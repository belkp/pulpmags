scientifiction searchlight of science

                     by jack williamson

science ever widens our conception of
the material universe we drift farther
from the old idea of man as the chief end
of creation to the savage the universe is his
valley with the heavens arching low overhead
and himself supreme sciencc has found a mil-
lion new worlds and lost itself in them earth
has become a cosmic mote man utterly ephem-
eral and insignificant science and intelligence
alone remain considerable quantities then if
the life of the earth is the briefest instant in
time a question rises must man pass with the
earth or will human intelligence rule on a
new factor in the universe  the idea is stupend-
ous science is the doorway to the future scien-
tifiction the golden key

  the chief function of scientifiction is the crea-
tion of real pictures of new things new ideas and
new machines scientifiction is the product of the
human imagination guided by the suggestion of
science it takes the basis of science considers
all the clues that science has to offer and then
adds a thing that is alien to science-imagination
it goes ahead and lights the way and when
sciencc sees the things made real in the authors
mind it makes them real indeed it deals only
with that which it can sec or weigh or measure
only with logical hypothesis ex-
periment and influence and cal-
culation scientifiction begins
with the ending of science

  the realization of scicntific-
tion is proverbial science has
made hardly a single step that
scientifiction has not foretold

and science in return has dis-
closed a million new and start-

ling facts to serve as wings for the scientifiction
authors brain

  scientifiction takes a thousand accumulated
facts and builds them into a real impressive pic-
ture of ages past whereby the future of the race
may be foretold it mounts a time machine
and ventures through futurity revealing the re-
sults of known conditions and tendencies

  science knows that life on other worlds is pos-
sible but it remains for scientifiction to make the
vision real and to suggest the space flier to verify
it then science may build the flier and see for
itself the boundless energy of the atom the
fourth dimension the sub-universe below and
the super-universe above arc scientific absurdities
all until scientifiction gives them reality

  and sciencc goes on with scicntifiction as the
searchlight here is the picture if we can but-
see it a universe ruled by the human mind a
new golden age of fair cities of new laws and
new machines of human capabilities undreamed
of of a civilization that has conquered matter and
nature distance and time disease and death a
glorious picture of an empire that lies away past
a million flaming suns until it reaches the black
infinity of unknown space and extends beyond
the picture is incredible to us now even in the
light of scientifiction it is dis-
torted and vague the idea of
the final product of evolution is
beyond us but a sublime pic-
ture is that scientifiction may
build through the ages and that
science may realize for the
ultimate advancement of man

eworld giant ants

 by a jfycitt verrill

 author of the king of the monkey men the astounding discoveries of doctor mentiroso etc
 from the field notes of the late dr benjamin henden ma frgs fa as dausm fnas fsef etc

                                              introduction

           fter a great deal of deliberation and with
           no little hesitation i have finally decided to
           make pubilc the contents of dr hendens
           notebooks although i can in no way be ield
           responsible for the incredible story theyre-
           veal or be accused of attempting to perpetrate a hoax
           or a ridiculous example

of imaginative fiction
still i have hitherto felt
that i might be ridiculed
for accepting the notes
as genuine or believing
they were written by a
sane man but the man-
ner in which the stained
and battered volumes
reached my hand and my
knowledge of doctor hen-
den and of the country
and tribe in the territory
near the locality where he
met with the astounding
adventures he recorded
convinced me that the
notebooks at least were
genuine no one who
knew doctor henden or
who was familiar with his
painstakingly accurate ob-
servations and his metic-
ulous care to write of
nothing which he had not
personally seen and in-
vestigated would dream
of accusing him either of
writing fiction or of re-
cording hearsay evidence

neither i think would
anyone familiar with doc-
tor hendens works at-
tainments and intellect
consider for a moment the
possibility of his having
lost his mind moreover
as will be seen by those
who read the contents of
his notebooks the events
he recorded although
seemingly impossible and
preposterous were viewed
and studied as well as
described by a man not
only sane and free

from hallucinations but quite obviously far more ob-
servant and possessing a bigger mind and better powers
of deduction and reasoning than most men it is in
view of these several arguments that i have at last

o tories about ants are no longer a nov-
u city in fiction scientifiction stories about
ants have been written before

     but we unhesitatingly state that the
   present story by the well-known writer
   is no doubt the greatest ant story that
   has ever been conceived

     the editor of this magazine in a talk
   with mr verrill who is not only an
   author of note but a noted explorer as
   well asked him to do a special ant story
   for this magazine it is interesting to
   note that practically the entire story was
   written in the south american jungle
   during mr verrills latest expedition

     readers will remember that mr verrill
   discovered a new race of bearded indians
   near the peruvian wilds in south amer-
   ica outside of this mr verrill has for
   many years been making a deep study of
   ants and their habits and the things that
   he tells us of them in this story are not
   at all exaggerated if you magnify the
   usual ant you will have exactly what mr
   verrill gives us in this notable document

     we wish to impress upon the reader
   the important fact that the habits of the
   ants as described in this story are scien-
   tifically accurate in practically all re-
   spects and that the author has taken very
   little if any liberties in telling about them

     few people are interested enough to
   study a dry scientific work of ant-life but
   here we are given the greatest scientifiction
   story of ants and the way they live made
   particularly inlergsting because it is in
   fiction form it is not only a first class
   piece of literature but is a gem from a
   purely scientific viewpoint also

     in order to enhance the value of the
   story the editor has taken the liberty to
   bring in a number of illustrations takeri
   from well-known scientific works

decided to publish doctor hendens field notes which
record quite tersely and in abbreviated form all of the
events and occurrences of any importance during the two
years intervened between the time when he vanished
in the heart of south america and the time when i
was in charge of an expedition searching for him and
his notebooks almost
miraculously came into
my possession

no doubt the majority
of those who read this
will recall more or less of
the details of doctor hen-
dens quest and disap-
pearance for when he set
out from the united
states and when the
world realized that he had
vanished the daily press
carried full accounts of
his undertaking of his
attainments and past life
and with more or less
reasonable speculation re-
garding his fate as a
matter of fact however
not one of these was with-
in miles of the truth and
hitherto only i and the
sponsors of the relief ex-
pedition have been aware
of the actual facts as
far as they were revealed
by his field notes

but for the benefit of
those few who may have
but a dim remembrance
or no remembrance at all
of doctor hendens aims
and disappearance i will
very briefly relate the
facts as far as they were
known to the world at
large doctor benjamin
henden was one of the
best known scientists in
the united states or in
the world for that mat-
ter although a compar-
atively young man at the
time he departed-he was
in his early fifties-yet he
had won international
fame in several branches of natural science he was an
excellent geologist something of a botanist and pos-
sessed a far greater knowledge of zoology than many
professors of that science in his early youth he had

amazing stories quarterly

specialized in ornithology and later in entomology and
in the pursuit of these studies he had made a number
of very successful expeditions to south and central
america securing on these trips vast numbers of rare
specimens and many new species it is scarcely exag-
gerating to say that doctor henden had a more inti-
mate first hand knowledge of tropical american bird
and insect life than any man of his time it was
upon these expeditions to which i refer that doctor
hendens interest was aroused by the aboriginal tribes
of south and central america and by the innumer-
able remains of past civilization in those countries
so absorbed did he become in these matters that he
completely forsook ornithology and entomology and be-
came an ardent student of american ethnology and
archeology in a comparatively short space of time
he had mastered all that could be learned from museums
and books regarding these sciences and again re-
sumed his long abandoned fieldwork this time how-
ever for the sole purpose of studying the living
indians and the remains of the prehistoric aborigines
in south america it is needless to even mention hi
numerous discoveries the monographs and the volumes
which he wrote or the rather startling and wholly
revolutionary theories he advanced as a result of his
expeditions and studies suffice to say he brought
many new races and cultures to light founded an
entirely new history of central and south american
civilizations and solved many ethnological and arche-
ological puzzles which for years had confronted all
other researchers in his chosen fields all this i have
mentioned merely as a preface or explanation to show
why doctor henden who for twenty years had been
known only as an ethnologist and archeologist should
have been so well able to record observe and deduce
matters which bore no relation whatever to either of
those sciences

  in  when he set out on his last ill-fated expe-
dition he stated publicly that he was in hopes of
reaching a hitherto unknown district lying in western
brazil and eastern peru in which it had been re-
ported there were mysterious unknown and unexplored
ruins in reality as was revealed in his notes he
had a far more romantic and adventurous object in
view as all know he reached peru in safety left
lima several days after his arrival travelled by the
southern railway to la paz and thence into the
beni river district and there dropped from sight in
the impenetrable and almost limitless forests of the
bolivia-peruvian-brazilian hinterland as was al-
ways the case he went alone accompanied only by a
camp-boy and man-of-all-work-a west indian negro
who had been his companion on many expeditions and
he secured his porters boatmen guides etc as he
went along his knowledge of spanish and portuguese
and of many indian dialects made this comparatively
simple and he invariably argued-when the perils of
thus penetrating dangerous territory were brought up
that he could accomplish more in a given time could
travel more swiftly and safely and could be more
certain of success when alone than with a party
with every added white man the dangers and responsi-
bilities were greatly increased he affirmed and as a
clincher he would always point out that no large expe-
dition into the american tropics had ever been a
success whereas his own and many other one man
expeditions had invariably proved successful

prom the time he left santa cruz on the beni no
definite word was received from doctor henden
or his party that he intended descending the beni
and exploring the rio grande had been well estab-

lished for he spent some time in la paz and afterwards
in cochabamba securing all information possible re-
garding the tribes on those rivers and especially re-
garding the strange bearded indians known as the
sirionos of the rio grande hence when after two
years nothing had been heard of doctor henden and
his friends organized a searching party to go after
him and selected me as its leader i followed the gen-
era route of these two rivers also i followed doctor
hendens example and went light being accom-
panied only by a camp boy-a half-breed pano indian
-and secured my guides and boatmen at san ramon
the last outpost of civilization in bolivia i regret
that i am forced to occupy so much space with the
wholly uninteresting details of doctor hendens last
trip and with a brief account of my own in search of
him or traces of him but i fear it is essential if my
readers are to understand the more important matter
to follow and are to accept it as fact rather than
fiction

  i found no trace of the missing men until i reached
the country of the sirionos these indians were in
themselves enough to cause anyone to wonder if he
were dreaming or in his right mind entirely nude
and wearing immense bushy beards and heavy mus-
taches they resembled australian bushmen more than
any indians while the bows and arrows they used
seemed fashioned for a race of giants rather than for
use by rather undersized humans the bows were
often ten feet in length and five inches across while
the arrows were an inch or two in diameter eight to
twelve feet long and with feathers projecting six inches
or more from the shafts and from two to three feet in
length to an ethnologist of doctor hendens type
they would have afforded months of study and very
obviously he had visited and studied them for once
amicable relations were established the indians told
of the visit of a white man many months previously
that they referred to the missing scientist i felt sure
for they had been vastly impressed by his black com-
panion moreover they described the doctor very well
and imitated some of his mannerisms-they are won-
derful mimics-so accurately that anyone would have
recognized to whom they referred according to the
sirionos doctor henden had remained in the vicinity
for several weeks during which time he had made
enquiries regarding the tribes and the fabled ruins
which were ins objectives none of the sirionos knew
anything definite regarding either but while doctor
henden was there a party of indians arrived from
the zanteca river and claimed to have accurate knowl-
edge they conversed with the scientist for a long
time as a result two of these strangers left with
the doctor when he departed the following day and
from one of these the sirionos understood that the
route would be largely through the jungle but just
where the river was to be left or in what direction
they were headed not one of the tribe knew hence
my only course was to make my way to the zanteca
river natives in the hopes of there finding some
indian who knew what route those who accompanied
doctor henden had followed for to go blindly into that
vast wilderness would have been worse than hopeless

  fortune favored me at the village on the zanteca
i found one of the two who had started out with the
scientist he had not however accompanied the doc-
tor to the end of his journey and he knew nothing
of his whereabouts or fate he and his fellow tribes-
man had merely guided the doctor to the first of the
luins and had refused to go farther because he said
ecnt beyond was inhabited by wild hostile tribes
and by beings which no man could resist in fact his
the world of the giant ants



tales were so bizarre and so utterly preposterous that
i put them down as mere figments of the savages
imagination and superstitious dread of any unknown
place or people he consented however to guide me
to the ruins where he had last seen doctor henden
alive of that journey it is not necessary to speak
it was filled with all the usual hardships of travel
through the jungle but eventually we arrived safely
at the ruined city i should like to describe the won-
ders of this lost and forgotten centre of some mar-
velous prehistoric civilization but this has its place
elsewhere moreover doctor henden describes it fully
and far more lucidly and accurately in his diary than i
could do

  it was after i had reached these ruins that the
great earthquake occurred although it as only
slightly felt in the united states it was exceedingly
severe throughout south america and particularly in
the district within several hundred miles of the andean
chain it was coincident with the violent eruption of
mount misti in peru which annihilated arequipa with
immense loss of life as all are aware and utterly de-
stroyed many towns and villages in peru bolivia
ecuador chile and elsewhere in the jungle there
would have been little or no danger to us but in that
ancient ruined city amid the immense buildings and
monuments we were in as imminent danger as if we
had been in one of the andean towns moreover it
occurred in the night and we were awakened by the
crash and thunder of falling walls and monoliths the
indians were panic-stricken and dashed shrieking from
the courtyard in which we had camped it was a
fatal mistake on their part for while the patio was
fairly safe from falling debris being roofless and
large enough to leave plenty of clear space in the
centre even if its walls did fall in outside of the
court yard stones were being tossed about and walls
were falling on every side pedro my half-breed
pano remained with me and throughout that terrible
night we cowered in the centre of the court quite
powerless to aid the indians and sick and nauseated
with the heaving undulating motions of the solid earth
beneath us when at last the tremors ceased dawn
was breaking and convinced that there was no more
danger-for even if the quakes recurred there was no
remaining masonry to fall-we ventured from our
refuge outside the ruins were devastated nothing
remained standing debris was piled high everywhere
and with the faint hopes of finding some of the indians
still alive-perhaps safe in hiding or only wounded-
we moved about shouting and hallooing for a time
only the echoes of our voices broke the silence then
from a spot where the great central temple had stood
majestically and impressively before the earthquake
we heard a faint sound as of some one striving to reply
to our calls climbing with great difficulty over the
heaped-up masses of broken stone and fractured idols
and guided by the human sounds which now that we
were nearer were evidently uttered by someone in
agony we came at last to the remains of the temple
court i had expected to find an injured indian in-
stead imagine my utter amazement at finding the body
of a negro wedged fast beneath an immense fallen
column he was clad in a single garment of some
coarse silk-like cloth his body was covered with scars
some recently healed and some showing merely as
bluish-white welts against his black skin and he was
obviously on the point of death but he was conscious
and still able to speak and the first words he uttered
-speaking between agonized gasps for his chest was
crushed and his back broken-caused me greater amaze-

ment than finding him there tor he spoke in english
but even more astounding was what he said he was
in fact doctor hendens servant-the jamaican tom
-and i bent low and hung on his words elated
despite my sorrow at toms plight to think i was
near the scientist or at least was about to learn of
his fate but i was doomed to disappointment the
wounded mans life was ebbing fast and the little
information he was able to communicate was given
in disconnected sentences or rather words interrupted
by heart-rending groans and gasps for breath

  as nearly as i can repeat them they were as fol-
lows i tom-doctor henden boy-getting away-
killed-come through tunnel-dead city-earthquake-
tunnel fall in-i die-better die than slave ant men-
maybe all killed-black fellows fight-doctor henden
teach them-all in book-in pouch

  with the last words he choked a spasm shook him
and death came to relieve his awful sufferings much
of what he had said was utterly incomprehensible to
me at the time-though later when i had read doc-
tor hendens diary it all became quite clear but
that the scientist was dead that tom had escaped
from some tribe whom he called the ant-people that
he had reached the ruined city by way of a tunnel
which had been destroyed by the earthquake and in
doing so had lost his life those things were quite
plain but i was at a loss to understand what he
meant by the book and pouch however with the
utmost difficulty pedro and i pried the stone from
toms body and dragged him out to give him decent
burial i discovered that he wore a leather pouch or
wallet strapped to his waist opening this i found
a few bits of dried fruit a few grains of some corn-
like cereal and a rather bulky package wrapped in a
transparent parchment-like material unwrapping this
i disclosed two small books and hastily opening the
stained worn and rubbed covers i hastily read in one
field notes - b henden and in the other
- notes b henden

  very probably there are many who will censure me
for not putting aside the two little volumes and giv-
ing my attention to the dead negro but i felt and
i still feel that at that time the scientists whereabouts
or fate was of far greater importance than the corpse
of any man and that it was my first and most press-
ing duty to examine the books which so miraculously
and providentially had come to my hands my first
glance however convinced me that it would take hours
-even days-to read the thousands of closely written
and almost microscopic words covering the hundred
and more pages of the books and which i noticed
were written for doctor hendens personal use being
abbreviated lacking in punctuation disjointed and
often forming almost a sort of shorthand in fact
they were written precisely as doctor henden myself
and innumerable other scientific men jot down notes
when in the field or when making some experiment
notes intended to refresh the writers memory in writ-
ing about it later or merely to be used as references
generally almost incomprehensible to anyone else

  on one point however i was satisfied on the last
space the final portion of the inner side of the back
cover of the second volume was an almost illegible
entry as follows decided t attempt reach tupec
going through tunnel believe he can make it giving
him my notes only proof t can bring party
through from tupec has full instructions forces
arms etc cheloneans attack today-cheloneans victor-
ious reds annihilated am mortally wounded t leaving
at once no use rescue party now my last words-

  sorrowfully i closed the book what tragedy what

sufferings what heroism must be concealed behind those
few terse words written by a dying man as imper-
sonally as succinctly as though he were recording the
habits of some insect and what startling story what
amazing discoveries might still be hidden within those
closely written pages but my wildest conjectures fell
far short of the reality as will be seen by those who
read doctor hendens notes as i have transcribed
them

  reading through his records i found that dr hen-
den had not-after the first few entries-either dated
his notes or kept them regularly sometimes he noted
that a week a month or some other period had elapsed
since he had last written of his experiences but more
often there would be no reference to time although
it was apparent that considerable time intervened be-

tween the records hence in compiling the notes
for publication i have omitted all dates and references
to time except when noted by the doctor and have
set down the story as though it were a continuous and
uninterrupted record of events also i have some-
what elaborated the notes and have filled in words
and sentences to make them more readable and i
have omitted strictly scientific observations and data
which add nothing to the interest of the account and
would be incomprehensible to the average person
aside from such changes and additions i have written
nothing more than the amazing story recorded by dr
henden in that remote corner of the continent whence
there was but one avenue of escape which now is
sealed forever to doctor henden any avenue of escape
would be useless now anyway

the story the notebooks revealed

               chapter i
iie indian guides that i secured on the zan-
teca tell me the first ruins are only two days
farther ahead i am looking forward to reach-
ing these ruins with a feeling of greater ex-
citement and thrill than i have ever expe-
rienced on any of my many expeditions and yet it seems
such a wholly preposterous wild goose chase that i have
undertaken at times i feel that i must have absorbed
some of the superstition and credulity of the aborigines
among whom i have spent so much time certainly
that for which i am searching seems beyond the
bounds of all probability and scientific reasoning i
have no doubt there are unknown ruins ahead for
there are countless undiscovered ruins in the country
but that there could be any such creatures such
monstrosities in existence seems incredible and were
it generally known that i had the faintest belief in the
indians tales of such things my fellow scientists
would laugh me to scorn hence i have let it be
thought that my present expedition is solely for the
purpose of discovering and studying the ruined city
of tupec which for more than two hundred years
lias been thought to exist somewhere within the vast
unexplored region i am now entering but i am truly
convinced that there must be some basis of fact in
the innumerable tales i have so often heard from so
many and widely separated tribes who could not under
any circumstances have heard the story from one
another the aborigines from my observations and
experience do not fabricate tales from whole cloth
as we say they must have a basis or fact of some
sort to build upon and while no doubt many of their
stories are fantastic and highly exaggerated some-
where there is some portion of truth in them this
i have repeatedly proved and my most noteworthy
discoveries hitherto have been made by following up
the indians myths or legends and tracing them to
their foundation hence this tale of the bizarre
terrible beings who dwell beyond the ruined city and
the nightmarish details of the story must i feel have
some basis and i am determined to find out what that
basis may be if i succeed and there is even one
thousandth part of truth in the stories then i will
have made an epochal discovery and will have entirely
upset all preconceived ideas of archeology ethnology
and several other ologies not only as relating to
south america but to the world in general but if i
find nothing more than the semi-mythical city of tupec
i will have accomplished a great deal

i

   have been sounding the zantecas regarding the
   tales of weird beings dwelling in the interior be-

yond tupec they were loth to speak of it but know
the tale there is one curious fact in regard to it
however if no human being can enter the territory
and if no one has ever been there and returned how
can anyone know anything regarding it if there is
any truth in it the story must have been handed down
from remote times perhaps from the days when
tupec was inhabited and a civilized race dwelt in
this district strange that such a race ever should
have disappeared what could have destroyed them
the europeans never entered here and there are no
records to show that the early conquerors had any
knowledge of the existence of ruins even if accounts
of tupec are within a mile of the truth the inhabi-
tants must have been a very highly advanced race and
very numerous one of my greatest efforts will be to
try to ascertain why or how the city was abandoned
and why the civilized race vanished i wonder if
it had any connection with the stories of those weird
beings beyond if the tupecans as i might call them
started that tale its all idle speculation and by to-
morrow night i should know whether such a place as
tupec really exists or whether it is merely some in-
significant ruin or even remains of some forgotten
spanish fort or outpost

	 

tupec exists i feel as if i had been dreaming
as i write this we reached the ruins day before
yesterday all i had heard had not prepared me for
anything so marvelous or of such incalculable arche-
ological value nothing in mayan-toltec aztec chib-
cha incan or pre-incan remains even approaches these
there is not the remotest similarity between the
tupecan architecture carvings monoliths and culture
and any of those that i have mentioned with two
exceptions in some respects they are striking fea-
tures that are common to these ruins and the ruins
of tiahuanaco in bolivia and the code ruins of
panama discovered last year by my friend and confrire
verrill i am beginning to think that all three civili-
zations were merely different stages of the same races
advancement tupec being the last and ultimate stage
also i am already convinced that the people who built
and lived in tupec were a white race and not in-
digenous to south america perhaps-but no that is
too wild a theory-i was about to say that perhaps
the tales so common in tropical america and relating
the existence of a white race may have had their
foundation in the existence of some remnants of this
tupecan people who still dwell somewhere in the
fastnesses of the unexplored districts i shall spend
many days perhaps months here years would be
required to make an exhaustive study of the place
the world of the giant ants



yesterday my zantecas cleared out they left
x suddenly and without notice something fright-
ened them perhaps they were nervous when i began
excavating in a spot i deemed to be a cemetery only
my two panos and tom are now with me even if
the panos desert i shall remain here for tom and i
can take care of ourselves and can find our way out
but in that case i fear i shall be forced to abandon
my intention of penetrating farther into the district
in search of the gigantic terrible beings of the indians
yarns

	 

i was right the inhabitants of tupec were white
i have found two well preserved mummies even
a superficial examination proves they were not of the
amerind mongol or any other known race they are
nearer the caucasian but not the same i have also
discovered that they had a written language tom
stumbled on a cache of beautiful ceramic tiles decorated
with symbolic figures and glypths their arrangement
at once caused me to suspect they were some sort of
record and i am now certain of it the same figures
appear in many places and always in orderly arrange-
ment exactly as we would use letters in inscriptions
moreover the discovery of these tablets proves the
truth of the theory advanced by dr tello of lima
in which he claimed that the decorative pottery ves-
sels with human vegetable and other figures in in-
numerable slightly varied positions or forms were sym-
bols employed in recording events and various matters
by the pre-incan races of peru

  i have been puzzled by the numerous sculptures and
paintings of strange creatures which are everywhere
some are quite easily recognizable as representing
birds mammals and insects with which i am familiar
but many although obviously as well and carefully
drawn and as accurate reproductions of their subjects
as the others are- not like anything known to science
today there are strange creatures that resemble
dragons or i might rather say pterodactyls there are
elephant-like creatures with claws and canine teeth
human beings or monkey-like creatures with tails and
shaggy hair and very commonly the figures of some
insect-like thing with enormous jaws six legs and no
eyes these are usually shown in connection with
figures of semi-human beings with triangular heads
exaggerated bowed legs immense outstanding ears
attenuated bodies and bald heads or with monstrosities
resembling overfed hippopotami with innumerable legs
and antennae in several places i have found sculp-
tures of these creatures side by side with those of
men and of equal size and on some ceramics and
also in carvings these men attired in truly remark-
able costumes and armed with strange weapons are
shown battling with the beasts probably these are
allegorical or symbolic records possibly showing mans
constant struggle with the lower animals and with
insect pests the latter being exaggerated to indicate
their numbers or dangerous characters or again they
may be indicative of human enemies the beast forms
being given as symbolic of contempt or derision if i
could only decipher the inscriptions i might discover
the key to these matters

 jf -r

i have made a most astounding discovery a dis-
covery which has completely upset all my former
ideas and conjectures

  the weird figures i mentioned are representations
of those beings so vividly described in the indians
stories strange i did not think of it at once do or
did these things exist or did the tupecans know the
same tales and did they merely depict the creatures of

their stories i am inclined to think that at the time
tupec was inhabited many creatures known to us
only as fossils still inhabited this land and that these
were the beings that gave rise to all these weird tales
perhaps they were rare and were regarded as sacred
or looked upon with awe but unquestionably the
tupecans battled with them as recorded by the carvings
and ceramics is it not possible that some of these
prehistoric creatures still exist in the fastnesses of
the unexplored areas into which i hope to penetrate

   

another discovery while exploring the inner
portions of the central temple-a magnificent struc-
ture-i came upon the cleverly concealed and evi-
dently secret entrance to a subterranean passage to-
morrow i intend to explore this it may lead to an-
other portion of the city or to some monument or
statue whence the tupec priests uttered words or
oracles to impress the people or it may lead to some
point outside the ruins but wherever it leads it is
highly probable that it may contain objects of inestim- 
able archeological value

   

am writing these words by torchlight within the
underground tunnel this is our second day with-
in it and we have not yet reached the end it must
be fully twenty miles in length and appears to have
been cut by hand yet in some ways it has the ap-
pearance of a natural formation perhaps the channel
of some subterranean stream long dry and improved
by man moreover it contains innumerable galleries
and side passages-a perfect labyrinth almost i might
say like a gigantic ants nest but i have found noth-
ing of any ethnological or archeological interest except
some skeletal fragments of human beings and parts of
some unknown prehistoric creatures the former show
jgns of having been intentionally broken or crushed
the latter as nearly as i can- determine from a
superficial examination by torchlight are horny or
chitinous plates or scales from some huge reptile
among them is one great curved serrated-edged horn
which reminds me of a gigantic shark tooth i regret
i am no paleontologist and possess but a very superficial
knowledge of fossil creatures i plan to continue to
the end of the tunnel if our torches and supplies per-
mit otherwise i shall be forced to retrace our way
to tupec this would be extremely difficult had i not
taken the precaution to mark the way by means of
smudges of smoke upon the walls wherever there was
a turn or a branch opening much to my surprise
my panos are still with us they appeared more ter-
rified at remaining in tupec than in accompanying
me through this tunnel the two fellows are fairly
chattering with insane and unwarranted terror how-
ever evep tom is nervous but i have always observed
that nearly every man is afraid of underground un-
known passages i wonder what purpose this tunnel
served was it a secret exit to be used in case of
necessity-if the city were attacked and conquered
for instance does it connect tupec with some other
ancient ruins anything of this size and character
must have possessed some immensely valuable or im-
portant feature however i shall know very soon

 	 

a month has passed since i last penned words in
my diary a month of such nightmarish impos-
sible events such amazing experiences such horrible
incredible happenings that i would be laughed to scorn
were i to relate them to my fellow men but i doubt
if i will ever see a fellow man other than tom again

i am writing more from force of habit than with any
hope that my notes will ever be read for i can see


amazing stories quarterly

no chance of escape from this fearsome awful place
all the tales i had heard were nothing compared to the
reality i am in the land of the indians tales and am
among the monstrous hideous beings they described
creatures more awful more savage more incredible
than the wildest imagination could invent and yet
possessing an intelligence an organization and a devil-
ish ingenuity and purpose that make them the equals
of most human beings

  i can scarcely force myself to believe that i am not
dreaming or am not in the delirium of fever that i
will not awaken to find it all the fabric of a sleep-
befuddled brain and that tom and i still live is
perhaps the most amazing thing of all

  we traversed the tunnel to find it closed by a mas-
sive stone door which could be readily opened from
within by means of cleverly designed levers and a
simple mechanism but which-too late-we discovered
could not be opened from without

  if we had only known if we had only guessed
what lay beyond if i had only stopped to investigate
before rushing blindly on how different would have
been our fate i could then have wedged the door so
it could not close behind us i could have made a closer
study of the mechanism i could have somehow ar-
ranged it so that we could retreat within the passage
and close the portal in our rear but i did none of
these things when the door at last swung open and
revealed a vast strange country beyond we-or rather
i for i assume all responsibility as leader of the party
-carelessly allowed the door to swing to and we found
it irrevocably locked when terrified beyond our senses
we again attempted to reenter the tunnel

  before us as we emerged from the passageway
stretched a strange country as i have said on every
side it was surrounded by immense snow-capped
ridges as nearly as i can judge from my knowledge
of geology the entire place is the stupendous crater
of an extinct volcano in fact the land appears to be
the very bottom of a long-dead crater for the sur-
rounding mountains must be fully twenty-five thousand
feet in height and as there are no such mountains
rising above the country of the outer world i feel
sure that the immense territory here must be at least
ten thousand feet below the level of the rest of the
surface of the continent it is like the bottom of a
huge well or giant mine-shaft everything points to
this it is hot damp humid the sky is overcast
and the mountains veiled in vapor the vegetation is
that of prehistoric days and is rank primitive and
viscous fungi are everywhere and of preposterous
proportions there are mushrooms higher than my
head rvssolas towerlike trees among clusters af agari-
cus that would serve as shelters for a mounted horse-
man lichens and liverworts form deep carpets club-
mosses and hepaticac here reach the dimensions of
cedar trees and cabbages parasitic vines and plants
are of gigantic size and incredibly rapid growth the
trees are fleshy-leaved and pithy and the air is so
heavy so laden with moisture and so reeking with
the odors of decaying vegetation and the overpowering
scent of the inhabitants that it is oppressive and diffi-
cult to breathe no doubt these conditions have brought
about the unique the terrifying and incredible condi-
tions of animal life which exist here just as the en-
vironment of the giant dinosaurs resulted in the de-
velopment of reptilian life to the nth degree but i
am wandering theorizing and cannot waste my all too
little space by recording such thoughts i must set
down the facts my observations just why i should
do this is rather a puzzle i feel sure we shall never
escape from this place it is equally certain that my

notes will never reach the outside world and yet
such is mans psychology that even when all hope
is abandoned he still goes on following his accus-
tomed habits planning his future and i am writing
this exactly as if i expected to return to civilization
at any time and planned to elaborate my notes to
form a report on this impossible place

  at first when we emerged from the passage and
gazed upon the bizarre country we saw no signs of
inhabitants there was no town no village in sight
but presently one of the indians-whose eyes are al 
ways keener than those of civilized man-saw some
creature moving about in the dense jungle upon the
plain below us we were woefully in need of food
and as there appeared to be no danger from hostile
savages we descended the hillside-which i noticed
even then appeared to be an artificial mound rather
than a natural formation in the hopes of securing
game it was when we reached the first vegetation
that i became aware of its remarkable character very
warily we approached the spot where the pano had
seen the creature for we did not know what sort of
beast it might be-whether carnivorous or a ruminant
whether it might prove ferocious or timid-and we had
no mind to be either unexpectedly attacked or to lose
our dinner presently we heard the sounds of some
creature ahead the rustling of foliage and a strange
crunching creaking noise which i may best compare
to the sound of a heavy cart passing over corn stalks
with my revolver drawn and with the indians holding
their bows in readiness for instant use we pressed
forward the next second i staggered back unable
to believe my eyes while the panos screamed with
terror and turning dashed madly from the spot
stretched along the limb of a low tree was what at
first sight appeared to be a gigantic serpent its huge
body of mottled green and brown undulating slightly
and moving slowly forward but the next instant i
realized it was no snake for through an opening among
the leaves i caught sight of legs stout fleshy legs
covered with coarse hair and terminating in disk-
like horny feet that clasped the bark of the limb
then as i gazed fascinated and  incredulous the
thing reared its head a huge rough dull-red head
with immense expressionless staring eyes and vicious
saw-toothed horny jaws seizing a-thick fleshy leaf between
these the mandibles ripped through the leaf with the
crunching noise i have mentioned it was absolutely
unbelievable positively impossible but true the
thing was a caterpillar a monstrous gigantic larva
fully ten feet in length a scream from the panos
broke the spell in which i stood transfixed gazing at
the thing with tom at my side shaking and actually
pale we turned and hurried towards the cries
what we saw seemed to freeze the blood in my veins
and caused tom to drop to his knees chattering and
mouthing in abject terror

  side by side the two indians were battling furiously
with a most terrifying fearsome creature that he was
human or semi-human no one could doubt but he
was a monster a being fit only for a nightmare and
with a shock i recognized him as the original of some
of the weird figures i had found at tupec his head
was hairless misshapen and almost triangular in form
with immense outstanding ears his body thin almost
to emaciation was black as night and covered with
close-growing wooly hair and his short legs were
enormously bowed his back was towards me and he
was leaping about with his immensely long arms aim-
ing sharp terrific blows at the indians who were
already torn and bleeding from dozens of deep wounds
broken arrow shafts protruded from one shoulder and
the world of the giant ants



a thigh of the creature evidently the panos had
used their weapons effectively yet the missiles im-
bedded in his body did not appear to affect the crea-
tures vitality in the least and he was at too close
quarters for the panos to use their bows

his ferocity was terrible and the worst of it was
he fought silently not uttering a sound although
at every blow of his hands-and with horror i noticed
that these were armed with sharp long claws-the
indians screamed and groaned in agony and deadly
fear all this i took in at a first glance without
hesitation i raised my pistol and fired point-blank at
the things back i knew i had not missed but in-
stead of falling dead or wounded as i had expected
the creature wheeled and at sight of its fac a cry
of horror escaped me and i fell back trembling shak-
ing never has living man seen such a face the
great staring expressionless lustreless lidless eyes in
the black triangular-shaped head the huge drewling
mouth with flappy lips revealing toothless gums and
the utter absence of a nose but with two yawning
black holes for nostrils were those of a fiend of the
eternal pit rather than of anything of flesh and blood
for the space of a second the thing stared at me
then without a sound it turned and recommenced
its attack upon the panos as rapidly as i could
pull trigger i emptied my revolver into the bestial
monster until fairly riddled with bullets it slumped
to earth but it was too late the panos had been
fairly ripped to pieces one was already dead and the
other was breathing his last and i had no time to
aid him even had his condition warranted it from
the dense growth of vegetation sounds were issuing
sounds of approaching things being attracted per-
haps by the shouts of the panos perhaps by the
sounds of my revolver shots who or what they
might prove i did not know and i had no wish to re-
main to see already within the space of a few short
minutes i had seen more than enough the place
was too terrible too monstrous thinking only of
escape only of putting as much distance as possible
between us and more of those fearful black things in
human form i shook and cursed tom into action and
raced madly towards the mound-like hill whence we had
issued from the tunnel

  once i glanced back and the blood seemed to freeze
in my veins as i saw a crowd a horde of the ter-
rible beings in pursuit but they were not fleet of
foot we were gaining on them and felt that if we
could reach the hill and the tunnel we might yet
escape imagine my horror my frenzy as we gained
the hill and found the gate to the passage irretrievably
closed against us

  madly we tore and beat at the massive stone portal
hurled ourselves against it wasted our puny strength
in vain efforts to swing that ton or more of rock and
each moment as we struggled and as sweat poured
from our skins and cold dread chilled our hearts those
fearsome beings were approaching us presently they
were close at hand silent ominous and so sure was
i that we were about to die an awful death that i
placed my pistol to my temple and pulled the trigger
before i remembered that in my blind terror i had
forgotten to reload the weapon before i could slip a
cartridge into the cylinder the things were upon us
i drew back cowering trembling while tom paralyzed
with fear was a pitiable sight i expected the crea-
tures-i cannot even now call them men-to fall upon
us and rend us as they had the panos but for some
inexplicable reason they did not though they made
no sounds yet they seemed to be conversing carrying

on some sort of argument among themselves debating
perhaps what end to make of us realizing we were not
to be summarily destroyed i regained some measure
of courage and hope i peered intently at them trying
to fathom their thoughts their intentions by watch-
ing their gestures and expressions but their flat nose-
less triangular faces were expressionless and their
huge dull eyes gave no hint of the reactions of the
minds behind them but from their actions and atti-
tudes i judged that we were as strange to them as
they were to us and being rather familiar with the
psychology of savages i took heart knowing that the
savage in his calmer moments seldom destroys that
which excites his wonder or curiosity nevertheless
one of the things had killed the indians and the
indians must have been as strange to the things eyes
as were ourselves but very possibly i thought the
panos had been the aggressors seing the black being
they had very probably taken no chances but had shot
at it and the pain of the arrow wounds had enraged
it and it had flown at them in a frenzy all the time -
that these thoughts were racing through my brain the
black beings were standing around us gazing un-
winkingly at us staring fixedly their loose lips slob-
bering over their toothless gums in a most horrible
manner then two stepped forward and stretched out
claw-fingered hands towards tom he shrieked in
terror and drew back but the beings did not even in-
dicate that his agonized screams had been heard as
easily as though he had been a mere child they lifted
him stood him on his feet and with- their faces close
to him sniffed at him passed their hands over his
skin and his garments and having apparently satisfied
themselves on some score they passed him to their
fellows and turned to me

  it was a terrifying an indescribably awful ordeal i
underwent the reek of the things was nauseating a
strange pungent odor that reminded me of something
i had smelled before but overpowering in its acrid
strength while the hideous faces of the brutes as they
sniffed at me and the feel of the rough hairy skin and
animal-like claws as they touched me caused me to
shiver and shrink from them but they showed no
desire to injure us although i well knew that a single
stroke of those talon-like fingers could rend me to
the bone

  presently the terrible examination was at an end
again the things seemed earnestly though inaudibly
discussing us and once more i felt sick with fear
at what fate they might decide should be ours then
seizing poor tom roughly by the scruff of the neck
and urging me more gently but no less insistently the
things turned from the hillside and with us captives
in their midst hurried towards the jungle whence they
had appeared

  turning to one side before we reached the spot
where the panos had met their end the beings con-
ducted us along a sort of roughly worn trail even in
my extremity and my fear i could not avoid noticing
the weird character of our surroundings the giant
fungi and the preponderance of parasitic plants and
what animal life i saw amazed me even more once
a dark shadow fell across our path and there was the
rustle as of huge wings

  startled i glanced up my eyes stared incredulously
for above us a butterfly flew slowly but such a but-
terfly no other mortal had ever gazed upon a scarlet
and orange thing of indescribable beauty fully a yard
in length and six feet across the velvety wings like
a flash my mind reverted to that first astounding dis-
covery we had made to that huge larva browsing on
the leaves and in my suddenly awakened interest in


amazing stories quarterly

entomology and my speculations as to whether this
glorious insect were the image of that larva all my
worries and fears were momentarily forgotten the
next second our captors appeared to be seized with
sudden panic they released their grasps on us darted
in to the shelter of nearby plants and giant toadstools
and crouched trembling in the shadows wondering
what had frightened them but realizing that some
dread danger must threaten i followed their example
and dragged tom dazed and incapable of thought or
action into the shelter of a broad-leaved vine then
to my wondering incredulous ears came a strange
sound the vibrant humming of a distant airplane

  human beings civilized men must be near for-
getting all else i sprang into the open gazing expec-
tantly at the vapor shrouded sky ready to shout to
wave my hands to use every effort to attract the at-
tention of the airships occupant the instant it appeared

  with astonishing rapidity the humming increased
it became a roar at any instant i expected to see
the machine flash into sight above the tree tops sud-
denly it burst into view and as my straining eyes
rested upon it my face blanched and with a cry of
terror i flung myself headlong into the undergrowth

chapter ii

i had expected to see an airplane a fabric of metal
and machinery made by the hand of man and with
a fellow being a civilized man or men within it

  instead the apparition that roared into the range
of my astounded vision was a living thing a huge
winged creature flying low above the trees a thing
to fill the stoutest heart with mad terror a creature of
fearful menacing aspect brief as had been my glimpse
of the thing before i sought safety in hiding i had
recognized it as the original of those figures in tupec
which i had mistaken for pterodactyls and instantly
too i had recognized it for what it was its great
staring many-facetted eyes its immense multiple jaws
with the outer serrated mandibles the short vibrating
antennae the gleaming black and golden thorax and
stream-line abdomen terminating in a needle-like point
were unmistakable it was a hornet a gigantic pred-
atory insect belonging to the group of solitary hymen-
optera no doubt it was searching for some victim
which having been stung into a state of helpless
paralysis would be buried alive inert but conscious
until the hornets grubs emerged from their eggs and
devoured the living flesh so thoughtfully provided by
their savage parent scores hundreds thousands of
times i had watched solitary wasps and hornets as
they seized spiders larva and even locusts and after
paralyzing them carried them to their nests to be
stored away as a live food supply for their young and
now now i was shaking shivering with abject terror
as overhead circled a hornet as large as an eagle a
rapacious terrible insect large and powerful enough
to swoop upon me and plunge its numbing paralyzing
sting into my own body cold sweat broke out upon
my temples at thought of such a fate at thought of
being buried alive but incapable of movement in some
underground chamber until hungry loathsome wrig-
gling maggots threw themselves blindly upon me and
gnawed at my palpitating living flesh from the actions
of the savages near me i knew my fears were well
justified they were even more terrified than i if such
a thing were possible for no doubt they knew from dire
experience the extent of the danger that hovered over
them only tom appeared oblivious to this newest
peril but he had no knowledge of the habits of hor-
nets and moreover his brain had been so surcharged
with fright that it held no space for further fears

  how long that fearsome giant insect hung on hum-
ming wings in the air above us i shall never know it
seemed like hours and each moment i expected it to
descend and seize a victim from among us again and
again i felt that its great eyes or its delicate waving
antennae had located us as it swooped downward its
great horny clawed legs outstretched its ravening
jaws open its abdomen thrust forward with shining
dagger-like sting unsheathed but either it was not cer-
tain of our character or our location or else it hesi-
tated to risk its membraneous wings among the foliage
and branches for each time with an angry buzz it
drew off until at last it dashed with terrific speed
from the spot and the humming of its vibrating wings
grew faint in the distance

  not until then did our captors rise and again seiz-
ing us proceed on their interrupted journey by now
too much of my first terrible fears of the beings had
worn off possibly familiarity was beginning to breed
contempt or again it may have been a subconscious
feeling that as we had not hitherto been harmed we 
would remain alive and whole but largely i think
it was due to the tremendous scientific interest my
strange surroundings had aroused and to my realiza-
tion that we faced far greater dangers from the other
denizens of this world than from our captors two
distinct emotions cannot exist coincidently ir the
human brain and my interest in the overdeveloped in-
sects the strange vegetal growths and the innumer-
able abnormalities on every side overrode my fears
and drove terror from my mind moreover i had made
an astonishing discovery or rather i might say reali-
zation had come to me once fear had fled and my brain
had cleared sufficiently to co-ordinate and function in
more or less normal fashion i was in an insect world
in a land where for some inexplicable reason evolution
had proceeded along insect lines where vertebrates
had taken second place and where the conditions of
the rest of the world had been reversed and super-
insects dwarfed and dominated man thinking thus

i studied the savages more closely and as i did so
my senses fairly reeled as i made a second and even
more astounding discovery the creatures were almost
as much insects as men to be sure they walked up-
right and possessed but four limbs and they had more
or less human-like forms but their heads and faces
were totally unlike those of men their eyes were dis-
tinctly insect-like their digits were more claws than
fingers their immense ears savored of short heavy
antennae and the manner in which the first one i
had seen had continued fighting while apparently ob-
livious of his wounds was astonishingly like the actions
of a wounded insect it was unthinkable preposterous
to even dream that they were insects that any insect
could have evolved or developed such humanlike char-
acteristics but was it not possible that in this land
where i had abundant proof of conditions which favored
the dominance of insects such vertebrates as there were
might have assumed insect-like characters

  scientifically i could see no reason for assuming
that this were not only possible but highly probable
environment has an even greater influence upon the
development of living organism than heredity in a
land where all the environment was adapted to the
survival and the development of insects there would
most assuredly be a tendency for vertebrates-even
man-to evolve certain characteristics which would
enable him to exist and which therefore would in-
evitably be insect-like it was an amazing idea wjth
astounding possibilities and incredible as it may seem

abnormal and undreamed of conditions of life as
yet i had seen only the fringe of the land had observed
but a few an infinitesimal portion of its marvels
what wonders might yet remain what incredibly as-
tonishing objects and events might be in store what
astounding discoveries might be made-provided i lived
to make them-were impossible even to guess in such
a land amid such surroundings almost anything might
be possible but my wildest dreams my most fantastic
conjectures were far short of the truth

with my mind busy with such thoughts with my
fears of our captors dissipated i gave even more
careful attention to our surroundings repeatedly
enormously overgrown insects were seen mostly they
were inoffensive harmless things even in their enorm-
ous size somehow too a remarkable sensation of dis-
proportion possessed me instead of the insects and
plants appearing of gigantic size i had the feeling of
being dwarfed of being a liliputian accompanied by
equally liliputian beings moving through a normal land
among normal creatures in fact the exact sensation
one might have were one suddenly reduced to the size
of a midget perhaps six inches in height and found
oneself in a brushy weed-filled pasture once this
sensation of inverted proportions had entered my brain
i could not rid myself of it try as i might it was
exactly the same as the effect of an optical delusion
like looking at the well known representation of shaded
cubes which when gazed at fixedly for a space sud-
denly turn upside down after which it is next to im-
possible to force ones optic nerves to see them in
their original position and up to the present moment
i still feel as though it were tom and myself who were
abnormal-insignificant beings the size of cucumbers
amid ordinary sized surroundings thus the immense
bamboo-like growths assumed the character of ordinary
grasses as they would appear to a toad or to the white-
footed little deer-mouse to a sparrows eyes the slug-
gish caterpillars for which he sought would appear no
larger than the giant bristle-clad larvae i saw the
mole or meadow mouse following his well-worn path-
ways across a meadow might well have gazed upon
much the same surroundings as those through which
we passed as our captors led us along their trail so
possessed with this strange hallucination did i become
that i began to wonder whether the insect life and
vegetable growths about me were actually of gigantic
size or whether in some inexplicable manner my brain
had been affected in such a way that i was seeing
things with distorted vision so insufferable did this
doubt in my mind become that in order to test my
senses i grasped the edge of a russet-hued toadstool
that reached to my shoulder and wenched off a hand-
ful of the fungi as the thing broke a nauseating
overpowering odor almost choked me and from the
sickly-gray decomposing mass three horrible corpse-
white wriggling maggots dropped one struck my
shoulder with a thud and a feeling of sickening re-
pulsion ran through me at its touch another fell to
the earth in front of me and before i could avoid it
i stepped squarely upon the thing and my foot was
buried to my ankle in the horrid pulpy body if my
eyes and brain were deceiving me so were my hands
my nerves my feet and i was convinced that what-
ever my sensations of proportion might be i was in
a land where normal men were puny as compared with
the insect and plant life

  also i found myself wondering what the beings
who had captured us ate where and how they lived
how they communicated with one another and whether
they were the only vertebrate denizens of the country

so far we had seen no other vertebrates no birds
mammals or even reptiles or datrachians but that
of course did not prove their non-existence and if
such higher forms of animal life existed what i won-
dered would they be like

  would they too be gigantic would they also have
acquired more or less of the insect characters or
would they have remained normal in size and character
it was fascinating to speculate on such matters and i
longed to be able to communicate with the black beings
in order to learn something of themselves and their
country but every effort to do this failed they
were apparently dumb my words meant nothing to
them and sign were obviously incomprehensible

  by now tom also had recovered from his first over-
whelming terror and although still shaking with fear
his brain was beginning to function and he was taking
note of his bizarre surroundings once or twice he
uttered exclamations of surprise and once when a
giant cricket nearly two feet in length leaped unex-
pectedly across the pathway he gave vent to a startled
cry and sprang back and gradually as i managed to
get him to converse i found that he had none of my
sensations of being dwarfed which was a vast relief
to me for it was convincing proof that everything
was of gigantic size except the savages who had come
with us

  we had now passed through the densest part of
the jungle and had entered an area of immense grasses
or bamboos suddenly these ended and before us was
a cleared open stretch in the centre of which was a
circular ring or mound of stones as we came within
sight of this scores of the black creatures swarmed
over the edge and came hurrying towards us as they
came forward in a close-packed mass their triangular
faces and great staring eyes were so strikingly insect-
like that they appeared more like a swarm of ants
than like a crowd of human beings in a moment
more we were surrounded the creatures were evi-
dently tremendously excited their heads swung from
side to side on their long thin necks they moved
about with nervous quick motions their antennae-like
ears seemed actually to vibrate and their saliva-drib-
bling lips twisted and grimaced while from them
there issued an almost inaudible indescribable droning
as though their vocal cords were vibrating without pro-
ducing articulate sounds

  in the midst of the horde as we were the odor of
their bodies was almost more than i could bear and
my eyes smarted and ran and i coughed and sneezed
as though afflicted with hay fever all the time we
were being urged onward towards the stone mound
where between stumbling walking and clamboring
and being pushed and shoved we at last found our-
selves on the summit it was a broad wall or barrier
of stone surrounding a circular sandy area or hollow
in the centre of which was a roughly built stone pile--
i can scarcely dignify it with the name of building-
perforated by innumerable apertures or openings
straight towards this we were hurried and still sur-
rounded by a crowd of the creatures although the
great majority remained outside we were led through
one of the openings and along a downward-sloping
winding and inky-black passage

through endless tunnels and galleries we were
led and gradually our eyes became somewhat ac-
customed to the darkness and i could distinguish the
shadowy walls and at times more or less of the in-
teriors of the chambers we passed or entered every-
where the walls of the tunnels were plastered with
dried mud or were built up with stones and every-
the world of the giant ants



where the place reeked with the smell of the beings
and with a different sickishly-sweet odor that issued
from certain galleries or rooms in some places i
caught glimpses of figures moving about but whether
they were males or females was impossible to say at
last we were conducted into a fairly large chamber
where a very dim light entered through a crack or
crevice in the ceiling and as i glanced about ex-
pecting to find some sort of ruler or chief presiding
over the place i rubbed my eyes and could scarcely
credit my senses instead of a king or ruler or even
a council of the beings who had captured us i saw
the most astonishing sight i had yet beheld here
and there about the chamber were insects of huge size
partly reared on his stout legs was a long-bodied rudi-
mentary-winged rover-beetle nearly a yard length
with his big eyes staring at us with an oddly vapid
peaceful expression that was almost ludicrous then
having apparently lost interest in the newcomers he
settled back lazily upon the floor near him was an im-
mense hairy-bodied bee-like fly with a fat overfed body
as large as a pumpkin and preening its antennae with
one foot so strikingly like a paunchy man stroking
his mustache after a full meal that even tom chuckled
at the sight in another spot a drowsy-looking wing-
less nymph reposed upon its belly a soft-bodied imma-
ture thing with glassy sightless eyes and undeveloped
pulpy legs the yard-long young of some species of
hymenopterous insect helpless as a human baby

  beyond this were several smaller insects i could
not identify while curled up like a sleeping puppy and
so obviously slumbering that i could almost fancy it
snored was a great wooly-coated caterpillar what did
this mean were these things prisoners like ourselves
were they destined to be killed and eaten by the sav-
ages and were we destined for the same fate there
seemed no other explanation of this aggregation of
strange creatures to which we had been added unless
the savages were acquiring a menagerie and regarded
tom and myself as exhibits then for the first time
i noticed that the creatures i have mentioned were
being tended by members of the tribe who had cap-
tured us several of the beings were offering the in-
sects food waiting upon them caring for them even
as i watched in surprise two of the things approached
tom and myself bearing bunches of tender leaves
they offered them to us as if expecting us to devour
them as eagerly as the caterpillar which had uncoiled
itself and was crunching avidly at the leaves given to
it they seemed greatly disturbed when we refused
to dine on the leaves and scurried about excitedly
presently one returned with a fragment of a mushroom
-evidently they had misinterpreted my act in break-
ing the fungus as i had walked along-while a second
brought a piece of stinking meat the meat almost
turned my stomach although the giant fly had ceased
stroking its antennae to dine on the same flesh i was
ravenously hungry and having tasted the fungus i
managed to swallow some of it tom however could
not stomach it and again the beings who seemed so
solicitous of our welfare scurried off to return with
some sweet sugary pasty material which tom found
palatable declaring that it tasted like condensed milk
this i noticed was also eaten by the mild-eyed rover
beetle as well as by the nymph with something of
dread that we would be forced to subsist upon the
same fare as that provided for the insect occupants of
the chamber i squatted down leaned against the wall
and wondered what would be the ultimate end of it all

  our captors apparently paid little heed to us leav-
ing us unwatched and unguarded when they frequently
left the room to return with more food and strangely

enough now that they had us here and had fed us
they appeared to take little interest in us it was
inexplicable behavior and i could only surmise that
eventually we would be taken before the ruler of the
beings and that our fate would then be decided still
there was something in the attitude of our captors
which puzzled me greatly they somehow acted as
though we were guests rather than prisoners and
finally in order to test the matter i rose to my feet
and walked boldly towards the entrance to the chamber
tom worn out with his fear and the strain he had
been under was fast asleep and i did not disturb him
the two beings still in the room glanced up as i
turned towards the doorway but they showed no
signs of interfering with my actions stooping low to
pass through the portal i stepped into the passage
and sauntered onward several of the beings met me
several overtook me but not one showed the least
interest in my movements or offered to molest me in
any way i was fairly astounded for all i could see
i was at liberty to go anywhere i pleased and i won-
dered if i would be permitted to reach the open air and
even to leave the home of the beings i was strongly
tempted to test it but i feared i would lose my way
in the multiplicity of galleries and passages and would
be unable to return to tom

  there would be plenty of time to discover how free
we were later and turning i walked back and re-
entered the chamber where the strange insects and
tom appeared to be all wrapped in sleep feeling tired
and drowsy myself i decided there was nothing better
than to follow their example and stretching myself
beside tom i closed my eyes then as i dozed off
and my half-conscious brain reverted dreamily to the
events of the day i suddenly burst out laughing as a
fantastical idea entered my mind why hadnt i thought
of it before why hadnt this solution of the case
occurred to me now i understood why tom and
myself were there why those giant insects were in the
chamber why they and ourselves were being fed and
tended by the strange beings yes my knowledge of
entomology of the life histories and habits of insects
should have made it all clear to me at first sight of
that great rover-beetle the paunchy fly the helpless
nymph the drowsy caterpillar like their prototypes
of the outside world that dwell within the nests of
ants and bees and are not only suffered to remain
but are actually fed and tended by their hosts these
insects about me were inquilines

  they were lazy improvident guests of these beings
who despite their human forms were themselves so
ant-like inquilines that perhaps had come uninvited
or that perhaps had been brought here as tom and
myself had been and it was this thought that had
brought a chuckle of laughter to my lips the thought
the conviction that ive two were nothing more than
inquilines creatures to be regarded with the same
tolerance and as on the same plane as the insects that
shared the underground chamber with us

chapter iii

i awoke greatly refreshed and much easier in my
mind tom was already awake but our insect com-
panions appeared to be still slumbering i had no
idea how long i had slept and the chamber was too
dark to permit me to see my watch i was on the
point of striking a match in order to learn the hour
but realizing how scanty was my supply of matches i
thought better of thus wasting one of the precious
things but i was longing to smoke and at last
unable to resist longer-for i had not had a whiff of
tobacco since entering the country-i decided that i

could afford one match for lighting my pipe and could
determine the time with the same light the effect of
the lighting of the match was astounding as the flame
flared up momentarily lighting the room every occu-
pant came to life instantly there was a rustling of
wings the scratching of chitonous feet the sound of
scurrying bodies and strange clicking noises instantly
everything was in confusion the rover-beetle rushed
scurrying into a dark passage the aldermanic fly
spread its wings and flew blindly about bumping into
walls and against the ceiling the wooly caterpillar un-
coiled and hurried out of sight as if it had a pressing
engagement elsewhere and the savages who were within
the chamber threw themselves on the floor in a
paroxysm of terror only the pulpy helpless nymph
remained placid utterly unmoved utterly oblivious to
everything just as any normal nymph should be i
was so surprised at the effect of the sudden light upon
the creatures that i held the match until it scorched
my fingers

  but after all i thought it was not really sur-
prising in the least insects invariably react to a light
in darkness they may be attracted by it and blunder
into it-the proverbial moths and the flame-or in the
case of many beetles and other insects they exhibit
fear and seek safety by hiding themselves in the dark-
est crevices they can find and the insect denizens
of the chamber were all inquilines creatures whose
lives are spent in darkness merely because they were
of gigantic proportions was no reason why they should
be any more intelligent than ordinary insects or should
not possess precisely the same habits characteristics
and reactions as the normal sized insects of the same
genera somehow quite unconsciously probably be-
cause tom and i had been treated like the other in-
quilines and perhaps partly on account of their size
i had begun to regard the huge insect inhabitants of
the land as sentient intelligent beings more or less
like higher forms of life or even like primitive humans
in fact the effect of my match upon the creatures
brought me suddenly to the realization that without
knowing it i had been brought into a curious psycho-
logical state wherein i had been regarding the over-
grown insects like fellow men or to put it another
way i had unwittingly placed myself mentally on a
plane with the insects and this knowledge explained
in a measure the ant-like characteristics of the black
savages through countless generations they had lived
among insects had inhabited a land where insects
dominated if i a civilized and i flatter myself an
unusually intelligent man so quickly and unconsciously
acquired this amazing psychological state the wonder
was that the poor ignorant semi-human savages had
not ages ago lost what little intelligence and human
characteristics they had possessed and it was not sur-
prising that they too had been terror-stricken at the
flare of a match when i came to think of it i had
seen no signs of fires anywhere and the chance were
that they did not even know how to make a fire but
my discovery of their fear of flame was most oppor-
tune and did much to encourage me fire would be a
weapon with which i could rule the beings and i
doubted if even the most courageous of them would
attempt to interfere with us once they had seen me
produce the phenomenon but i soon found that i
possessed an even more potent and terrible power than
fire telling tom of my plans and explaining as well
as i might what i believed our position to be we rose
and leading the way i started down the passage as
on the previous day no one attempted to interfere
with us and presently i noticed that as we ap-
proached them all the savages within sight raced off

as though the devil were at their heels moreover they
came pouring from chambers and galleries and filled
the passage to overflowing as they crowded and
struggled to get out of our way until the tunnel
before us was packed with a milling excited throng
at first i thought that word of my match had been
spread and that the savages were terrified for fear
i would again strike a light then suddenly the
truth burst upon me it was the smoke from my
pipe perhaps the sight of the smoke was enough to
strike terror to their hearts or more probably the
odor of the tobacco was the cause of their fright
but whatever the basic cause the result was in our
favor for not only was it obvious that we had noth-
ing to fear from that time on but in addition we
had merely to follow the retreating mob in order to
reach the open air the instant they reached the
exits to the tunnels the creatures scattered and ran
and we found ourselves quite alone with the faint
light of dawn just breaking through the heavy veil of
mists that shrouded the land

the smell of the fresh air and of vegetation was
most welcome after the musty malodorous at-
mosphere of the subterranean chambers and we sat
there taking deep breaths and waiting for the sun to
rise i had determined that as soon as it was light
enough to see i would go in search of food the bit
of musty fungus i had eaten had merely taken the
edge off my ravenous hunger and tom confessed that
he felt famished somewhere in the land there must
be edible fruit vegetables or game and i was de-
termined to find out what alimentary resources the
country possessed i still had my revolver and a belt
full of cartridges and though i am no expert marks-
man i felt confident that i could manage to bring
down any ordinary sized animal or bird we might
find also there was a chance that there might be
fish in the streams or pools i had seen and all else
failing we might be able to fall back upon some form
of insect more than once when among indians i
had eaten dried grasshopper meal fried caterpillars
and roasted palm grubs and from personal experience
i knew that when ones natural repugnance to such
things was overcome that food was nutritious and
palatable and i could see no reason why a grub larva
or grasshopper should not be equally edible if it
happened to be several feet long instead of an inch
or two in fact at that moment i could picture din-
ing off a grasshoppers drumstick or a beetle-grub
steak with intense satisfaction

  meanwhile i loaded my pistol and chatted with
tom while in the distance the shadowy forms of the
savages lurked about watching us fearfully and ready
to take flight at the first movement on our part
they were after all a most timid and harmless lot
and i wondered that i had been so terrified by them
in the first place but then again i had seen a
demonstration of their fighting ability and i thoroughly
appreciated the fact that should they screw up their
courage to the proper pitch they could make short
work of us without much danger to themselves but
it requires the highest degree of both mental and
physical courage to attack an unknown being and more
especially a being who is regarded with superstition
or who is regarded as a superior being and i could
not imagine those triangular headed degenerate sav-
ages possessing any mental courage no matter how
much physical valor they might have now i felt per-
fectly secure as far as any danger from our recent
hosts was concerned

  presently too the light had increased sufficiently
the world of the giant ants



for us to start on our hunt leaving the savages to
their own devices and to their underground retreats
we clambered over the stone wall walked across the
open space and found ourselves in the jungle on every
hand strange noises and rather terrifying sounds is-
sued from the shadows and thickets some of these
i recognized the siren-like deafening screech from
a clump of bamboos was unquestionably that of a giant
cricket the piercing ear-splitting note was probably
from some awakening grasshopper the crunching
rending noises were caused by hungry larvse devouring
the moisture-laden leaves and the loud clicking noises
like a hammer striking metal were i decided pro-
duced by beetles the whole place appeared to teem
with life and at every turn we caught glimpses of the
busy insects probably the number of insects in this
place is not any greater in proportion to the ea and
the vegetation than elsewhere but owing to the fact
that they are all or nearly all of exaggerated size
they appeared far more numerous also as we were
relatively small we were better able to discover the
insects had we too been built on the same propor-
tionate scale as human beings in an ordinary land i
doubt if we would have noticed any greater abundance
of insect life than in an ordinary meadow or forest
but as it was we were not only enabled to see prac-
tically every insect within reach of our vision but i
was afforded a most marvelous opportunity of studying
their lives and habits it was in fact like looking
at everything through a powerful microscope and my
hunger was forgotten in my interest in watching the
strange life about me even tom who was not in the
least given to an interest in natural history and al-
ways considered all forms of insect life as bugs to
be destroyed became quite excited and fascinated as i
pointed out the habits of the creatures about us from
the limb of a spreading tree a fat-bodied spider the
size of a tea-tray and with hairy legs as thick as a
rolling-pin was industriously spinning a web of gleam-
ing silken strands each strand the size of stout cord
and when a blundering gnat as large as a sparrow
flew blindly into the half-completed web and the fero-
cious owner dashed at it enveloped it in coils of silk
and gloatingly proceeded to devour the captive we
watched the tragedy with almost hypnotic fascination

  tom glanced nervously about wa-laa he ejacu-
lated ah dont wantin for to meet scopions an
tarantlas here bout chief nor centpedes neither a
centpede mos surely be as big as derr boonstrictors
an a scopion de bigness of a cow no chief ah
dont longin fo meet none of dem folk

  but fortunately we met neither centipedes scor-
pions nor predatory arachnids though i could fully
appreciate toms fears of such an encounter and fully
realized the dangerous character of such creatures if
of the same proportions as the other insects a scor-
pion six feet in length a mygale or tarantula weigh-
ing a score of pounds or a centipede twice as long as
a man would indeed be a formidable enemy

but even without these to reckon with there was i
felt no little peril in wandering through this
jungle of strange forms of plant life many of our
commonest insects are predatory still more are car-
nivorous and for their size insects are the most
savage ferocious and utterly fearless of all creatures
to be sure as a rule insects are very particular as
to their food and a species which devours caterpillars
for example will attack and eat nothing else hence i
reasoned that if human beings were not included in
the menu of any of the insects in this land we had
comparatively little to fear for it is rarely that any

insect attacks another creature except for the purpose
of eating it but on the other hand i had witnessed
the terror of the black savages when the solitary
hornet had approached and for all i knew the giant
insects of this country might have acquired a liking
for human flesh and blood a tiger-beetle a yard in
length would be a bad customer and would be far
more dangerous than a tiger an aphislion with its
enormous scissors-like jaws a foot in length would be
able to shear a mans head from his shoulders and if
there were ants as i felt there must be they might
and probably would prove the most dangerous of all
the preposterously overdeveloped fauna of this strange
land in addition to all these unknown dangers which
might confront us at any moment there was the
danger that the veterbrate beasts inhabited the jungles
although i had so far discovered no sign of the
presence of mammals lizards or even birds yet it
seemed highly improbable that such did not exist and
if they did how could i be sure that they too were
not relatively as large as the insects

   i trembled at the thought of meeting a carnivorous n
beast or bird under such conditions even a shrew-
the tiniest of mammals-would be large and powerful
enough to destroy us as readily as our ordinary shrews
destroy a husky stag-beetle but a little later when we
met our first mammal all my conjectures had not pre-
pared me for what i saw the creature was some sort
of gopher or ground-squirrel and quite unexpectedly
it darted from the jungle across our pathway and
so strangely had my surroundings affected me mentally
and so accustomed had i become to seeing familiar
things enlarged to incredible size that i was speech-
less with amazement for the creature was no larger
than an ordinary woodchuck recovering my self-
possession in time i brought the marmot down with a
lucky shot from my pistol and we were assured of
at least one meal i felt immensely relieved also
to find the marmot of normal size if the form of
mammalian life was normal in this land of abnormali-
ties there was no reason to think that others were not
normal as well but as i speculated upon this and
again resumed our way i wondered how ordinary sized
vertebrates ever managed to survive in a land of giant
insects but i believe now from what i have observed
that the only vertebrates which have managed to exist
are those that dwell in subterranean holes or burrows
and are nocturnal in their habits whether all other
species have been completely exterminated or whether
they were never indigenous to the land i cannot say
but my opinion is that the latter is the case and that
the absence of large carnivorous birds and mammals
is one of the chief causes of the ultra-development of
insect life here

  so engrossed had i become in my thoughts and so
closely was tom scrutinizing the thickets fearing a
surprise by some dangerous creature that i failed to
watch my step suddenly and without warning my
feet flew from under me and with a terrified yell i
found myself sliding rolling down the steep side of
a pit-like depression to be sure it was not more
than five feet in depth but to me it held all the terrors
of an inferno at the very instant i had lost my foot-
ing i realized what it was and as i struggled to re-
gain my feet and to scramble up the sandy slope my
hair seemed literally to stand on end and i fairly screamed
with terror for i had fallen into the trap of a mon-
strous ant-lion a few feet from me and clearly vis-
ible as with fear-dilated eyes i glanced backward two
enormous scimitar shaped jaws were protruding from
the loose sand at the bottom of the pit once within
reach of those homy dagger-sharp living blades and
	amazing stories quarterly

i would be seized sliced as with gigantic scissors and
the blood slowly sucked from my palpitating body
many a time had i watched helpless struggling ants
and other insects as they slid to the bottom of an
ant-lions trap and were seized and sucked dry by the
flat-bodied powerfully-built ravenous creature con-
cealed under the sand now as i fought madly to
escape from the shallow pit i realized how those un-
fortunate insects must have felt

  meantime tom stood paralyzed above me his mouth
gaping his eyes rolling and utterly bereft of enough
of his senses to aid me but the worst was yet to
come as i slowly as if in a nightmare clawed my
way upward slipping back an inch for every two i
gained the lurking terrible creature at the bottom
began throwing showers of sand and dust at me
exactly as i had seen countless ordinary ant-lions
throw dust at escaping ants with quick upward jerks
of his flat spatulate head and broad pincer-like jaws
he would toss a few handfuls of sand over me with
devilish accuracy half blinded by the dust frightened
out of my wits expecting each moment to reel back
into those waiting jaws i might as well have been
trying to find hand- and foot-holds in water as in the
sliding loose sand then when i was becoming ex-
hausted and felt convinced that i was doomed tom
recovered his wits and bracing himself firmly ex-
tended a tough branch within my reach the next
instant i was panting spent breathless and shaking
but safe on firm ground

   it had been a close shave maddened and in a paroxysm
of hate and resentment i whipped out my pistol and
was about to blaze away at the now quiescent ant-
lion when tom reminded me that my ammunition would
be more valuable for getting food and that a few good
sized rocks would serve equally as well as far as the
ant-lion was concerned suiting his actions to his
words he picked up a convenient stone and hurled it
at the beast but the creature was protected by a
layer of sand and the only result was to cause it
to hastily bury itself deeper

axe proceeded with far greater caution after that
  experience it was fortunate that we did so for
not only were the ant-lion traps fairly numerous but in
addition we soon discovered that the earth in spots
was riddled with holes and burrows in any one of
which we might wrench an ankle or break a leg

   to recall all the forms of insect life we saw would be
impossible and to fill my notes with descriptions would
be a waste of paper of which i have none too much
ground-beetlcs seemed to be the most abundant things
and though they rushed madly about in a strangely
excited and yet purposeless manner and several times
almost knocked our legs from under us they appeared
to be quite terrified whenever they came near us per-
haps it was the strange scent of human beings though
they smelled so abominably themselves that i cannot
understand how they could detect any outside odor
dipterous insects were also very common and these
appeared quite familiar and of ordinary size until i
realized that their iridescent jewel-like gauzy-winged in-
sects the size of our common bluebottle flies belonged
to genera members of which ordinarily are so small
that they are scarcely visible to the untrained eye
once too a great dragon-fly dashed into sight alighted
with stiff outspread wings and keen eyes upon a dead
tree top and then darted after a passing fly and
snapped it up at a single gulp he was a truly mag-
nificent creature although a bit terrifying at first a
gleaming thing spreading fully ten feet from his round
head with its terrible jaws to the tip of his tapering

plated body he was a mass of dazzling blue scarlet
and silver tom remarked that if he could only be
caught and tamed he might serve as a living airplane
to carry us back to civilization

  butterflies were numerous and while i recognized
some genera others were quite strange to me the
liehoconidae appeared the most common as they usu-
ally are in the tropics one species-a gray and white
mottled chap spreading about three feet-had a most
interesting habit of settling upon the earth waving its
wings slowly and emitting a remarkable clicking or
ticking sound like snapping clam shells together sev-
eral very large species were observed the largest being
a shining green beauty spreading at least eight feet
across the wings and evidently one of the morphos
but the most beautiful and interesting butterflies were
tiny fellows the size of our ordinary danais or medium
sized papilios they flitted nervously and jerkily from
one resting place to another as we approached them
invariably alighting with their heads towards us and
with their feathery antennae and ruby-like eyes watch-
ing our every movement in a most intelligent and fas-
cinating manner

   they were most delicately fashioned and beautifully
colored things too their legs and bodies appeared
to be dressed in garments of thick soft fur of almost
metallic lustre their wings were in some cases edged
with delicate feathers in other cases they were entirely
of the most intricate lacework and their colors were
indescribably lovely for the most part they were
pastel shades of lavender buff red and green
often set off by shining flecks of gold or silver i
longed for a net in which to capture and examine some
of these and it was not until i had watched them for
a long time that it dawned upon me that they were
in reality prototypes of our own microlepidoptera
things so minute that they can only be examined
through a powerful lens and so delicate that it is
practically impossible to capture or preserve them
without ruining their beauty and their details but
here were microlepidoptera large enough to study at a
considerable distance and with the naked eye and i
wondered if somewhere inthis land there were any
minute forms of insect lite creatures as small in
proportion to the lacy feather-winged beauties as are
our minute moths in proportion to the big shingidae
strangely enough too a great many genera and fam-
ilies of insects appeared to be entirely wanting i saw
no repiptera none of the carnivorous predatory beetles
no termites no arachnids other than a few spiders no
millipedes or centipedes and no mosquitos for this
i was duly thankful for the thought of mosquitos
the size of dragon flies or larger was disconcerting
to say the least aside from the gopher i had killed
one or two field-mice which darted out of sight in-
stantly and a fleeting glimpse of some creature i
thought to be a hare or rabbit we saw no mammals
we did however find several snails one or two of large
size but no larger than many marine molluscs and
we had a hearty laugh over our terror-after it had
passed-when an enormous overgrown toad leaped from
the shadows and descended like a falling elephant to
the trail ahead of us to our affrighted and startled
eyes he appeared a most gigantic and terrifying beast
although in reality he was no larger than a good-
sized dog and quite harmless as he squatted there
eying us speculatively winking first one eye and
then the other as if doubting his own vision the
while his yellowish-white throat palpitated to his
breathing he seemed most astonishingly and ludi-
crously human finally having apparently satisfied
himself that we really existed he opened his wide
the world of the giant ants



toothless mouth yawned prodigously and as if de-
ciding we were most uninteresting and ridiculous
beings he leaped back to his damp retreat

  so far our search for food had not been very suc-
cessful and it began to look as if we would fare badly
unless we resorted to insect flesh for sustenance we
had not gone entirely hungry however from time to
time we had found nuts and seeds once or twice we
had found berries which from a botanical viewpoint

i knew must be edible and tom had discovered-with
the born instinct of the west indian negro-a species
of cane with a sweet sap which he munched avidly
declaring it was as good as inferior sugar cane

  but by far the greater portion of edible fruits ber-
ries and even tubers that we found had been com-
pletely ruined or partly devoured by the innumerable
insects in fact the only real edibles of any account
which we found were located by means of the insects
if we noticed flies beetles and other creatures hurry-
ing in any one direction we soon learned that by
following them we were usually led to an accumulation
of ripe fruits or to a bush laden with berries of
course the greater portion of the fruit was fai beyond
our reach and often we gazed longingly at the luscious-
looking fruits surrounded by butterflies hymenoptera
diptera etc in the lofty tree tops

we had been wandering thus for several hours
when i at last suggested that we should light
a fire and roast our game no dry fuel was near
and noticing a fairly open forest a short distance
ahead we turned towards it we had proceeded but
a short distance when to my surprise i came upon
a well-marked carefully smoothed pathway a road of
bare earth perhaps two feet in width and leading
almost in a straight line in either direction as far
as we could see evidently i thought there were
human beings in the country men who were far above
the black savages and whether hostile or friendly far
preferable as hosts mentally deciding that as soon
as we had eaten we would investigate the pathway and
find where and to what it led we set about gathering
dry sticks in readiness for the fire busy with this
while tom was engaged in skinning and cleaning the
marmot i failed to maintain as careful a watch as
i should until instinctively warned by the sixth sense
that one develops in the bush i straightened up and
turned my eyes towards the pathway my amazement
at what i beheld forced an exclamation from my lips
and at this tom also glanced up one glimpse and
dropping the carcass he leaped to his feet and with
rolling eyes and terrified features he sprang behind
a sheltering tree hurrying towards us down the path-
way came a huge reddish-brown creature a creature
fully five feet in length with enormous head great
rounded fixed eyes short club-shaped antennae rough
powerful legs attenuated waist and turnip-shaped ab-
domen from head to tail he was sheathed in shining
horny armor like a coat of mail clamped fast in his
enormous triangular jaws he held a huge section of
green leaf that waved like a banner above his head
behind him came another and another an endless
procession each carrying its green burden until the
moving stream of leaves appeared like a strip of
jungle marching through the forest

  instantly i recognized them for what they were
they were leaf-cutting ants the bane of all tropical
agriculturalists but hundreds of times larger than
any leaf-cutting ant ever before seen by mortal eyes
like their prototypes so abundant throughout tropi-
cal america the gigantic terrifying creatures before us
were bent only on their own affairs they turned

neither to right nor left as they rushed past us in-
tent only on reaching their underground nest and plac-
ing their bits of leaf within the chambers where the
decaying vegetation carefully watched and tended
would develop the edible fungi on which the ants sub-
sisted i have said they were hurrying but the term
conveys no idea of the terrific speed at which they
traveled

  they moved with the rapidity of racing motor cars
at a speed of fully fifty miles an hour i should say
and this added to the illusion of a moving steadily
flowing stream of leaves for a moment i was astounded
at the speed of these huge ants but an instants re-
flection convinced me that it was quite to be expected
that it was really no faster in proportion to their size
than the movements of ordinary ants i had repeatedly
timed the progress of various insects and i knew that
the larger ants easily traversed forty to fifty feet or
approximately one thousand times their own length in
one minute hence at the same proportionate rate
there was no reason why the giant insects i was watch-
ing should not move one thousand times their length
or fully a mile in a minute tom was absolutely help-
less with terror and was gazing with horror-filled eyes
at the ever-flowing endless procession of rushing
ferocious looking giant ants for a space i confess

i partly shared his fears but unless these overdeveloped
ants possessed intellects and habits wholly unlike those
of their normal relatives we had nothing to fear if
we were not so foolish as to step into their pathway
or interrupt their business-like progress but i could
not convince tom that the creatures would not tear us
limb from limb if they caught sight of us or sus-
pected our presence in fact he shook and quaked
with new terror when i spoke filled with dread that
the onrushing ants might hear me i laughed gaily and
assured him that the ants were stone deaf as far as
our voices were concerned and gradually as he noticed
that the passing creatures gave no heed to my voice he
began to believe me but it was not until i had
thrown the entrails of the gopher into the ants path-
way and he had watched them halt and remove the
obstruction and again resume their interminable march
without offering to devour the offal that he could
realize that we were in no danger so feeling quite
safe as far as the ants were concerned we lit our
fire and prepared to cook our meat and eat our long
delayed breakfast within a stones throw of the ant
column but if the ants had paid no attention to our
proximity before and had given no sign that our voices
were audible to them they showed immediate and un-
mistakable evidences of knowing something was wrong
the moment the fire was lighted

  at the first whiff of smoke blown across their road-
way they came to an abrupt halt milled about
stroked one another with their feet touched antennae
and seemed tremendously excited some dropped their
burdens and started off in various directions through
the forest and two of these scouts headed directly to-
wards us tom sprang to his feet screaming but i
seized him by the coat and forced him to remain beside
me although i admit it required no little courage and
self-possession to stand there in the face of the fero-
cious-looking expressionless beasts who rushed down
upon us but i trusted to the intelligence of the ants
and to our fire and i was not disappointed as the two
came within range of the thickest smoke they halted
reared themselves on their hind legs-reminding me of
great tawny bears as they did so-pawed the air rubbed
their antennae and wheeling scurried around to the
other side of the fire once more they dashed up
until they felt the heat of the flame whereupon they

again retreated over and over again they repeated
these tactics often passing within a foot of us and
each time they came near tom trembled and shook
until his teeth chattered but as far as the ants were
concerned we might have been forest trees or bits of
stone all their attentions and senses were centered
upon the fire and smoke totally new things to them
at last having satisfied themselves that it was some
phenomenon that was to remain fixed and that it was
not likely to attack them they hurried back to the
waiting column then having apparently conveyed
the information they had gathered to their fellows
they picked up their discarded bits of leaves fell into
line and once again the procession was in full motion
convinced that he had nothing to fear tom sank back
to the earth while i chaffed him and poked fun at
him for being afraid of leaf-carrying ants with vhose
habits he should have been so thoroughly familiar
somewhat shamefacedly he admitted that he was quite
aware hat the drougher ant of jamaica and other
tropic lands was a strict vegetarian and confined itself
to certain definite vegetable growths at that but he
added as he ravenously attacked a gopher leg dis
gentman he dont been tha same chief he dont
been right an proper ant fall chief he been distinc

chapter iv

our hunger satisfied the question arose as to our
next move we were homeless friendless waifs
in a strange bizarre and dangerous land to
return to the hospitality of the black savages was not
to be considered and we well knew that it would be
a waste of energy to attempt to regain the outer world
by way of the tunnel from tupec there was a
chance however that there might be other means of
leaving the place and our only feasible plan appeared
to be to thoroughly explore the country in the hope
of discovering some trail or passage by which we
might escape i have already said that at our
first view of the place it had appeared to be sur-
rounded by lofty mountains but i knew from expe-
rience that mountain ranges might seem continuous
and unbroken from a distance and yet might be cut
by numerous passes ravines and canyons and it is
rarely indeed that a long mountain range cannot be
surmounted in some spot to be sure it seemed
an almost hopeless task to think of tramping around
that vast territory searching for an exit maintain-
ing a precarious existence meanwhile and constantly
facing unknown perils i knew only too well
how slow ones progress is in a tropical untamed
land and i knew that months years in fact
might be required to really explore the place
but in a way time meant nothing to us aside
from the fact that my supply of ammunition was
limited and that our garments and shoes would not
last forever there was no valid reason why we should
rot devote the rest of our lives to our search for
that matter if we did not attempt it the rest of our
lives would be passed here anyway at any rate we
would be doing something to occupy our minds and
bodies and anything was better than to remain inac-
tive and hopelessly awaiting whatever might befall
as i thought on such matters and discussed them
with tom it occurred to me that my position was
highly amusing i had set out on this trip lured on
by the wild tales of weird people and strange beings
in the unknown interior of the country i had de-

termined to penetrate the district beyond tupec and i
had looked forward with enthusiastic interest to mak-
ing epochal discoveries and now that i had pene-
trated to the locality had actually reached the fabu-
lous land and had met the beings-as well as even
more amazing things-all my interests and efforts
were bent on getting away from the very spot i had
so long desired to enter

  there was no doubt that i had made epochal dis-
coveries but of what use to discover things unless such
discoveries could be made known to the world also
it struck me forcibly for the first time in my life
that mans desire to explore to see strange sights to
discover amazing facts was not a question of personal
gratification or a thirst for individual knowledge but
was really due to an inherent egotistical vanity a
love of publicity and a longing to be applauded praised
and regarded as famous by his fellow men through-
out my own career i had rather prided myself on fight-
ing shy of publicity and had flattered myself that all
my studies and investigations had been carried on
solely for the benefit of science and adding to my
own store of knowledge yet here was i amid the
most amazing things that any scientist ever dreamed
of and thinking only of getting away from them of
returning to humdrum lands and uninteresting civi-
lized human beings still i did feel an intense interest
in the place and its strange denizens and i knew that
had i been free to leave whenever i desired i should
have elected to remain for a long time and should
have found the greatest delight in studying the animal
and plant life of the land thus musing on the complex
psychology of mankind and the reaction of the human
brain to conditions and environment i lit my pipe and
as one place seemed as good as another for a be-
ginning led the way through the forest towards the
nearest mountains i should have liked to have crossed
the pathway of the leaf-carrying ants for beyond that
line of march the forest was more open the land
sloped upward and i surmised that from the higher
land i might secure a widespread view of the place
and could thus be enabled to pick some promising ob-
jective point but despite my knowledge of the ants
habits and hecwvorous characters i had no desire
to attempt a passage of their highway to try to dash
across amid that throng of hurrying insects would
be far more perilous than to undertake to dodge among
countless racing automobiles on a congested avenue
ants at best are short-tempered things and while they
might not go out of their way or neglect their own
affairs to attack us-as long as we minded our own
business and did not interfere with them-yet i felt
quite confident that they would resent any trespassing
on their right of way and would show their resentment
in a most unpleasant and terrible manner even if
they did not fall upon us and tear us limb from limb
but merely regarded us as temporary obstructions-
much as they had treated the gophers entrails-i had
no desire to be picked up by those great terrifying
jaws and tossed to one side so abandoning all
thoughts of crossing the stream of ants we turned
our backs upon them and keeping to the open forest
tramped onward here in the forest life was com-
paratively scarce far above our heads we could hear
the sounds of insect life the crunching of leaves by
giant larva the droning of buzzing flies and bees
the high-pitched screech of tree-crickets and innumer-
able noises i could not identify

  once too a terrific roaring bellow struck terror
to our hearts and we halted cowering behind a tree
for such a sound i felt could only issue from the
throat of some huge carnivorous mammal but pres-
the world of the giant ants



ently as the roar was repeated and i gazed fixedly
in the direction whence it came expecting to see a
crouching tiger or other feline i burst into a peal of
laughter clinging to the rough bark of an outjutting
limb his great golden eyes blinking squatted a huge
tree-frog a gigantic hyla with moist skin so perfectly
matching the color of the lichen-covered bark that had
it not been for his eyes and the movements of his
throat as he again gave vent to his bellow he would
have been invisible

 on another occasion we were startled by what
might well have been the screech of a steamships
siren a terrifying sound that rose and fell and quav-
ered and drowned all other noises for a moment i
was perplexed but as i caught sight of an object
clinging to a tree trunk i knew instantly what crea-
ture had produced the ear-splitting cry as tom also
saw the thing on the tree he gave a howl of terror
and clung to me shaking with fear i really could
not blame him for nothing we had yet seen was more
horrifying in aspect or more monstrous in form its
fat abdomen was perhaps three feet in length its
heavy spike-covered legs ended in great anchor-shaped
claws that were buried deep in the bark its goggle
eyes wore a fishy ghastly expression-reminding me
of a long-dead human-and between short murderous-
looking palpi or fore-legs we could see a long needle-
pointed tusk or beak but despite its fearsome aspect
i knew the thing was harmless devoid of life and
picking up a stick i stepped forward and with a laugh
aimed a blow at the thing as the stick struck the
monster it crackled collapsed and dropped in a dozen
pieces to the ground it was merely the cast-off skin
of a cicada larva or so-called locust and the siren-
like screech from the tree top was the triumphant
love call of the mature insect which had recently
emerged from the discarded pupa-case

another time tom had a surprise which amazed
him so that for several moments he was quite
incapable of speech and sat gazing unable to believe
his eyes until my peals of laughter brought him to
his senses in order to remove a twig from one shoe
he had reached out one hand to rest it against a tree
to steady himself the next instant a two-foot section
of the rough gray bark had detached itself from the
tree trunk had sprung suddenly into life and on
broad rustling wings had flitted off showing a flash of
flame color as it did so fifty feet away it had van-
ished as suddenly and as completely as though it had
dissolved in air and tom as i said sat gazing in-
credulously at the spot where it had disappeared i
had recognized it as a catoccda moth a giant specimen
to be sure but possessing the same habits and prac-
tically the same colors as our familiar catocalas of the
northern forests like them its upper wings were
colored and patterned to precisely match the bark of
the tree on which it rested like them its under wings-
visible only in flight-were gaudily colored in orange
and black and like them it flitted but a short distance
before again alighting on a tree trunk where it be-
came instantly so camouflaged as to become invisible
tom was loth to believe this possible and in order
to prove the facts and to accustom him to unexpected
experiences i approached the tree where the moth had
vanished until within a few feet of it then while
tom stared at the bark incredulously i tossed a peb-
ble and once more the apparent piece of bark took
flight tom shook his woolly head and gazed after
the flitting insect reflectively pears to me chief
he observed we folks dont been design for to abide
here no ways so convenent like tha bugs could ah

absolve mahself into a tree bark like dat gentman do
ah wouldnt be afraid of nothin ahd jes transfom
mahself into the bark an laff at whatsoever was
a-sarchin fo me yes chief ah mos surely would

  to me the most astonishing thing about all the life
we had seen was the fact that in their habits charac-
ters and even appearance the insects mammals and
batrachians were so very similar to those i was fa-
miliar with elsewhere

  about the only difference was the discrepancy in
size and in the case of mammals at least even that
distinction was wanting only the human denizens
of the land appeared to have developed unusual physi-
cal characters and habits-characters and habits strik-
ingly insect-like as i have already said if as i as-
sumed this was due to the predominance of insects
and the environment why then had not the insects
developed higher forms greater intelligence and at
least some of the characters that we associate with
human beings as i speculated on this my memory
went back to my college days and i recollected the
words of my professor of zoology in the course of at
lecture he had stated that one of the peculiarities of
mans mind was that it could not conceive of anything
totally unlike anything ever before seen smelt heard
tasted or felt in other words mans imagination was
completely restricted to the experiences of his five
senses no man he had declared could describe a
color a sound an odor a texture or a form entirely
new or unknown even the writers of the most imag-
inative fiction were at a loss to do this if they
attempted to describe the denizens of another planet
they invariably compared them to something familiar
they were like this that or the other with slightly
altered details a color was invariably described as
resembling one or more of the visible rays of the
spectrum and yet he continued we have no rea-
son to assume that the inhabitants of another world-
or even of some unknown part of this world-have the
slightest resemblance to anything we have ever seen
there is no valid scientific reason why any of the lower
forms of life-even the insects-should not somewhere
in the universe have evolved and developed to the
same or even greater heights than the primates in
our circumscribed world

  the truth of this statement coming from a scient-
ist of world-wide reputation could not be denied or
even doubted and yet here in a land where most
obviously every condition was most admirably adapted
to the ultra-development of insect and batrachian life
the insects were still insects in character in intellect
in habits the batrachians were still batrachians and
while man had regenerated the other forms of life
had not progressed beyond acquiring greater size
there were the ants for example the most intelligent
the best organized the most human-like if i may use
the term of the insect-world theoretically ants in
a land like this and where they reached undreamed of
proportions might be expected to exhibit marvelous
intellect amazing progress and might even be more
advanced than human beings yet the leaf-carrying
ants which were the only species i had observed were
still ants gigantic in size to be sure but still behav
ing exactly like any ordinary leaf-carrying ants

i -

no there was not a thing i had met so far which
i could not have described fully and intelligently
from my former experiences and observations not a
thing which was absolutely new to my eyes nose ears
tongue or touch

  after all i thought there is much truth in the
old saying that there is nothing new under the sun
	amazing stories quarterly

but there is equal truth in the equally trite proverbs
regarding pride going before a fall and a modicum of
knowledge being a dangerous thing as i was to dis-
cover very soon

   absorbed in my reflections and cogitations i had failed
to note our surroundings until i was aroused by a
surprised ejaculation from tom i glanced up to find
that we had reached the end of the forest and that
before us was a grove or i might say orchard of
large shrubs or small trees with thick fleshy stalks
and soft green foliage that they had been planted
purposely and were cultivated growths was evident
for they were arranged in orderly rows and the earth
beneath them was bare of grass or weeds for a
brief instant new hope sprang to my breast for here
i thought was proof that intelligent civilized or semi-
civilized men dwelt in the land but the next second
my heart sank and i involuntarily slipped back of a
tree from between the rows of plants one of the
hideous black savages appeared

  but it was not the semi-human being that riveted
my attention and caused me to gasp with incredulous
amazement but the creatures that accompanied him

an emmet shepherdess carrying one of her aphid flock

from natures craftsmen by henry c mccook

for the fraction of a second i mistook them for some
species of pachyderm some creature related to the
hippopotami and in a flash i remembered the carv-
ings at tupec showing the same beasts but that
they were not pachyderms of any sort was instantly
apparent in fact they were not mammals for the
dozen or more ungainly creatures forming the herd
which the black savage was driving and urging on-
ward all possessed six legs

  incredible as it seemed they were insects-great
round-bodied short-legged beasts the size of heifers
soft and flabby-skinned with drooping dewlaps small
elongated heads goggle-eyes staring upward from the
occiput and with short rudimentary antennae and
elephant-like trunks which were folded up between the
front legs some possessed rudimentary wings in the
form of fleshy pads above the abdomen some were
brown some pale green some mottled and several were
a livid sickly whitish but all were alike in one
respect for near the rear end of the abdomen of
each was a swollen protruberance with teat-like ap-
pendages it was in fact this peculiarity more than
anything else which enabled me to identify the things
despite their enormous size despite their striking re-
semblance to lumbering pachyderms i knew they must
be aphids plant-lice as they are more commonly known
it was equally apparent that they were domesticated
for they behaved precisely like our own domestic cattle
every moment or two one or more of the beasts would
stray aside and extending its proboscis would feel
about on the stem of a bush as if searching for food

and each time as the black herder started in the
direction of the beast it would fold up its proboscis
and kicking up its heels in a most ludicrous and un-
gainly manner would hurry after its companions who
taking advantage of the herders diverted attention
would invariably stop to graze as i might express it
by climbing up the nearest bushes and inserting their
noses in the soft fleshy stems the poor black was
having his hands full but between tossing pebbles
at his charges whacking them with a light switch
which he carried and constantly darting first to one
side and then the other he managed to keep them
going in the direction he desired scarcely had the
first herd and its driver passed when another came
into view followed by a third and fourth so astonished
had i become at discovering that the semi-human blacks
had actually domesticated the giant aphids and were
apparently using them as milch cows exactly as do
many species of our common ants that i completely
forgot myself and my surroundings and hurried from
the shelter of the forest in order to secure a closer
view of the remarkable beasts instantly all was con-
fusion the blacks the moment they caught sight of
me deserted their charges and scurried off with every
indication of terror and the aphids as startled by the
apparition of a strange being as ordinary cattle are at
the approach of a stranger stampeded thundering off
in every direction at a speed of which i should never
have thought them capable but they did not go far
instead of rushing off among the rows of small trees
they commenced clamboring up the stems so indescrib-
ably ridiculous and so absolutely astounding was
the sight of these great lumbering beasts climb-
ing up the straight smooth stalks that i fair-
ly roared with laughter a few of the beasts con-
tinued upward for a dozen feet or more until they
gained the lowest branches but the majority instantly
forgot their fear as soon as they found themselves 
the stalks and with bovine complacency at once fell to
work sucking the sap oblivious to all else

  for a moment or two i watched them and then
feeling rather sorry for the terrified herders and tho
commotion i had caused and being anxious to study
their actions further i withdrew and rejoined tom
where he was hiding still terrified in the forest no
doubt the concealed blacks had been watching my every
movement for a few moments after i had again en-
tered the forest they crept timorously forth and after
a deal of difficulty again rounded up their charges of
course i knew that the aphids were perfectly harmless
and incapable of either offensive or defensive actions
-unless by chance they should step  one-but never-
theless i was rather amazed at the manner in which
the triangular-headed blacks manhandled the big beasts
pushing and shoving them about and dragging them
down from their perches by tugging at legs or snouts

i was still more astonished at the almost monkey-like
agility of the blacks as they ran up the stems of the
trees and herding the escaped aphids from the limbs
forced them to descend to the ground presently the
herds were again moving steadily onward and anxious
to discover where they were going and with what pur-
pose the savages were driving them i waited until
they were barely visible in the distance and followed
after

chapter v

by now as will have been surmised i had com-
pletely lost any lingering fears of the savages
and even tom seeing my example did not dread
them greatly this was due partly to our experience when
we had left the subterranean chamber and had realized
the world of the giant ants



that the blacks were far more afraid of us than we
of them still more it was due to the evident fear of
us exhibited by the aphids herders but  think that
the last sensations of dread  had felt had vanished
mainly because of the innumerable and far more dan-
gerous things i had met

  compared to a five-foot leaf-carrying ant the blacks
seemed comparatively harmless a roving wasp or
hornet was a far more dangerous foe than a dozen
of the savages and i would rather have faced a score
of the beings single-handed than to have repeated my
experience with the ant-lion to be sure they were
the largest living things we had encountered fairly
good-sized for men and almost equal to my own stature
but almost any insect is fully one hundred times as
strong for its size as a human being and i was well
aware that any predatory beetle or hemiptera of the
size to be expected would be a match for a small army
of the savages or for several well-armed beings like
myself

  hence quite unconsciously i had been mentally
comparing the savages with the giant insects of the
place and without realizing it i had come to think
of them with something of contempt perhaps i can
best explain my feeling by comparing myself with a
man who surrounded by hyenas and seeing the beasts
tearing some creature limb from limb becomes terri-
fied at their ferociousness and brute strength until he
comes face to face with a lion or a tiger

  added to all this was the fact that my scientific
interest had been aroused and that-even had i still
feared the blacks-i doubtless should have forgotten
my own peril in my anxiety to study them and their
habits at any rate the fact remains that i had no
fear whatsoever of the beings who were urging on their
aphid cattle far ahead of us rather my mind was
bent on not frightening them and it struck me as
rather amusing to think how quickly our positions had
been reversed and that within twenty-four hours of
my first sight of the savages i was the hunter rather
than the hunted and was taking every care not to
terrify them into flight then for the first time i
realized how rapidly the hours had passed it was
already late in the afternoon my appetite warned me
that i should be searching for food rather than fol-
lowing the creatures ahead and it behooved us to
find some place in which to pass the approaching
night regretfully i decided that it would not do to
continue farther i was about to turn aside and hunt
for provender and a spot in which to camp when the
herds and their drivers suddenly vanished as if the
earth had swallowed them

  as a matter of fact that was precisely what had
happened as i discovered a few moments later when
we reached the spot where they had disappeared here
were several yawning openings in the side of a hill
or mound and from the sounds issuing hollowly from
within i knew that the savages and their charges had
entered the subterranean passages it was useless to
follow them without a light for it would i knew be
inky black within the passages deciding to remain
in the vicinity until morning and then investigate i
abandoned all entomological researches for the time
and with tom vastly relieved by my decision set out
in search of dinner we were rather fortunate as in
other lands with the approach of sundown the ma-
jority of the insects went to rest while nocturnal mam-
mals- and apparently most if not all of the verte-
brates of the place were nocturnal-came forth from
their hiding places scarcely two hundred yards from
the edge of the forest we came upon several large
hare-like creatures browsing in an open space as they

were not at all shy and we approached within a short
distance of them i easily shot one while tom knocked
over a second with- a well-thrown club of wood at
the thunderous echoes of my pistol-shot pandemonium
broke loose in the forest and on every side were the
sounds of beating wings sharp cries strange clickings
and the rustle of unseen creatures aroused and fright-
ened by the unwonted sound seeing how easily tom
had killed game with mankinds first and most primi-
tive weapons i was sorry that i had wasted my am-
munition hence as i gathered fuel and tom pre-
pared the hare i had shot my mind turned to the
matter of equipping ourselves with bows and arrows
which would enable us to secure game protect our-
selves quite effectively and hoard the cartridges which
might be far more valuable later on

  very soon the fire was blazing and as the flames lit
up the shadowy forest and the pungent smoke drifted
upward through the trees we soon discovered that we
had created a most unpleasant situation for ourselves
from every side insects came winging towards us
attracted by the light myriads of gnats and midges
the size of bumble-bees swarmed about tumbling into
the flames blundering with seared wings over the
ground and upon ourselves crawling over us and mak-
ing life miserable great crane-flies with yard-long
attenuated legs and flimsy wings flitted through the
smoke and dropped crippled and injured about us
moths of every imaginable size and color from tiny
things no larger than our own millers to great
eagle-like sphingidae and bombycids as big as alba-
trosses dashed back and forth on whirring pinions
that blew the fire about and drove the smoke in our
faces while humming clumsy armor-clad cockchafers
longicorns and other beetles dove blindly at the light
dodging the larger things brushing the smaller from
our persons and kicking aside the cripples that seemed
bent on wandering over us we managed to stick it
out until the hare was broiled then we retreated
to the shadows and with our backs against a tree
proceeded to dine off the half-burned half-cooked meat
but even then we were not to be left in peace

no sooner did we commence to eat than scores of
insects -swarmed about us attracted by the odor
of the meat mainly they were coleoptera and neurop-
tera hard shelled beetles representing several fami-
lies and genera were numerous and among them i
recognized some familiar forms there were many of
the tumble-dung groups a number very similar to our
lady birds or lady-bugs as they are popularly called
some shimmering iridescent chaps gleaming like bur-
nished metal and a few magnificent purple and gold
buprestids

  all of course were far larger than anything in other
lands and the same was the case with the disgusting
looking cockroaches the big brown crickets and one
or two stupendous green katydids but none of these
were as troublesome as the caddis-flies which swarmed
about frail phantom-like things that were constantly
completing their brief lives and were dropping dead
upon us and our food they were even more of a
nuisance than the buzzing gnats and flies which seemed
determined to share our meal many of these were
no larger than normal insects and glancing towards
the dying fire i was surprised to see myriads of tiny
minute forms of insect life attracted by the light of
the smouldering coals how far i wondered did this
diminution in size extend

  were there actually microscopic insects in this land
i remembered the old jingle about fleas having little
fleas to bite them and a somewhat surprising idea


amazing stories quarterly

occurred to me did the same conditions exist in other
lands were there actually forms of insect life as
much smaller than the common sphinx moths as these
minute things i was watching were smaller than the
six-foot moths darting through the air about me so
small were many of the midges and flies that they ap-
peared like motes of dust in the firelight and if species
existed in other lands as small in proportion they
would be wholly invisible to the unaided eye-perhaps
invisible-even through a powerful lens of a micro-
scope it was a fascinating thought and i wondered
it had never occurred to me before by now it was
black dark in the forest and among the trees fire-
flies made their appearance but such fire-flies in
the tropics the big fire-flies or rather fire-beetles be-
longing to the elater or snapping-beetle group are fa-
mous for the brilliance of the steady luminosity of
their thoracic spots and the abdominal segments often
in the past i had kept a phial containing one or two
of these fellows to enable me to discern the hands of
my watch by their light during the night and here
were light-giving elaters hundreds of times the size
of any known tropical species their twin thoracic
spots gleamed like the headlights of a motor car and
fairly dazzled our eyes when they came winging to-
wards us the greenish luminescence of their abdo-
mens illuminated the earth beneath them as they
crawled along or winged among the trees as though
they carried concealed arc-lights as hundreds of the
creatures appeared and flew aimlessly about trees
earth branches and every object in the forest became
outlined in a soft radiance as bright as moonlight
very fortunately for us there appeared to be no biting
insects and the absence of these i attributed to the
scarcity of vertebrates but whatever the reason we
neither saw nor heard mosquitoes the gnats and
midges though insistent and a nuisance did not offer
to test the quality of our blood and as there seemed
to be no other solution of the problem we decided to
sleep where we were to be sure there was no little
danger in doing so a wandering hungry ant might
find us and make short work of us and i shivered
as i thought of the possibility of their being army-
ants in the country i had witnessed many demon-
strations of the voracity and destructiveness of these
insects of the ordinary army-ants which march through
the tropical forests in countless millions their armies
often hundreds of yards in width and extending in
dense formation for miles and which march on irre-
sistibly killing and devouring every living thing in their
pathway i had seen houses invaded by these ferocious
highly organized perfectly trained insect soldiers who
had passed on leaving nothing behind them but the
bones of dogs and cats and not a living insect or exist-
ing vermin and i had known of more than one in-
stance of human beings having been surrounded over-
come and devoured by the army-ants in this land of
giant insect forms if army-ants existed what monsters
they must be in my minds eye i could picture them-
six perhaps even ten feet in length-judging from
the size of the leaf-carrying ants we had seen-sweep-
ing across the land in a vast all-devastating army and
coming upon us as we slumbered and the thought
was far from reassuring or pleasant there was also
the danger of some prowling beast of whose existence
we were ignorant falling upon us

  but there was nothing else to be done and we
had beheld so many amazing things during the day
and the previous night and had become so accustomed
to being terrified by real dangers that the idea of
passing a night in the forest did not greatly frighten
us i deemed it wise however to have one of us re-

main awake while the other slept and although i
doubted his ability to keep his eyes open for long tom
offered to take the first watch handing him my re-
volver and cautioning him not to use it except as an
ultimate resort and telling him to arouse me at the
first sign or sound of danger or if anything unusual
occurred i curled myself up in a moss-covered space
between two tree-roots and fell instantly asleep sev-
eral times i woke with a start thinking some huge
beast had stepped upon me only to find it was some
wandering beetle clambering over my recumbent body
at last i came to my senses with a start with the
feeling that i had overslept and wondering why tom
had not called me but as i rubbed my eyes and
gazed about i broke into laughter it was broad day-
light and tom was snoring lustily doubled up where
he sat he had been utterly oblivious of his surround-
ings throughout the night and yet nothing had hap-
pened we were still safe and sound and i felt quite
confident that we had little to fear in case we were
forced to spend another night under the open sky but
i had no intention of doing this before the sun set
on us again we would have some provision made for
sleeping safely and securely as well as comfortably

  if we ran no danger of being attacked by the liv-
ing denizens of the land there were other very grave
risks from the dampness miasma and chilly air even
now in the forest it was cold and my hands felt
numb and my teeth chattered as i hastily gathered
firewood and started a cheery blaze this brought to
my mind another matter of importance to be attended
to i possessed but one box of matches and tom who
was not a smoker had none i must discover some
other means of kindling fire without delay there
might be flint or stone of some-sort which would serve
with the aid of my hunting-knife and proper tinder or
again i might be able to rig up a bow-drill with
which to ignite punk the thought of a bow-drill
brought back my decision of the previous afternoon
to fashion bows and arrows this i knew would be
a rather difficult problem and i mentioned it to tom
as i thought he might know more of the properties
of tropical woods than i it was fortunate that i
did so for he solved the problem instanter by sug-
gesting that we return to the spot where the two
panos had been killed and secure their bows and
arrows

our breakfast was very meagre and consisted of a
few fruits we were lucky enough to find but soon
after we started off in the direction which i assumed
would carry us to the scene of the indians deaths we
surprised a huge land-frog dozing in a clump of
palmettos tom gazed at him quizzically a few mo-
ments and then picking up a hefty club grinned as
he cautiously approached the fifty-pound batrachian
seem to me chief he observed he mighty like a
crapaud in he aspecs yes chief he certy possess
tha same look an ah been goin to astain is he as
fit fo to eat as they

  reaching the side of the still unconscious frog he
dealt the creature a terrific blow on the head and
the batrachian collapsed without a sound as tom had
said there was no reason why the huge frog should not
be edible in fact most palatable for the big west
indian land frog or crapaud is a highly prized deli-
cacy and is most delicious i judged that this immense
fellow belonged to the same genus-even unobservant
tom had noticed the resemblance-but i was also aware
that two species of the same genera may vary greatly
in their edible qualities however tom had not been
mistaken one of the frogs legs was soon broiling
the world of the giant ants



over a fire and the flesh proved as white as tender
and as savory as the most fastidious could wish one
hind leg was ample for our meal for it was twice the
size of a turkeys leg and having cooked the other
leg and the thick white loins tom wrapped these in
fresh green leaves tied them with flexible vines and
slung them over his shoulders we had enough food
on hand for the rest of the day and more and feeling
fresh and strong after our feast we proceeded on our
way towards the scene of the recent tragedy for-
tunately i possess a very highly developed sense of
direction and within an hour or two we began to
recognize familiar landmarks but to travel in the
general direction of some spot and to locate a certain
small point in that direction are two very different
matters moreover in our flight from the savages
we had raced blindly towards the tunnel entfynce and
had taken no heed of surroundings also we had been led
as captives along a trail that passed far from the
scene of the panos end hence it was a long and ap-
parently hopeless task searching for the bodies of the
indians when after weary hours of retracing our
way-as nearly as was possible-from the tunnel en-
trance to the jungle and back again we at last found
the spot which i felt certain was where the black savage
had fought with the panos we could find no trace of
either dead bodies or skeletons that we were not mis-
taken in the locality was certain the earth showed
the imprints of our shoes and of bare feet the plants
were wilted and drooping where they had been crushed
and broken by the struggling men and if any doubt
had remained in our minds they would have been dis-
sipated when tom picked up an empty pistol cartridge
and a short search revealed others one thing puzzled
me quite an extensive area was bare of living plants
and appeared to have been recently dug was it pos-
sible i wondered that the black savages had buried
the bodies of their fellow and of the indians i could
scarcely believe that such primitive degenerate beings
would bother to do this but there seemed no other
explanation of the recently turned earth and the
absence of corpses if they had done so no doubt
they had also taken possession of the indians weapons
i was about to give up in despair and was roundly
berating our ill-luck when tom uttered an exclamation
and pushing his way into a clump of wilted vegetation
drew out a bow a moment later we had secured the
other bow and five of the eight arrows then as we
were diligently searching for the balance of the wea-
pons i noticed a bit of smooth straight cane pro-
truding from the freshly turned earth

  recognizing it as the end of an arrow-shaft i seized
it and tugged at it it seemed rather firmly embedded
and as with a final pull it moved i staggered back
momentarily horrified about it the loose earth had
come away and had exposed the partly decomposed
shoulder of the black savage i had killed three days
previously and as i dropped the broken arrow and
drew hastily back the earth about the swollen black
flesh began to move and heave as if the body were
coming to life it was a horrifying ghastly sight and
hardly knowing what to expect i gazed fascinated at
the spot the next instant a clod of earth fell away
and a huge black and red beetle emerged instantly
i recognized the creature and knew why and by whom
the bodies had been interred it was a carrion or
burying-beetle a vastly enlarged edition of the com-
mon burying-beetles with which i was familiar like
those it and probably a number of its fellows work-
ing in unison had dug away the earth under the bodies
until they had dropped into the excavations and had
then covered them with soil to provide a food supply

for their larvaj when they emerged from the eggs de-
posited beside the decomposing flesh it was all so
ghastly so goulish and so repulsive that i shuddered
and abandoning all thoughts of searching for the other
arrows i called to tom and we beat a hasty retreat
from the vicinity

but we had accomplished our purpose we each
possessed a powerful bow and most efficient and
deadly arrows for i was well aware that the tips were
poisoned and that even a slight wound caused by the
weapons would produce death in a few moments tom
was quite as well aware of the deadly character of
the things as i was and he handled them most gin-
gerly but even so i felt that we ran a grave risk
in case we should stumble or by chance scratch our-
selves and i at once took steps to safeguard ourselves
by cutting some sections of hollow reeds and slipping
these as sheaths over the arrow-points

  neither of us had ever used bows and arrows and if
we were to secure game with them or intended to use
them to protect ourselves it was highly important that
we should test our skill or lack of skill and should
practice until we were proficient archers so setting
up a target of reeds tied together in a bundle as large
as a fair sized animal we spent the next few hours
shooting the arrows we made for practice or rather at
it knowing that any game we might meet or even
enemies would be at short range we confined our
efforts to a distance of thirty yards and much to my
surprise i found that we rapidly acquired proficiency
and were presently making hits at every shot

  quite satisfied with our progress and well tired and
hungry we dined off cold frogs leg the next step
was to endeavor to discover some sort of fire-making
apparatus in this i was successful and with toms
aid and suggestions for he had the primitive mans
knack of such matters i at last had the satisfaction
of creating a smouldering heap of dust by means of a
bow-drill and spindle in fact it took us longer to
find some highly inflammable tinder which would
spring into a blaze from contact with the spark than
it had required to ignite the material in the first
place at last satisfied that we could kindle fire
whenever we wished without sacrificing matches we
again set out this time heading towards the locality
where we had seen the aphids driven into the under-
ground passages i was still anxious to investigate
this matter farther but as we strolled along we did
not forget to keep our eyes and senses alert for some
camping place for the approaching night

  it would have been a fairly simple matter to have
erected a shed or lean-to-a benab as the indians call
such temporary structures-but the main question was
to provide beds or substitutes for i had no wish to
spend another night reposing on the damp earth tom
suggested hammocks and when i asked if he knew
how to weave a hammock and if he realized the length
of time necessary to do so he replied that he had
often used a sheet of flexible inner bark for the pur-
pose but our most diligent search failed to reveal
a single tree with bark adapted to hammock making
in fact it was late in the afternoon before a solution
of the problem occurred to us and then as is so often
the case the solution was thrust upon us and was in
no manner due to our own intelligence or inventive
abilities we had seen several huge spiders webs
and i had half facetiously remarked that we might
make hammocks of spider silk when upon glancing at
a nearby sapling i noticed several oblong grayish
objects hanging from the branches for a moment i
rather vaguely wondered what they were and with the

investigative tendency which has led me into innumer-
able successes and misfortunes-including my present
predicament-i stepped closer to examine them as
i had half-expected i discovered they were the cocoons
of some bombycid moths or as they are more com-
monly known moths of the silk-worm group in nearly
all countries the moths of this family are among the
largest of insects in the united states for example
the cecropia is our largest lepidoptem spreading over
six inches in the east indies the atlas moth attains
the largest dimensions of all living lepidoptera-aside
from the moths in this strange land of course-with a
wing spread of a foot or more and here i had already
observed giant bombycids with a wing expanse of over
ten feet which in proportion to the other huge insects
of the place was rather small if anything the cocoons
much resembled those of the atlas moth or rather 
more those of the ailanthus silk worm of the orient
which has been introduced into the united states like
these they were pendant being attached to the branch
from which they hung by stout silken strands and
like them they were gracefully tapered from the thick
central portion to the two extremities the cocoon of
the atlas moth is about five to six inches in length
by over one inch in diameter and hence the size of
the cocoons before me was not greatly surprising
they were in fact about nine feet in length by two
feet in diameter or approximately twenty times the
size of the average atlas cocoons

  for a moment i stood admiring the beautiful texture
of the silk of which they were composed and the in-
tricate manner in which it was woven then i uttered
a triumphant shout that brought tom to my side on
the run here ready made for us were ideal ham-
mocks silken couches such as no other human beings
had ever possessed

  tom grinned from ear to ear as i explained mat-
ters and armed with my hunting-knife he climbed up
the smooth stem as he had many a time climbed coco-
nut palms but it was a far more difficult matter to
cut down the big cocoons than to dislodge a bunch of
coconuts the silk was tough and elastic and the
hunting-knife was not the best of tools for cutting
through it but tom was strong and persevering
and presently the first cocoon came tumbling down
the next soon followed and tired and exhausted tom
descended

  from the resounding thuds with which the things
had struck the earth i knew that they contained liv-
ing pupae or chrysalids but as it would be necessary
to cut the cocoons open in order to use them the pres-
ence of the pupae did not trouble me tom having done
his share i straddled a cocoon being rather more
familiar with their construction than tom i readily
found the loosely-woven aperture at one end inserted
my knife-blade and ripped the thing from end to
end then calling tom to help me we stripped off
the thick tough outer envelope and revealed the thin
papery structure containing the dormant chrysalis with-
in rolling the latter to one side we trimmed away
the edges of the cocoon and presently were in posses-
sion of a strong light and most perfect hammock of
spun silk slung by its own silken strands between
two trees it proved most comfortable and luxurious
before sundown the second hammock was ready well
satisfied but tired with our unwonted labors we dined
on cold frog slaked our thirst at a nearby brook and
flung our weary bodies into the hammocks so provi-
dentially supplied by nature

chapter vi

we were not disturbed during the night and as
we had no fire the insects did not bother us
much having breakfasted we folded up our
hammocks slung them like packs on our backs and
went on our way peering into the thickets in search
of game as we proceeded we followed along near the
edge of the forest with the dense jungle on our right
there was a fair-sized brook here and anxious to
learn if it contained fish we crept to an overhanging
spot on the bank and gazed down at a clear calm pool
below presently from the dark shadows a large fish
moved slowly into sight but we had no fishing tackle
and i was about to withdraw regretfully when i re-
membered how the indians secure fish by shooting
them with arrows although i was only a beginner
with these primitive weapons i decided to try my hand
at the game

  unsheathing an arrow i fitted it to my bow and
rose as slowly and quietly as possible at my first
movement the fish darted out of sight but he was
either bold or hungry and soon reappeared he re-
mained far below the surface however and i knew
that to attempt to get him at that depth would be
futile tom however was resourceful and unwrap-
ping the last remnants of our food he cut off a few
tiny shreds of meat and tossed them onto the water
instantly the fish rose to the bait and as he did so
i discharged my missile i could scarcely have missed
the fish was within five feet of my poised arrow and
i distinctly saw it strike him just back of the gills
but to my amazement the point failed to penetrate
his body and as the fish darted off the arrow floated
harmlessly upon the surface of the pool

  tom was as puzzled as i was and insisted the fish
must be obeah or a jumbie to have resisted the
arrow but i knew there must be some good reason
for the seeming miracle and i became more than
ever anxious to secure the denizen of the pool and to
learn the explanation without fish hooks without a
net this seemed a hopeless desire however until tom
again proved his resourcefulness

  searching through his pockets which invariably con-
tained as miscellaneous an assortment of odds and ends
as the pockets of the proverbial small boy he pro-
duced a large wire nail by means of stones and my
hunting-knife and at the expense of bruised fingers
he at last succeeded in bending this into hook-like
form unstringing his bow he attached the crude
hook to the string and having baited it with a bit
of frogs meat he stretched himself full length on
the bank and dangled his improvised fishing-tackle in
the pool the fish which had never before seen a
hook or a line and was therefore wholly unsuspicious
lost no time with a rush he seized the baited hook
and the next instant was flapping upon the grass at
my feet instantly i knew why my arrow had failed
to injure him he was a ganoid fish one of those
strange hold-overs from prehistoric days which like
the sturgeons and a few other species wear a coat
of bony armor on the skin in place of scales i had
seen similar species in the rivers of guiana and as
i examined his gleaming coat of mail his exterior
skeleton in fact i no longer wondered that my arrow
had been turned aside but despite his peculiarities
he proved excellent eating and we lunched sumptu-
ously that day having thus provided for our mid-
day meal we again resumed our tramp we had by
this time become so accustomed to the magnified forms
of insect life that we gave little attention to them
except now and then when some new or most unusual
the world of the giant ants



i felt sick with fear as visions of becoming the victim of the loathsome thing swept through my mind and frantically

i leaped aside screaming as i did so

creature attracted us and having so far been un-
molested and having encountered nothing dangerous-
with the exception of the hornet on the first day-
we became rather careless and thereby came very near
meeting a most horrible end we were crossing a
small open space in the forest when a dark shadow
fell across our path glancing quickly up i was
terrified to see a huge fearsome-looking creature
swooping like a hawk upon us at my first glimpse
i had mistaken it for another giant hornet its huge
eyes had the same ferocious expression it possessed
the same broad transparent powerful wings its ex-
tended clawed feet were similar and its deep-orange
and blue thorax slender waist and tapering abdomen
were hornet-like but the powerful sharp-edged bit-
ing jaws of the hornet were missing and in place of
the dagger-like sting of the hornet there was a long
horny appendage as with a sharp startled yell i
leaped to one side tom following i realized the
nature of the malignant thing it was a gigantic
ichneumon-fly an insect even more terrible and re-
pulsive in its habits than the predatory hornet

  the hornet may sting its victims into a coma and
place them within its nest to be devoured alive by its
young but the ichneumon reverses the process
swooping upon some caterpillar or other insect it
clings fast to the struggling creature and deliberately
deposits its eggs under the unfortunate victims skin
in due time the eggs hatch the young ichneumons
devour the tissues of the living body within which they
find themselves and the doomed creature with the
hungry maggots within him continues to live to eat

and to suffer untold agonies as the parasites gnaw
at his vitals until they have attained their full growth
then transforming to chrysalids they leave the
shrunken almost devoured creature to die a lingering
death and eventually emerge from his carcass as full
grown ichneumons all this flashed through my mind
as i dodged the swooping creature and escaped it by a
hairs breadth for a brief instant i had thought that
perhaps the ichneumon was attacking us in error that
it had mistaken us for larvaa or some other natural
prey and that finding itself mistaken it would draw
off and continue on its way

  but hope died in my heart as baffled the ichneumon
checked its swift descent and with amazing speed
turned and dashed at me i felt sick with fear as
visions of becoming the victim of the loathsome awful
thing swept through my mind and frantically i leaped
aside screaming as i did so but for a man to
dodge a winged insect is a difficult and hopeless under-
taking as anyone who has ever disturbed a hornets
nest or a bee-hive is aware and to seek safety in
flight was i knew suicidal the ichneumon could
move ten feet to my one and the instant i took to
my heels it would be upon my unprotected back i
shuddered at thought of feeling those grasping claws
upon my body of feeling the sharp stabbing pain as
the creatures ovipositor penetrated my flesh and de-
posited an egg in my quivering tissues all this of
course occurred in an instant the enraged insect
was swooping at me again and in a few moments
more would have fastened its claws upon me had it
not been for tom he poor fellow was as terrified

as myself although he had no knowledge of the crea-
tures habits and the awful fate in store for him if
the ichneumon accomplished its purpose as i dashed
and dodged about and tom came within the insects range
of vision the creature became confused and suddenly
abandoning its attack on me it hurled itself at tom
luckily for him he reached the shelter of a tree in
the nick of time and the insect unable to check its
rush or to turn in time bumped against the opposite
side of the tree trunk for the fraction of a second
it clung there apparently a bit dazed and stunned
but that fraction of a second was enough with a
rush my presence of mind returned to me whipping
out my pistol i sprang close to the momentarily
quiescent insect and fired two shots in rapid succes-
sion into its thorax acrid ill-smelling juice oozed
from the bullet holes the great wings quivered the 
hooked claws slowly relaxed and still alive but in-
capable of flight or action the terrible thing dropped
to tho earth and as with fiendish hate we beat it
to a pulp with sticks and stones i thanked heaven
that i had retained my pistol and my ammunition

so shaken and unnerved were we from this awful
experience that we were quite unable to walk or
even stand and for an hour or more we sat there
pale nervous and trembling but the attack of the
ichneumon had taught us a lesson it had proved
that we were surrounded by dangers at every step
that at any instant we were liable to be attacked
from some unexpected quarter and by some unsus-
pected creature and that if we were to survive for long
we must be constantly on the alert the least careless-
ness might result in our deaths or worse

  hence when we started forward once more we pro-
ceeded with the utmost caution and it was well that we
did suddenly from the dense growth of canes at the
edge of the jungle came the sounds of some immense
creature rushing towards us the canes swayed
crashed snapped and were crunched underfoot as
though a herd of elephants were approaching at break-
neck speed not knowing what terrible thing might
appear what gigantic creature might be about to at-
tack us we rushed for shelter and cowered trembling
behind a huge tree the next instant the canes parted
nothing had prepared us for the thing that burst
upon our astounded eyes it was a monster a verit-
able dragon fully fifty feet in length and the exact
counterpart of the carvings i had seen at tupec
with incredible speed it rushed from the canebrake
leaped across an immense fallen tree raced through
the forest and vanished in the distance never have
i seen any living creature move with such agility and
rapidity on four feet it appeared sped past us and
vanished all in one flashing movement but brief as
had been its appearance i had obtained a fairly good
view of the creature its scaly body that gleamed like
metal was vivid green from the tip of its big blunt
snout to the end of its immensely long tail its stout
powerful legs ended in long-toed feet armed with great
recurved claws a foot in length beneath its throat
hung a great fold of loose skin or a dewlap from
the back of its broad scaly head rose a crown or crest
of serrated upright plates of blue and along the
entire length of its back and tail extended a row of
upstanding thin scales two feet or more in height
despite its gigantic proportions and its dragon-like
appearance i knew that it was merely a super-lizard
of the iguana group and unless varying vastly in
habits from all its fellow species a most omnivorous
beast ready to devour anything of vegetable or animal
nature that came its way although it was by prefer-

ance a vegetarian obviously it had not been after
us and had probably not seen us but i trembled to
think of what would have happened had we been in
its way and had been trampled under the feet of the
hurrying monster i realized also how powerless we
would be to protect ourselves from such a beast for
my pistol and our arrows would prove as ineffective
against his scale protected hide as against an ele-
phant tom of course was once more quaking with
terror and clung close to my side as we hurriedly
left the spot and moved directly away from the area
wherein the huge lizard had vanished it was evi-
dent that giant insects were by no means the only
denizens of the place which we had to fear and guard
against if iguanas reached such giant proportions
there was no reason to believe that other reptiles
would not attain an equally great size what i won-
dered would a snake be like what if we stumbled
upon some deadly serpent-upon a bush-master or even
a rattlesnake equally overgrown bush-masters in the
tropics attain a length of eight or nine feet-larger
by far than any ordinary iguana-and hence these
most deadly of snakes might be expected to be fully
one hundred feet in length if they existed here and
a boa or anaconda eighteen to twenty-five feet in
length is not unusual for these under normal condi-
tions and here they might easily grow to a length of
two hundred feet if developed in equal ratio to the
iguana and the batrachians these were disconcert-
ing thoughts and the only comfort was that such
things might not exist and that judging from our
experiences so far they must be scarce if they did
exist and after all i thought a boa or anaconda
one hundred feet long or more would probably take
no more notice of a puny man six feet in height than
an ordinary boa of twenty feet would give to a hum-
ming bird or a squirrel moreover all the big snakes
are very sluggish and such gigantic serpents as i was
imagining would not in all probability be capable
of rapid movement and could readily be avoided no
snakes if they existed and were of immense propor-
tions would not be nearly as dangerous as the livelier
more active and voracious creatures such as lizards
and especially the carnivorous solopendras then i
chuckled i had been disturbing myself working my-
self into a nervous state by imagining utterly im-
possible perils how could there be huge snakes when
there was nothing for them to eat all the mammals
we had seen were tiny things not enough to supply
a meal for even an insignificant snake and i could
not imagine a boa depending upon insects for its sus-
tenance so dismissing all further thoughts of giant
serpents i passed the time as we tramped along
mentally reviewing more reasonable possibilities and
now and again stopping to examine some particularly
interesting form of insect life one thing struck me
forcibly though it had not before attracted my at-
tention there were no birds not a chirp trill
nor song of a bird had i heard since i had entered
the place to be sure amid such a chorus of insect
noises as came incessantly from tree-tops and under-
brush it would be difficult to distinguish a birds note
but in all our wanderings we had not caught a glimpse
of a feathered creature if birds were non-existent it
was small wonder that insects teemed and i reasoned
that in all probability the absence of birds was one
of the principal reasons why- the insects had developed
to such proportions from an ornithological viewpoint
i rather regretted the lack of bird life what astonish-
ing things they would be if they occurred here i
let my imagination run wild and tried to visualize
brilliantly-hued warblers and tanagers as large as
the world of the giant ants



eagles partridges as big as ostriches hawks the equals
of sinbads rok and humming-birds the size of
pheasants but on the other hand our own dangers
would have been enormously increased a hawk an
eagle even a crow or a crane would have been an
ugly customer if built on the same proportionate
scale as the insects and reptiles and i thanked our
lucky stars that birds of prey did not occur here
meanwhile we had left the denser parts of the forest
behind and presently emerged at the edge of an open
space which to my surprise i recognized as the spot
whereon was the home of the black savages to be
sure we had reached it by a different route from the
one we had followed the first day but it was unmis-
takable for in the distance was the mound with its
wall of stones and even from where we stood i could
distinguish the moving figures of the beings nearer
at hand was a smaller hill and beyond this and per-
haps a quarter of a mile from it was a broad expanse
of green which i recognized as the orchard or grove
wherein i had first seen the aphid-cattle a few mo-
ments study enabled me to locate the spot where i
had seen the aphids driven into the underground pass-
ages and still anxious to learn more of this interest-
ing incident i hurried across the plain with tom at
my heels

we were just in time as we neared the place
several aphids came lumbering forth from the
entrances in the mound and knowing our appearance
would alarm them i dropped behind a boulder with
tom beside me one after another the grotesque
overgrown insects emerged to be followed at last by
a black herder who rounding up his charges com-
menced driving them in the direction of the grove
determined to reach the subterranean chambers before
the rest of the aphids came forth i sprang up and
hurried forward sounds from within assured me the
occupants were still there and quite forgetting our
danger i entered the nearest aperture the place
smelt abominably it was worse than any cow-shed
or stable for mingled with the stench of dung and
the sharp pungent odor of the blacks was that sickly
sweet smell i have mentioned as being so nauseating
in the burrows of the savages tom coughed and
choked and i felt suffocated but my scientific ardor
was aroused and i hurried on as i had conjectured
the place was dark as pitch but presently i saw a
glimmer of light ahead and turned into a side passage
from the direction of the light came the sounds i
had heard low grumbling noises the soft squashy
sounds of moving heavy feet and a strange swishing
noise the next moment we came to the entrance of
a large chamber faintly illuminated by a shaft from
above and i halted dumbfounded the place was
divided into two or three sections by mud walls and
was crowded with the aphids and moving about
among them were a dozen or more of the black sav-
ages actually engaged in milking their insect-cows it
is a well known fact that many species of our com-
mon ants not only make use of aphids as we use cows
and even watch over and tend their plant-lice herds
but in addition build underground stables or shelters
in which they keep the aphids during cold or inclement
weather but to come suddenly upon such things to
unexpectedly find aphid-cattle in their subterranean
shelters to actually enter these and see aphids as
large as real cows and to watch these being milked
by human beings instead of by ants was astonishing
and the manner in which the blacks obtained the
milk-if milk it can be called-was most interesting
ants i knew stroke the aphids with their feet in

order to induce them to exude the desired honey-
dew as it is called and it has always been assumed
-and accepted as fact-by scientists that the stroking
produces a pleasurable sensation upon the nerves of
the aphids and that this causes them to produce their
sweet excretion but the savages before me were beat-
ing and lashing their charges with switches and sticks
in anything but a gentle or pleasurable manner and
at each stroke the aphids grunting and protesting
but unable to move because they were securely teth-
ered fore and aft were exuding the thick greenish-
yellow fluid

  obviously it was pain rather than pleasure which
caused the aphids to give up their secretion and i
was instantly convinced that it was the irritation of
the ants claws and no pleasurable stroking that caused
our ordinary aphids to produce honey-dew for the
ants delectation surprising and interesting as was
this discovery even more amazing was the manner in
which the blacks were gathering the honey-dew
beside each aphid under treatment there squatted a
hideous black and as the viscid material dripped from
the appendages of the aphid above him he would
catch the fluid in his great toothless mouth when at
last his mouth could hold no more he would close his
lips scurry to a large trough-like affair of clay and
empty the contents of his mouth into it each black
was in fact a living milk-pail and as tom watched
the process and it dawned upon him that it was this
substance which he had swallowed on the first night
among the savages-and that it had unquestionably
been prepared in the same manner he uttered a dis-
gusted and far from elegant exclamation at the
sound of his voice the occupants of the cow-pen be-
came panic-stricken catching sight of us they
dropped their sticks and switches and huddled among
the cattle while those who had been catching the milk
hurriedly emptied their mouths by the simple expe-
dient of swallowing the contents and scurried like
rats between the legs of their aphids who also alarmed
milled and struggled and snorted crushing their mas-
ters and trampling upon them whether the unfortu-
nate savages were badly injured or killed or not or
how the disturbance was finally quelled and affairs
straightened out i cannot say regretting that we
had been the cause of all the trouble and having seen
enough i hurried from the place how or where we
lost our way i cannot say but it was soon evident
to both tom and me that we were not moving towards
the opening whence we had entered

  in vain we attempted to retrace our steps over
and over again we stopped and listened hoping to
hear the sounds that would lead us back to the scene
we had just left and over and over again when
we heard the sounds and at last reached the spot
whence they emanated we discovered it was a different
chamber presently in the dim light ahead we saw
the form of a scurrying savage and feeling sure that
eventually he would enter some passage whence we
could reach the outer air we dashed after him the
next moment he vanished and coming to an abrupt
halt we found ourselves at the entrance of a large
room the contents of which caused me to rub my
eyes and stare incredulously everywhere over the
floor swarmed immature savages i cannot call them
babies or infants for they were such unspeakably hor-
ribly repulsive and hideous things that they deserve
only to be called lame they were a sickly livid-gray
in color almost shapeless with stubby pulpy limbs and
faces which seemed all mouth and eyes apparently
too they were all of approximately the same age
and when we first saw them they were in charge of


amazing stories quarterly

several undersized blacks who i surmised were females
but who seemed to scent our presence and almost in-
stantly vanished i had no mind to enter the stink-
ing place nor to make a closer inspection of the
infantile stages of the beings but the next chamber
we saw was if anything worse here again were
countless of the young but these were much larger
they were more active and the manner in which the
horrid things crawled squirmed and wallowed in their
own filth and over one another was disgustingly like
a mass of maggots another and another chamber
was passed each containing its quota of young and
each lot being apparently older and more advanced than
the preceding everywhere too the sweetish fetid
odor of the aphids milk was overpowering and i
noticed in my hurried glances into the nurseries that
the young savages were being fed on this substance

  even in my disgust and hurry to get away from the
place i could not help wondering what became of
such an innumerable supply of young savages no
doubt the percentage of infantile fatalities was very
high but even if a tenth of the young reached adult
size the whole country would i thought be overrun
with the savages in a few years and yet there did
not appear to be a great number of the blacks and
they were restricted to the vicinity of their homes

  evidently all young were reared in unison and
all identity to parentage was lost indeed it was
probable i thought that even the mothers were
ignorant of the parentage of their offspring for i
could not imagine such degenerate creatures having
either morals or marriages of any sort they were
in fact scarcely a step above the brutes scarcely
above the insects and once more their amazingly ant-
like characters and habits struck me forcibly the
way they herded the aphids the extensive use of the
honey-dew the manner in which the young were cared
for even the appearance of the grub-like young were
all more ant-like than human was it possible i
wondered that they had developed such habits and
characters through watching ants but all conjectures
and speculations were forgotten when a moment later
we saw bright light ahead and emerged from the
passage into the open air

chapter vii

from the summit of the mound which marked the
entrance to the savages homes we had a very
good view of the surrounding country i had not
of course noticed this before for we had left the spot
before it was fairly daylight and the mountains and
forests had been shrouded in mist but now we
could see across the wide areas of jungle and forest
across plains valleys and hills and had an unob-
structed view of a large portion of the surrounding
mountains now i understood a matter which had
puzzled me i had often wondered how the savages
had first happened to see us not since that first
day had i seen any of the blacks in the jungle or
forest and yet the indians had been attacked and we
had been captured several miles from the area to
which the savages appeared to confine their activities
but i could readily see that from their mound they
had spied us as we entered the place and had deliber-
ately gone after us to me however the terrain of
the ranges was of far greater interest and importance
than anything else and i studied them carefully
searching for a spot which might offer a pass or
opening they were mostly rugged sheer cliffs un-
questionably of volcanic structure and hence i knew
liable to be much broken and cut with fissures canyons
and ravines moreover they did not appear to be as

high as i had first estimated them assuming that
the lowest limit of perpetual snow was approximately
eighteen thousand feet above the sea i judged from
the extent of gleaming ice that crowned the summits
that the highest peaks were not over twenty or twenty-
one thousand feet above the surface of this place but
as no such lofty mountains had ever been reported
from the surrounding country-the highest known
being the pakina range not exceeding fourteen thou-
sand feet above the continental surface as any such
peaks would be visible for hundreds of miles i felt
sure that the surface of the land in this strange terri-
tory must be about six thousand feet below the sur-
face of the country beyond the mountains but unless
i could discover a pass it mattered little to us whether
the mountains were twenty or fifty thousand feet in
height to scale a range twenty thousand feet high
and with several thousand feet of their summits en-
tirely covered with glaciers and frozen snow and with
a temperature below zero was i knew an impossible
feat but some ten or twelve miles beyond where we
stood almost in a direct line with a distinctive three-
peaked mountain i could distinguish a deep purple
shadow which might indicate a canon it seemed the
most promising spot to explore and so leaving the
savages mound we turned our steps towards the moun-
tains fortunately as it seemed at the time our
route led along the edge of the cleared land where it
bordered on the forest here it was far easier walk-
ing than in the forest or jungle there was less dan-
ger of being surprised by dangerous creatures and it
was less damp and oppressive for the sun had dis-
sipated the miasmic mists and vapors here in the
open

soon too we reached the aphid orchard and found
it delightfully cool in the shade of the orderly
arranged broad-topped bushes from twelve to sixteen
feet or more above our heads the branches were inter-
laced to form an almost continuous roof of vegetation
while underfoot the earth had been packed down until
firm and smooth by countless herds of aphids pass-
ing over it several times we saw black herders
dozing in the shade while their cattle grazed con-
tentedly in the branches above them some were
sound asleep and were quite unaware of our proximity
while others who were awake hurriedly sought refuge
in the bush-tops as soon as they saw us approaching
glancing up at these i noticed in several places that
rude structures of interlaced twigs and leaves had
been constructed where large limbs forked from the
main stems at first i thought them arboreal homes
of the savages but presently i realized that their true
purpose was to serve as shelters for the aphids in
case of sudden showers here again the savages ex-
hibited most amazingly ant-like habits for i was
quite familiar with the aphid-sheds or shelters erected
by many of our commonest ants and in which their
tiny plant-lice cattle are protected from the weather
ofie discovery often leads to another and as i moved
about the better to observe the sheds i noticed sev-
eral odd creatures among the aphids they were most
grotesque and weird-looking things they were slightly
larger than the aphids but were far less clumsy and
bulky with slenderer bodies longer thinner legs and
brighter more intelligent eyes in fact as they
peered down at us their expression was so droll and
quizzical that both tom and myself laughed gaily at
them their forms and colors were however their
most astonishing features all appeared monstrosities
some were humpbacked others were broad and flat-
tened some had projecting rhinoceros-like horns on
the world of the giant ants



their heads and several were armed with wide-
spreading horns that would have been a credit to a
texas steer some were brown some green some
mottled with yellow and black and a number were
most gaily marked with diagonal stripes of intense
rose and vivid green although i should have recog-
nized them at a glance yet they were so huge so exag-
gerated in all their details that it was not until one
of them leaped abruptly from its perch and sailed
through the air for fully fifty feet before it alighted
on another limb that it dawned upon me that they
were ieaf-hoppers hemiptera closely related to the
aphids but in their appearance their actions and
their agility they no more resembled the heavy slow-
moving bovine aphids than a deer resembles a cow
even as i watched them interesting events were trans-
piring over my head scarcely had the giant leaf-
hopper made his astonishing jump through space when
a black savage materialized from somewhere among
the leaves and grimacing down at us as though
thoroughly out of patience at our presence he ran
scrambling and swinging from branch to branch in
the direction of the grotesque creature every moment
i expected to see the leaf-hopper leap again as the
black approached him for i well knew how wary
these insects are and how exasperating it is to attempt
to capture one of our ordinary species

  i was therefore greatly surprised to see the black
follow and reach the side of the creature straddle
its hard back and deliver resounding blows with a
short club upon its savage-looking horns for a mo-
ment the leaf-hopper shook its head menacingly backed
around the stem to which it clung and squatted down
as if determined to remain there indefinitely but as
the blows still continued to fall it thought better of
the matter gathered itself together and before our
astounded eyes it leaped back towards the bush whence
it had come thereupon the savage dismounted re-
tired to the shelter of his leafy retreat and the leaf-
hopper burying its proboscis in the soft bark re-
sumed its interrupted feeding here then was still
another ant trick the blacks had domesticated the
leaf-hoppers as well as the aphids for the sake of
their honey-dew truly indeed they must literally
have followed the time-honored advice of go to the
ant thou sluggard

  to me accustomed as i was to the marvelous habits
of insects and the wonders of their every-day lives
the insects of this place had been a revelation and
i was being continually amazed at observations and
discoveries i made but to tom who never before
had dreamed that such things existed the most ordi-
nary habits of the insects thus revealed by their
immense size appeared to savor of the miraculous or
supernatural but even i could appreciate his feelings
when having watched the leaf-hoppers amazing jump
with its savage black rider he stood gazing open-
eyed and with sagging jaw and i thoroughly agreed
with him when as we resumed our way he shookl
his head dubiously and remarked ah ain never
seed nawthin in no circus tha equal chief lordy
but that mos surely was travelinl

  then as a sudden idea came to his somewhat child-
ish mind he halted in his tracks and exclaimed fo
tha lod chief dont it been possible we kin cotch
some o them beass an ride em our own sels yes
sir chief theyd mos certnly move we over this
place mos expedently an can they keep on a-leapin
like that fo long theyd cay us clean crost that
mountings in scarce no time tall

  hmm i muttered wondering if after all there
might be anything in toms wild idea i dont be-

lieve we could catch them in the first place tom we
might steal one or two from those black rascals but i
very much doubt if we could control them guide
them or manage to do anything with them theyre
accustomed to their black savage owners and would
be frightened and wild if we went near them and i
dont know as i am very anxious to attempt to ride
one on such a jump it would be worse than riding
a bucking broncho

  tom sighed a bit regretfully yaas chief he
admitted as he moved on again ah spec you right
ah calclate as how theys like the coolie buffloes we has
in jamaica they mos humbuggin ugly beass an
dont stan no foolishness from white men or niggers
but they gentle like kitten wif tha coolies an any little
coolies boy or girl can ride he an driv he about any
place yaas chief an ah took notice some o them
beass been mos surely like them buffloes in aspecs
they got tha same hons an tha same hump on he
back but wa-la tank de good lord the buffloes
caint go a-leapin bout like dem folks

we reached our objective point without further adven-
ture and without encountering anything of particu-
lar note i was elated to find that as i had suspected there
was a deep ravine or canyon cutting into the mountain at
this point and promising a pass but we were doomed
to disappointment after long hours of laboriously
climbing over loose rocks toiling up the cliffs and al-
ways ascending we came to the end of the canon a
cid-de-sac with precipitous walls impossible to scale
our efforts however had not been without some re-
sults in one spot a few hundred feet above the val-
ley and just beyond the limits of the vegetation we
had found a deep fissure or cave near the base of a
cliff this i had at once realized would provide an
ideal dwelling and finding we would be forced to re-
main in the country for a time at least we decided
to take possession of the cave it was large and dry
and a chimney or volcanic blow-hole extended from
the roof of the cave to the open air far above thus
providing ventilation and sufficient light

  nearby a brook trickled down the mountain side fed
by the melting snows far above and within easy dis-
tance was the jungle the question of food did not
worry us for since we had discovered that the big
land-frogs were palatable we could always be sure
of a meal by hunting up one of the creatures and a
short search would always result in the discovery of
the hare-like animals which were easily killed by ar-
rows or even stones a little later too tom rigged up
a coop-trap in which he captured many of these crea-
tures alive

  as there were practically no insects on the bare
mountain side the only species we had seen being a
few butterflies and some harmless beetles we felt we
would rest undisturbed in our cave during the night
but there was always the danger of being attacked by
some roving lizard or other beast or by some predatory
hornet or ichneumon and our first step was to protect
our new home from invasion this we accomplished
by constructing a door of light poles bound together
to form a grid-like affair- it was not a difficult job
for the entrance to the cavern was not over six feet
in width by eight feet in height to be sure any
fairly large beast could have torn the frail screen to
bits or could have pushed it aside but i trusted to
the instinctive fear of traps which seems to be com-
mon to all wild animals and i had little dread of any-
thing attempting to reach us past the screen there
was no place in which to sling our hammocks but
as we felt sure we would be free from insect invaders


amazing stories quarterly

and as the floor of the cave was dry we gathered dead
leaves and dry moss and soon had comfortable beds
prepared partly for the sake of warmth for the air
was chilly and cold at night and partly to prevent
being overwhelmed by insects attracted by the light
we built our fire within the cave it was well that
we did so for no sooner had darkness fallen than hun-
dreds of insects came buzzing whirring about but
very few were small enough to find entrance through
the openings in our door and they bumped and banged
themselves aimlessly against the screen while we re-
mained cozy and comfortable within and as we at
last threw ourselves upon our couches and i smoked
an after-dinner pipe i felt more at ease and far safer
than at any time since we had reached the strange
country	v

  from the caves altitude we were able to look down
upon a vast area of the land which lay spread like a
map below us without difficulty we located the
mound whence we had emerged from the tunnel from
tupec we could see the open area with the semi-
circular wall of the black savages home in its centre
the orderly rows of bushes where the aphids pas-
tured appeared like a neatly laid out garden and we
could even identify the area that we had covered on
our wanderings and a very small an almost negligi-
ble portion of the whole place this was in fact as i
compared the limited district we knew with the whole
vast expanse of plains forests jungles hills valleys
and marshes it seemed a hopeless endless task to
explore the whole or even a small part of it this
however did not trouble me for i had no interest in
the place aside from a possible way of escape and i
had no intention of exploring the land more than was
necessary as we would move from one spot to an-
other in our search for an exit but as i studied the
topography and as the light increased and the drift-
ing vapors and fogs were dissipated i began to notice
many features of the land which interested me

  not far from the base of our mountain and a little
to the east was a broad expanse of green which had
a rather unnatural appearance in fact the edges
were so straight and even and the low vegetation ap-
peared to grow in such oddly rectangular areas that
i felt convinced that they were cultivated fields very
possibly i thought they were fields of the blacks
perhaps additional pastures for the aphids herds
farther off and covering an area of several hun-
dred acres as i judged was an almost bare spot dotted
with a few large trees and as i gazed at this i started
and uttered an ejaculation of surprise for unless my
eyes woefully deceived me i could distinguish a num-
ber of buildings clustered there and when tom also
saw the structures i knew that there was no fault
with my vision and that human beings perhaps semi-
civilized men must dwell there

  but the next instant my hopes fell for close nearby
i noted a second orchard of the aphids shrubs no
doubt it was merely a larger settlement of the black
savages and i sighed regretfully as i turned my eyes
towards another quarter but tom whose eyes were
far sharper than mine was making discoveries on his
own account urging me to look in the direction he
indicated he pointed towards the cultivated fields and
insisted that he could see men moving about and
working for a long time i stared longing for a
field-glass to aid my vision until at last i too caught
the movement of tiny figures but so distant were
they so foreshortened as we gazed down from our
height and so concealed among the vegetation that i
could not distinguish any details tom insisted how-
ever that they were not blacks such as we had met

that they were brown or reddish like indians and
that they were cultivating the fields presently too he
made out a road or pathway leading from the fields
and wildly excited he cried out that he could see a
village at the end of the roadway once he had pointed
it out i also could see it and this time i felt con-
vinced that the little settlement was not the home of
the blacks instead of the circular wall of stones and
the minute black dots marking the openings to under-
ground burrows i could see fences or walls built in
straight lines and forming a large irregular square en-
closing a number of buildings apparently of thatch and
surrounded by plots of green like small gardens here
and there a spreading tree or a palm rose above the
edifices and in every respect the place had the ap-
pearance of an indian village instantly i determined
to investigate if there were indians the chances were
they would be peaceful on all my expeditions i had
never yet met a hostile indian except where they had
suffered at the hands of whites or blacks and here
where i well knew no other civilized man had pene-
trated i felt confident the indians would prove friend-
ly still there was a chance that never having seen
a white man before they might become terror-stricken
and attack me before waiting for explanations

  this however was a rather remote chance more-
over it was a chance that must be taken not that i
was so overwhelmingly anxious to partake of the
aborigines hospitality nor was i obsessed with ethno-
logical ardor

  tom and myself were living quite comfortably and
we did not particularly feel the need of the compan-
ionship of other men but the indians-or whoever
they might prove to be-would know the country and
even if they could not lead us to some exit from the
place they would prove of the utmost value as guides
and in aiding us in innumerable ways during such
time as we were searching for a means of escape
moreover they possessed cultivated land and doubt-
less vegetables fruits and grain and we would i
knew soon be sorely in need of a change of diet if
we were to preserve our strength and health though
i gave little thought to it at that time i remember now
that i wondered how on earth the indians could culti-
vate the land and raise crops where insects were so
numerous and of such size

  somewhat to my surprise tom appeared as ready
and willing to make our way to the distant village
as i was i had expected him to be nervous and
frightened but he had become so accustomed to visit-
ing wild and savage tribes with me in the past and
had faced so many far more terrifying things here
in this land that the idea of visiting human beings-
no matter who or what they might be-appealed to
him as about the only normal thing we could do

having breakfasted well and having prepared an
ample supply of food-for we had i knew a
long and weary tramp ahead of us we rather regret-
fully left our snug cave and after fixing the location
of the village in my mind and noting landmarks we
started on our way

  the first few miles was down hill and easy going
and from our point of vantage on the mountain side i
had picked out a route which appeared to be less diffi-
cult than striking blindly through the forest and
jungles in a general way it followed the courses of
the streams and as i had foreseen we were enabled
to proceed far more rapidly than on our former tramps

  very soon too the country took on quite a new
and different character the jungle became more open
with fewer of the giant fungi and with more of the
the world of the giant ants



palms and tree-ferns the flat land gave way to roll-
ing hills and presently although i had not been aware
of it when looking down from above i realized that
we were steadily ascending from our cave the culti-
vated lands had appeared only a few miles distant-
certainly not over ten miles but as we tramped on
and on toiling up the hills and maintaining our course
by occasional glimpses of the mountains i began to
realize how deceptive distances might be when viewed
from a considerable altitude by mid-day we had reached
the end of the elevation and found ourselves on a
broad fairly level plateau rising well above the sur-
rounding forests and jungles and covered with brushy
areas and open park-like groves of big trees even
a cursory examination convinced me that the place
had at some time been under cultivation v
the decayed remains of trees and bushes that had
been cut down were still visible there were large
piles of stones which had obviously been picked out of
the earth as it was ploughed or turned over here
and there were fragments of low mud walls and in
several places among the weeds and brush were stray
stalks of a corn-like plant quite new to me as well
as a large grass bearing heads of grains somewhat
like wheat that any indians should have cultivated
such an extensive territory and should have done so
in such an apparently thorough manner was astonish-
ing the ordinary jungle indian usually cultivates very
small fields in the forests and as soon as the soil loses
its fertility he moves his gardens to a new spot at
a considerable distance but i was aware that the
quichuas aimaras and other andean tribes were ex-
cellent agriculturalists moreover in this land where
mammalian and bird life was almost lacking man
would of necessity fall back on agriculture unless like
the blacks he copied the habits of the ants and domesti-
cated giant insects there was another peculiarity of
the place which caused me considerable surprise and
which i could not understand insects were scarce
and come to think of it i could not recollect having
seen any huge forms of insect life-with the excep-
tion of several flashing dragon-flies one or two beetles
whose stench identified them as carybidae whose prey
was caterpillars and sailing high in air some insects
which i took to be flies or bees i had not seen a but-
terfly a moth a larva or even a ground-beetle but
i had little time to puzzle over these matters we
had reached the edge of the deserted brush-grown
fields and before us saw a low mud wall and beyond
it fields of waving grain not desirous of taking any
chances we crouched back of the wall peered into the
grainfields searching for indians and endeavored to
orient ourselves and recall where the village was sit-
uated this was not difficult from our hiding place
i could look back and see the big scarf in the moun-
tain side which i had hoped was a pass and in the
opposite direction i could pick out a peculiarly formed
peak which i had noted as a bearing according to
my calculations the village lay a few hundred yards
beyond us and to the left but i could hear no sounds
of life no barking of dogs no human voices such as
usually emanate from an indian village but it was
mid-day and the chances were that the inhabitants
were lazing away the hottest portion of the day and
taking their siestas

  it was a good time to visit them and i was about
to rise and proceed in the direction of the village
when my attention was attracted to the luscious look-
ing ears of corn so near us the sight of this re-
minded me that i was hungry and anxious to test
the edible qualities of the new cereal i leaped the
wall and started towards the nearest stalks the next

instant there was a loud humming from overhead a
sharp cry of warning from tom and i glanced up-
ward to see a huge winged creature dropping like a
falling meteor towards me without stopping to ques-
tion what manner of enemy it was but almost sub-
consciously supposing it a bird of prey i dodged into
the shelter of the corn stalks i was not an instant
too soon as i crashed into the thick growth of ten
foot stalks the creature struck the spot where i had
stood an instant before

  and as momentarily it alighted upon the earth and
i had a good view of it i was utterly dumbfounded
it was no rapacious bird but a gigantic bee a great
fuzzy black and buff insect with a body the size of a
beer keg and with dusky semi-transparent wings fully
five feet across there was no question that it was
angry and that it had deliberately attempted to attack
me its eyes gleamed savagely its strong mandibles
clashed together like the action of some carnivorous
beast gnashing its teeth its antennae were laid back
like the ears of a fractious mule and its big abdomen
rose and fell constantly unsheathing and withdrawing a
terrifying stiletto-like sting and it was buzzing with
the roar of a steam saw-mill as it peered in my direc-
tion as if considering whether or not to attempt to
resume its attack there was no doubt that it was
one of the solitary bees related to our common bumue-
bees and i reasoned in all probability its nest was
close at hand and its fiery temper had been aroused
when it had spied me so close to its home

anyone at all familiar with bumble-bees or any-
one who has ever purposely or inadvertently dis-
turbed the nest of one of these insects knows from
dire experience what short and ugly tempers the own-
ers possess and how unpleasant they can make it for
the trespasser and here was a thoroughly aroused
and irate bumble-bee several hundred times the size
of our common garden variety ready and waiting to
inflict dire retribution on the being who had unwit-
tingly approached too closely to its home i was in a
pretty fix i could not rise and seek safety in flight
and i was not at all sure that the giant bee would
not advance upon me at any moment bees are most
intelligent creatures and if this big fellows brains
were developed in proportion to the rest of his body
he must possess true reasoning powers in that case
he would realize that all he had to do was to crawl
over the canes beneath which i cowered thrust his
eighteen-inch sting between the stalks and kill me as
readily as a man spears an eel all this of course
passed through my mind in a fraction of a second
then before the bee could make up its mind as to its
next move before i could even wriggle deeper into the
corn there was a sharp twang from the direction of
the wall and a five-foot arrow sang through the air
and buried itself in the bees body tom had come to
my rescue with rare presence of mind he had used
his weapons to good effect and too late i bethought
myself of my revolver the arrow had struck the bee
just back of the thorax and with an angry buzz that
was more like a roar it swung itself about twisted
into a half-circle and with a single bite of its power-
ful jaws snapped the arrow-shaft in twain furiously
it beat its wings striving to rise but the muscle or
some nerve was severed and the poor creature rolled
over and over its struggles became weaker and weaker
as the poison on the arrow did its work until at last it
lay dead and harmless before me not until then did
i rise and hurrying to tom grasped his hand and
thanked him fervently for his timely action and com-
plimented him on his marksmanship

  my words were cut short by a distant roar from
the sky the next instant we were racing as fast as
our legs could carry us in the direction of the village
one brief glance had been enough fully a dozen of
the giant bees were speeding towards their stricken
fellow and we had no desire to be in the vicinity
when they arrived onward we dashed keeping to
the scant cover and dodging among the scattered trees
while behind us the roar of buzzing wings grew
louder indians no matter how savage and how wild
would be preferable to the angry insects and intent
only on reaching the village we sped on suddenly
ahead of us loomed a wall beyond it were the roofs
of buildings to scale the barricade in our spent and
breathless state was impossible and even in my terror
of the bees i realized that should we appear suddenly
over the wall we would probably be shot down instantly
somewhere there must be a gate or an opening and
panting stumbling we dashed along the mud wall it
seemed endless my legs felt as if they would collapse
beneath me but the increasing buzz of the bees spurred
me on

   the next instant we turned an angle in the wall
before us was a low arched opening and with a final
spurt we bent our heads and dashed through it

chapter viii

as i stumbled through the gateway amazement
and terror drove all fears of the pursuing bees
from my mind enclosed by the wall was a large
courtyard or plaza of bare clean-swept earth broken
here and there by small beds of plants grouped near
the centre were a number of mud-walled buildings with
roofs of straw but at the time i saw nothing of
this my gaze my entire consciousness was rivetted

horizontal scction of an agricultural ants nest arrangement of
rooms and granaries shown

from natures craftsmen by henry c mccook

upon a large circular area of hard-packed earth within
a dozen yards of where i stood covering it were
piles of freshly-cut grain and staring at us where
they had been interrupted in their work of threshing
by our precipitate arrival were the inhabitants of the
place i had expected to see indians naked primitive
savages perhaps but still men and women instead
the beings i saw were monsters so astounded so ter-
rified was i that for the moment i was not sure

whether or not they were human their color was
a coppery-red their great round heads were supported
on necks so slender that it seemed impossible that they
could support them they had enormous chests at-
tenuated waists and short paunchy abdomens and
each had six strong powerful limbs they were in-
sects seven foot giants thoroughly human in their
attitudes their occupation and in their surroundings
but unquestionably insects nevertheless

   as my stunned senses realized this and shuddering
i recoiled i recognized them as monstrous ants any
one of the creatures could have torn us to pieces with
ease but despite their awesome aspect their powerful
fearful jaws their unwinking staring eyes there was
something reassuring about their appearance an in-
tangible indescribable expression of intelligence and
peacefulness on their faces in fact they appeared to
be as astounded at our wholly unexpected advent as
i was about to dash pell mell into their midst neither
did they appear alarmed nor angry and they made no
hostile move

  all this i noted almost instantaneously the next
instant the roar of the buzzing bees galvanized us into
life and action and with yells of terror we dove for
the shelter of an open shed glancing over my shoulder
and drawing my pistol as i ran i witnessed a most
incredible and amazing thing-a sight that caused me
to halt in my tracks and to forget fear giant ants
everything as the first of the maddened bees swooped
down with extended sting ready to deal me a death
blow one of the red creatures on the threshing floor
darted forward and threw itself directly in the bees
path i expected to see the creatures instantly at-
tacked and destroyed instead the bee checked itself
in mid-flight swerved sharply to one side and circling
came to rest at the creatures feet one after another
the other bees did the same until a swarm of the huge
insects surrounded the man-like ant humming in
subdued tones fawning upon him stepping among
them he stroked their heads and backs uttered strange
scarcely audible whistling sounds and appeared to be
conversing with them the next moment one bee
after another spread its wings and took flight until
presently all were again sailing like tiny black specks
high in the sky nothing i had hitherto witnessed in
this marvelous land approached this for sheer incom-
prehensible wonder dazed as i was by my fright
my surprise and my topsy-turvey brain yet i rea-
soned that the bees were domestic creatures the prop-
erty of the beings before me and that the red giant
had called off the chase and had saved my life and
with this knowledge like a flash of light came an even
more astounding thought the bees were actually en-
gaged in watching the ants property in guarding the
grain fields and had attacked us not because we were
near their nests but because we had trespassed on
their domains but wonders had only just begun the
huge red ant was approaching tom and me he came
slowly cautiously as if striving not to alarm us every
few moments he would halt rise on his hind legs and
wave his fore feet and antennae in a strange manner
and wduld utter the same whistling or hissing sounds
he had employed with the bees

  tom of course was nearly insane with terror and
i felt shaky and far from easy myself but the fellow
had shown friendliness rather than hostility by calling
off the bees and i reasoned that if he or his com-
panions desired to attack or seize us they could have
done so readily either singly or en-masse in many
ways his actions were strikingly similar to those of
strange indians when meeting a civilized man for
the first time the actions of a man trying to make
the world of the giant ants



friends but still a bit suspicious and why should i
assume that these giant ants must be hostile or dan-
gerous why should i fear them any more than i
would have feared the unknown savages i had ex-
pected to meet so summoning all the nerve i
possessed and comforting myself with the thought that
i was at the ants mercy anyway i stepped forward
moving my own arms in much the same manner as the
ant for an instant it hesitated as if rather doubtful
of my peaceful intentions then evidently reassured
he stepped close to me extended his antennae and
with his great horny hook-clawed feet resting lightly
against me he examined me thoroughly

  i confess i trembled felt chill and in deadly fear as
his immense round head moved close to my own and
i had a close-up view of the terrible mandibles which
could have severed my neck as neatly as a guillotine
but his gentleness and the purring sounds he uttered
gave me courage and i managed to stand the ordeal
bad as it was it was not as terrible as the examina-
tion i had undergone at the hands of the black sav-
ages at last apparently satisfied he stroked me with
his antennae and turned towards tom

a shriek that would have roused the dead had
there been any near rose from toms lips and
cowering and shaking he clung to my coat for a
space the ant regarded him critically standing on
his four rear legs his body raised and his head turned
first to one side and then the other as he actually
sniffed with his antennae then perhaps deciding
tom was of the same species as myself or perhaps
recognizing him as my servant he turned to me and
half-led half-urged me towards the watching throng
on the threshing floor for a moment i feared that i
was to be forced to pass an examination by each ant
in turn but luckily i was spared this and while
the individual who had made the first advances ex-
plained matters to his fellows the others kept turning
curious glances at us but as i stood there the cen-
tre of interest i could not help thinking how puny i
seemed by comparison with the ants and how superior
they were to man in many ways i am speaking only
of physical superiority but since then i have become
convinced that these ant-men as i must call them as
well as others are mans superiors in mentality also

  our advent might have been expected to completely
disorganize the ants for the time being the arrival
of an inhabitant of mars or venus on earth would
most assuredly disorganize human occupations and
we were unquestionably as strange and remarkable to
the ant-men as a martian would be to ordinary humans
but nothing of the sort occurred no sooner had the
fellow explained matters-and i would give a lot to
know what his explanation was-than they again re-
sumed their work of threshing the wheat and gave
no further heed to us whether or not the one who
had checked the bees attack and had introduced us so
to say was a leader an officer or an official i cannot
say but he seemed to take charge of us by common
consent and with gestures which were unmistakable
in their meaning indicated that we were to follow
him for a moment i thought we were to be con-
ducted to underground chambers and that possibly we
would once more find ourselves inquilines but in-
stead our guide led the way to one of the buildings
i noticed now that i had recovered my self posses-
sion that these were built of pellets of mud neatly
piled and cemented together and that the straw roofs
were not true thatch but were in reality roofs of clay
supported and held together by straws in form they
varied greatly some were roughly rectangular others

circular others oval but all were alike in having dome-
shaped roofs near them as i have mentioned were
plots of vegetation and as we passed some of these i
saw that they were seed-beds or nurseries and were
filled with young plants

  with this discovery came a rather dim recollection
of having somewhere or at sometime seen similar beds
then suddenly it dawned upon me why had i not
thought of it before it had been in southern texas
where i had been on an entomological trip and i had
spent hours watching the marvelous habits of the
famed agricultural ants i had watched them busily
clearing their tiny fields pulling up the weeds cut-
ting down small sprouts i had seen them garnering
their crops of grass seeds i had seen the minute
grains threshed out by the insects and had-quite ruth-
lessly but in the name of science-dug up one of their
underground storehouses or granaries there could be
no doubt about it the ant-men among whom i found
myself were agricultural ants very similar in habits
to their little texas cousins but far more advanced
far more intelligent and-as might be expected in a
different environment - possessing certain distinct
habits and characters evidently too they were like
most agricultural creatures including human beings
peace-loving and friendly and i felt sure that neither
tom nor myself had anything to fear

  by now we had reached the first building and glanc-
ing within as we passed it i saw that it was more
than half filled with ears of the corn-like cereal the
next was partly filled with the wheat-like grains the
ants were threshing out and as we passed the door
two of the fellows arrived carrying receptacles full of
wheat and entering the building dumped the contents
into a huge bin

  here was proof that the agricultural ant-men were
far ahead of their texan prototypes in intelligence
they had erected out-of-door storerooms they had
learned to build roofs they had constructed bins of
mud walls they had discovered how to form basket-
like receptacles with my interest and my scientific
thirst for knowledge thoroughly aroused and anxious
to study these most remarkable creatures i felt actu-
ally grateful for quite by accident finding myself
among them

  we had now come to a smaller round building and
this our guide entered then having hissed or
whistled again and having rubbed me with his anten-
nae he left us and hurried off

  the room was bare of any furnishings of course
and it contained no food in fact nothing except a num-
ber of the basket-like utensils i had seen in use rather
curious to discover what type of weave the ants had
employed i stepped forward and examined these to
my surprise i found them formed of strong broad
leaves firmly glued or cemented into shape i was
puzzled to know how this was accomplished or what
the creatures used for their glue but i was soon to
have this puzzle solved i also noticed that one wall
of the building was provided with numbers of arched
openings or holes reminding me of a country post-
office with gigantic mail-boxes wondering what pur-
pose these served i stepped close to them and peered
within the ones at the height of my eyes above the
floor some were empty except for soft shredded
straw scattered over the lower portion or floor but
to my amazement several were occupied by ants ap-
parently sleeping could it be i wondered that this
was actually a dormitory or barracks it certainly
looked that way and perhaps we too were supposed
to make ourselves as comfortable as possible in the
niches they were certainly large enough to accom-

modate us being about three feet in width and height
and fully nine feet in depth but they were stuffy
dismal places and were far too much like the tombs
in a latin american cemetery to appeal to me as
sleeping quarters

  but i soon made another discovery noticing what
appeared to be a rear door to the building i passed
through it and found myself in a long gently-sloping
corridor leading into a hill or mound and with its
walls as far as i could see riddled with the same
oven-shaped apertures unquestionably these were the
living quarters of the ants from the main corridor
too side galleries led to right and left and these also
contained hundreds of the niches examining some
of these i found those of one corridor completely filled
with the dormant pupae of the ants another wtas
devoted to the larva and later i found that the eggs
were also stored in these pigeon-holes i noticed too
that the air in the corridors devoted to pupae larva
and eggs seemed much warmer than elsewhere and
presently i found that the passages actually were
warmed by artificial means in mud-walled receptacles
designed for the purpose were piles of some material
which gave off considerable heat and a rather fragrant
vapor or steam it appeared to be decaying vegetable
matter although there was none of the unpleasant
odor of rotting material and ultimately i found the
stuff was a form of fungus or rather i think a plant
closely allied to the yeast-mold which threw off heat as
it developed moreover it was not a natural growth
but was a culture obtained from the masticated grains
of certain grasses which were then fermented until the
spores developed

t longed for a thermometer to enable me to test
the amount of heat thus produced but i judged it
to be about  deg f here was a solution to the
heating problem which would have been a wonderful
boon to civilized man at no expense whatsoever and
with practically no care a house or other building
could be perfectly heated and when once started the
plants increased there was practically no limit to
the extent of heating that could be produced from
the first culture moreover the vapor thrown off by
the growing plants contained a large amount of free
oxygen so that the air was kept constantly fresh and
invigorating in this ultra-tropical land human beings
had no need of artificial heat however and perspiring
freely and feeling as if i had been in a turkish bath

i hurriedly returned to the outer room as there ap-
peared to be no restraint upon us and no reason why
we should not go wherever we wished i urged tom
into activity and some semblance of common sense and
stepped from the building several ants hurried to-
wards us and for an instant i thought we were to be
forced back to the hut but after waving their anten-
nae and feet and as nearly as i could judge interro-
gating us on some matter they scurried off and left us
to our own devices threshing was still in progress
and as i passed close to the threshing-floor i noticed
for the first time that the ants were actually using
mechanical means to separate the grain from the chaff

i had been too nervous and disturbed to notice this
before but now with the utmost interest and amaze-
ment i watched them

   each great ant was provided with a short section of
a log of wood moving on the hind feet and guiding
the roller with the front feet the creatures pushed the

 the fermenting leaves in which the leaf-carrying ants of the tropics
 propagate their edible fungi develop considerable heat many authorities
 are of the opinion that thcse ants thus produce artificial heat purposely

    scientific observers have reported that the agricultural ants actually
 use small pebbles for threshing the seeds of grosses which they cultivate

sections of logs with the middle pair of legs present-
ing as they did so the appearance of men pushing
wheelbarrows while some thus trundled their wooden
rollers around and around the area others scattered
the heads of grain before them others followed after
gathering up the waste straw and tossing it to one
side others deftly swept the grains of wheat as i must
call it into their leaf baskets while still others were
constantly engaged in tossing fresh sheafs of the grain
into the arena

  every individual worked with machine-like efficiency
and clock-like precision never did one get in an-
others way never did they stop their work to rest
or converse and yet as far as i could see no one was
in charge in fact the impression conveyed was that
of a machine with each cog of its mechanism perform-
ing its allotted task and functioning without jar or
apparent effort and with mathematical precision
everywhere where the ants were working it was the
same a short distance from the threshing-floor an-
other group was busily winnowing the grain here
too the advantage of six legs was very obvious stand-
ing on their hind legs and grasping a leaf-basket
with the front feet the ants would scoop this full
of the threshed grain raise it high and pour the con-
tents in a steady stream to a basket on the ground
before them and as it descended they would vig-
orously wave a stiff fan-like leaf with the middle
pair of feet thus blowing the light chaff aside the
creatures were all so human so evidently actuated
by intelligence and reasoning powers that i momen-
tarily expected to hear them speak but aside from
the low hissing or whistling sounds they emitted they
were inarticulate all communication appeared to be
carried on by means of antennae and feet and while
at times their gestures were so expressive and obvious
that even i could guess their meanings yet i felt con-
vinced that it was not merely by signs that they
conversed but by means of some vibratory or other
waves emanating from their antennae in fact once
or twice i was astounded to discover that i grasped
their meaning even when they did not gesticulate it
was a most remarkable sensation something like the
sensation one has when listening to a conversation in
some utterly unknown and incomprehensible foreign
tongue a word is suddenly caught which is intelligible

i do not mean td convey the idea that the ants anten-
nae wireless as i might call them was intelligible to
me but as i watched them at that time and later i
would now and then receive flashes of detached frag-
mentary communications not words or phrases by
any means but simply meanings or thoughts so to
say i would have given a great deal-provided i
had had it to give-to have been able to communicate
with the ants for there were a thousand and one
things i should have liked to have asked them but
as it was and still is i can only observe and form
my own conclusions can only guess at many things
and can only solve puzzles by theories or conjectures
deduced from my knowledge of the habits and char-
acters of related insects in other lands

  wandering from the busy threshers and winnowers
who by the way scarcely glanced at us although they
must have been consumed by curiosity we approached
one of the seed-beds where several ants were carefully
transplanting the tender seedlings it was while
watching them that i again marvelled that these crea-
tures could carry on their agricultural pursuits suc-
cessfully in a land so teeming with destructive insects
and once more i became suddenly cognizant of the
scarcity of insects here it dawned upon me that
with the exception of the bee watch-dogs-still sailing
the world of the giant ants



like buzzards far above us-and a number of immense
dragon-flies that were constantly flashing to and fro

i had not seen an insect of any kind since we had
entered the ants domains but the next moment the
riddle was solved and another astounding discovery and
amazing proof of the ants super-intelligence was

  in removing some of the young plants two wriggling
grubs or naked caterpillars were exposed tossing
these to one side the ant uttered a low hiss and in-
stantly from some hiding place among the adjacent
buildings a gigantic green and purple beetle rushed
forth and pounced upon the larva reaching out a
foot the ant patted the magnificent beetle and stroked
him exactly as a human being would stroke a faithful
dog whereupon the beetle squatted down with his
bright fierce eyes fixed on the earth ready to pounce
upon any stray larva that might appear there was
no doubt about it the beetle like the bees was domes-
ticated was kept by the ants to destroy insect larva

with a sudden flash of comprehension i realized
that the dragon-flies were also allies of the ants
no wonder there were so few injurious insects here
the ever-hungry beetles would devour every grub and
larva they could find the alert keen eyed swift winged
dragon-flies patrolled the air and destroyed all flies
moths and other winged pests while overhead the
droning bees kept constant guard and were ready to
swoop upon any trespasser they saw as we knew from
dire experience perchance for all i knew other
domesticated carnivorous insects might guard the fields
and storerooms by night but with the corps of day-
light patrols i doubted if such were required

  no doubt also the ants themselves destroyed count-
less larva and eggs as well as insects incapable of
flight as they tilled the fields here again the ants
exhibited intelligence and common sense in advance of
our human farmers despite every effort of scientists
and the government our farmers still persist in de-
stroying birds mammals reptiles and carnivorous in-
sects and as a result are constantly fighting a losing
battle with insect pests despite numberless pamphlets
and monographs and widespread propaganda and lec-
tures proving beyond question that birds of prey
crows snakes and countless other forms of wild life

aa well as innumerable insects-are the farmers best

friends the human agriculturalist will still adhere to
his hide-bound superstitions ideas and beliefs and will
ruthlessly destroy the very creatures that if protected
and encouraged would save him countless thousands ol
dollars annually yet here were ants giants to be
sure super-ants it is true but nevertheless ants who
protected themselves and their crops by encouraging
those insects which naturally preyed upon their ene-
mies and in a land where insects were a thousand
times as large and as numerous as in the north they
had by so doing practically exterminated insect pests
throughout their domains with my mind filled with
such thoughts and deeply regretting that i could not
demonstrate the matter to a committee of grangers i
left the ants busy with their seedlings and walked
towards the rear of the buildings here were several
large trees and as i neared one of these i noticed a
group of ants busily engaged upon some work which
rather puzzled me and when i approached closely
enough to witness their operations i found i had
stumbled upon the most interesting and surprising
thing of all in the shade of the wide-spreading
branches was a great pile of freshly cut leaves trimmed
into regular forms close to these were several ants
as i have said as i reached them one of the crea-

tures selected a piece of leaf spread it with his fore
feet and grasping a second piece of leaf with his
middle feet he extended the two leaves towards one
of his fellows

  reaching down this second ant picked up a curious
elliptical object from among a pile of straw beside
him holding this in his front feet he pressed one
end of it against the edge of the leaf held by his
comrade instantly from an orifice at the extremity
of the object a thick viscid fluid emerged and left a
muscilagenous trail along the leaf-edge as the ant
moved the thing slowly back and forth as i gazed
fascinated at this sight the first ant passed the leaves
he held to a third who quickly pressed the edges of
the two pieces together and handed them to a fourth
he in turn picked up another leaf held it for a fifth
ant to smear with the gum-like material and then
passed all to the sixth ant who dexterously pasted the
last bit to the others and formed a basket-like recep-
tacle such as i had already seen here indeed was
ample proof of intelligence equal to many human
beings

  anxious to learn what sort of glue they were using
and what the paste containers were composed of i
edged around until i stood beside the first ant who
was using the glue imagine my surprise when i saw
that the yellowish spindle-shaped objects were the liv-
ing larva of some insect larva which like many
other larva possess a sticky liquid silk with which
they spin their cocoons and which when irritated or
disturbed they excrete from their heads and these
great ants -were availing themselves of this habit and
were using the larvass store of cocoon material to
cement leaves together to form baskets i was aware
that certain ants are known to use their own larva in
a somewhat similar manner gumming the edges of
leaves together to form their own nests to be sure
i had never personally witnessed this but i had read
numerous descriptions of the remarkable habit and i
knew that it had been observed and studied by such
eminent scientists as bruce agassiz wood leconte
bates putnam and others but here beside me were
ants using larva as living muscilage bottles to form
utilitarian articles and if i were not greatly mis-
taken they were using the larva of some other insect
and not their own of this i soon convinced myself

  without interference on the part of the ants i
examined the larva and found they were the young
of a lepid-opterons borer while doing this an ant
arrived carrying a couple of large baskets filled with
straw and sawdust and containing a number of fresh
larva setting this down he picked up the ones that
had been used and hurried off anxious to see what
he did with those whose supply of gummy silk had
been exhausted and thinking perhaps i would thus
learn more of their origin i scurried after him he
moved much more leisurely than had the racing leaf-
carrying ants we had seen but i had hard work to
keep pace with him while tom fearing to be left
alone panted after me my expectations were soon
fulfilled the ant headed for a number of small trees
near the further side of the plaza reaching these
he busied himself placing the sluggish larva in neat
round holes in the tree trunks then while i watched
he ripped off a section of bark from another tree
exposing the sappy hole-riddled wood and began ex-
tracting the larva concealed in their burrows among
them were several brown pupae and these he carefully
placed to one side also i noticed several imagos
which as i had already assumed were rather hand-
some steel-blue feather-winged moths very similar to
our peach-tree borers although of course far larger

being over a foot in expanse the trees i saw were
conifers and as i could find no others in the vicinity
i was forced to the conclusion that they were raised
and maintained for the sole purpose of providing a food
supply for the borer larvae which were of such economic
importance to the ants just how the larva and their
adults were protected from the carnivorous insect at-
tendants of the ants was something of a mystery
possibly the beetles bees and dragon flies had been
taught not to molest them just as our farmers dogs
and cats are trained not to attack chickens or other
live stock or possibly the borers habits were sufficient
protection

  but the thing which puzzled me far more than this
question was how and where the giant agricultural-
ants had learned the trick of using borer larvse far
cementing leaves together to form baskets their owh
larvse as i soon determined could never have been
used for such a purpose for they possessed no sticky
secretion had the ants seen some other species using
their young and had they learned to imitate the
process substituting the borer larvse for their gumless
young had they accidentally discovered the borer
larvse exuded a sticky material which had by chance
fallen on leaves and had fastened them together or
had they actually invented the process by using their
brains and their reasoning powers i could not say
and i do not know it was one of the questions i
should have liked to ask them had i been able to con-
verse with them

  and now i had begun to realize that i was hungry
so interested had i been so astonished at every turn
that i had quite forgotten that i had not eaten since
early morning however tom still carried our food
supply and seating ourselves in the shade of a large
tree we proceeded to eat our meal oddly enough this
simple matter excited the ants tremendously and caused
more interest and curiosity than they had hitherto
shown

   evidently their sense of smell was marvelously keen
for though no ant was in our vicinity when we started
to eat they came scurrying from every direction the
moment we began munching our cold meat for a
moment i feared they were angry or that the smell of
meat had aroused their savage instincts for there was
something about their expressions and the business-
like manner of their approach that was not reassur-
ing but it was soon evident that they had no inten-
tion of molesting us as they came close they rose
on their hind legs sniffed-i can only describe their
actions by this word-with their antennae hurried
about and watched us intently then as if utterly
unable to understand the matter they formed a circle
about us and remained with antennae pricked for-
ward and eyes staring exactly like a crowd of human
beings watching animals fed in a menagerie sud-
denly i laughed as the explanation of their behavior
dawned upon me being strictly vegetarians them-
selves they could not understand us devouring flesh
to be sure their domesticated allies were some of
them carnivorous but to see a dragon-fly or beetle
devour a larvse or a moth was one matter and to see
us strange beings eating what must have appeared
like carrion to them was quite another we humans
think it nothing strange or unusual to see a cat eating
a rat or a chicken eating worms but we would be
filled with amazement and disgust were we to see an
apparently intelligent human being dine on a mouse
or a snake or witness a ruminant devouring a haunch
of mutton that my surmises were correct was soon
proved one of the ants scurried off and presently

returned carrying a leaf basket which he rather hur
riedly and timidly placed by my side

   it was filled with ears of the corn-like cereal and
with the wheat-like grain perhaps the kindly fellow
thought we were forced to eat the meat through want
of anything else and was offering us what he con-
sidered proper fare at any rate his hospitable inten-
tions could not be mistaken and being thoroughly tired
of a meat diet anyway i helped myself to the con-
tents and passed it to tom the corn though hard

tnm i b i the uncooked srain was beyond us
tom declared however that it could be cooked and
that if he could crush it he could make some substi-
tute bread and i knew that the corn if picked green
would be delicious no doubt the ants were disappointed

 	more than ever when they found we pre-

fen ed the meat to their fare but despite our wishes
to please our hosts we could not manage to satisfy our

                            until we had finished
our meal did the crowd of ants leave us evidently
too their day s allotted work was over for instead of
letuining to their former occupations they betook
themselves to the storerooms whence they emerged
each carrying corn or grain and proceeded to dine in
the open air i could not but envy the way in which
their great horny mandibles crushed the hard-shelled
cereals and i was thankful indeed that thev were
friendly and not hostile and preferred the products
ol their fields to our flesh and bones

   having dined they filed into the building with the
niches and quickly took possession of the openings
apparently each had its own pigeon-hole and while
the majority vanished down the passages others
stowed themselves away in the niches in the wall of the
first room by the time all had retired every cavity
was occupied and it was evident that tom and i must
shift for ourselves

  although these ants had none of the rank fetid
odor of the black savages still they smelled unmis-
takably of ant and the outer air was preferable to
that within moreover there were no insects to trouble
us except for the domestic beetles which appeared to
confine themselves to larvse and so we slung our ham-
mocks between two of the trees and were soon sleep-
mg soundly

chapter ix

the ants were early risers they were up before
dawn and like workmen streaming towards fac-
tories were hurrying to their tasks before the
sun rose seeing that the majority were headed for
the grain fields we joined the throng for i was
anxious to study their agricultural methods and i dared
not visit the fields unaccompanied while the bee-
guards were on duty

  without stopping to think i lit my pipe and in-
stantly the entire orderly system of the ants was dis-
organized still they appeared far less afraid of the
flare of the match and the sight and smell of smoke than
had the leaf-carrying ants or even the black humans
their actions in fact savored far more of curiosity
than of fear although the tobacco smoke evidently irri-
tated and troubled them every time a whiff of smoke
reached an ant the creature would shake its head
sneeze-if i can use that term to express the action-
rub its face with its fore-legs twitch its antennae and
act temporarily confused and almost intoxicated realiz-
ing that if i were to accomplish anything and fearing
that the ants might think better of their hospitality if i
persisted in troubling them i put out my pipe and
forebore smoking for the time being for that mat-
ter i had not intended to take more than a few puffs
                                                                -svfwg

the next moment one bet after another spread its wings and took flight until presently all were again sailing like tiny specks high in the sky
nothing i had hitherto witnessed m this marvelous land opproachcd ibis or sheer incomprehensible wonder

for my tobacco supply was woefully small and i
doubted if i could secure any substitute in the
country

   apparently puzzled at the sudden cessation of the
incomprehensible smoke the ants again fell into line
and proceeded on their interrupted way again i
noticed that there appeared to be no leader no chief
or officer and that no orders or directions were given
yet the ants seemed to work in unison to know just
what to do where to go how many were required at
each spot exactly as though all were controlled by
a single mind indeed the more i watched and studied
the ants the more i became convinced that this was
in a way the case so intensely communistic and
socialistic had they become that a sort of mental
telepathy or similar unconscious means of communica-
tion existed among them and the thoughts or idea of
one were common to all in other words the mental
reactions or stimulations of the ants were identical
in every individual and were in effect a single unit
just as their physical actions were so well co-ordinated
that in effect the labor of a number was the labor
of a unit

   to be sure when we first arrived a single ant had
 taken charge and as i have said he apparently had to
 explain what he had learned of us to his comrades
 but in that case he was dealing with a matter totally
 strange and foreign to all their lives experiences and
 mental processes i had no doubt that in the case of
 any unusual or wholly new event or experience the
 ants would be confused disorganized and at a loss
 for their synchronized minds would not function in
 unison except when dealing with matters with which
 all were perfectly familiar

   i noticed too that all the ants i had so far seen
 were apparently of one class all appeared to be sex-
 less workers there were no warriors such as are
 common to most ant communities fellows with over-
 developed jaws and physical characters adapted for
 defensive and offensive duties all i had seen were
 exactly alike in every detail and i wondered if through
 countless generations and with the domesticated insect
 allies to protect them the warrior class had gradually
 been eliminated through evolution or if being no
 longer needful and merely a burden on the community
 they had been destroyed as they developed of course
 somewhere there would be a queen or queens and
 there must be consorts or drones possibly i thought
 the ants i had found sleeping in their cells on the
 day previous had been males who performed no manual
 labor and i determined to investigate later and satisfy
 myself regarding the breeding habits and social sys-
 tem of the ants

   we had now reached the grain-fields and with per-
fect system and as if by mutual consent and under-
standing the ants began their task of weeding culti-
vating and reaping they worked with marvelous
rapidity and precision and their six legs and powerful
mandibles enabled any one of them to perform the
work of several men neither did they require tools
of any sort a nip of the chitinous jaws was sufficient
to cut down a stout stalk their powerful hard hooked
claws hoed and raked the earth as well as any steel
implement and weeds were uprooted and tossed aside
by their powerful jaws

very few injurious insects were found and these
were instantly pounced upon and destroyed by
the big carib-beetles who roamed about among the
toiling ants i wondered how with insects so ruth-
lessly and completely eliminated the corn and grain
could be pollinated but of course there were the bees

and presently i discovered that there were innumer-
able lady-beetles as they are called these i noticed
were unmolested the ants evidently being aware of
their usefulness and i hunted about until i found the
beetles larvaj--ferocious-looking flat-bodied creatures
with short stout legs rough hairy bodies and stupen-
dous serrated sickle-shaped jaws at sight of me
they backed away snapping their great jaws shaking
their ugly heads and lashing their stubby tails in a
most menacing manner although comparatively small
in relation to the ants and other insects yet they were
far too large and powerful to be treated with impunity
they were in fact about the size of large tom-cats
with jaws twice the length of their bodies and i knew
that a single bite would sever a mans wrist or arm

   they were however most interesting creatures and
apparently represented several species some were al-
most naked being sparsely clothed with stiff bristles
while others were covered with warty protuberances
thickly set with short barbed hairs to which the own-
ers had attached bits of leaves and empty skins of
small insects

  thus camouflaged they were wonderfully protected
and concealed indeed as i watched one of them rest-
ing motionless and completely hidden under his cloak
of empty skins of former victims a small thrip came
flitting by seeing the skins of his fellows clustered
together on the leaf and mistaking them for a little
colony of his species he dropped unsuspectingly to
the spot scarcely had he alighted when the crouch-
ing larva sprang forward with surprising agility and
seized the unfortunate thrip in its hungry jaws very
quickly the juices were sucked from its still palpi-
tating body and a moment later its empty skin was
added to the collection of trophies on the larvas back
in a way it was an old story to me countless times
i had watched our own insignificant aphis-lions cap-
turing and devouring their tiny prey in the same way
and following almost identical habits but despite
this it seemed like a new discovery and a most aston-
ishingly interesting one to see these twenty-pound
aphis-lions doing the same thing often in my en-
tomological days i had marveled at the lack of interest
in insects habits and lives exhibited by the average
man over and over again i had tried to arouse an
interest in such matters among my layman friends
but without success but now i realized why men
and women give no heed to the most remarkable
habits of insects about them and yet become
intensely interested and engrossed in the far less
remarkable habits of birds and mammals it was
merely a matter of size were our insects the
size of our mammalia and birds the public would find
as much or more interest in them even i who had
made a deep study of entomology and was thoroughly
alive to the fascination of insect life was being
thrilled excited and engrossed by the revelations of
the giant insects about me in a way i had never expe-
rienced when observing insects of normal size

   presently  noticed a new arrival at first i mis-
took him for an undersized bumble-bee for his colors
were much like those of the big fellows who had at-
tacked us but as he blundered about among the corn-
tassels and i had a closer view i discovered that he
was a honey-bee also as he was busily engaged in
loading his pollen-baskets with the yellow dust of the
corn flowers i discovered that he was one of the sting-
less bees so abundant in tropical america thinking
to have a little fun at toms expense i called him
to me showed him the big bee and quite casually ex-
tended my hand and poked the insect with a finger
tom yelled and grasped my arm but too late the
the world of the giant ants



bee angry at being so rudely interfered with uttered
an ominous buzz swung about and struck viciously at
me with its abdomen but it was all bluff he pos-
sessed no sting and i laughed heartily at toms ex-
pression of combined terror and amazement

  somewhere not far distant i knew the bee must
have a nest and a store of honey honey would i
thought be most desirable and i watched the depart-
ing bee as laden with pollen it spread its wings and
flew off it headed directly towards the ant village
and i mentally decided to have a thorough search for
its hidden sweets when i returned to the buildings
but i would no more have dared to leave the vicinity
of the toiling ants and approach the village alone with
tom than i would have dared to enter a den of
hungry tigers ever in the air above the great bees
wheeled about looking like the tireless-winged vul-
tures of the tropics and faintly to our ears came
the droning of their pinions like the distant exhaust
of airplanes as long as i was with the ants i felt
safe from the giant bees but i felt sure that the
moment their eyes detected tom and myself alone
they would swoop upon us and wreak vengeance for the
death of their companion i need not have worried how-
ever the bees like ferocious watchdogs once they
had learned that we were to be treated as friends of
their masters would not have molested us but
at the time i was not aware of this and whiled away
my time as best i might watching the ants studying
the habits of the few useful insects that i saw mak-
ing friends with the ferocious carib-beetles some-
thing about these big coleoptera appealed to me
despite their almost overwhelming pungent odor which
is a characteristic of their family they were very
dog-like in their behavior and they were gloriously
magnificent in their colors of metallic red green and
blue ornamented with sparkling dots of gold and sil-
ver lying on the ground in some shady spot their
bright roving eyes watching every move of the ants
they would wait patiently until their keen vision or
the signal from an ant apprized them of the presence
of a larva then with a bound and a rush they would
be upon it exactly as a terrier springs at a rat
despite their fierce aspect and their somewhat nervous
dispositions they were quite docile and although at
first they showed distrust and fear of tom and myself
and edged away whenever we approached them closely
i very soon managed to win the confidence of one or
two digging about with my hunting-knife in spots
which to my entomologically-trained eyes promised
the presence of hidden larva i unearthed several and
kicked them within view of the beetles thereafter
two of the creatures followed me about constantly and
watched my every movement tom however fought
shy of them the negro i have always noticed is
very timorous when near strange dogs and tom could
not overcome his fear that one of the beetles might
nap at him at any moment

  as mid-day approached and our appetites warned
us that it was time to lunch the question of our food
arose there were apparently no mammals in the
vicinity for us to shoot and the only edible substances
seemed to be the corn and grain many of the ears
of corn-it was not true maize but so very similar i
always think of it as corn-were in the green milky
stage and somewhat hesitatingly as i was not sure
how the ants would take it i pulled off several of these
the ants however gave no heed to my actions and
gathering a number of the ears we prepared to
lunch on green corn but while the cereal was edible
in a raw state it was not particularly tempting and i
decided to try roasting it i realized that to build a

fire might cause a panic among the ants and i was
somewhat torn between my desire to dine on roasted
ears and my dislike of exciting or frightening the
creatures who had so far shown nothing but friendly
and kindly feelings towards us but my curiosity to
witness their reactions my appetite and my insatiably
experimental mind decided me gathering some dry
corn stalks for there was no better fuel near and
moving a few yards from the ants to a spot where
the grain had been harvested and the earth was bare
i kindled the fire the reactions of the ant were as
remarkable as they were unexpected at the first
whiff of smoke they had swung about their eyes star-
ing and their antennae pointing in our direction then
as they saw the flames and sparks with one accord
they dropped their work and came hurrying towards
us for an instant i felt sure we were in for it and
bitterly i regretted my actions but instead of at-
tacking us as i had feared the ants dashed directly
for the blaze almost too late i realized that they were
actually about to throw themselves into the flames
without stopping to think of consequences i seized
the foremost ant shouting to tom to follow my ex-
ample and with all my puny strength shoved him
roughly back for the fraction of a second he re-
sisted struggling and snapping his jaws then ap-
parently realizing that there must be some reason for
my actions he fell back and gazed fascinated towards
the fire

tom meanwhile terrified at the ants as he was
had nevertheless obeyed me and had succeeded
in driving back two ants he had been less fortunate
than i however one of the creatures had snapped
at him and had torn one sleeve of his coat completely
off and had left an ugly cut on his arm but our
interference brief as it was had checked the impet-
uous rush of the creatures it was hopeless for us to
think of holding back the whole mob but the first three
were now more cautious and as they drew closer and
felt the heat of the blazing corn-stalks the others
leaped- hastily away

  one individual had approached too closely and had
badly singed one of his feet and limped off to some
distance the others perhaps through co-ordination
of mentality or perhaps through reasoning now realized
that the fire was dangerous and stood quietly regarding
it antennae and postures expressive of the utmost
wonder i was amazed every intelligent wild crea-
ture i had ever known had invariably exhibited in-
stinctive dread of fire even the leaf-carrying ants had
been wary of it yet these ants were attracted by it
and would have blindly thrown themselves to destruc-
tion like stupid moths and gnats had we not forcibly
prevented them but after all why should they be
afraid of fire they had never seen it and no doubt
their first impulse at sight or smell of anything new
was to rush upon it in fact now i came to think
of the matter i had often observed that this was a
common trait of ants and that their brains appeared
to be incapable of either fear or caution but it argued
well for these ants intelligence that they should have
understood our actions and should have resisted their
natural impulses however i was convinced that it
would not be wise to kindle fires within the ants
reach and i foresaw a rather dismal prospect of sub-
sisting upon raw food while we were with them but
as we had this fire-or rather the coals for the stalks
had quickly been consumed-i decided we might as
well follow out our original intention and roast the
corn the ants looked on with intense curiosity as we
did this when at last i raked the ash-covered some-

what blackened ears from the smouldering cpals i
handed one to the nearest ant as he sensed its heat
he hurriedly drew back and stood regarding it sus-
piciously his attitude his muscles tensed ready to
leap away his forward-turned antennae and his every
expression were exactly like those of a skittish horse
regarding the approaches of a stranger but as tom
and i sank our teeth into the truly luscious corn the
ant gingerly touched the ear became more confident
and at last bit off a piece and tasted it

  instantly he became excited and apparently sum-
moned by him his comrades crowded about smelling
and tasting the roasted corn very evidently it did
not appeal to them for each in turn ejected the masti-
cated kernels from his mouth but it was equally cer-
tain that they were vastly astonished at discovering
that such a great change could be wrought in their
cereal by placing it in the fire finally one of them
picked up the ear and hurried with it in the direction
of the village what he did with it i cannot say per-
haps he desired to test it on the young ants possibly
it was to be presented to the queen or for all i know
it was to be preserved as a precious relic and a great
rarity for future generations to marvel at i am not
sure whether it was the effect of my fire or the time
that caused the ants to cease their labors in the fields
and turn towards their homes naturally tom and i
joined the crowd and as we passed along i tried to
count the ants in sight

  much to my surprise i discovered that there were
not over two hundred and as far as i could judge
practically the entire population was present

  of course there might be many in the buildings and
underground chambers many more might be in dis-
tant parts of the fields or gardens and there might be
others engaged in other pursuits but when we had
started out no others were in sight none were thresh-
ing winnowing or making baskets and i felt convinced
that the entire colony did not number over three hun-
dred individuals

  but when we reached the village i was astonished
to find at least another hundred busily threshing and
winnowing presently i noticed that these appeared to
be somewhat smaller lighter in color and softer-boiled
than the others then i caught sight of several ants
carrying off broken fragments of papery parchment-
like material and the solution dawned upon me the
threshers and their companions were newly-emerged
ants which had hatched from their pupae during our
absence and the objects being disposed off were the
remains of their pupae skins a new wonder filled
my mind a wonder at a fact which had never before
impressed me during my long study of insects here
were creatures who until a few hours previously had
been inert helpless things incapable of voluntary move-
ment or thought and yet no sooner had they cast off
their pupal coverings and emerged as ants than they
fell to work upon the tasks of the old experienced adults
and apparently as expert as skillful and as accustomed
to the by no means simple processes as though they
had been doing the same things for years and perhaps
after vigorous training

  it was far more wonderful than the newly-hatched
chicken scratching for its food it was as remarkable
as it would be for a newly-born infant to step into a
motor car and drive it through traffic or to solve a
problem in trigonometry unquestionably it was in-
herited instinct and i wondered if in future genera-
tions the human race will have developed to a similar
extent and if some tens of thousands of years hence
the new-born members of our race would be able to
take the places and the duties of the aged without un-

dergoing the long and in a way wasted years of train-
ing and instruction

  but even more remarkable than their aptitude at
age-old tasks of their ancestors was the fact that they
showed no curiosity or interest in us certainly that
could not be inherited instinct i felt positive that no
member of the tribe had ever seen human beings
moreover when we had arrived the new generation
must have been in an advanced pupal stage and almost
ready to emerge hence they could not by any possi-
bility have inherited a knowledge of us from their par-
ents why then i wondered did these newly-hatched
ants appear to regard us with the same indifference as
they regarded their fellows the only way i could
account for it was to assume that the ants from the
very beginning regarded everything they saw smelt
heard or experienced as matters of course in that
case i decided they would fall easy victims to enemies
or to any untoward or unusual event if they emerged
to find themselves surrounded by deadly enemies they
would assume instinctively that all was well if they
emerged to find the crops being devastated by insect-
pests they would think it nothing unusual and yet
in that case their inherited instincts would force them
to undertake work to do things that would be impos-
sible of accomplishment

  and it must have required generations to have
domesticated and trained the insect-allies no which-
ever way i tried to solve the mysteries of the ants
lives instincts and intelligences i ran figuratively
speaking against a stone wall of evidence in rebuttal
and at last i gave it up in despair

  this time still desiring to learn where the queen or
queens were secluded and to discover more about their
home life i followed the ants into the passages leading
from the exterior buildings

  there was little difficulty in locating the royal cham-
ber as i entered my attention was centred on the
other occupants of the place rather than upon the
queen herself a dozen or more ants were working
busily and my first hasty glance showed me they were
actually making bread by this i do not mean that
they were kneading dough and baking itin ovens

  but they were cracking and masticating the grain
with their jaws mixing it into a pasty dough with
some sticky substance and patting it into loaves or pel-
lets with their feet curious to know what they were using
i went closer and discovered that it was honey as i
had already half-suspected as fast as the little loaves
of sweetened flour were formed other ants would pick
them up and carry them to the queen who was so
enormously fat and lazy that she was actually unable to
feed herself the bored expression in her eyes the
blasfi indifferent manner in which she opened her
mouth to receive the pellets of food from the jaws
of her servants was indescribably ludicrous and was
amazingly like many old dowagers i had seen in fact
the whole scene was far more like a dream than a
reality i thought of the old nursery rhyme for here
literally the queen was in her parlor eating bread
and honey

chapter x

that night we dined in royal style it was a
comparatively simple matter to locate the bees
store of honey in a hollow tree and as the owners
were stingless and powerless to harm us we helped
ourselves tom rigged up a crude sort of mill consist-
ing of a flat stone and a rounded cobble and after the
manner of spanish-american women and indians he
ground a quantity of corn and grain on this rough
and ready metate mixed to a paste with water and
the world of the giant ants



wrapped in corn husks these were baked in hot ashes
and when dipped in our honey proved most delicious
after days on a meat diet in order not to attract the
ants and endanger their lives and limbs we built our
fire at some distance from the buildings and waited
until all the ants had retired before lighting it evi-
dently the ants once they had ended their days work
were not easily disturbed for despite the fact that
they must have scented the smoke which blew across
the buildings no ant put in an appearance

  despite my interest in the ants and the friendly
manner in which they had received and treated us i
was still as anxious and impatient to escape from the
country as i had been before no civilized man would
have been content to remain indefinitely in such a place
even though we wanted for nothing in the jy of
creature comforts and were literally monarchs bf all
we surveyed in a truly magnificent and interesting land
in fact when i tried to analyze my own feelings and
discover why i should be so intent on leaving the place
i was rather at a loss i had neither kith nor kin in
the outside world and i was surrounded by the very
things in which i was and always had been most inter-
ested and i had enough material for study to last me
the rest of my life i finally came to the conclusion
that i was actuated by a combination of causes the
desire to make my discoveries known the gregarious
instinct of the human race the inborn restlessness of
the explorer and most important of all that peculiar
and inexplicable kink in the brain of man which never
permits him to be content or satisfied but is forever
urging him on forcing him constantly to seek some-
thing better or something beyond his reach it might
be called ambition desire purpose or any one of a
thousand different names but that did not explain it

  it was this urge this insatiable longing for some-
thing he has not got that has led man to all human
progress civilization and attainments and while
possessed by all men no matter how primitive and
savage yet nature has so ordered things that the
more advanced the more cultured man becomes the
more he develops this desire thinking upon this mat-
ter as i lay in my hammock i concluded that in this
lay the real the greatest distinction between man and
the lower animals not a single creature i could bring
to mind possessed this mental state here for example
were these ants in their actions their habits their
intellect they were fully the equals of many races
they had learned to till the soil to raise crops to domes-
ticate and train other creatures they had made at least
two quite notable discoveries or inventions and in unity
of effort in social life and organization and in success-
ful communism they were far ahead of average human
beings

  they had completely done away with leaders and the
necessity of rulers and consequently they had eliminated
oppression and caste there was no poverty no riches
among them they had attained to a measure the
state which many of my fellow men prate of as utopia
but to what purpose boiled down to actualities all
they did was to eat toil sleep and propagate their
species they possessed no arts no sentiment no cul-
ture no romance no literature no history and while
they were no doubt perfectly happy and contented i
felt that almost any fate would be preferable to lead-
ing such an existence their very unity of purpose and
their co-ordination of brains and effort had utterly
destroyed all individuality all personal rights and con-
siderations no member of the community could possess
anything more or less than his fellows there could be
no striving for something better no incentive for
progress and yet how could this be when i had proof

that there must have been progress must have been
individuality must have been an inherent desire to
better themselves in the past surely some one ant
must have thought of training the other insects to
destroy the insect-pests that beset them some indi-
vidual must have invented the use of a roller for
threshing grain even if he only discovered it by acci-
dent some one ant must have visualized utensils for
carrying the grain and must have found the way to
imake baskets some ant must have constructed the
first building

  such ideas such conceptions could not have come
suddenly to all at once such things could not be the
result of inherited instinct even in the cultivation of
their lands the garnering of their crops the use of the
grains they showed the result of invention of progress
and if their lives from time immemorial had been pur-
poseless as i had assumed if they had been satisfied
with things as they were if they had not possessed
some sort of urge or ambition why should they have
accomplished all these things the more i thought of
it the more confused and puzzled i became did all
living things possess to greater or less degree that
never-ending desire for improvement and come to
simmer it down so to speak did the human race with
all its super-intelligence its boasted progress and en-
lightenment really accomplish anything more than did
these ants when all was said and done were not all
our lives all our efforts all our civilization our wars
everything devoted to enabling us to eat sleep toil and
propagate our species and to what end men toiled
that they might eat and sleep

   they ate and slept that they might toil and eat and
sleep again they propagated their species and reared
their offspring in order that their offspring might live
to toil and toil to live and they themselves toiled and
lived with the sole aim of enabling the younger gener-
ation to take their places and toil and live in an end-
less circle what did it all mean what did it all lead
to why was man-for that matter and the lower
animals also-created to go on forever in this way and
get nowhere and why was i who by a mischance
found myself so situated that i need not toil to live
nor live to toil so anxious to return to a land where
i would be to all intents and purposes of no more
importance and where i would possess no more true
freedom or individuality than belonged to one of the
ants sleeping in their underground cells like so many
other problems and puzzles that i had faced since enter-
ing this land it was insoluble as far as i was con-
cerned and i therefore gave it up and lost myself in
sleep

   i had determined to set out on a further search for
an exit from the country without more delay and the
following morning we started on our way i had rather
wondered how the ants would take our departure i
did not think they would hinder us but i did assume
that our leave-taking would arouse some curiosity but
i was disappointed not an ant paid the least heed to
us and that was not surprising for i noticed that a
second crop of the creatures had hatched out during
the night and that all the ants in sight were newly-
emerged individuals who had never seen us before
what i wondered became of the older ants at this
rate the colony would soon increase until the food sup-
ply could not support them and the village would be
overcrowded of course they must swarm new queens
must leave the place and establish new colonies but as
yet we had seen no swarming no signs of young
queens and still there had been two broods of new ants
since we had arrived in some ways obviously their
habits were quite different from any ordinary ants and

i rather regretted leaving them until i had thoroughly
studied their lives and habits

t eading from the gate in the wall was a well
 marked pathway which we followed partly because
it afforded easier walking and partly because i was
rather curious to know whither it led perhaps half a
mile from the village we had left we were greatly
surprised to come upon another wall exactly like the
first though evidently much newer as in places the
mud plastering was still damp within it we could see
the roofs of houses and beyond tilled fields wherein ants
were laboring

  like the wall the buildings were of recent construc-
tion and in fact were not entirely completed for a
number of ants were working upon them the fields
too were freshly tilled piles of weeds and pebbles
culled from the soil were scattered about and ants were
still weeding and preparing the fields for planting here
then was a newly established colony of the agricultural
ants and i at once jumped to the conclusion that it
was a community started by young ants with a new
queen from the parent colony but it is a rash matter
to jump at conclusions in this land where everything
is strange and new as i approached the nearest ants
i saw that they were not young but old individuals
and among them i recognized the fellow whose foot
had been burned in our fire for a space i was puzzled
but presently the solution came to me among these
ants it was not the young but the old who went forth
and established new colonies

  as fast as enough young had emerged to manage the

fields and carry on the studies of an established com-
munity the older ants left and started a new village
and fields being experienced and in the social or-
ganization of the ants of less value when aged they
were better fitted for this pioneer work also it oc-
curred to me that it was quite possible that although
the newly emerged young instinctively carried on the
work to which they had been born they might not
inherit the knowledge of starting new communities at
any rate it was a far more human habit than most
ants possessed when establishing new colonies the
young were brought up in a new environment and be-
came thoroughly able to take care of themselves and
their own progeny before being forced to go forth
and face the world and its dangers

  each generation in turn would establish new colonies
leaving the younger ants to continue with the old com-
munities and thus the larger and more important col-
onies were always maintained by young virile active

and more numerous ants what i wondered became of
the old ants eventually how long did they live under
normal conditions did they continue to move on
indefinitely until they died of old age or did they at
last find a quiet and toilless old age in some colony or
again were they put out of the way killed off as so
much deadwood when they became too old and stiff in
their joints or too feeble in intellect to be of further
economic value in all probability i decided they
gradually decreased in numbers either through natural
deaths through accident or other causes so that after
having started a certain number of colonies their places
were taken by the succeeding generation i wondered
also how they managed to subsist until their fields were
producing grain and also whether they brought their
own queen with them or carried off a new one each
time they moved on even whilst i was pondering on
these matters the first question was solved

  a number of ants arrived each carrying its burden
of grain or corn and hurrying to the storerooms de-
posited the load and hurried off all were young ants
unquestionably from the colony we had just left and
supplying the immediate needs of their elders from their
own stores it was a striking proof of the splendid co-
operation of these creatures and a good demonstration
of filial duty they might permit the old ants to leave
home-might even drive them forcibly away-but they
had no intention of permitting them to starve to death
before the new colony was on its feet by the very
order of things and as a result of their habits and cus-
toms this was most essential for the entire existence
of the race and the successful spreading of communities
depended upon the older ants being supported and main-
tained in health and strength until a colony was pro-
ductive and a new generation or two had appeared it
was not so easy for me to settle the question regarding
the queens the ants made no move to interfere with
us--perhaps they assumed that we were moving to the
new colony along with them-and i wandered into the
passage which i assumed would lead to the royal
chamber i was not mistaken there was the obese
complacent blas female and her court but whether
she was the aged mother of countless offspring or a
youthful flapper i could not determine to my eyes
all queens looked alike although to the ants they
were doubtless as distinct in forms and features as are
women to the eyes of men

  for several hours thereafter we came upon colonies
of the agricultural ants in various stages of develop-
ment some were well advanced and the crops were
bearing or were even being harvested and in one or
two we saw numbers of newly-emerged ants here was
a wonderful field for study with an opportunity to
make most interesting discoveries and to observe and
to record all the similarities and differences existing
between these ants and our own and to make compari-
sons and reach conclusions as to the effects of heredity
and environment at any other time and under other
conditions i should have welcomed the opportunity
but as it was i made only the most cursory inspection
of the various colonies and kept to my main purpose of
searching for an outlet from the place passing the
last of the ants farms we swung into the woodland
once more and headed towards a spot on the mountain
ridge which i had previously selected as our first goal

  we had traveled perhaps ten miles and had just
killed a fine fat hare for our mid-day meal when glanc-
ing through the trees i noticed a moving object which
rather puzzled me at first sight i took it for one of
the black men bending over as if searching for some-
thing then i saw that it moved on all fours it did
not however resemble any other creature i had met
the world of the giant ants



and as well as i could judge on account of the distance
and the shadows of the trees it appeared to be jet
black in color it was i judged about ten feet in length
and it moved about with a peculiar indescribable man-
ner of most efficiently searching every nook and corner
in its vicinity had i been in any other land i should
have thought it a giant black bear for its movements
were far more ursine than feline even here where i
had almost convinced myself that there were no large
mammals i felt fairly certain that the strange crea-
ture must be mammalian and that it might be and
in all probability was a powerful and dangerous beast
i did not question but no matter how dangerous it
might be there was nothing we could do save remain
silent and motionless where we were in the hopes that
the thing would move on without seeing or scenting us
for a time i thought this would be the case for the
creature came no nearer and in fact at times actually
moved away from us then as if finally locating that
for which it was searching and with a confident man-
ner it had not hitherto shown it turned and came
hurrying directly towards us

  wa-la muttered tom between chattering teeth
he been smell tha blood what drap from the rabbit
he been a-trailin we long o tha blood chief there
was no doubt about it he had crossed our trail had
smelt the hares blood-and perhaps our own scent as
well-and was after us i had already drawn and cocked
my revolver and tom had unsheathed his arrows in
readiness to defend ourselves to the best of our
ability but i well knew that a pistol bullet was of
little avail against such a huge powerful beast and
i doubted if the arrows had power enough to pene-
trate its thick hide if need be we would fight for
our lives but as long as there was a chance of escap-
ing without facing the beast i intended to avoid battle
if the creature had smelt the hares blood there was
a possibility that it would be satisfied with the hare
and would not attempt to attack us to be sure the
hare would be scarcely more than a mouthful for it
but it probably had never before smelled a human
being nearly all wild creatures have an instinctive
fear of man and while it was devouring the hare we
might be able to get far enough away to be beyond
its reach so dropping the hare and in terse words
explaining my ideas to tom we hurried as fast as
our legs could take us in the opposite direction once
i looked back and through the intervening foliage i
saw the dark bulk of the monster where it was busy
with the hare a moment later tom yelled and
spurted by me like a deer and behind me i could hear
the crackling of branches and the running footsteps
of our savage pursuer it was hopeless to think of
outrunning the thing in the forest and shouting to
tom we raced for a large tree whose outjutting slab-
like hips extended several feet from the trunk and
formed a small niche or open space with a narrow
opening here we could be attacked only from the
front and exhausted and spent we reached our hastily
selected refuge not a moment too soon as we dodged
between the big bark-covered walls and swung about
the ferocious creature was less than twenty yards
behind us and as for the first time i had a clear
view of the beast i saw to my absolute and complete
amazement that it was- an ant he was so monstrous
so gigantic that it did not seem possible even in this
land of impossibilities but there could be no doubt
about it he was far larger than the agricultural ants
nearly twice the size of the leaf-carrying ants and far
more formidable than either from head to tail he
was shiny jet black reflecting the light like burnished
steel his head seemed all eyes and terrific jaws in

fact the jaws were far larger than the head and were
as keen-edged as heavy and as deadly as battle axes

his great eyes wore a terrifying savage glare his
antennae were drawn back his jaws opened and
extended and his great clawed front feet were
raised ready for action as he rushed upon us never
have i seen a more inexpressibly ferocious beast and
had we been in the open he would have made short 
work of us for despite his size he was as quick and
agile as a panther

  raising my revolver i blazed away my first shot
went wild but my second tore a gaping hole in one
eye partly blinded no doubt he swung slightly to
one side and banged into one of the outspreading
hips of the tree this was our salvation before he
could recover himself i fired the other bullets into
him at short range while tom drove three arrows at
the great beast now within a dozen feet of us the
arrows might as well have been straws his thick
polished coat of chitinous mail turned them aside as
readily as would steel armor it even proved efficacious
against some of the pistol bullets when they struck a
glancing blow but the others crashed through his
shell from the gaping wounds thick yellowish juice
oozed emitting a sickening acrid stifling odor but
despite the damages done by my bullets the creature
was far from dead or even mortally wounded half-
blinded as he was riddled with holes he staggered off
a few yards and shaking his head and clashing his
jaws gathered himself for a second - charge as he
stood there for a moment i reloaded my weapon with
trembling fingers and i noticed for the first time
that his abdomen ended in a sharp point and that
from this protruded an immense barbed sting in-
stantly i placed him he was one of those strange
solitary ants of the tropics those giants of their fam-
ily who possess both stings and powerful fighting
mandibles and who roam the jungles alone blindly at-
tacking every living thing they find devouring any
creature they can conquer and are so savage so
poisonous that even those of normal size are regarded
with terror by the indians and this one gathering
strength for another attack upon us was a monster
of monsters hundreds of times the size of the largest
known to science all this flashed through my brain
during the few short seconds it required to reload my
pistol the next instant i was feverishly kicking
scraping pawing dead leaves twigs and bits of bark
into a pile at the entrance of the tiny refuge where
we stood as the giant ants muscles tensed and his
great jaws opened i scratched a match and touched
the flame to the little pile

  as the match flickered and went out and a tiny flame
ran through the dead leaves the ant charged though
his rush lacked the speed and strength of the first
for he was evidently weakened by his wounds still it
was terrifying enough and with cocked revolver i
awaited him determined to withhold my precious am-
munition to the last and hoping against hope that he

would be checked by the rapidly-spreading fire as
he felt the heat and smelled the smoke he hesitated
then a pile of leaves flared up the flames scorched his
feet and head and hastily he drew back for a
moment he stood there shaking his head rubbing his
burned legs and peering at the flames then as if
deciding the fire was a new enemy to be summarily
dealt with he leaped forward and regardless of the
smoke and flames savagely attacked the blaze with
jaws sting and feet throwing the firebrands aside
biting at the flames with such ferocity as i have never
witnessed in any beast

  again and again i fired at him tom his fear
giving way to primitive savage frenzy was belaboring
the creature with his bow pelting him with clods of
earth and yelling like a fiend but our case semed
hopeless the giant ant was rapidly destroying the
fire he was within six feet of us and my bullets ap-
parently had no effect then suddenly help arrived
from a most unexpected quarter there was a rustle
of leaves the swift patter of hurrying feet from be-
hind the tree and the next instant a huge beetle
rushed upon the scene i say huge but in comparison
to the maddened ant he appeared puny in his large
soft abdomen his embryonic wings his steel blue
color he closely resembled one of the blister-beetles
or as they are more commonly termed spanish-flies
but that he was a distinct species and a new genus
to me i knew at a glance

  as he caught sight of the fiendish ant he halted his
protruding glistening eyes fixed on the scene then
with his short club-shaped antennae sheathed in their
recesses out of harms way with his useless wings
half raised with his abdomen curled sharply upward
he raced for the ant it seemed the height of folly
a suicidal act for this soft-bodied harmless-looking
creature to attack the giant ant i expected to see
the latter turn snap the beetle into bits and resume
his attack upon us but nothing of the sort happened
busy with the fire the ant failed to see the beetle
until it was upon him with a leap so swift the eye
could scarcely follow it the beetle sprang at the ant
alighting upon its back instantly there was a sharp
report like a miniature explosion a misty cloud en-
veloped the two insects and tom and i staggered back
almost overcome by a smarting burning choking ter-
rible sensation as if we had been exposed to mustard-
gas scarcely able to see through the tears that filled
my burning eyes i saw the great ant stagger back
and the beetle spring lightly from its perch the next
moment the ant was writhing and twisting while the
beetle always maintaining a safe distance from the
terrible sting the clashing jaws and the thrashing
feet darted back and forth like a dog worrying a
wounded bear but each time instead of nipping at
his struggling foe he would swing quickly about raise
his abdomen and would discharge a clov-l of vapor
with a loud report i was scarcely as much amazed
by his temerity in attacking the ant as by his methods
i was of course familiar with the habits of the com-
mon bombardier-beetles those little ground-beetles who
when angered or frightened discharge an infinitesimal
quantity of ill-smelling gas from their abdomens to
the accompaniment of an almost inaudible pop

  but the beetle before me was of a totally different
genus one of the blister-beetle family i felt sure
and the vapor he was discharging at his fallen foe
was obviously having a deadly effect in fact the
huge ant was even now helpless barely able to move
and after one or two more of the beetles gas attacks
he remained quiescent and evidently quite dead here
was a most marvelous exposition of the triumph of

science over brute force the soft-bodied short-jawed
inoffensive beetle had easily defeated and destroyed the
gigantic armed and ferocious ant without even ex-
posing itself to serious danger but what if he turned
his attention to ourselves what if he should dis-
charge his deadly gas at us grateful as i felt for
his timely intervention i was half minded to shoot
the beetle at once for my eyes still smarted from the
effects of the slight amount of gas we had been ex-
posed to and i knew that a full charge would render
us helpless if it did not destroy us at once i also
realized that the odor and the intense burning proper-
ties of the vapor were precisely like the smell and
effect of the oily secretions exuding from the blister-
beetles in fact it was this strongly irritant material
which has given them their popular names and has
caused them to be used in medicine in the form of
plasters and counter-irritants in many lands if then
this huge beetle was as i felt sure a member of
this family it was no wonder that his secretions were
sufficient to destroy the ant especially when concen-
trated and discharged in large volume directly upon
him

  as all these thoughts rushed through my mind i
watched the triumphant beetle closely expecting at
any moment to see him turn towards tom and myself
but- need not have worried he was examining the
dead ant feeling him with his antennae smelling of
the carcass and as nearly as i could judge he was
greatly puzzled to account for the wounds caused by
my pistol balls no doubt it was the first time he
had ever destroyed an enemy by his gas attacks and
then had found the defeated insects life-juice exuding
from a dozen or more gaping holes puzzling as it must
have been it apparently made little difference to him
with his stout short jaws he quickly tore a large
opening in the ants abdomen and began devouring
the creature he ate ravenously and at last gorged
to repletion he balanced himself on his hind legs
meticulously cleansed his head antennae and jaws
brushed the crumbs from his waistcoat-if i may use
the metaphor-and with a regretful glance at the store
of food still unconsumed he trotted off and disap-
peared in the forest

  with deep sighs of relief tom and i stepped from
our shelter for a moment we stood gazing at the
remains of the giant ant tom stooped picked up
one of the huge disarticulated jaws and grinned seem
like to me he chuckled this been a mighty fine
sort of cutlash chief ah been goin to cay it along
an if ah comes to fightin another of dis gentman
ah boun for to use it far bash in he haid

  toms idea was excellent the jaws were as large
and as strong as butchers cleavers with edges almost
as keen and the rounded knob-ended joints with which
they had been connected with the muscles before the
beetle had devoured the tissues made excellent handles
they would as tom had said serve as most vicious
and deadly weapons at close quarters and moreover
they would prove useful as tools or implements and
would save much wear and tear on my hunting-knife
but the almost skeletonised ant was to provide us
with still another addition to our armament pro-
truding from his half-devoured abdomen was his im-
mense sting a needle-pointed rapier of chitin
over eighteen inches in length as flexible as tempered
steel and almost as light as wood with some diffi-
culty i cut it free from its tissues and muscles and
cautiously examined its shining black length with its
sharp recurved barbs near the tip a tiny scratch
from that poison-soaked weapon would mean death
and mounted on a stout shaft it would be a most
the world of the giant ants



formidable spear to find and cut such a staff was
easy and having bound the sting to its four-foot shaft
and having protected its point by a bamboo sheath
we left the scene of the recent drama and resumed
our interrupted journey

chapter xi

having sacrificed our prospective meal we
searched about for possible game and were at
last forced to fall back upon frog tom killed
the big batrachian with a blow of his ant-jaw axe and
thus proved the efficiency of his new weapon to the
entire satisfaction of us both we lunched beside a
fair-sized stream and the cool limpid water appeared
so attractive that we decided to have a swim before
resuming our journey stripping off his scanty gar-
ments tom dove from the bank and through the
clear water i could see his brown body swimming
like a giant frog far below the surface like all of
his race he was almost amphibious and i watched
him as he moved slowly along close to the overhang-
ing bank near to the bottom of the stream then
just as i was on the point of plunging in to join
him i saw him veer aside strike out furiously and
shoot to the surface wild terror filled his eyes his
face was distorted with fear as he swam madly for
shore he had seen something to terrify him i knew
and i peered towards the bottom of the stream in
an effort to discover what it might be but the com-
motion caused by his frantic movements obliterated
everything and while i thought fr an instant that i
caught a glimpse of some huge dark creature scarcely
more than a shadow i could not be sure it was not
merely the effect of the disturbed water the next in-
stant tom was on dry land stammering and quaking
and it was several minutes before he could speak
coherently or i could make head or tail of his gibberish

  lordy he managed to exclaim at last wa-la
chief ah been see the mos frightsome algator ah
ever see yes indeed chief an fo tha lard yo
come nigh to losin yo nigger tom chief he been
miss grabbin me by no moren a inch chief

alligator i ejaculated are you sure tom

  as i spoke i crouched on the bank and again peered
into the depths but could see nothing still tom in-
sisted that a monstrous saurian had attacked him and
that he had barely escaped with his life unquestion-
ably he had seen something but i could not believe it
an alligator or crocodile the clear water the smooth
pebbly bottom were not such as the saurians prefer
and in all my experience i had never before known
one of the reptiles to lie in wait and snap at pass-
ing objects far below the surface always they rise
and seize their prey at or near the surface or when
below rush at it	n

  also knowing toms character and how easily he
became terror-stricken at any unusual sight and how
objects under water are distorted and magnified i
felt that it was far more probable that he had seen
an overgrown and harmless salamander or even a tad-
pole so sure was i that no alligator was lurking below
that i rose prepared to dive down myself and investi-
gate but tom begged me not to attempt it and re-
membering how many unexpected perils had been met
i thought better of my impulse and decided on a wiser
plan

  the discarded portions of the frog on which we
had lunched were near at hand and dragging these
to the bank we attached them to the end of a tough
vine weighted them with stones so they would sink
and lowered them into the stream at the spot where
tom insisted he had seen the reptile for a moment

nothing happened and then from among the stones
under the bank a huge horrible head darted out seized
the bait and with a jerk that tore the vine from our
hands dragged it back among the stones i was
amazed even in the brief glimpse i had had i
knew it was no alligator no crocodile the immense
curved jaws armed with huge spike-like teeth were not
those of a saurian or of any reptile with which i was
familiar and yet what else could the monster be

  all my curiosity was aroused and i determined to
discover what manner of rapacious beast lay in wait
there gathering the remaining portions of the frog
we bound them and a number of stones together with
vines attached them to a stout vine and fastened this
to the tip of a long strong pole this we fastened
securely so that it extended several feet from the
bank stretching myself at full length and with
my ant-sting-tipped spear poised i told tom to drop
the bait into the stream as the ripples caused by its
fall smoothed out and the frog-meat slowly sank i
lowered my spear until its point was but a foot above
the spot whence the creature had appeared with
both hands gripping the shaft i waited ready to plunge
it into the monster the moment he emerged from his
lair for a space i feared he would not expose him-
self that his hunger had been appeased and that our
bait would not again tempt him but i had not counted
on the things insatiable appetite once more that
fearsome head lurched forward with wide-spread
ravenous jaws but this time the bait was further
away and following the monstrous ferocious head came
a foot or two of pale livid fleshy body with all my
force i drove the spear downward aiming for the point
where the head and body joined i felt the spear bury
itself in yielding flesh the shaft was wrenched from my
grasp and as i sprang back the stream frothed and
churned and was transformed to a miniature maelstrom
by the wounded maddened monster keeping well back
from the shore tom and i watched with fascinated
eyes expecting each moment to see the terrible thing
rise from the waves and dash at us

  gradually the commotion subsided the water cleared
and cautiously we approached the bank with a yell
tom leaped back pointing excitedly then i too saw
close to the bank half-floating belly up and still
wriggling and twitching spasmodically was the body
of the thing i shuddered as i looked at it never
had i seen a more diabolical looking beast its flat-
tened segmented ten-foot body with its rows of short
clawed stout legs resembled that of a giant centipede
along the sides were rows of great warty protuber-
ances bearing short stiff bristles its immense flat
head was covered with broad plates of chitin and its
enormous terrible jaws were still opening and closing
viciously as it moved feebly in its death throes it
turned partly over and its big cruel eyes glared at us
balefully

  no wonder poor tom had been terrified to meet
such a monster under water would have been enough
to drive the bravest man half mad with fear but the
monsters days were over my spear had proved its
worth and the ant poison had done its work thor-
oughly but as i had felt sure the beast was no
reptile he was an insect the larva of some gigantic
species of corydalis a monstrous hellgromite or dob-
son a stupendous prototype of the ugly savage aquatic
larvse of the neuropter common in our own brooks
and so much in demand by anglers as bait for black
bass

  fortunately tom had discovered the beast in time
still more fortunately his discovery had probably
saved us both from horrible deaths for i had no doubt


amazing stories quarterly

that scores hundreds of the creatures lurked in the
stream and in other streams and bathing with such
monsters about would be far more perilous than diving
into a nest of man-eating crocodiles at last the huge crea-
ture ceased to move and approaching it cautiously we
threw rocks and sticks at it our attack brought no
response not even a tremor feeling convinced it was
quite dead we managed to throw a loop of vine over
one of its jaws and dragged its head within reach so
that i might retrieve my spear the struggles of the
monster had snapped the staff of the weapon but the
sting itself was uninjured and with considerable diffi-
culty i wrenched it free from the dead hellgromites
flesh then having again bound it to a new shaft
and feeling quite elated at our destruction of the
monstrous larva we resumed our way	v

  we had been delayed and interrupted so frequently
that we had made but little real progress it was
mid-afternoon we were miles from our cave too far
from the ants villages to return to them and with
the mountains still in the distance it was evident
that we would be forced to pass another night in the
open but this did not greatly trouble us we had
our hammocks we felt quite well equipped with
weapons and while we had learned that we were sur-
rounded by many known and still more unknown
enemies and dangers we had grown so accustomed to
facing such perils that night held little terror for us

  i preferred not to sleep in the forest however and
as we proceeded we searched the country for some
open spot wherein to camp an hour or two after
our destruction of the hellgromite we reached the
edge of the forest and came to the verge of a broad
rather sandy plain or prairie bare of vegetation with
the exception of bunches of coarse grass and clumps of
cactus and agaves some of the cacti were of the
giant candelabra variety and were even larger than
the largest of those on the deserts of our southwestern
states they were in fact real trees and amply strong
enough to sustain our hammocks here was an excel-
lent camp-site we would be in the open away from
the myriad of gnats moths and beetles we could not
be attacked without warning except from the air-and
it was dry and free from the miasmic mists of the
forest selecting a clump of several large cacti at a
short distance from the forest edge as a likely spot
for our camp i  directed tom to gather some dry
firewood from under the trees and sauntered on in
advance towards the group of cacti never dreaming
that any danger could be near in this open country i
gave little attention to my immediate surroundings

  suddenly and without the least warning a two-foot
circular section of the earth sprang up within a few
yards of my feet to my startled eyes it had pre-
cisely the appearance of a man-hole cover thrown
open then as the lid dropped back exposing a round
hole a chill ran down my spine from the aperture
two great hairy brown arms appeared each tipped
with immense black talons before i could regain my
wits before i could move a horrible head followed
a rough hairy brown head with immense down-curv-
ing tusk like black fangs and with a group of small
flaming-red piercing eyes i needed no second glance
the thing was a giant tarantula-one of the trap-door
spiders-a deadly terrible creature confused unable
to decide on what to do i stood there inert and help-
less as the fearful creature climbed swiftly and silently
from its silk-lined burrow a moment and he would
pounce upon- me i could almost feel the agony of his
gripping claws could almost sense these awful fangs
burying themselves in my neck then life action
sense came back to me with a wild cry i whipped out

  my pistol and fired but my hand shook the bullet
went wild and striking the sand a few inches in front
of the crouching tarantula it flipped a shower of dust
and pebbles into the things eyes surprised dazed
partly blinded confused the giant spider sprang
quickly back bit viciously at the offending sand and
momentarily forgot his human prey taking careful
aim i pulled the trigger and from the great hairy
thoras i saw a puff of dust and fur fly as the missile
struck

  but it served only to infuriate the beast to remind
him of my presence

  again i levelled my weapon and pulled the trigger
but only a click followed

  the revolver was useless i had forgotten to re-
load after my battle with the ant to turn and run
would be worse than hopeless in less than a dozen
steps the monstrous spider would be upon my defence-
less back and i had no time even to turn i saw the
great tarantula gather his feet together for a spring
i saw him hurl himself forward unconsciously in-
stinctively i thrust out my hands to ward him off like
a ten-inch shell he came hurtling upon me his ter-
rible talons outspread his awful fangs ready to bury
themselves in my body his dozen red eyes gleaming
like coals of fire in my mad terror of the deadly
creature i had forgotten that i still grasped my
spear not until my staring dilated eyes saw the
tarantula upon me not until i felt the impact of his
body against the weapon did i remember it then
with a rush recollection and swift action returned to
me grasping the shaft with both hands taking a
backward step i lunged forward and upward with all
my strength

  i felt the weapon go home i dropped the shaft and
plunged headlong to one side one great claw snatched
at my coat and ripped the sleeve from shoulder to
wrist vile-smelling horrible liquid spattered me
stumbling to my feet not daring to look back i rushed
blindly away until tripping over a stone i sprawled at
full length on the sand dazed shaken trembling and
utterly spent i stared back expecting to see the
monster about to finish me

but he had other matters to occupy his mind if he
possessed any in a perfect paroxym of rage he was
writhing twisting rolling about biting with inde-
scrible ferocity at his own body his own legs and at
my spear which had transfixed him it was a horrible
a terrible sight and tom who had witnessed the en-
tire affair had dropped senseless from sheer terror
had actually fainted for the first time in his life what
my bullets had failed to do my spear had accom-
plished the tarantulas minutes were numbered
already his struggles were becoming weaker and by
the time i had reached toms side and he had recoyered
consciousness the gruesome horrible beast was still in
death my spear however was ruined the dying
spider in his convulsive rage had bent and broken
the tough chitinous blade beyond all hope of repair
i was maddened at my loss for twice the weapon had
served me well and i owed my life to it but if the
gigantic spider had robbed me of my trusty javelin
he was to supply me with a substitute his great
curved pointed fangs were larger and heavier than the
ants sting and while they bore no poison as i knew
they were not to be despised as weapons with diffi-
culty overcoming my repugnance at the task-and
utterly unable to coax or threaten tom into approach-
ing the dead creature-i hacked and cut its fangs free
unlike the ants sting which was beautifully tapered
perfectly cylindrical and straight as an arrow the
spiders fangs were curved thickened on the convex
the world of the giant ants



edge and possessed deep longitudinal grooves as
spears they were useless but their similarity to the
ancient english bill-hooks was striking and i knew
they would prove most effective -weapons passing
one to tom and keeping the other myself we care-
fully retraced our way to the forest keenly searching
each square foot of the desert as we advanced

  after my experience we had no desire to sleep on
that open plain the horde of night insects in the
forest was far preferable to prowling tarantulas

  only stopping long enough to cut and fit handles to
our new weapons we hurried into the forest until we
were beyond sight of the plain before preparing to
make camp it was already very late we had no time
to lose and quickly we lit a fire cooked our meal and
slung our hammocks by the light of the flames but
we slept little that night as before myriads of- in-
sects attracted by the fire buzzed blundered crawled
and flew about us and i was far too nervous and upset
by the afternoons adventure with the tarantula to sleep
well

  altogether it was a nightmarish time but dawn
came at last and with the new day and the welcome
light our spirits rose very soon tom secured game-a
hare and a strange creature quite new to me and
which resembled a porcupine without spines we
breakfasted well by the light of morning the expe-
riences of the preceding day seemed dream-like and
unreal but there were our tarantula-fang bill-hooks
to prove their reality not to mention the ripped sleeve
of my coat we had no mind to attempt to cross that
stretch of sandy plain however where one giant
trap-door spider dwelt others probably dwelt also and
i knew the ferocious character of the creatures far
too well to take any chances with them

  so although the route was far longer we decided
to follow the forest edge to our objective point hith-
erto all the sliders we had seen were rather small
and were of the geometrical orb-weaver group quite
harmless as far as we were concerned although ugly
and terrible in appearance

  this had already caused me a great deal of surprise
and no little wonder for in a country where other
insects were so abundant and of such huge propor-
tions it might be assumed that the spiders or arachnids
would be proportionately abundant and of proportionate
size yet until i had met the tarantula we had seen
no spider of any sort more than three feet in length
we had met none of the predatory jumping-spiders so
abundant in other lands none of the wolf-spiders the
funnel-makers or the long-legged web-makers nor
had we seen any of the arboreal my gale group which
are usually so abundant in the tropics why i won-
dered were spiders relatively so scarce i could not
explain it could find no hypothesis to account for it
but i was duly thankful that they were rare be-
fore the day was done however i was to discover the
answer to the question we had passed well beyond
the scene of our adventure with the tarantula and were
in a district where the country was broken and out-
crops of rock projected above the earth several times
i had noticed large dark-colored insects winging back
and forth above the plain but had given them little
attention knowing they were neither solitary hornets
ichneumon-fiies nor giant bees but as we stopped to
rest for a time my eyes idly followed the creatures
presently one of them swooped quickly towards the
surface of the plain vanished for a few moments and
reappeared carrying some object in its jaws and fore-
feet somewhat curious as to the prey it had secured

i	watched it as turning it came flying heavily in our
direction as it drew near i saw that it was a wasp

a big dark-blue dusky-winged slender-bodied fellow
perhaps three feet in length and that its burden was
a big fat-bellied spider its similarity to our own
familiar mud-wasps was striking and like them it
evidently had the habit of preying upon spiders
knowing the manner in which our own mud-wasps
sting their victims into a comotose state and then
wall them up in their mud nests to provide food for
the young wasps when the latter hatch out i had
no doubt that the big wasp humming past us was
bound for its nest on a similar mission a few rods
beyond where we sat it volplaned down to a rocky
ledge and vanished

  anxious to learn more of its habits i rose and
cautiously approached the spot clamboring over the
rocks i soon detected the wasp it was clinging to its
nest and was so busily engaged in forcing the stupe-
fied spider within it that it paid no attention to my
presence the nest was a beautiful structure a per-
fectly symmetrical urn-shaped affair of smoothly-
moulded clay with its base attached to the rock a
perfect example of the workmanship of the potter-
wasp group and as true in form and as gracefully
designed as though modelled by an expert human pot-
ter on a potters wheel

  but unlike the potter-wasps with which i was fa-
miliar this species was evidently gregarious for clus-
tered on the rocks near the first nest were a dozen
others some had the orifices tightly sealed indi-
cating that their owners had stored their supply of
living provender within and had completed their ma-
ternal duties others were partially completed others
were ready for occupancy but were still empty while
on several the big wasps were resting as though they
were tired out with their labors

  while i watched two more wasps arrived with their
spiders and i realized that here was one reason for
the comparative scarcity of the arachnids no doubt

i	thought there would be numerous colonies of these
wasps scattered throughout the country and the ag-
gregate might be sufficient to keep down the spider
population still i had noticed that all the spiders
captured by these wasps appeared to belong to the
wolf-spider group and i could not sfie how or why
the decimation of their numbers should have any effect
upon the spiders of other species dwelling in remote
spots in the jungles and forests as a matter of
fact however i was really more interested in the
wasps nests than in the spider problem seeing the
graceful vessel-like nests had put an idea in my
head if wasps could mould pottery why should not
tom and myself do the same hitherto we had been
forced to roast or broil all our food and we had
sorely felt the want of utensils for holding water on
several occasions calabashes gourds large nuts or
similar objects appeared wanting in this place and we
had fallen back upon sections of bamboo somewhere
near there must be a clay bed and mentally deciding
to hunt this up and try my hand at the ceramic art
if we failed to find an exit through the mountains
upon my return i rose and calling to tom we again
trudged on but our way was beset by difficulties we
had not foreseen everywhere among the rocks were
wasps nests whichever way we turned we came upon
them many were like those i had seen but others
were immense rough irregular affairs containing many
cells we had literally stumbled into a hornets nest
but fortunately for us the mud-wasps like their ordi-
nary prototypes were docile peaceful insects and did
not offer to attack us still i did not care to tempt

   	many of our solitary wasps constrdct clay nests of beautiful vase or pot-
like form for this reason they are popularly known as potter wasps

them too far and finding we could not continue on
our route without passing through the wasp colonies
we swung far to one side and headed for a defile or
valley which was sparsely wooded but here we were
no better off although the mud-wasps were left be-
hind with the bare rocks the valley fairly swarmed
with black and yellow wasps and these too were
spider-catchers the air fairly vibrated with them and
i knew perfectly well that they were quick-tempered
fellows very different from the good-natured mud-
wasps everywhere too the trees were festooned
with their gigantic top-shaped nests of gray paper
and as we watched them from a safe distance scores
hundreds of the big yellow-jackets were constantly
arriving each carrying a stupefied spider

  no wonder the spider-world had not multiplied or
grown to gigantic proportions betwixt the  mud-
wasps with their penchant for prowling wolf-spidera
of the open and these paper-makers who apparently
captured woodland spiders only there was little chance
for the arachnids to increase in numbers or in size
no doubt too there were many other colonies of
wasps and hornets who depended upon spiders and
which i had not chanced to find for it would be most
unusual and quite contrary to all known habits of
insects to have the entire spider-eating wasp popu-
lation of the vast territory confined to one small area
why the mud-wasps should be here i could well under-
stand for their habits required the presence of the
rock ledges near the edge of the open plain but
wherever there were such conditions there would no
doubt be mud-wasps while i could not see that the
haunt of these black and yellow fellows was in any
respect different from countless other wooded valleys
still there might be certain details-as the presence
of trees suitable for paper making-which would ap-
peal to the hornets at any rate it was obvious
that they had taken complete possession of the place
and i for one had no longing to dispute their rights

chapter xii

making a wide detour we passed through a
stretch of jungle and came out upon a grass-
covered area ascending at an easy angle to
the first slopes of the mountains scattered about and
half-hidden in the grass were scores of what i at
first took to be great rounded boulders suddenly i
halted staring for one of the rocks had seemed to
move squinting in lla brilliant light shading my
eyes with my hand i gazed wondering if it was an
effect of the shimmering heated air rising from the
plain if it was an hallucination of my brain due to
a coming attack of fever or if i had merely imagined
it then once again the massive boulder heaved itself
upward moved slowly forward for a few yards and
again remained motionless i hurried forward filled
with amazement and curiosity at this seeming miracle
then abruptly i roared with laughter at my own stu-
pidity the thing was no rock but a gigantic turtle
a stupendous land-tortoise the dome-shaped carapace
was strikingly similar to those of the giant tortoises
of the galapagos islands but immeasureably larger
being fully ten feet in length and rising for several
feet above the waist-high grass i stood awed and
impressed at thought of the countless centuries which
must have passed since this huge creature first emerged
from its egg the galapagos tortoises are estimated
to be from two to five hundred years old and if these
fellows in the grass about me grew at a proportionate
rate then their ages must be measured by thousands
of years and as we earner near and the mammoth
tortoise raised his great head and looked at us curi-

ously his bleary eyes seemed to gaze upon us puny
beings with all the wisdom of the ages

  immense age too was indicated by the countless
deep wrinkles on his skinny neck the worn and bat-
tered scales upon his enormous feet his scarred and
battered shell and the blunted worn-down edges of
his jaws what marvelous stories these multi-cen-
tenarians could tell could they but speak what amaz-
ing events they must have witnessed in the transform-
ation of the world about them but the hoary old
patriarch within a few yards of us was not interested
in anything aside from the grass within his reach
and after assuring himself that we were not to be
feared and that he need not withdraw his wrinkled
neck and elephantine feet within his shell on our
account he worried a bunch of grass from the earth
and munched it slowly deliberately like a toothless old
man having devoured all the herbage within reach
he reared himself ponderously lurched forward a few
yards and again sank down

 something in his movements reminded me most
forcibly of an army tank and seized with a sudden
boyish impulse i handed my weapons to tom with
some difficulty i scrambled onto the giant turtles
back of course he paid no attention to my presence
for through his immensely thick carapace he could
not have felt my movements and my weight was no
more to him than that of a grasshopper upon the
back of an ordinary tortoise and he continued to
graze as calmly as ever as far as i was concerned
i might as well have been standing upon an upjutting
rock grinning from ear to ear tom stepped towards
the beasts rear and dealt a resounding blow upon
its stout scale-covered tail instantly i felt as though
i were experiencing a terrific earthquake the great
carapace rose upward it shook swayed rocked and
sprawling flat on my stomach i clung desperately to
the rough surface with hands and feet like a dis-
masted ship in a hurricane-lashed sea the tortoise
lurched forward thoroughly startled at the treatment
he had received and at each forward heave of his
ponderous legs progressed a dozen feet or more

  tom elated at his success and bellowing with laugh-
ter followed after belaboring the turtles tail and pay-
ing no heed to my frantic shouts to cease the
beasts pace was by no means slow and tom was
forced to run to keep up with us but the rolling
rocking motion was more disturbing than that of any
laboring ship and at last unable to stick it out
longer i allowed myself to slip earthward and landed
safely on all fours in the grass

  instantly as tom ceased his efforts the turtle came
to a halt and resumed his interrupted breakfast as if
nothing unusual had occurred it had been a most
unique and remarkable experience for me and i as-
sured tom that as a means of transportation the
turtle was even more tank-like than in his appearance

  passing through the herd of the giant tortoises i
remarked that here were creatures who had nothing
to fear from any enemies no living beast not even
a dinosaur if such had existed could have made any
impression on those mighty shells the fiercest most
savage insects would have found the thick scale-pro-
tected skin of neck and legs impervious to mandibles
and stings even man unless equipped with a power-
ful rifle would find it difficult indeed to harm the
beasts and once they withdrew within the shelter
of their shells they would be as secure and safe as
though barricaded in a battleships turret they were
harmless useless creatures provided by nature with
ample means of protection in lieu of means of defense
and yet i knew that should civilized men ever invade
the world of the giant ants



this country they would wantonly destroy these
monstrous tortoises as ruthlessly as they had extermi-
nated the giant turtles of the galapagos

  for the first time since entering the place i felt
thankful that it was not inhabited by my fellow men

  beyond the turtle plain we came to broken country
and throughout the day we climbed toiled tramped and
searched the mountain side but all in vain

  every ravine and canon we explored proved a blind
lead and when night fell we camped where darkness
found us among the rocks too tired and spent to re-
trace our way to a better spot or to worry over dis-
comforts nothing disturbed us there was no reason
for any living creature dwelling in such a desolate
spot even the customary ground-beetles were lack-
ing with daylight we had a magnificent viewvof the
country for we were at a higher altitude than we
had previously attained in our explorations far below
us stretched the green sloping plain dotted with the
brown rounded backs of the giant turtles in far dis-
tance we could distinguish the farms and villages
of the agricultural ants barely visible on the op-
posite side of the valley was the low swampy jungle-
covered area with the aphis groves beyond like a
vast brown patch the desert plain of the tarantulas
broke through the greenery and we could make out
the rocky ridge where the spider-eating mud-wasps
had their nests so far we had covered a large part
of this familiar area but there was an immense
amount of territory still unknown to us and this i
studied carefully ilere once more i saw the expanse
of orderly arranged trees which we had seen from
our cave on the other side of the valley and which i
had assumed was a second settlement of the black
humans with their aphis orchards

  but i was now much closer to it and the more i
studied it the less it looked like the settlement and
orchards of the blacks we knew i could not exactly
describe or analyze why or how it appeared different
and at the time i did not give very great attention
to it for i thought it in no way strange that two
settlements of the race should vary considerably in
another spot and much nearer to us was a group of
half a dozen or more low rounded dome-like objects
standing prominently among the vegetation they were
quite different from anything i had hitherto seen and
in general appearance were more like huge beehives or
kaffir kraals than anything else i longed for glasses
with which to examine them and as i had done scores
of times before i blamed myself and figuratively kicked
myself for an unmitigated ass for having left my
equipment including my field-glasses at tupec when i
first started to explore the tunnel but to regret my
lack of foresight was futile and i strained my eyes
and tom did the same trying to puzzle out what the
structures were whether in fact they were structures
or natural formation and trying to pick out a route
that would lead us to them if they were indeed
artificial things buildings of any sort then in all
probability they might be the homes of human beings
a short time previously i should have said certainty
rather than probability but experience had taught me
not to jump at conclusions and after the agricultural
ants i realized that even if artificial these beehive-
like affairs might be the homes of some form of insect
life but whatever they might prove to be i had made
up my mind to have a look at them at close range

  from former experience i knew that the puzzling
affairs would prove far more distant when we began
to tramp towards them than they appeared to be when

 	these tortoises often reach enormous size specimens have been known
 large enough easily to carry two or three men upon their backs

viewed from the heights but i planned to cross the
valley and thoroughly explore that side retaining our
cave as a headquarters before continuing on the side
where we now were and it would be only a few miles
out of our way to visit the dome-shaped things de-
scending the rocky slope was far easier than ascend-
ing it and very soon we were again in the turtle pas-
ture crossing this and searching for game for we
were very hungry we swung to the north and en-
tered an expanse of thorny jungle where we secured
two of the odd mammals which i have likened to porcu-
pines minus spines like all other mammals we had
seen they were rodents but i noted as i cleaned and
skinned them while tom prepared his fire that they
were of a very primitive type and undoubtedly new to
science in many ways they were more closely related
to the capybaras and guinea pigs than to the porcu-
pines and to my surprise i discovered that they were
marsupials pouched mammals here indeed was a
great discovery the only american marsupials hith-
erto known were the opossums which are carnivorous
and here was a marsupial rodent

  this set me to thinking and i wondered if it were
possible that the hares and marmots of the place
were also marsupials in fact for the time being

my discovery of a new order of marsupial mammals
on the south american continent quite obsessed me
until i recollected that unless i escaped from the
place this discovery along with all my others would
die with me and might remain unknown to the world
for centuries or perhaps forever

  regardless of their peculiarities and their interest
from a zoological viewpoint the creatures proved ex-
cellent eating and when we at last resumed our tramp
only the clean-picked bones of the beasts were left
however i had no fears about future meals and
within the hour tom knocked over one of the little
marmots as i had rather expected and had hoped he
too proved to be a marsupial and later i discovered
that the same was the case with the hare-like crea-
tures yet despite the fact that i was daily hourly in
fact making astounding scientific discoveries and find-
ing all previously conceived ideas completely upset it
came as something of a shock when tom stumbled
upon the nest and eggs of one of these animals we
were walking through a patch of forest carpeted with
dense ferns when tom exclaimed that he had found
a birds nest i hurried to him for we had neither
seen nor heard birds and i had instantly assumed that
he had found the eggs of some reptile or possibly of


amazing stories quarterly

some huge insect but my first glance assured me
that i was wrong and tom was right at the base
of a cluster of ferns and filling a slight depression in
the earth was a bulky nest of dead leaves and down
containing five elliptical pale-buff eggs slightly speckled
with bluish-green they were about the size of hens
eggs and so i at once assumed were eggs of some gal-
linaceous bird perhaps incapable of flight tom how-
ever was far more interested in their edible properties
than in the identity of the owner and picking up
one of the eggs he deftly sliced off one end with a
startled surprised cry he dropped it as if it were red
hot

  lord amighty he exclaimed he been got a
rat inside he

i stared incredulously at the contents of the egg
revealed by the smashed shell squirming feebly
in the mess upon the earth was the embryo of a four-
footed creature for a brief instant i thought it a
reptile but the bedraggled scant hair the ears the
whole appearance of the embryo precluded that and
proved it to be the inmate of the egg of a mammal
it was astounding and yet i knew that the platypus
or duck-bill of australia lays eggs as does the echidna
or spiny ant-eater excited at this fresh discovery i
examined the now defunct embryo and readily identi-
fied it as the young of the hare-like creature we knew
so well the long ears the rudimentary tail and the
greatly developed hind legs were unmistakable more-
over in its embryonic state the creature appeared far
more like a kangaroo than a hare and a new idea
flashed to my mind

  was it not possible that the kangaroos had evolved
from rabbits or vice-versa here were creatures evi-
dently very low in the scale of mammalian evolution
who resembled hares as much as kangaroos who were
marsupials who laid eggs they were true missing-
links and more than ever before i regretted my in-
ability to make my discovery known to my fellow men
and to add to the worlds knowledge of life and evolu-
tion no scientist was ever in a more exasperating
and unenviable situation i was making epochal and
revolutionary discoveries that could be of no benefit
either to myself or to the world even my discovery
of the hares eggs for i must thus refer to the
creatures was of no real benefit for they were unfit
for food and food to tom and myself was of far
more importance than scientific facts

  so leaving the nest and its contents undisturbed we
proceeded on our way

  i gave little attention to our surroundings my
mind was far too busily occupied with theories and
speculations i wondered if all the marsupial mammals
of the place laid eggs i wondered if the young
emerged from the eggs blind and helpless or if they
hatched out quite as able to care for themselves as
newly-hatched chickens and i wondered whether the
females incubated the eggs or left that duty to the
air and sun in fact my mind harked further back
and i began to wonder if the black savages we had
met might not also deposit eggs had i not personally
viewed their young being cared for in their subter-
ranean chambers i might even have speculated on the
possibility of these being marsupial humans for noth-
ing seemed too wildly unreasonable or bizarre in this
weird land

  filled with such thoughts i failed to note that we
had left the wooded area behind and were now in a
brush-covered country presently however i was
aware that the sunlight had disappeared and thinking
it must be clouding over i glanced up above the

trees to our right hung a dark cloud blotting out the
sun a funnel-shaped lowering cloud with its whirling
twisting stem descending earthward an ominous-look-
ing cloud presaging a tornado

  and it was coming directly towards us we were
in its path and death was imminent for a brief
instant i hesitated confused searching about for the
safest direction in which to flee ahead the way
seemed more open there was less brush and even
if we failed to out-race the coming twister we would
be free from the danger wind-hurled trees and
branches the next instant we were running at our
utmost speed while behind us we could hear the roar-
ing of the oncoming cloud and the day became as
dim as twilight panting exerting every effort strain-
ing every muscle we dashed through the shrubs and
bushes that tore at us and held us back like clutching
fingers at any moment i expected to feel the first
blast of the tornado to see the brush torn up by the
irresistible force of the revolving gale to be hurled
aside bruised helpless perhaps broken and mortally
injured then above the roar of the cloud came a
staccato patter like rain or hail upon the vegetation
close to us heavy falling objects fell upon the leaves
and earth about me and pelted my back as i caught
sight of them i screamed like a maniac and halting in
my mad race stared with bulging eyes at the black
menace in our rear it was incredible impossible too
fearful to be real but it was there was no doubt of
it all about us great winged insects were dropping
to earth insects a foot or more in length insects
dropping like falling leaves from the vast army the
countless millions of their fellows who formed the
roaring black cloud now passing directly above our
heads thousands were falling about us striking us
with the force of descending wild-ducks killed in mid-
flight thousands covered the earth the bushes as
rapidly as they fell their flimsy dark wings dropped
from their bodies and aimlessly excitedly they
rushed hither and thither climbing over us scratch-
ing our exposed flesh with their horny claws causing
us to shake shiver and tremble with terror and
loathing

  at my first sight of them i had realized that they
were ants swarming ants equipped with temporary
wings ravenous creatures able to overwhelm us to
tear us to bits to devour us alive it was horrible
beyond words enough to drive anyone mad and
screaming fighting beside ourselves we staggered
backward inch by inch away from the main cloud of
the ants still we remained unharmed untouched un-
bitten not one of the myriads of hurrying creatures
had offered to molest us and gradually our first mad
terror decreased and a measure of confidence returned
to us we might yet live to escape the main body
of ants had passed on the thousands that had fallen
had scattered and were intent on hurrying away and
now only a few were dropping down from above but
we were almost smothered in their cast-off wings
wings lay six inches deep over the ground and cov-
ered the brush-like icy snow

  then common sense returned to me and i remem-
bered that swarming ants are almost as harmless as
swarming bees that they are far too much occupied
with their own affairs and their new queens to bother
with anything else and that our danger-if ever there
had been any-was over

  the swarm had passed on only a slender line of
laggards streamed across the sky above us and glanc-
ing back i saw for the first time that they rose
from the locality of the dome-shaped structures i had
seen
the world of the giant ants



  was it possible these were giant ant-nests that
the swarming insects had issued from them avoid-
ing the few hurrying ants that remained under foot
swinging to one side out of the reach of chance
stragglers from above i hurried towards the spot i
had seen presently we left the brush behind and be-
fore us saw the group of bee-hive-like objects there
was no doubt of it they -were ants nests ants were
scurrying about them winged ants were still issuing
from the apertures and were taking flight but they
were ants quite distinct from any we had hitherto
seen they were far smaller they were frailer weaker
things and their undersized blunt mandibles convinced
me that they were no fighters and that we were not
in any great danger from them at our approach a
few turned from their duties and rushed towards us
but the instant they came within scent of our per-
sons they turned tail and scurried off evidently as
much afraid of us as we had been of their swarming
fellows in color they were a peculiar greenish-gray
a most unusual shade for ants and i wondered how
with such small dull jaws they could hold their own
how they erected such huge structures and what they
depended upon for food by now the last of the
winged ants had vanished and the others had retreated
to their homes evidently having been warned of the
presence of unknown beings by the ants who had
first inspected us stepping closer to better examine
the great rough-surfaced mounds i discovered that
instead of being constructed of mud or earth they
appeared to be formed of some woody substance pos-
sibly i thought it was a material akin to paper such
as the paper made by hornets and taking out my
hunting-knife i chipped off a bit of the surface i
gave vent to an ejaculation of surprise under the
dull-gray outer surface my knife had exposed a green
sappy interior

  it was exactly as if i had cut away a bit of the
outer bark of a living tree

a moment later i knew that this was the case
here and there upon the surface of the structures
small shoots were sprouting out about the bases
of the nests i found slender roots and on one were
a number of good-sized fleshy leaves the things were
not artificial they were living natural vegetable
growths like the famous ant-tree of java they were
distorted bulbous pithy roots of some tree or plant
within which the ants dwelt

  greatly i longed to examine the interiors to de-
termine whether they were filled with natural cham-
bers and galleries like the javanese ant-tree or whether
the ants had tunnelled their own passages and rooms
but the apertures were far too small to admit my
body-even had i wanted to enter-and i knew it
would be a hopeless task to attempt to dissect one of
the tough gnarled roots with my knife as i stood
there examining the huge warty root and trying to
place its family botanically i decided that it was
not a root at all but the short stocky trunk of some
unknown genius in some ways very much like the
yaretta plant of the high andean deserts and which
is used extensively as fuel like the yaretta it grew
in dome-shaped masses like the yaretta the leaves and
flowers were insignificant and sprouted directly from
the bark and for all i knew or could determine it
might like the yaretta belong to the celery family
presently too i realized that my right hand felt numb

  the remarkable ant-plant of java and the east indies appears to be
designed by nature as a home for ants the large tuber-like root is
filled with natural passages and chambers very similar to those of an
ants nest within these certain species of ants always dwell and
probably are beneficial to the plant

and swollen as if it had been stung or bitten by some
poisonous insect glancing at it i was surprised to see
that it was red inflamed and puffed up yet i was
certain i had not been bitten by an ant and i was
equally certain i had not been stung then the truth
dawned upon me it was the juice of the plant

  no wonder the ants were free from molestation
dwelling within this plant whose juices were so irri-
tatingly poisonous they were perfectly safe no
enemy would venture within and nature had made
them immune to the poison just as it provided them
with natural poison-filled nests wherein to dwell

  it was indeed fortunate for me that i had not at-
tempted to investigate the interior of the ants natural
dwelling place the minute quantity of sap juice or
oil which had exuded from the tiny incision i had
made had played havoc with my hand already it was
swelling rapidly pains were shooting up my arm i
felt feverish and ill i was ignorant of the nature
of the poison i did not know whether it was an
alkaloid an oil or an acid and even had i known i 
possessed no antidotes no medicines of any sort

  to continue on our way was impossible to remain
here would be worse i realized i was in for a
period of severe illness and helplessness if not death
and we must reach some shelter some spot where we
would be safe and where food could be obtained i
thought of the cave but that was far distant it
could only be reached by a stiff climb which i knew
i could not accomplish and time was pressing then
i thought of the agricultural ants their colonies were
near they were safe there was food in abundance and
i felt sure we would be permitted to return and re-
main there telling tom of my plan we hurriedly
left and headed for the nearest ant-farm until i
started to walk i did not realize how badly off i was
how weak or how feverish it was only by using my
utmost will power by forcing my muscles to act that
i could set one foot before another tom was all
anxiety solicitous of my welfare and did everything
possible to aid me he almost carried me and he con-
stantly spoke cheering words vowing that once he got
me to the ants village he would find bush with
which to cure me had it not been for him i would
never have reached our goal i would have dropped
in my tracks to die miserably and be devoured by
the loathsome carrion-beetles by the time we saw the
walls of the agricultural-ants ahead of us the whole
right side of my body was paralyzed i could scarcely
see or hear and i was hardly more than a moving
corpse with amazing speed tom stretched my ham-
mock in the shade just within the wall and dropping
into it i lost consciousness

  how long i remained utterly dead to my surround-
ings i shall never know tom was far too busily oc-
cupied trying to save my life to keep count of days or
weeks but he won his intimate almost uncanny
knowledge of tropical medicinal herbs was my salva-
tion when i opened my eyes and regained my senses
the fever had left me the swelling of hand and arm
had gone down and tom assured me that all i needed

at every unusual thing his fear even of the friendly
agricultural-ants and his worry over me i could partly

tlie ants only for the purpose of gathering his bush
did he leave my side for a moment he did not
even possess a utensil in which to brew the herbs and
roots but was forced to pound and bruise them and
macerate them in cold water the poor fellow was thin
drawn haggard he was so emaciated he was like a
living skeleton but he was as cheerful as ever and
grinned delightedly from ear to ear as he saw me
open my eyes and knew that he had won the battle
for my life

  the first thing i did was to send him on a hunt
declaring i was perfectly safe and that meat was needed
as much for his benefit as for mine he demurred at
first but finally went off to return very soon with
two of the hares

  regardless of the ants we kindled a fire and sofm
tom was gnawing ravenously at the broiled meat and
i felt new strength coursing through my veins as i
partook of the tenderer tidbits-the livers and hearts
of the creatures

  the ants tom informed me when he had at last
satisfied his hunger and could talk had been most
friendly seeing tom helping himself to their stores
which he did with trembling limbs and terror-filled
mind for fear they would resent his act they had reg-
ularly brought corn and grain to the spot where we
were camped evidently to them we were a new kind
of inquilines dependent upon their bounty but they
had not brought honey as tom had hoped they might

and despite my demonstration of the bees harmless-
ness he could not summon enough courage to attempt
to rob their hive his greatest fear had been of the
giant bumble-bees and the savage carib-beetles and
he still quakes with unreasoning terror whenever one
of these savage-looking but docile creatures comes
near

  my convalescence has been rapid but i have not
yet regained sufficient strength to walk about or to
sit up for long but time has not hung heavily on
my hands for i have busied myself writing these
notes of our experiences so far although i do not
expect any living man ever to read them

  i have practically abandoned all hopes of escaping
from this place and i am resigned to whatever fate
may have in store for me here i might be far
worse off and with faithful tom for company i feel

sure i could endure life and even find a measure of
contentment here for years

  i have said that a month had elapsed since last i
recorded anything in my note book but that is merely
guess work it may have been three weeks or six
since we entered the valley it seems years ago to
me i wonder what our next experiences will be what
new and amazing discoveries i shall make what ad-
ventures we will have there is no more to record
at present tomorrow i shall make an effort to walk
a short distance i think we will make our home
here among the friendly ants

chapter xiii

much has happened since last i wrote in my note
book there have been many remarkable oc-
currences i have made many marvelous dis-
coveries and we have had innumerable strange adven-
tures in fact nothing that the most fertile imagina-
tion could invent nothing the wildest fiction could re-
late would begin to equal the reality

  when last i wrote i was recovering from the ill-
ness brought upon me by the poison of the strange
ant-tree during my convalescence i had thought
much upon our situation and our future and i had
decided that it was almost hopeless to expect to leave
the place i determined to make the best of things
and yet not to give up calmly but i realized that
it would undoubtedly be many months-perhaps years
-before we could find a means to escape if ever we
did and that if we were to live in anything approxi-
mating comfort and security we must have a perma-
nent home or headquarters the cave i have men-
tioned was excellent in its way but it had many dis-
advantages and having considered various locations
i decided that we could do no better than to remain
where we were with the friendly agricultural-ants
here we were in the centre of things so to speak
we were safe from enemies for none dared trespass
where the giant bumble-bees were ever on guard there
was abundant game within reach and the ants grain
corn and honey were also available moreover i had
become rather attached to the good-natured hard-
working peaceful ants whose hospitality had stood us
in such good stead thus have i decided and tom
agreed with me for he too liked the ants and no
longer feared them we started work on erecting a
hut to shelter us for i felt sure that before long we
would have rainy weather with torrential downpours
to erect a fairly comfortable shack is an easy matter
in the tropics and although my strength had not fully
returned i was quite able to perform much of the
lighter work while tom could gather the material and
do the heavier work the hut as we planned it was
to be of the indian type an affair of bamboo cane
and small posts with the framework fastened together
with bush rope of lianas vines and with a shingled
roof of palm leaves i had helped to construct scores
of such shelters and tom was perfectly familiar with
their erection for they are widely used by the west
indians very soon he had collected the material re-
quired and with my help the corner-posts and frame-
work were set up without any difficulty

  as we worked the ants seemed greatly interested
but whether they were merely curious or whether they
mildly resented our taking possession of their land
and placing a house thereon i could not feel sure but
on the third day when the shelter had begun to as-
sume the form of a building they became quite excited
they examined the hut from every side climbed over
it and presently hurried off imagine my astonish-
the world of the giant ants



ment when a short time later they came trudging
back each ant carrying a load of stick mud with
which they immediately began plastering the shack
nothing i had seen had surprised me so greatly not
only had they recognized the structure as a house
but they had decided to aid us and to complete our
shack in the manner which they considered proper
of course it may have been nothing more than their
instinct their natural tendencies to construct mud
buildings excited by seeing a framework suggestive of
such a building but i prefer to think that it was
their almost human intelligence and their kindly hos-
pitable desire to aid us at any rate the work went
on apace and in an incredibly short time we found
ourselves in possession of a mud-walled snug home
far more elaborate and solid than we had planned at
first i feared that our ant neighbors might carry mat-
ters still farther and turn their attentions to the in-
terior of the edifice but either they thought that that
was a matter for ourselves or else they reasoned that
as we had not elected to use their cell-lined buildings
such things were not adapted to us but if they very
wisely refrained from furnishing our home with tiers
of pigeon-hole-like cells they were not yet through with
us no sooner had they completed plastering the hut
to their satisfaction than they began bringing corn
and grain and storing it within the shack in fact
i began to fear that they had mistaken our purpose
and had assumed that we were building a storehouse
and that they would fill it to overflowing and force us
either to sleep in the open or to erect a second dwell-
ing enough was as good as a feast and not knowing
how to induce them to cease provisioning our new
home i decided to try a gentle hint and slung our
hammocks within the dwelling this had the desired
effect and at last the helpful ants withdrew and left
us in sole and undisputed possession of our own home
and supplies it was very evident however that to
their minds we were helpless creatures true inquilines
who must be humored and cared for daily they
brought us food and i was highly amused when one
of the creatures appeared lugging in a huge squirm-
ing larva and deposited it beside tom evidently think-
ing that all meat was alike to us indeed it was a
constant puzzle to the ants as to why we should devour
some forms of animal life and not others and almost
daily they brought offerings of dead or living insects
one of the big carib-beetles had taken up his abode
with us and although his overpowering odor was most
unpleasant and he was far from welcome on that
account we permitted him to remain needless to
say we found a ready means of disposing of the well
meant but superfluous offerings by feeding them to
the ever-hungry beetle

  by the time i had fully recovered my strength and
felt able to go about and take long walks we had
become thoroughly accustomed to dwelling among these
ants we had even grown to distinguish individuals
at first they all looked precisely alike now however
we realized that there were slight differences one
would have a slightly malformed antenna or foot an-
other would be a shade lighter or darker on abdomen
than thorax or vice-versa another would possess tiny
warts or pimples and so on indefinitely to amuse
ourselves we had given many of them nicknames we
had a tom a bill a jerry a pat a daddy long-legs
a fatty a skinny and many others while one unusu-
ally dark colored individual who was particularly
assiduous in its attentions had been dubbed nigger
baby by tom moreover the swarming or emergence
season was over for the year and there was no change
in the personnel of the colony

had also learned much about the family and social
life of these strange ants among other things i
had discovered that we were not the only inquilines
by any means within their multitudinous chambers
i had come upon a regular entomological collection of
these easy-going lazy self-appointed guests there
were moths caterpillars beetles flies hemiptera neu-
roptera hymenoptera and even snails i learned that
the larvse of the carib-beetles were inquilines and
that the big bumble-bees had their homes in the ants
burrows reminding me of the burrowing owls who
dwell with the prairie-dogs and i came to the con-
clusion that it was this close association rather than
true domestication which had led to the savage beetles
and ferocious bees positions among the ants but by
far the most surprising and interesting of the in-
quiline were other ants i had never heard or
known of ants maintaining other ants as inquilines
and i considered i had made a truly remarkable ento-
mological discovery these ant-inquilines were a very
distinct species and genus and in many ways more
closely resembled termites than true ants

  they were soft-bodied colorless creatures owing no
doubt to the fact that they never emerged from the
underground chambers and as might be expected in
the case of such creatures they were perfectly blind
in size they were slightly larger than the ants whose
swarming had so nearly overwhelmed us being about
two feet in length and they were exceedingly sluggish
in their motions but they possessed a most remark-
able habit of burrowing or digging they were liter-
ally born miners and whenever one of the creatures
was placed on soft earth or found itself in a strange
spot it would instantly commence digging like mad
until it had completely vanished within its new bur-
row at first i was puzzled as to the food eaten by

  these white ants or termites they are not true ants are among
the most destructive of creatures in the tropics unseen and uusus
pcctcd they will completely devour the interior of a board timber or
piece of furniture and the first warning of its condition will be when
it collapses in a shower of dust in a remarkably hort time they will
riddle a good-sied plank or timber and completely ruin it voluntarily
they never expose themselves to light but remain in the darkness of
their chambers and passages gnawed in wood

these ghost-like inquilines for i saw no stores of
grain or other food near them but soon i solved this
riddle and in so doing was more than ever impressed
and amazed at the unfathomable ways of nature in
several of the chambers i had noticed great globular
objects hanging from the roofs at first i took them
for the nests of some inquiline some wasp or hornet
and i rather avoided going too near them then
quite by accident i bumped my head against one of
the objects and as i drew hastily back expecting an
angry hornet to emerge and resent my actions i was
astonished to see the thing move slowly along the
ceiling in the dim light it had a most remarkable
effect and approaching closely i discovered that the
thing was alive the globular mass was the enorm-
ously distended and swollen abdomen of an ant vso
large was the abdomen in proportion to the rest of
the insect that its head thorax and feet were almost
invisible and the three-foot body appeared suspended
by a stem like a gigantic apple rather than supported
by legs and feet the contact with my head had dis-
turbed the weird creature and from tiny orifices be-
tween the widely separated and stretched segments of
the abdomen a thick fluid with a sickly-sweetish odor
was exuding

  there was no question as to its identity it was
one of those strange honey-ants those remarkable
insects who fed and waited upon by its fellows be-
comes filled with a peculiar matter resembling honey
until so distended that it is practically helpless it
becomes a living honey-pot and provides a source of
food for its more active companions

  to have found a colony of honey-ants even of such
immense size would not have surprised me greatly
but to find such honey-ants in the home of the agri-
cultural-ants was most remarkable that it was not
a member of these i felt positive and i came to the
conclusion that it too was an inquiline and that in
return for its bed and board it provided the agricul-
tural ants with its syrupy secretion but i was
destined to make an even more surprising discovery
as i was examining the creature and its fellows sev-
eral of the blind white digger-ants came into the
chamber and climbing up the walls made their way
unerringly to the honey-ants and proceeded to help
themselves to the contents of the latters abdomens

   this then was the food of these pale-bodied sight-
less creatures inquilines themselves they were pro-
vided with food by other inquilines who in turn were
maintained by the rightful denizens of the place here
indeed was a matter for entomologists to puzzle over
for evolutionists to explain had the honey-ants been
the first inquilines and had the blind diggers taken
advantage of their presence had the reverse been
the case and had the agricultural-ants introduced the
honey-containers to feed their other inquilines or
was it all a matter of evolution of nature creating
or developing one insect to support another and
what did it all mean of what benefit were the pale
sickly looking burrowing ants to the agricultural-ants
what purpose did the honey-ants sei-ve as far as the
agricultural-ants were concerned and why should the
industrious busy intelligent agriculturalists support
these lazy apparently useless inquilines within their
homes personally i could find no answer but i felt
that somewhere in some manner the owners of the

many species of ants arc prized by the natives as delicacies the
queens of the biff drougher leaf-carrying ants of tropical america arc
eagerly hunted and eaten by the indians the queens bodies are enor-
mously distended with eggs and have a sweet rich flavor much like
condcnscd milk the true honey-ants are very different certain mem-
bers of the colonics of these ants remain quiescent and are fed and
gorged by their fellows their abdomens swell to huge size and become
filled with a peculiar honey-like material which provides food for the
other members of the colonies they are in effect living honey-pots

burrows must benefit by the presence of these and
other inquilines and that the whole involved affair
must be the result of a purposeful scheme of an all-
wise creator

   i have hitherto spoken of the agricultural ants as
friendly peaceful creatures but by this i do not mean
they were inoffensive or cowardly

  on the contrary i found them most valiant and
courageous when necessity arose and once their temper
and fighting spirit were aroused they became possessed
with an almost insane fury the first occasion on
which i discovered this trait was a few days after i
was able to be about i had taken a short walk along
the roadway leading from one colony to another and
was perhaps a mile from our shack when my atten-
tion was attracted by thrashing crackling sounds is-
suing from a thicket near the path cautiously for i
had no desire to walk blindly into danger i approached
the spot beyond the thicket was a small open space
and within this two creatures were engaged in a ter-
rific duel to the death so rapid were their move-
ments that for a moment i could not be sure of their
identities except that they were ants but as for
an instant they drew apart and awaited another op-
portunity to rush at each other i saw that one was
a member of the agricultural-ants community while
the other was an enormous red warrior with huge
terrible jaws overgrown head and powerful legs he
was of a species i had not before seen but that
he was one of the fighting or soldier caste and no
ordinary worker was obvious as he stood there
reared on his hind legs his big head thrust forward
and his terrible jaws opened threateningly he reminded
me of the pictures of old roman gladiators and if he
represented the helmeted sword-armed gladiator then
i might say the other represented the fisherman
gladiator with net and trident that the latter stood
any sort of a chance against his powerful fighting-
machine foe seemed unworthy of consideration and
for a moment i was tempted to come to our friends
aid by firing a pistol bullet into the warrior facing
him but i was rather anxious to witness the out-
come of the fray and decided to withhold my inter-
ference until i saw that the agricultural-ant was get-
ting the worst of it the next second they rushed
the big warrior fairly hurled himself forward and i
held my breath my nerves atingle with excitement
expecting to see our champion thrown mortally
wounded to the earth

   but what the farmer lacked in brute strength and
power was made up for by his superior intelligence
and agility lowering his head he dashed in like a
flash and like a football player tackled his enemy
low the very impetuosity of the others rush was
against him he stumbled over his adversary his
great jaws clashed murderously but harmlessly and
as he sprawled headlong on the earth i saw that our
friend had severed one of the soldiers legs as he had
rushed beneath him but the warrior was not crippled
or out of the fight by any means before the agri-
cultural-ant could turn he was on his feet and mad
with rage was rushing at the other one nip with
those giant jaws and all would be over but with a
quick side leap our friend escaped the others vicious
side-swiping mandibles and wheeling like a flash he
flew at his enemys rear and snapping right and left
tore great pieces from his foes abdomen before the
latter could turn however things were not going
entirely in his favor the other swung about caught
the agricultural-ant before he could escape or dodge
and for a moment the two were a whirling writhing
confused mass of swinging legs snapping jaws and

records and my experiences in the order of their
occurrence as far as i can co-ordinate them in my
memory

  it was a few days after the ant duel that i took
my first long tramp -with tom our object being to
explore a spot on the mountain where tom had dis-
covered a small waterfall or series of waterfalls de-
scending through a narrow gorge or cleft in such
a spot there might be a chance of climbing out as
soon as the next dry season came on and the water
vanished by now i had forgotten to note the wet
season was evidently near at hand as i had suspected
it would be although no heavy rains had fallen we
had had a few showers the summits of the moun-
tains half way to their bases were hidden in clouds
and from the increased flow of the streams and he
innumerable trickling rills on the mountain sides i
knew that heavy rains must be falling on the moun-
tain tops and probably on the country beyond the
ridges

  the ants too were preparing for the rainy season
they had harvested all their crops had worked over
the soil and had planted their seeds and young plants
constantly too they were adding to the plastering
of walls and buildings and a small army of the
creatures was busily engaged in digging trenches
about their fields evidently designed to carry off the
surplus water when the torrential rains arrived

  our route that day was new and as we walked along
traversing a pleasant rolling district covered with
dense forest and cut by many streams i noticed that
the insect life had altered greatly with the advance
of the seasons butterflies and moths were very scarce
there were no caterpillars seen but we noticed in-
numerable cocoons and chrysalids attached to trees
limbs and bushes some of the former were composed
of such delicate thin tough silk that we determined
to secure them  our return for they would serve
excellently for blankets and for garments we would
very soon be in dire need of clothing and i had already
given considerable thought to the problem of making
new wearing apparel to replace our worn and tattered
rags i had thought of many things but here ready-
made for us was tough strong cloth which only needed
to be cut and sewed into form to provide excellent
clothing

  bees and hornets were also scarce the few beetles
we saw were arboreal species but flies gnats and
neuroptera swarmed while by far the most abundant
insects belonged to the ortlioptera a family which on
our previous trips had not appeared numerous
crickets and grasshoppers were everywhere katydid-
like insects filled the forest with their strident notes
from the tree-tops and woodland cockroaches scuttled
over the earth and dodged into hiding places on the
bark of the trees in one spot tom came to a sud-
den halt and his eyes grew wide with wonder i
could scarcely blame him in a small opening ahead
of us a shaft of sunlight cast a subdued golden-green
light and dancing about in this were a number of
beings who might well have been fairies so fairy-
like were their pale semi-transparent graceful bodies
their gauzy iridescent wings and their flowing draper-
ies that even the most prosaic and non-imaginative per-
son might have been converted to a firm belief in the
existence of woodland sprites silently as wraiths
they circled and floated in the golden haze their move-
ments orderly and rhythmic their motions graceful
and following a well defined system and  ephemeral
and unreal as a fragment of gossamer rainbow for a
long time we watched them fascinated and charmed by
their supernatural beauty and phantasmal dance and

tom found it difficult to believe me when i assured
him they were no fairies but merely a species of
may-fly enjoying their nuptial festivities during the
few short hours which nature had allotted them as
their span of life poor happy care-free beautiful
things an hour before they had been ugly crawling
acquatic larva before the day was done they would
be lying lifeless and forgotten upon the forest floor
and yet to them their lives probably seemed as long
and as filled with adventure love sorrow joy and expe-
riences as our lives seem to us

  it was after we had left the dancing fairy-like crea-
tures and my mind was occupied with thoughts on the
mysteries of life and nature that in approaching a
partly fallen tree trunk an apparent mass of dead and
dried leaves suddenly sprang into life and fluttered
off on dull-orange and purple wings tom promptly
collapsed and sat staring incredulously lordy he
ejaculated ah boun say chief there been plenty
obeah roun bout here the fairies a- dancin back
there they been dead leafs a- turnin to butflies
an ah aint goin be surprise no more if one o tha
trees turns into a elphant or a man no sir ah-

as if to test his statement and to bear out his ex-
pectations a limb of the tree suddenly came to
life and raising itself on legs and rearing up a long-
neck topped with goggle eyes it peered searchingly
into toms face the sudden transformation of ap-
parent dead leaves into butterflies had been surprising
enough to tom although i had recognized them as
a species closely related to the tropical kalimas those
most remarkably camouflaged of all protectively-colored
butterflies or lepidoptera-

  but to be taken at his word and to see a rough
bark-covered limb of the tree come to life before his
eyes was too much for tom he was too astonished
to move too amazed even to be frightened he sat
there eyes staring and rolling wide lips parted jaw
sagging and had such a thing been possible i verily
believe his kinky wool would have stood on end it
was an astounding thing to see leaves become butter-
flies but once they had become animated they were
obviously and unmistakably butterflies but the limb
although indisputably alive was still to all intents and
appearances a tree branch

  it was the same color it was covered with the same
mottled lichen-dotted bark slender twigs took the place
of legs a small warty knob formed the head and the
grave serious-looking eyes seemed nothing more than
imperfections on the end of a twig having apparently
satisfied itself that tom was harmless or perhaps as-
sured that the negros boast was not to be taken seri-
ously the animated limb moved slowly deliberately
along the trunk for a few yards halted raised itself
at an angle and instantly became transformed into a
limb indistinguishable from those about it i was
convulsed with laughter at toms expression it seemed
an incredible an impossible thing to him something
supernatural and savoring of witchcraft was taking
place but after my first momentary surprise at the
great size of the apparition it seemed perfectly natural
to my eyes it was as i knew merely one of those
strange almost weird orthoptera commonly known as
walking-sticks or stick-insects which have been
formed and fashioned by nature to exactly imitate
a twig or branch for their self-protection they are
among our commonest woodland insects in the north

   many common butterflies simulate leaves when at rest the moet
remarkable case of protective coloration as it is called among butterflies
is the kalima the under surfaces of the wings are colored and veined
like a dead leaf and are of the same shape when folded when at rest
the kalima assumes the exact position and location of a leaf upon a twig
and is almost distinguishable from the true leaves about it
the world of the giant ants



especially in late summer and autumn and they are
fairly abundant in the tropics our own species reach
a length of six inches or more i had seen and collected
specimens over a foot in length in the tropics but
here was a giant at least twelve feet long i tried to
explain the matter to tom but until i approached the
harmless creature and prodded it with a stick forcing
it to come to life again he refused to believe it was
merely a curiosity of the insect-world i wondered
as at last we left the giant walking-stick to itself if
these big fellows went through the same seasonal
transitions as their small northern cousins i won-
dered if they were green and soft in the spring if
they simulated the luxuriantly growing and budding
branches during the summer and if they turned russet
and yellow and ended their lives by dropping earth-
ward with the falling leaves in the autumn as the
northern species do

  also i was somewhat surprised that we had not
come upon any representatives of those even more
remarkable and astonishingly-protected creatures the
walking-leaves or leaf-inseets they are mainly
tropical and are noted for the exactitude with which
the veins of their wings the foliate legs and the mark-
ings upon them match the leaves among which they
rest no doubt we had passed near many of them
without discovering their presence but thought of
them did not make me any easier in my mind they
are carnivorous creatures very savage and bloodthirsty
and if they grew to the gigantic proportions one might
reasonably expect in this place they might prove far
from harmless

  i did not at all relish the idea of being suddenly
pounced upon by a hungry leaf-insect or mantis several
yards in length and i kept a sharp watch for sus-
picious-looking clusters of leaves as we proceeded on
our way

  so intent was i on avoiding possible attacks from
such sources that we very nearly came to grief we
were passing under some unusually large trees draped
with tangled lianas and gigantic air-plants when tom
sniffed audibly mus be a mighty sweet flower roun
bout he remarked

  i also noticed the almost sickish sweetness in the
air now that he mentioned it but overpoweringly sweet
odors from blossoms are so common in the tropical
forests that i gave little heed to it the next moment
tom gave a yell like a comanche and almost bowled
me over as he dashed from behind the tree

  wa la he exclaimed tha mos surely been obeah
bout here ah been went for pick tha flower an he
turn to snake an try for nip me

  laughing at toms fears and supposing that he
had come upon some other protectively-colored insect
i stepped around the tree covering a fleshy-leaved
vine depending from the tree-top were clusters of
strange blossoms

  in color they were dull purple and russet with
golden-yellow striping and the sweet odor emanating
from them was cloying in its heavy sickish perfume
in form the flowers suggested orchids and the stems
and leaves of the vine were very similar to those of
a gigantic vantilla vine tom maintaining a safe dis-
tance in my rear and ready to turn and run at an
instants notice repeated his assertion that when
he had attempted to secure one of the flowers it had
turned into a serpent and had struck viciously at
him such a thing i knew was impossible even in
this land of many surprises but i felt that there

  in borneo a species of mantis is colored and formed to exactly imi-
tate the flower of a handsome orchid lying motionless among the
leaves the creature pounces upon butterflies and other insects which
mistake him for an orchid flower

must be some basis for his terror and that in all
probability some insect was concealed among the blos-
soms or foliage

  possibly i thought there might be a real snake
there and i had no intention of taking any chances
of being bitten but despite my most painstaking
scrutiny of the vine and its odorous flowers i could
detect no signs of animal life telling tom to indi-
cate which flower he had approached i extended my
bill-hook spear until the point touched the blossom
instantly from behind the petals five long green ten-
tacles shot out and entwined themselves about the
spear thunderstruck at this phenomenon i attempted
to withdraw my weapon only to find it held irresistibly
by those clinging tentacles with all my strength i
tugged and wrenched but my efforts were futile
slowly the tentacles contracted and the spear was
drawn towards the centre of the flower while the
petals folded inwards closing like the segments of an
orange-peel dredge-bucket then as the tip of the
weapon touched the surface of the blossom the petals
flew back the green tentacles released their grasp and
i sprawled backward overbalanced by the sudden free-
ing of the spear

it was toms turn to laugh and he took full ad-
vantage of the opportunity i certainly could not
blame him for having been frightened and for having
mistaken the tentacles for snakes and while i knew
that the tentacles were vegetable and not animal i
was fully aware of the narrow escape tom had had
if those powerful tendrils had seized him there would
have been no escape for there was no doubt that the
plant was carnivorous that it was as relentlessly
bloodthirsty and savage as any wild beast and that the
sweet beautiful blooms were designed to lead unsus-
pecting creatures to their destruction

  the whole thing was a marvelously designed and
perfected trap any object touching or approaching
the flowers was instantly seized by the concealed ten-
drils coiled behind the handsome petals and was
drawn to the flowers centre and enfolded by the petals
where if the capture was a living creature it was
digested and devoured by the plant or if inedible as
in the case of my spear it was cast aside even as
we watched a huge green-bodied fly flew towards the
clustering flowers and alighted on the velvety-looking
petals the next instant he was buzzing and strug-
gling helplessly in the grasp of the tendrils and was
being drawn towards the centre of the blossom that
had attracted him a moment more and the flower had
closed and the unfortunate insect had been added
to the list of the plants victims

  but a fly even a giant two feet in length was
scarcely more than a morsel for the plant although
as greedily seized and eaten as a peanut by an ele-
phant

  unquestionably the normal food of the strange vine
was insects for there were no other forms of animal
life except the gigantic lizards and an occasional tree-
frog which could fall into its trap but its tendrils
were strong and powerful enough to capture and hold
a man and as i looked more closely at the flowers i
saw that the inner surfaces of the petals were cov-
ered with sharp barbed thorns which would anchor
a body immovably once the petals had closed over

  many plants are carnivorous our common northern pitcher-piant
has leaves which contain water and which are lined with hairs so ar-
ranged that insects may crawl in but cannot emerge attracted by a
sweetish secretion of the leaves flies and other insects enter to find
themselves prisoners and eventually die and drop into the water where
they decay and are absorbed by the plant the venus fly trap plant
also devours insects closing its trap-like leaves upon them in the
tropics carnivorous plants and flowers arc even more common and many
carnivorous orchids are known	-

it i had during my travels seen many strange
carnivorous plants but even aside from its enormous
size i saw nothing to compare with this flower for
devilish deception and deadliness

  very fortunately for us the things activities were
confined to its immediate vicinity beyond reach of
its tentacles there was no danger however i had a
peculiar horror of the plant and an irresistible feeling
that it might dash at us as we passed and we gave
it a wide berth as we at last continued on our way

  very little transpired during the balance of that
day we met nothing more that was especially note-
worthy or remarkable and we had no further adven-
tures once to be sure we had a distant glimpse of
one of the giant iguanas but he was too intent on
chasing a hare to see or scent us and vanished from
sight in the jungle evidently these creatures were far
from abundant for which i was duly thankful for
we had seen only two-or perhaps we saw the same
individual twice

  when soon after mid-day we reached the cataract
we found far too much water flowing down the gorge
to make a thorough examination of its possibilities as
a msans of egress from the valley from a distance
it had appeared a mere cascade but when we got
close we found it a truly impressive waterfall thun-
dering down for hundreds of feet but from the
formation of the rock and what i could judge by a
careful scrutiny of the gorge it held a promise once
the dry season returned it was certainly the best
and most encouraging prospect we had yet found

  our return to the ant-colony was also without inci-
dent except for one discovery which at the time seemed
of little importance in one spot we came upon a
great pile of rotting leaves and vegetation evidently
of artificial construction upon investigation this
proved to be a nest or breeding place of those strange
bombardier-beetles one of which we had seen destroy
the giant solitary-ant which had attacked us no
adults were present for which i was grateful but
the compost pile was alive with the immature larva

  one other discovery i made which was most im-
portant to me but has little if any scientific interest
my tobacco had been exhausted for some time and on
this trip i found an excellent substitute this was the
inner bark of a tree which i take to be closely re-
lated to or identical with the kipa tree whose bark
is so widely used in place of tobacco by many tribes
of south american indians it was the similarity
of the tree to the kipa that first attracted my atten-
tion and a trial pipe-full of the shredded papery bark
proved that it was fully the equal of the kipa

  hence although our journey was without definite re-
sult from the point of view of escaping still it was
not fruitless and i felt well repaid for the days
work

chapter xiv

it was several days after our expedition to the
cataract that we had a most terrifying adventure
and a most narrow escape from an awful fate we
had turned southward and were following the course
of a good-sized stream when stopping to rest for a
few moments in a rather dense patch of forest i
noticed an unusual number of insects even during
the height of the dry season i never saw so many
insects at one time during the day but now myriads
of flying crawling hopping running and creeping
things were all about us a few late butterflies flitted
erratically past on frayed wings great green tree-
crickets whirred through the air alighting momentarily
to again spread their stiff wings and continue on

huge brown cockroaches blundered about bees and
flies buzzed and hummed beetles scurried over the
ground crickets and grass hoppers traveled by huge
leaps an ugly looking praying-mantis with his lobster-
like claws raised and clasped as if in supplication
scurried by and paid no heed to the abundant insects
about him and as if in chase of the myriad insects
and yet paying no attention to their proximity several
big warty toads and a couple of tree-frogs hopped pon-
derously past us once or twice also we caught
glimpses of fleeing hares and marmots and then with
the rush and roar of a charging rhinoceros a gigantic
dinosaur-like iguana tore through the forest

  it was as if the entire population of the place was
on the move as if every form of life was migrating
in unison and unable to account for the exodus i
noticed that all were headed in the same direction
somehow it reminded me of a picture in the geography
of my schooldays a picture supposed to represent a
prairie fire with the herds of wild horses antelopes
and other creatures fleeing from the onrushing flames
but there was no fire in the forest near us no con-
flagration of any sort to drive the denizens of the
forest en masse before it fire i felt sure had never
existed until our arrival and even had it been pos-
sible that by accident we had set fire to the forest
there was no smell of smoke nothing to indicate a
conflagration

  yet here were countless creatures all hurrying from
something and obviously terrified and seeking only
their own safety for the most ferociously carnivorous
and predatory species moved side by side with their
natural prey and made no effort to molest them even
ants were numbered in the throng and to my amaze-
ment i saw one of the giant solitary fellows hurrying
past all his savagery gone in his fear of some un-
known danger so numerous were the creatures that
to attempt to move on our way was impossible and
only by flattening ourselves against a tree-trunk could
we escape being overrun by the onrushing hordes for
perhaps ten minutes this continued then the numbers
of the creatures sensibly diminished only the slower
moving species continued to pass us and as the last
stragglers and cripples struggled along i was conscious
of a strange rapidly increasing sound from the direc-
tion whence the hordes of creatures had come it was
a roaring swishing noise more like the sound of de-
scending rain upon a roof than anything else and for
a moment i thought it was caused by a torrential
downpour upon the forest and that the deluge was
the cause of the creatures flight but the sky was
still bright there was no feel of rain in the air
for perhaps ten seconds i stood irresolute unde-
cided whether to advance or to follow the example of
the affrighted creatures and retreat then suddenly
a terrible premonition an awful fear swept over me
shouting to tom to follow i sprang forward and
rushed headlong after the fleeing insects but too
late hardly had we covered fifty yards when i leaped
back with a warning yell before me like a flowing
living stream was a vast column of gigantic ants my
worst fears were realized army-ants were on the
march no wonder the wild denizens of the forest
had fled in mad terror too late i had realized what
that roaring sound presaged thousands millions of
the voracious ants were marching through the forest
devouring every living thing in their way leaving
the country over which they had passed absolutely de-
void of life if ever we were caught by them we
would be beyond all hope and only our clean-picked
bones would remain when the army had passed on
turning hoping yet to outdistance the advancing
the world of the giant ants



as he stood there reared on his hind legs his big head thrust forward and his terrible jaws opened threateningly ho reminded mo ol on old

hordes of terrible creatures i turned and raced in the
opposite direction with tom at my side ten twenty
fifty yards we covered and then converging upon us
came the other far-flung wing of the ant army we
were surrounded hemmed in to try to break through
that cordon of five-foot creatures creatures as large
as wolves a hundred times more ravenous a thousand
times more fearless more powerful and more immune
to injuries or attack was suicidal and now apallingly
close at hand we could hear the sounds of countless
millions of advancing bodies the ceaseless clashing of
countless millions of terrible jaws blending into a uni-
form swishing roar yelling orders at the top of my
lungs resorting to our last hope i franctically gath-
ered leaves and twigs while tom terrified beyond
speech but mechanically obeying did the same piling
them in a heap i touched match to them with shaking
hand and praying as i had never before prayed that
the leaves might ignite that fire and smoke might yet
save our lives never had leaves seemed so loth to
take fire shaking until my teeth chattered i held the
flickering match while close upon me i heard the first
of the advancing ants by the time the leaves ignited
and the flames darted up the foremost ants were
within a dozen paces blind as they were depending
wholly upon the senses of smell and hearing the
fearful creatures turned towards us unerringly but
as the pungent reeking smoke reached them they
halted and as though at a spoken word of command
the whole vast army in their rear came instantly to
rest it was a brief respite and madly we availed
ourselves of the few short seconds regardless of
burns scarcely sensible of the heat and pain we

grasped handfuls of the blazing leaves and twigs and
hurled them towards the ants some of the creatures
scorched and half-suifocated squirmed and twisted in
agony others hurried in a frenzyto one side while
the bulk moved deliberately as with one accord a
few paces backward by now the fire had spread and
all about us the forest floor was smouldering burning
sending up a dense choking smoke and breaking into
little spurts of flame where the leaves were thicker or
drier than elsewhere

nphe army was checked even the fearless irresist-
a ible ants dared not cross that hot smoking area
but we had no time to lose in a few moments the
thin layer of leaves the few dry twigs would be con-
sumed and once again the ants would be upon us
turning we dashed forward if we had delayed five
seconds we would have been irretrievably lost though
the main army had been checked though our fire had
thrown back the curving crescent-like vanguard or
skirmishers the leaders of that marvelously organized
army had not been out-generalled by our defense from
either side of the main body flanking parties had rap-
idly advanced and now as we rushed onward they
were hurrying at incredible speed to cut off our re-
treat less than twenty feet separated the two con-
verging columns and as we dashed for this narrow
opening panting almost insane with terror three of
the great warriors scurried forward to intercept us
at point-blank range i fired two bullets through the
head of one with all my strength i swung my taran-
tula-jaw bill-hook at the second and i saw tom lop
the head from the third with his weapon before us

the way was clear behind us came the ants in full
cry though far slower in movement than the other
ants we had met yet they were steadily gaining on
us our mad pace could not last for long we seemed
doomed to destruction when ahead we saw the gleam
of water without hesitation forgetting the perils
of possible aquatic beasts as dangerous as the ants
we plunged into the stream and with our last remain-
ing strength struck out for the further shore draw-
ing ourselves upon the bank we lay helpless gasping
for breath while the baffled ants reaching the brink
of the stream moved rapidly up and down searching
vainly for a spot to cross i felt certain we were
safe at least for a time the river was far too wide
for even the army ants to bridge but for all i
knew there might be a narrow or a shallow pot
further up or down the stream or a fallen tree might
partially bridge it it would be more than reckless to
remain long where we were but we could not pro-
ceed until we had recovered somewhat from our stren-
uous exertions and as we strove to calm our palpi-
tating hearts and to regain control of our lungs we
watched fascinated our enemy ants separated by a
scant one hundred feet from where we sat their
perseverance their organization their ingenuity were
almost uncanny

  again and again they attempted to cross the stream
by means of living bridges several of the ants would
select a firm spot on the bank and holding to roots
and bushes with their tremendous jaws would allow
their bodies to swing suspended in the air others
would rapidly clamber down these and grasping their
fellows by their jaws would extend the living chain
by their own length over these would hurry others
until link by link the bodies of the ants extended the
chain sufficiently to reach from shore to shore

  then the last ants releasing their hold of the bank
the living bridge would swing free and would be swung
outward and towards our side by the current

  several times we fairly trembled and were ready to
rise and dash off as the ultimate links of the ant-chain
seemed about to lodge against the bank where we sat
but each time the current proved too swift the living
bridge failed to make connections and the ingenious
ants were carried past us and were forced to scramble
back to safety on their own side of the river but i
felt that ultimately they would succeed and that sooner
or later a bridge would be formed and that over the
suspended bodies of their fellows the whole vast army
would come swarming to our side i had exhausted my
final cartridge both tom and myself lost our price-
less weapons when we threw them aside to swim the
stream but even unarmed and defenceless it was
better to face the dangers of the forests and jungles
than to remain so dangerously close to the ant army
at last our breaths and strength partly restored we
rose and hurried with all possible speed upstream and
towards a distant spot where we could cross the river
just above a branch which would effectively prevent
the army ants from reaching us fortunately for us
we met no dangerous creatures on our way the en-
tire district appeared to be devoid of life and i decided

   the organization and discipline of the common army ants such a
we encountered are almost incredible although blind these ants move
in regular columns send out scouts maintain a commissary and hospital
corps build bridges and manoeuver with military precision and order
members of the army that are injured are placed at one side and are
examined by the ants detailed for the purpose if too badly injured to
recover they are destroyed whereas if only slightly wounded they arc car-
ried to the rear and cared for until ablo to resume their places broken
or injured legs arc often amputated when reaching streams or fissures
the engineering corps hurry forward and form living bridges over which
the army passes

that every living creature had sensed the oncoming
army and had hurried away for safety

  spent and weary we reached the walled-in lands of
the agricultural-ants at last and never have i seen a
more welcome sight than the little group of mud
buildings our humble shack and the good-natured
peaceful ants among whom we had found refuge

tt rained quite heavily a day or two later and each
j- day the rains became heavier and of longer dura-
tion but at no time during the wet season was there
so much precipitation or such prolonged rains as in
other portions of the tropics with which i was familiar
nevertheless time hung rather heavily on our hands
for we were more or less confined to our shack and
it was hopeless to try to do any serious exploration
work in search of an exit through the mountains

  to while away our time we busied ourselves with
many matters we made a number of new and better
arrows than those we possessed and we made several
spears we also gathered a quantity of the silkiest
toughest cocoons and managed to make ourselves some
fairly serviceable garments they were of course
most ludicrous and crude for our only cutting instru-
ment was my knife and we had neither thread nor
needles but by means of bone awl and the fibres
of the cocoons ravelled out and twisted together for
thread we succeeded fairly well the clothing consisted
of baggy gaucho-like trousers which were little more
than bifurcated bags and short ponchos in place of
shirts ponchos of course were the simplest things
to make for they were nothing more than squares of
material with a slit in the centre they were very
serviceable however and as we discovered that the
outer covering of the cocoons was impervious to water
they served us excellently as raincoats too we had
become so friendly with the ants and so accustomed
to them that i jokingly slipped a poncho over one of
the creatures it was a most amusing sight to see
the big ant wearing this typically indian garment
and for a few moments he seemed rather proud of it
but it evidently was more of an impediment than an
advantage and he soon stripped it off the ants were
however vastly interested in everything we did and
we constantly had an attentive audience watching our
operation and task personally i devoted an immense
amount of time trying to establish some means of com-
munication with our hosts but i am convinced that
they either communicate among themselves by means
of vibratory waves emanating from and received by
their antennae or else by a means akin to mental
telepathy i did however make some progress by
repeatedly making use of precisely the same gestures
or signs when i did anything required anything or
wished to communicate any thought i established a
sort of sign language it was truly remarkable to find
how quickly the ants grasped the idea in a very short
time they had learned to recognize my sign for food
and as soon as i made it they would rush off and re-
turn with corn or grain from this it was but a step
to teach them one sign for corn and the other for
the threshed grain and in a month i had accomplished
wonders in the way of this primitive means of com-
munication

  it is during this time also that tom first started
keeping pets he has captured a young specimen of
the hare-like marsupial and it soon became very tame
and amused us both with its antics and its frolicksome
ways one of the porcupine-like creatures followed
soon afterwards two marmots were added to the col-
lection and one day tom returned from his traps with
a most remarkable creature which as nearly as i
the world of the giant ants



could identify it was closely related to the solendons

  having exhausted the mammalian inhabitants of the
region i suggested to tom that we try our hands at
domesticating insects at first tom could not see any-
thing at all attractive or interesting in the idea of
making pets of the giant bugs as he still called
them but i pointed out the success of the ants in
domesticating beetles and bees and half humorously
suggested that with a body-guard of tame hornets or
other dangerous insects we would have no fear of
enemies tom took this quite seriously and he spent
a long time considering whether he would start with
a young hornet or an immature solitary ant he plied
me with innumerable questions regarding their habits
their food and where he would be likely to find a nest
which he could safely rob of the young in fpct he
appeared quite disappointed when i told him that it
would be a rather dangerous matter to attempt to
raid a solitary ants nest and that a young hornet
was a most uninteresting and helpless grub but the
discussion had given me an idea and i recalled the
bombardier-beetles nest we had found and suggested
that we visit it and if it contained young secure
some of them and try to domesticate them

not only was i curious to learn more of the crea-
tures but if it were possible to domesticate
them they would prove far better guardians than the
most ferocious of dogs by good fortune we found
the heap of fermenting material contained a number
of the beetles in the pupal stage quite capable of
movement and feeding and yet soft-bodied harmless
things and with their gas-glands and explosive ap-
paratus still undeveloped four of these we carried
back to our home and installed in a compartment by
themselves they grew very rapidly and to my sur-
prise i discovered that they were vegetable eaters in
their immature stage although carnivorous when fully
grown they also appeared amenable to domestica-
tion and i began to have high hopes that we would
find them very similar in their characters to our com-
mon skunks in the states these odorous beasts are
easily tamed and never make use of their natural
means of defense when with their masters or friends
but are quick to recognize enemies or strangers and
to make themselves both felt and smelt needless to
say our miniature menagerie was a vast source of
curiosity and interest to the ants undoubtedly they
regarded our pets as our natural inquilines and i was
greatly amused when one of them brought us several
specimens of the honey-ants with one of the big-
bellied females evidently thinking they were an essen-
tial portion of any real inquiline colony but when
we established our nursery of bombardier-beetles the
ants grew wildly excited in them of course they
recognized traditional enemies and i could well imagine
their feelings in the matter

  to them it must have been much the same as it
would be for a guest in a hotel to start rearing rattle-
snakes or cobras in his suite no doubt had they
been able to communicate with us they would have
ordered us either to rid ourselves of these newest pets
or else betake ourselves elsewhere but as it was
they merely showed their displeasure by giving us the
cold shoulder for several weeks gradually however
their curiosity overcame their fears or their dislike

   the solcndon is a most interesting and remarkable mammal which
combines characteristics of the rodents and the inscctivorac as far as
known they arc represented by only two species one inhabiting cuba
the other santo domingo in many ways they more closely resemble ter
tain fossil creatures of the pleistocene period than any living creatures
it is about fifteen inches in icngui with short neck long trunk-like nose
rat-like tail front feet like a mole extremely weak eyes and keen ears
and covered with a combination of hair wool and scales showing the
complete evolution from skin to true hair

and finding that the creatures appeared to be harm-
less they soon became as friendly as ever perhaps
reasoning that bombardier-beetles in captivity were no
more like their natural wild fellows than were the
carib-beetles or giant bees at first also we had
been much afraid that these guardians of the colony
and especially the carib-beetles would fall upon our
pets and destroy and devour them but we soon found
we had nothing to fear on that score the big ferocious
beetles were as well trained to differentiate between
friend and foe as any watchdog at home and like
our dogs they appeared to distinguish instinctively be-
tween living creatures to be attacked and those to be
left unmolested many a dog will live in perfect
amity with cats belonging to his master or mistress
and yet will fly at any strange feline and our friendly
carib-beetle and the others made no attempt to molest
any of our live stock although they would instantly
attack others of the same species in their natural
state

  they appeared to take naturally to the rapidly-
growing bombardiers and would frolic and play with
them exactly as an overgrown mastiff will frolic with
a playful puppy and never did the young bombardiers
show any tendency to use their deadly gas brought
up with us and with the ants they had no hatred or
fear and though they would rear and raise their tails
in a most threatening manner when teased or irri-
tated they always bluffed in fact they were so
good-tempered and apparently so thoroughly weaned
from their natural habits that i very much doubted
if they would prove of any value as guardians in case
of an attack and i was rather anxious to test them

  by the time they were fully grown the rains were
over and we were again able to make extensive trips
through the land several times one or more of our
pets accompanied us and as we walked along and the
bombardiers scurried about examining every nook and
cranny now and then locating and devouring some
grub or larva i rather wished that we might run
across a solitary ant just to see what our companions
would do but i had no need to come upon one of
these terrible creatures to satisfy myself as we were
passing through a patch of jungle three huge red
ants suddenly rushed at us instantly i recognized
them as of the same species i had seen duelling with
the agricultural ant remembering the savagery and
ferocity shown by the red ant on that occasion i
realized we were in the most imminent peril

  quickly fitting an arrow to my bow i discharged
the missile at short range and saw it strike fairly
between the thoracic segments of the leader of the
trio tom also transfixed one of the creatures but
the arrows seemed to have little effect other than to
halt the creatures temporarily until they could bite
off the arrow shafts the next second there was a
rush and our attendant bombardiers hurled themselves
at the enemy as instinctively as intelligently and
as efficiently as though they had never known confine-
ment the four beetles followed their natural and in-
stinctive tactics and the episode of the solitary ant was
reenacted before us i verily believe that a single
bombardier could have worsted the three red giants
but with the four of them the battle was so short
sharp and decisive that it was literally a massacre
within ten or fifteen seconds the three red ants
were stupefied dying from the bombardiers gas and
the triumphant four were gorging themselves on the
flesh of their victims i was more than satisfied
with our bombardiers accompanying us we need have
no fear of savage ants and i was also pleased to
discover that the beetles did not draw the line at any

one species of ant but attacked the red fellows as
quickly as the black solitary ants tom was tre-
mendously elated and enthusiastic and he declared
emphatically that he believed our pets could vanquish
an entire army of the army-ants but when it came
to getting the bombardiers in hand once more we had
no little trouble indeed for a time it looked as if
we might have to leave them to revert to their natural
lives their savage fighting instincts had been aroused
temporarily they had forgotten they were supposedly
domestic animals and they turned on us savagely rear-
ing up opening their jaws and lifting their tails as
if about to attack us with a discharge of their deadly
gas but tom oddly enough considering his fear of
wild animals appeared to be absolutely unconscious
of danger in the case of his pets talking to them a
he might to a rebellious dog or a fractious horse he-
advanced boldly slapped the creatures with his big
black paws grabbed them by the necks and half-urged
half-dragged them away from their unfinished feast i
fairly gasped expecting the beetles to turn on him
but evidently they recognized their master and finding
they could not frighten him they submitted and trotted
along beside us as docile as ever

it was upon the return from this trip that we met
with the most exciting event that had as yet
transpired on our way back towards the ant colony
we came upon a column of the leaf-carrying or drough-
er-ants they made no effort or attempt to attack us
but our bombardier-beetle companions went at the

fig -a worker of palyergus lucidus the shining amazon

moving column with a concerted rush i had ex-
pected to see them overwhelmed or destroyed for
hundreds of the droughers were hurrying along their
pathway unquestionably i thought they would destroy
a few of the ants but even their agility their ferocity
and their deadly gas could not combat hundreds of the
ants but i had yet to know the fear the bombardiers
inspired in the minds of their natural prey no sooner
had our pets leaped to the attack than the hurrying
ants abandoned their burdens and scattering in every
direction made good their escape leaving their fellows
to their fates

  in one respect however the leaf-carriers had an
advantage over the bombardiers they were far more
agile and quicker in their motions than the solitary
ants or the big red fellows and they were of a race
that deemed discretion the better part of valor in-
stead of stopping to give battle they turned and ran
and only one unfortunate overpowered by the bom-
bardiers gas fell a victim to the beetles ferocity as
we waited for our allies to satisfy their insatiable ap-
petites for ant flesh my attention waa attracted to the

objects the fleeing ants had dropped to my amaze-
ment i discovered they were ears of corn where had
the ants secured these what were they doing with
them the answer to my mental query flashed across
my brain instantly the droughers were inveterate
thieves in other countries as i knew in a single
night they will carry off a bag of rice or a sack of
corn kernel by kernel there was no wild corn here
there could be but one explanation they had been
robbing our friends the agricultural-ants there had
been a raid and probably a battle had our friends
been defeated had they been destroyed i feared
the worst and calling to tom and regardless of their
resentment beating and luring our bombardiers into
obedience i hurried in the direction of our hut

chapter xv

it was even worse than i thought during our
absence the droughers had swept down upon tho
peaceful agriculturalists and had left death and
destruction in their wake that the owners of tho
property had put up a stiff fight was evident every-
where dead and dying ants were lying about and
there were far more bodies of the raiders than of
the agriculturalists

  no doubt their insect allies had aided them in their
defense but against the hordes of leaf-carriers re-
sistance had been futile as i glanced about at the
victims of the battle i noticed several of the big
red warriors i have mentioned for a moment i was
puzzled as to their presence among the raiders then
as i examined them more carefully and discovered
that they were of the same species as the droughers
i realized the truth they were the soldier-caste of
the robbers professional fighters no wonder the
agriculturalist had flown at the red warrior he had
met in the forest he had recognized him as an arch
enemy and had known that he was a scout spying
upon the agricultural ants homes and that had he not
been destroyed he would have carried word to his
fellows

  unquestionably cso the three whom we and our
bombardiers had destroyed had also been scouts no
doubt scores of other scouts had been lurking about
for days and the attack had been most carefully
planned very probably i thought our presence had
troubled the raiders and they had deferred their at-
tack until we had absented ourselves i was rather
puzzled to account for the fact that i had never seen
any of the big warriors accompanying the leaf-carriers
on their legitimate business and i came to the con-
clusion-which i later found was correct-that the
fighting individuals invariably remained in their homes
except when required for actual warfare or scouting
obviously too they were not numerous for which i
was most thankful for had their numbers equalled
those of their working fellows life would have been
impossible in the forests

  fortunately too the raiders were strictly vegetarians
and hence once they overcame the resistance of their
victims they contented themselves with taking posses-
sion of the agriculturalists stores and crops and did
not attempt to destroy the ants or their young hence
although scores of our friends had lost their lives
the bulk of the colony had sought safety in their sub-
terranean burrows where we found them huddled to-
gether frightened out of their senses and reminding
me most forcibly of human beings panic-stricken by
some catastrophe they are powerless to overcome or
avert

  but not an ear of corn or a grain of wheat re-
mained in the colony the place was stripped bare and
the world of the giant ants



our own hut had been completely cleaned out it
would be months until another crop could be harvested
and starvation faced the unfortunate ants but unless
the neighboring colonies had also been raided supplies
could be obtained from them and already the ants
assured by our presence that the enemy had gone were
hurrying off towards their neighbors in search of help

  until this time i had never fully realized the feeling
of friendliness i had for these ants i was as angry
as worked up and as upset by the raid as were the
ants themselves and yet as far as tom and myself
were concerned we were really none the worse for the
visit of the droughers but somehow it affected me
as a personal matter and my mind was filled with far
from peaceful thoughts and i was busy trying to
formulate some plan by which i might even up scores
and prevent any future raids for us two t attempt
to destroy or even attack those hordes of giant rob-
bers with their powerful fighting corps would be the
height of folly and i well knew that it would be
equally hopeless for me to attempt to induce the agri-
culturalists to carry war into the enemys country so
to say they were far too peaceful and peace-loving
to fight except in defense of their lives or property
and i had no means of conveying ideas to them even
had they been born fighters

  but there was one thing certain steps must be
taken to render the colony less open to a raid than it
was no doubt as i have said the droughers had
swept upon the colony many times in the past and
yet the victims of their attacks had never done any-
thing to prevent the robberies the low wall was no
defense and the entrances or gates were always open
to be sure the leaf-carriers could climb any wall it
would be possible to build but a higher wall would
hinder them a gate which could be closed would pre-
vent their dashing in and out freely and there was
no reason why the storehouses should not be fitted with
doors or gates which could be closed from within thus
preventing the robbers from making off with the ac-
cumulated food supplies

  i tried to convey my ideas on these matters to the
ants but of course without success but if they could
not understand my gestures or my words they were
quick to grasp an idea once they had it demonstrated
to them and they were wonderful imitators so trust-
ing they would fall-to and help us once they saw
what we were about tom and i began gathering ma-
terials and preparing to construct movable barriers
the material which seemed best adapted to our pur-
poses was bamboo it was light strong easy to cut
and handle and was i knew about the only material
we could expect to work with the hunting-knife as our
sole tool it was not difficult to build doors or gates
from the bamboo and we progressed rapidly my
method was to lay a number of lengths of the bamboo
side by side lash these together with tough vines
place a second layer across these at right angles and
lash these to the first to be sure the first door we
made and which was designed for our own home was
crude but it was strong and stout and when hung in
place by means of bark loops over pegs for hinges it
was indisputably a door in fact i felt quite sure
that it would resist the efforts of even the most pow-
erful ants and that it would prove an effective barrier
to a human being unless he were armed with an axe
needless to say the ants were intensely interested
and curious but their curiosity and interest gave
way to obvious amazement and surprise when they
saw the door in place they ran excitedly about opened
and closed it tested its strength and even tried ineffec-
tually to force it but it was not until tom and i car-

ried loads of bamboo to the vicinity of their main
storehouse and commenced work upon a second door
that they realized that it was not a device intended
solely for our own use but the moment they saw us
constructing another barricade beside their own build-
ing they understood and fell to work with a will
bringing in vines and bamboo and aiding us in every
way possible often i laughed to myself at thought of
the strange picture we must have presented working
there in the midst of the great truly terrifying-appear-
ing creatures and yet so accustomed to the ants had
we become that it seemed perfectly natural for us
to be laboring in their midst and to me at least they
no longer seemed insects rather they seemed strange
primitive but friendly savages they were wonder-
fully skillful and resourceful creatures their jaws
were as useful as saws knives and axes they were
incredibly strong and their six legs were all brought
into play at one time their intelligence too was re-
markable

ants of course are noted for their intelligence
but hitherto i had always felt that this was
much overrated and that a great deal of the supposed
intelligence of ants was in reality purely instinct
but here were ants who had never in the history of
their race seen doors or any structure of bamboo or
timber but who nevertheless were showing them-
selves far more skillful in the strange undertaking than
were we two humans by the time the door to the
granary was completed and in place the ants were
perfectly capable of constructing their own doors and
all i had to do was to indicate the opening to be
supplied with a door by placing some material beside
it i was truly amazed also at the mathematical ac-
curacy with which the creatures fitted the doors to
the openings they would scramble about apparently
aimlessly feeling the walls with their antennae and
would then build a door to exactly fit the opening
which in many cases was irregular arched or even
oval in form finally every aperture in the buildings
was equipped with a door and only the opening in the
wall remained this was an undertaking that re-
quired several days and it was while the work was
proceeding that another idea occurred to me i had
been puzzling my brain over some means of pro-
ducing a defensive wall or barrier when i thought
of our escape from the army-ants here was the solu-
tion we could construct a moat about the settlement
and the water would prove an insurmountable barrier
to the droughers the land was practically level a
good-sized stream flowed within a few yards of one
side of the fields and while it would be a tremendous
undertaking to dig a wide deep trench about the entire
colony i felt sure it would be worth the trouble and
could be done

  but it was a job that tom and myself could not
hope to accomplish the ants must do this for them-
selves and the difficulty was how to show them what i
had in mind and for what purpose the ditch was in-
tended i had seen them digging irrigating ditches-
and trenches to drain the surplus water from their
fields but how was i to make them understand that
they must dig a huge ditch completely encircling their
domain however i did not give the ants enough
credit for their intelligence or their confidence in me
digging ditches was one of their normal and everyday
occupations and i had merely to start digging to have
a husky gang of workers digging like mad wherever
i turned the earth i would have given a great deal
to have known what their ideas were what purpose
they thought i had in mind but i feel sure that

they associated the ditch with the doors and with the
recent raid and that their quick intelligences had
jumped to the conclusion that both were designed for
their own protection at any rate trench digging
went on apace and i thought as i watched the crea-
tures what wonderful aids they would prove to an
army and how easily and rapidly a regiment could
dig itself in if accompanied by a corps of these giant
insects but the next day the ants sprang a surprise
on me each ant appeared carrying one or two of
the white blind termites i had seen within the gal-
leries the instant these creatures were placed within
the trench they commenced to burrow like mad each
doing the work of several ants and fairly making
the dirt fly all the ants had to do was to carry out
the loosed earth and guide the termites and keep them
going for the pale-bodied creatures had a tendency to
stop digging as soon as they were a few feet below the
surface they were in effect living drills and i was
more astounded than ever at the resourcefulness of the
ants in thus availing themselves of the natural ten-
dencies of the termites here at any rate the in-
quilines had been forced to earn their keep several
weeks were required to complete the moat but when
it was done at last and connected with the stream
and filled rapidly with water i felt quite sure that the
colony was fairly safe from further raid by the
droughers in fact i had a rather amusing and per-
fectly convincing demonstration of the efficiency of
my trench when we returned to the gate in the wall
i had quite overlooked the fact that we would be cut
off by the moat but here we were on the wrong side
of the trench accompanied by our gang of tired ants
to tom and myself the moat was nothing it was
not over six feet in depth and barely twenty feet in
width and either of us could swim it in a few strokes
but to the ants it was an insurmountable barrier they
were as completely cut off from their homes and
friends as by a raging torrent wildly excited they
rushed up and down the banks while on the opposite
side their friends were just as troubled at seeing their
fellows unable to return to their homes

  wondering if it was merely fear of the water on
the part of the ants or if they actually were unable
to swim i plunged into the moat and after a few
strokes climbed out on the opposite side the distress
of the ants was really pitiful one poor fellow braver
than the rest tried to follow my example and was
saved from drowning by the narrowest margin it was
evident that they could not cross and not wishing to
trouble or excite them further and somewhat afraid
they might turn upon me as the author of their pre-
dicament i again swam the moat and with toms
help cut a number of bamboos and with these formed
a crude bridge hardly were the bamboos in place
before the ants rushed across them to be welcomed
by their friends as though they had been miraculously
raised from the dead to build a light strong bridge
of bamboos was our next undertaking and this we ar-
ranged like an old-fashioned draw-bridge so that it
could be raised or lowered from our side of the moat
this was a never-ending source of delight to the ants
who i feel sure made many wholly unnecessary trips
into the nearby forest merely for the sake of traversing
the bridge but i was not yet wholly satisfied i
remembered the ingenuity the army-ants had shown
in attempting to reach us by forming a living bridge
across the stream and i did not feel at all sure that
the droughers might not be equally clever all the time
we had been working on our defenses i had been think-
ing trying to evolve some plan to strike a decisive
and salutary blow at the droughers how i wished i

had my medicine-kit if i had possessed a few bi-
chloride of mercury tablets or my calomel i could
have wiped out the droughers or so decimated them
that there would be no danger of attacks for years
ants as i had often demonstrated when they became
troublesome in any tropical camps are strangely affectcd
by mercurial poisoning it appears to drive them
insane and once they have tasted it they will fall upon
one another ferociously fighting to the death and as
each one swallows more of the poison as it bites its
maddened adversary an entire colony is soon destroyed
much after the fashion of the famed kilkenny cats
but i had no mercury bichloride no means of securing
any and i knew of no natural ant poison in the coun-
try bisulphide of carbon would be as efficacious as
mercury and while there was an abundant supply of
sulphur in deposits about hot springs and fumeroles
on the mountain sides i had neither the apparatus
nor the chemical skill to produce the volatile bisulphide
but the thought of sulphur gave me an idea would it
not be possible to locate the droughers nests surround
them with sulphur and setting fire to this destroy
the ants with the fumes i had no compunction about
resorting to such means despite the fact that they
were giants in size the leaf-carriers were merely ants
and it speaks volumes for the state of my mind and
the vagaries of human psychology that while i re-
garded the droughers a vermin to be destroyed by
any or all means i looked upon the agriculturalists as
friends and fellow beings

  to secure a supply of sulphur was easy enough but
to locate the homes of the droughers was a more diffi-
cult matter to be sure it would be easy to follow
their trails to their nest once the trail was found
but oddly enough during all our stay in the country
and on our innumerable trips we had not met the leaf-
carriers more than three or four times and each time
they were far from the colony of the agriculturalists
that the raiders had come a long distance i felt
sure but a long distance to us humans would be but
a short trip to the droughers who as i have men-
tioned moved at terrific speed and traveled farther in
a half hour than a man could walk in two days

moreover we had no idea where to start the
raiding ants had left no visible trail but i knew
that like bees ants returning to their nests usually
travel by the straightest most direct route and i de-
cided that our best course would be to start at the
spot where our bombardiers had attacked the raiders
and follow as nearly as possible the course they had
been taking when we had surprised them it was an
easy matter to locate the spot where we had met the
raiding droughers and after a few moments consider-
ation we decided upon the general direction they had
been following all through the first day we tramped
on nothing of any great interest transpired but we
made one or two interesting discoveries among others
we found a most interesting example of protective color-
ation-not the type whereby a defenseless creature imi-
tates its surroundings but of the more remarkable
form wherein a defenseless creature mimics in form
or color some dangerous creature quite unexpectedly
and suddenly we came upon a gigantic solitary-ant
resting quietly upon a stone at the edge of a clearing
in the forest without our bombardiers which we had
left at home fearing they might apprise the droughers
of our proximity we were practically at the mercy of
the terrible creature but apparently he had not seen
or scented us and hoping to escape his notice we
drew hastily back trying to step noiselessly but tom
unfortunately tripped upon a root and crashed back-
the world of the giant ants



ward instantly at the sound the ant was on the
alert he reared himself on his hind legs raised his
great head and swung quickly around towards us
terror-stricken i sought about for some spot some
refuge wherein we could battle against the monster
which i felt sure was about to rush at us

  then something about the creature struck me as
being peculiar i peered intently at the giant insect
and roared with laughter while tom gazed at me
apparently thinking i had suddenly gone mad the
next moment he had every reason to think i had
taken leave of my senses for i deliberately approached
the dreaded creature picked up a stone and tossed it
at him tom yelled in terror expecting the ant to
dash at me but instead the huge ferocious-looking
insect turned tail and scurried off as fast as iis six
legs could carry him he was in fact an out-and-out
fake a sheep masquerading in wolfs clothing he
was not an ant at all but a harmless beetle so in-
capable of offensive or defensive tactics that nature
had protected him from enemies by fashioning him in
the form of a solitary-ant my first close scrutiny of
the creature showed me that he possessed no powerful
mandibles although at first sight he appeared to
owing to the manner in which black and white mark-
ings were arranged about his mouth neither were his
antennae those of an ant while his seemingly slender
waist his round thorax and ant-like abdomen were all
optical illusions produced by white markings upon his
stout heavy thorax and bulky abdomen but he was
a most remarkable counterfeit and would have passed
as a true ant anywhere unless his make-up was de-
tected by the trained eye of an entomologist

  it was a short time after unmasking this fellow that
we luckily came upon an abandoned road of the leaf-
carrier although partly overgrown with weeds and
grass it was still recognizable and i had no doubt
it led to the nest and had been abandoned when the
supply of proper vegetation at its other terminus had
been exhausted i was not mistaken a few hours
later we came to a cross-road and although no ants
were visible i knew from its appearance that it was
daily in use

  i had no desire to be seen by the droughers for
memory of their giant warriors still was uppermost in
my mind although i had no fear of the ordinary
workers moreover if my plan was to be successful i
would have to approach the nest when its occupants
were at home and resting to attempt to walk about
the nest and arrange my sulphur would be impossible
with endless streams of busy ants passing back and
forth and i had no definite knowledge as to the hours
when the leaf-carriers ceased their labors and betook
themselves to their underground chambers ordinarily
i knew they were most active during the day and in
the tropics as a rule the relatives of these ants re-
tired to their nests at night but i also knew that they
frequently made raids during the night-time and on
several occasions i had found the ants passing the
day underground just what the hours of labor and
rest might be with these particular ants must be
learned by observation so making a short detour
we cautiously approached the road once more several
times we repeated this until to my satisfaction i saw
a large cleared space in the forest and in the centre
of this the enormous mounds of refuse and earth
which marked the home of our enemies from hiding
places back of the trees we watched and saw a num-

   a very common form of protective coloration among insects is that
in which a harmless species or genus imitates a dangerous or offensive
species or genus many flies bear such a close resemblance to bees that
they arc left undisturbed beetles imitate hornets and ants moths imi-
tate bees and wasps and many butterflies which are edible to birds and
other enemies arc colored to imitate noxious or inedible species

ber of the big droughers come rushing from another
pathway and vanish in one of the openings in the
mound no others were in sight none emerged and
as it was near sundown i assumed that the ants
labors were over for the day retiring to a spot at
a safe distance we ate our dinner and waited patiently
until nearly dark then we again approached the
ants nest and as no ants were visible i decided our
time was ripe treading softly for i felt sure the
ants beneath the ground would be aroused if they heard
the unusual vibration caused by our steps we worked
diligently encircling the nests with a pile of leaves
and twigs scattering sulphur among them and arrang-
ing a pile of inflammable material and sulphur in each
of the openings that led to the underground galleries
at last all was ready and striking fire i ignited the
leaves and rapidly we spread the flames from pile to
pile

  choking and coughing with the fumes of burning sul-
phur we stamped shouted and danced above the homes
of the ants anxious now to arouse them and bring
them forth then holding our breaths we dashed
through the ever-thickening fumes and took up posi-
tions of vantage on the windward side of the clearing

  our noise our pounding and the smoke had almost
instantaneous results ants by scores came pouring
struggling from their burrows but as fast as they
emerged they fell victims to the fumes of the sulphur
over their dead bodies poured others-workers war-
riors great fat-bellied queens drones and even in-
quilines the whole place was a writhing squirming
dying mass

  terrified by the fire overcome by the smoke killed
by the fumes utterly disorganized and at a loss the
ants fell by the thousand a few broke through the
encircling fire only to succumb a few yards beyond
and by the time the fire had burned out and the
last pale-blue flames of the sulphur had died down
not a living ant was visible moreover the mound
itself had caught fire and was a smouldering red-hot
mass and i knew that any ants any young or any
eggs that might remain within the chambers would be
utterly destroyed

  we had wreaked vengeance in full we had entirely
annihilated that den of robbers while there were
doubtless others in the forest i felt sure that we had
eliminated the greatest source of future raids on
our friendly agriculturalists

all went smoothly and peacefully after our return from
our successful destruction of the drougher-ants we
made several trips a the weather improved always
seeking for some means of escape it was on one
of these trips that for some inexplicable reason the
humor seized me to go out of our way and visit tho
black savages heaven knows i had no sane reason
for wishing to do so they were bestial horrible crea-
tures far less human in many ways than our clean
friendly agricultural ants and i ought to have been
content to let them mind their own business while i
minded mine but something some uncontrollable urge
led me on

  as we reached the aphis orchard we heard strange
sounds from the distance gutteral cries and most
peculiar animal-like noises wondering what could be
up and thinking the savages must be holding some
sort of dance or ceremonial we hurried towards their
village but as we came within sight of the open
area and the mound in its centre we halted abruptly
and drew quickly into the shelter of the trees before
us a terrific battle was in progress everywhere upon
the clear space about the blacks village there were
fighting struggling knots of the black savages and
light yellowish-red creatures which i at first took
to be some species of giant ant everywhere too

lay dead bodies and wounded combatants never have
i seen such savage vicious fighting not even between
the most ferocious insects and for a moment i stood
spellbound watching as if in a trance the savage
warfare before us despite their repulsiveness and
their bestial characters my sympathies were all with
the blacks for they were human at least but despite
my sympathies and my desire to aid the savages i
had no desire to throw myself into the fray i had
long ago exhausted my pistol cartridges our weapons
were crude bows and arrows and spears and-yes i
had almost forgotten it very useful slings such as
he andean indians use-and while i had no doubt
that we could give a good account of ourselves and
could injure or kill a number of the enemy still i
knew that the ultimate result would be our own de-
struction as i watched i noticed that while the
blacks used every effort to kill their adversaries the
latter appeared more anxious to capture or disable
the savages than to annihilate them

  but the most astonishing thing that which held me
spellbound and oblivious to all else was that the
strange creatures were not ants as i had at first

thought what they were i could not even imagine
in many ways they were ant-like they possessed six
legs they resembled insects in the arrangement of
thorax head and abdomen their enormous nipper-like
jaws were those of warrior ants but there all re-
semblance to ants or other insects ceased their eyes
possessed lids and instead of being fixed glassy and
expressionless like those of insects they were movable
and as capable of expression as those of a mammal
their antennae were almost rudimentary and they had
well developed ears and instead of all six legs and
feet being similar each pair differed from the others
the rear legs were heavy strong and terminated in
broad clawed feet admirably adapted for supporting
the creatures and gripping the earth the central
pair were flexible slender and ended in digited mem-
bers most astonishingly like hands while the front
pair were short immensely powerful and bore terrible
pincer-like claws somewhat like those of a gigantic
lobster moreover the creatures did not behave in the
least like ants or any other insects they stood most of
the time erect they moved swiftly and with amazing
agility upon their hind legs they used their middle
pair of limbs like hands and they wielded their front
claws like weapons that they represented an en-
tirely new order of animal life a peculiar connecting
link between the true insects and the crustaceans
seemed certain and yet their eyes and their actions
appeared to be almost those of vertebrates so in-
tensely interested in the creatures had i become that
i scarcely noticed the battle or other incidents of the
scene and i had quite forgotten our tame bombardiers
until one of the beetles rushed forward towards the
struggling combatants instantly i realized that his
interference would prove equally disastrous to both
the black savages and their foes that his deadly gases
released among those struggling close-locked figures
would overcome all alike then an amazing thing hap-
pened the bombardier checked its onward rush
sniffed suspiciously and turning tail came dashing
back with every symptom of terror at the time i
had little chance to marvel at this from the op-
posite side of the open area a column of the strange
red creatures was issuing without attempting to
aid their comrades in their ferocious battle they hur-
ried directly towards the low wall surrounding the
village of the blacks swarmed over it and vanished
within the subterranean galleries of the savages by
now the fighting was almost over nearly all the
black beings were dead wounded or prisoners but
they had given a good account of themselves far
more bodies of their enemies than of their own lay
scattered about the battlefield perhaps a dozen were
still fighting but they were rapidly overpowered and
with their prisoners surrounded and completely cowed
the red creatures stood waiting presently from the
blacks homes the strange invaders began to emerge
each i noted carrying r burden

  the next moment i gasped in astonishment the
burdens they were carrying were the young savages
i had seen in the underground nurseries squirming
and yowling but firmly held in the powerful claws
of their captors the infantile savages were being
borne towards our hiding place terrified at thought
of being discovered realizing too late the danger we
were in we turned to rush for safety among the
denser growth before we had taken a dozen strides
terrifying figures surrounded us huge claws darted
out and seized us and screaming fighting but helpless
in the vise-like grips of the monsters we were borne
triumphantly back to the horde of awful creatures with
their human loot
the world of the giant ants



even in our extremity during that terrifying time

i was astonished that our captors did not offer
to harm us the creatures who held me were in fact
most considerate even gentle for brutes who a few
moments before had been fighting so savagely and
exhibiting such ferocity their present actions were
astonishing of course i did not struggle or resist
-such a course i knew would be worse than useless
and poor tom was too far overcome with terror to do
more than move one foot before the other as his cap-
tors led him forward

  our arrival before the horde of the creatures caused
tremendous commotion one huge beast who appeared
to be a leader hurried towards us examined us min-
utely and uttered strange squeaky sounds which re-
minded me more of the creaking of rusty hingfls than
anything else i had ever heard instantly my captors
released me but not so with tom with scant cere-
mony he was hustled to the groups laden with their
kicking squirming black captives the next instant
the throng commenced to move away from the open
space with its litter of dead and dying and headed
to the right with the captives tom included in their
midst and surrounded on all sides by the compara-
tively few unburdened creatures they gave no heed
to me and it was obvious that i was free and of no
interest to them why this should be so i could not
imagine

  although the comparison was not flattering yet it
must have been evident to the beings that the blacks
and myself were equally human and it must have
been equally evident that tom was also a human being
why then should they have attacked and carried off
the youthful black savages taken possession of tom
and freed me the only answer i could think of was
that it was a matter of color

  both the savages and tom were black while i was
white or rather i should say red for i was tanned
and burned by the sun until no one would have recog-
nized me as a white man possibly i thought these
weird puzzling ferocious beasts might classify human
beings by color alone tom being black would be con-
sidered in the category of their victims of the battle
while i would be regarded as a friend or at least no
enemy because my color was somewhat like theirs

  it seemed a far-fetched theory but it was the only
one that occurred to me but i had no mind to re-
main there while tom was being carried off to some
terrible fate so hurrying forward i joined the pro-
cession and presently growing bolder now that my
first terror of the things was overcome i managed to
push my way in towards the creatures guarding tom
even then the red giants paid no more attention to
me than if i had been one of their own sort

  but when i tried to force myself between tom and
his captors the latter roughly shoved me aside and
indicated that i was to remain at a distance from
their captives but they could not prevent me from
talking to tom and i did my best to try to reassure
him and to assure him that i would stand by him no
matter what happened the sound of my voice ap-
peared to amaze the creatures and the entire company
came to an abrupt halt and stood staring and listening

  but toms voice simply astounded them at his
first words his captors sprang aside in evident fear
but their surprise and terror was only momentary

  as we again marched onward i studied the creatures
minutely and once more i revised my idea as to their
identity and place in the animal kingdom now that
i could observe them closely i was once more con-
vinced that i had been correct in my first surmise
and that they were ants but if they were ants

speaking from a zoological viewpoint they were as-
suredly most remarkably specialized ants and yet
aside from their lidded eyes their well-developed ears
and their unusual feet they were distinctly and un-
mistakably ant-like they were in fact exactly what
one might expect had evolution proceeded along insect
lines and had ants the most intelligent and advanced
of insects reached a stage comparable to that of the
pithecanthropus in the mammalian genesis of evolu-
tion

  antennae had become of secondary importance as
auditory organs were developed movable eyes had de-
veloped through necessity and variable lenses and
pupils had made soft eyes essential and consequently
lids were needed to protect them and with advance-
ment and specialization of characters the variable feet
might well have resulted the fact that they com-
municated by means of sounds was not so surprising
now that i came to consider it for all we know
ordinary ants and other insects may communicate by
means of sounds pitched too high or too low for the
human ear to detect and the fact that the voices
of these creatures were audible to me merely proved
that their vibrations happened to come within the
range of my own sense of hearing

  realizing this realizing that the creatures were
nothing more than huge highly specialized ants com-
prehension came to me like a flash of light and all
that had puzzled me was made clear they were slave-
keeping ants they were the warriors of some colony
who had made a slaving raid and instead of fellow
ants they had taken possession of the degenerate
human beings and were carrying them into slavery
and tom was destined also to be a slave to these super-
ants all our common well-known slave-holding ants
so abundant in many lands are red always they make
slaves of black ants and here these gigantic red ants
still ran true to natures laws and chose black beings
for their slaves it solved the problem of my treat-
ment and freedom also not being black i could not
to the ants way of thinking be made a slave and
hence i was of no value or interest to them for they
made war and attacked other creatures solely to obtain
a supply of slaves

  if i were right in my surmises and deductions as i
felt convinced i was then personally i had nothing
to fear from these semi-human ants but my blood
boiled and i was furiously angry at thought of their
calmly taking possession of tom as if i had no rights
or say in the matter still there was something ex-
tremely ludicrous in the thought of tom being a slave
to the ants

  i could picture him trying to act as nursemaid to
a young ant scurrying about seeking food to supply
his owners laboring at building the ants nests or
digging subterranean tunnels he would i imagined
be about the most useless and inefficient slave the
ants had ever owned and with this thought came a
new fear i had watched and studied the habits of
our common slave-holding ants far too often not to be
thoroughly cognizant of their customs and i well
knew the fate that befell their black ant slaves if they
failed to fulfill their allotted tasks or to satisfy their
cruel owners death swift and certain was their por-
tion and tom i felt certain would fail utterly even
if he did not assert himself and submitted to his

   many species of common ants possess slaves oddly enough the slave
owners are red and the slaves black the slaves-which are reared from
the captured pupae and eggs of the black ants-are faithful industrious
and perform practically all the labor of the colony so dependent upon
their black slaves are some red ants that they are unable to feed them-
selves when on a slave-hunting raid these ants send scouts ahead to
locate the nests of the black ants and conduct the attack on military
lines with skirmishes rear guards flanking parties shock troops and
reserves

slavery a human being serving as the slave to ant
masters it was unthinkable monstrous impossible
and yet the black savages were human and before
me the red ants were carrying off the savages in-
fants for the first time i noticed that not a single
adult savage had been borne away as a captive al-
though many had been taken alive and unharmed all
had been released when the victorious raiders had de-
parted it was all very clear to me now that i realized
they were slave-holders and were following precisely
the same habits and customs as any ordinary slave-
keeping ants with the sole exception that they had
substituted black human beings for black ants and
while they were acting much as do human slave-
raiders yet they showed far greater wisdom and fore-
sight instead of carrying the adults into slavery and
being forced to expend a vast amount of time fn
teaching and training them as well as in forcing them
to labor and in addition losing many through one
cause and another they were making slaves of the
infants who reared among their owners knowing no
life but that of slavery would be easily trained would
never rebel at their lot and would grow to maturity as
ideal slaves no doubt too the red giants had other
and equally excellent reasons for leaving the adult
blacks behind and for taking pains not to kill more
than was essential to their victory

left unmolested the blacks would continue to breed
and increase for i could not imagine them having
sufficient intelligence to move to a new locality or to
provide defenses against further attacks and they
would thus provide a constant source of supply for the
slave-raiders whenever the latter required new slaves
no doubt these red fellows had been systematically
raiding the blacks for generations but all this as
i mulled it over in my mind did not pacify me in
the least regarding toms plight nor did it account
for the reds taking possession of him an adult the
only answer i could find for their thus making an
exception of him was that they had looked upon him
as my slave a trained slave from infancy like their
own and had calmly taken possession of my property
the more i thought of it the angrier i became the
creatures were no better than highway robbers i was
tempted to attack them single-handed to attempt to
recover possession of tom for somehow my first in-
tense dread of these super-ants had given way to a
supreme contempt for them but my common sense
prevailed i realized that it would merely mean de-
feat injury and probable death for me and that in
that case tom would be irretrievably doomed no it
was far wiser for me to control my feelings follow
along with the procession to the ants destination and
trust to some chance of rescuing tom without endan-
gering ourselves overmuch

  up to this i had been too preoccupied with- my
thoughts to notice that our bombardier beetles had
deserted us i was puzzled but then the actions of
these beetles had puzzled me from the time of our
first meeting the slave-raiders why had they appeared
frightened why had they failed to attack these
great ants with the same ferocity they had always
exhibited towards others surely they must have
recognized them as ants and why had they now
deserted us i could not even think up a theory to
account for their actions

  meantime we had made a wide detour had left the
aphis orchards far behind had passed at a consider-
able distance from the colony of agricultural ants and
were approaching a portion of the valley i had not
previously visited eventually as we topped a low

hill i saw that we were close to the area which on
several occasions i had viewed from a distance and
which i had always assumed was a second colony of
the black savages with their neighboring aphis pas-
tures now as we drew near  discovered that i had
made a great mistake the orderly expanses of trees
were aphis groves to be sure and the herds of clumsy
bovine aphids we saw were being herded by blacks
but here and there among them stalked great red
slave-holding ants they were the owners of the
aphids the masters here and the black herders were
merely their slaves unquestionably we were close to
the homes of the slave-raiders and presently we left
the orchards behind and came out upon a broad open
space with a great conical mound in the centre
everywhere were the red giants and everywhere
hurrying about on numberless duties laboring in the
broiling sun toiling under heavy burdens were scores
of the subjugated human slaves and yet even then
i could not avoid feeling that of the two the ants
were the superior beings that the naked misshapen
black savages were far inferior to their insect masters
here in this remarkable spot the whole order of
things seemed to be reversed insects dominated the
only indigenous human beings were degenerate miser-
able brutes and were entirely subservient to the forms
of animal life which man is accustomed to consider
are the lowest orders of creation

  i noticed too that there was a great diversity
among the giant slave-holding ants those whom i had
accompanied and who had raided the blacks were
obviously warriors or soldiers a few of the same
sort were to be seen around the immense ants nest
towards which we were now proceeding but there were
far more of totally different forms many of these
others had enormous heads weak bodies and almost
atrophied legs and were apparently blind for despite
the fact that they possessed fixed fishy-looking eyes
each was being guided and led about by attendant
black slaves others were burly heavy-bodied creatures
with small heads inconspicuous jaws great staring
eyes well developed antennae and such long slender
legs that they appeared almost more spider-like than
ant-like it was this type i had seen with the aphid
herders and i now saw that they were all engaged in
watching the blacks and in keeping them at their
work we had now reached the summit of the mound
and paused at the verge of the great crater-like de-
pression in the centre with the various dark openings
to subterranean burrows piercing its sides as we
halted a horde of horrible-looking creatures emerged
from the tunnels that they also were ants and be-
longed to the colony was evident but they were totally
distinct in form from any of the others i had seen
their jaws were huge but were blunt thick-edged af-
fairs their eyes were minute almost invisible their
bodies were swollen and their legs short stout and
terminated in peculiar blunt-ended claws that somehow
looked like pudgy toil-calloused hands as these slov-
enly almost grub-like beasts reached the waiting war-
riors the latter handed over their squalling infantile
captives to the newcomers with skill which could
only have been born of long practice these creatures
seized the black youngsters holding them securely
but without injury in their powerful mandibles and
hurried with them to the burrows whence they had
emerged

tut tom was a problem as he cowered and yelled
-d and struggled at the approach of the things one
after another would examine him and apparently satis-
fied that he was not an infant-and perhaps recogniz-
the world of the giant ants



ing the fact that he was not of the same race as the
other blacks they would move off without offering to
take charge of him the warriors squeaked croaked
and evidently became insistent but without result
the nurses for i knew that was what in reality the
blunt jawed individuals were would have nothing to
do with the big adult negro their duties were to
care for infant slaves to rear them train them per-
haps until old enough to labor for their masters and
they had no interest in grown-up slaves like all the
rest of their kind they were highly specialized for
their particular place in the complex social and com-
munistic life of these ants and had been developed
through countless generations to perform one set of
duties and only one it was the same with the war-
riors they had become specialized for conducting
raids and taking prisoners and were at an entire loss
when it came to any other matter and it was very
obvious that they were now at a most complete loss
when it came to ridding themselves of tom through-
out their lives and the lives of their innumerable an-
cestors warriors had gone forth had battled had re-
turned with captives and had delivered the captives to
the proper individuals not until they had been re-
lieved of every prisoner were their duties at an end
and here they were with a captive of whom they could
not rid themselves so intensely socialistic were they
so synchronized their brains or instincts that the
whole army was as much affected as though each in-
dividual were personally responsible for tom there
they stood all completely upset all waiting on the two
who had tom in their custody more than ever
was i impressed by the shortcomings of ants boasted
intelligence more than ever i realized the futility of
communism when carried to the extreme and more
than ever i appreciated the fact that ants no matter
how huge no matter how super-developed would never
attain the heights of human beings as long as every-
thing went smoothly and along accustomed lines they
were capable of accomplishing anything and exhibited
what appeared at first sight to be real intelligence
and reasoning but once their accustomed line of
action was interrupted once anything without pre-
cedent took place they were helpless and there was
no one individual no group of individuals to get them
ut of a dilemma to meet unforeseen circumstances
and find a way out of difficulties to give orders or to
be obeyed in short there was no head no leader no
ruler among any of the ants and therein lay their
greatest weakness

  all these thoughts flashed through my mind in a
moment the next instant i was hurrying forward
here was my opportunity the warrior ants had no
thoughts no ideas except to get rid of tom and thus
fulfill their allotted duties as ordained by their special
development their duties and their instincts probably i
thought they would not care a jot who took their trou-
blesome captive in charge as long as he was off their
hands and quite confidently with these convictions in my
mind i strode to toms side seized him by the arm and
started to drag him off without offering the least
resistance his captors released their hold and in-
stantly as if i had given them an order the assembled
warriors broke ranks and scurried off to their under-
ground quarters

  i was delighted immensely pleased that my deduc-
tions had proved so correct and tom poor fellow
was almost speechless with delight but we were not
to get off so easily as we hurried down the slope
of the mound and started across the cleared area to-
wards the woods beyond one of the long-legged slave
drivers glanced up stared in our direction with his

odd toilet attitudes ants cleaning the legs and the stinging organs
from natures craftsmen by henry c mccook

protruding almost crustacean-like eyes and the next
instant came racing towards us

  just what his intentions were i neither knew nor
stopped to enquire with tom at my side i dashed
forward at topmost speed but we were no match
for the big ant now i realized why these fellows
possessed such muscular bodies and long legs they
were built for speed they had ben developed through
centuries ages for the sole duty of watching and
guarding slaves and for chasing those who attempted
to escape evidently the fellow racing after tom
and myself thought tom was a runaway slave what
he thought of me was of no particular interest at the
time and what punishment was customarily meted
out to slaves who attempted to escape i did not know
but i had no doubt it would be drastic and that i as
an abettor of toms break for liberty would be treated
far from gently

neither tom nor myself had any intention of sub-
mitting to capture tamely we had been surprised
taken at a disadvantage when we had been made
prisoners by the raiders moreover they had outnum-
bered us fifty to one but with this single long-legged
fellow after us it was a different matter and even in
the excitement of the time i saw that he was alone
that none of his fellows had joined in the pursuit
realizing we could not outdistance him i gave a
sharp command to tom and halting we both wheeled
quickly we fitted arrows to bows and let drive toms
shaft went wild he was still trembling and shaky
from his experience but mine struck the oncoming ant
fairly in the thorax he plunged forward on his
head turned a complete somersault and lay helpless
paralyzed

  but as we were about to turn to hurry on another
of the long-legged fellows came speeding towards us
there was nothing to do but stand and fight he was
still far off but to run would merely be to exhaust
ourselves his six long powerful legs would carry
him twice as fast and countless times farther than
our legs and to battle with him even if by good
luck we were as successful as with his companions
would not better us much there were dozens of his
sort scattered about the plain and i had no doubt but
that as rapidly as we destroyed one another would
take his place why several did not start for us in
unison was a mystery but i assumed it was age-old
custom and instinct for individuals to recapture run-
aways and i let it go at that

  as i have mentioned tom and i possessed slings
which we had found quite serviceable in the past and
now not caring to waste arrows which were valuable
we whirled the primitive weapons and hurled a shower
of rocks at the oncoming ant several struck close to
him one or two whanged against his body and one
struck and broke the second leg on his left side here
was something quite unexpected and new to his expe-
rience with the same lack of initiative with the same
utter failing of intellect and reason which i have
referred to when face to face with any novelty the fel-
low stopped in his tracks not knowing whether to
retreat or advance he made a tempting mark and
as rapidly as we could load and whirl our slings we
continued our fussilade whether we killed or
wounded him i do not know for all our interests were
centred on an unexpected development

  our ammunition rough stones of various sizes and
shapes was not conducive to accuracy and the ma-
jority of our shots went wild some thudded harm-
lessly upon the open ground but two or three dropped
into the midst of a group of black savages attending
some of the blind fat ants whether the slaves were
actually struck or not i do not know at any rate the
falling stones brought cries of terror and frightened
screams from the blacks and completely forgetting
their charges thinking only of getting away from the
descending missiles they took to their heels as if the
devil had been after them as no doubt they thought
he was instantly every long-legged slave driver within
sight was up and going here to their minds was a
slave-break and almost before we had recovered from
our surprise at this unexpected denouement the chase
was in full swing and heading directly away from us
our way was clear and making the best of our oppor-
tunity we gained the shelter of the forest

chapter xvii

since i last opened my notebook to record events
i have gone through a greater trial than has
been my misfortune since entering this place
but thank god all ended well and it is now a thing
of the past much as i suffered poor tom suffered a
thousand times more

  having escaped from the red slave-owners who no
doubt found too much to occupy their attentions in
recapturing their slaves to bother chasing us we
reached our home we now called this agricultural-ant
colony our home in safety

  for a time nothing of great moment happened we
made many new discoveries and found many new
things and we also vastly improved our weapons now
that we knew of the warlike slave-owners we felt the
need of weapons more than ever not only did we
make better slings but having proved the value of
these primitive weapons we spent much time search-
ing for pebbles of uniform weight and size and as
rounded as possible to be used as missiles

  and having nothing better to do we spent many
hours chipping and pounding uneven pebbles into
spheroidal form until we possessed a large store of
ball-like stones then we made a discovery which
caused us to feel that all our labor in this direction
had been wasted in a clay bed near the upper
waters of a stream we came upon great quantities of
perfectly spherical nodules of great weight veritable
bullets in fact nearly as heavy as if made of iron
which i recognized as cassiterite or stream-tin com-
mercially this would have been a great find and had
i been free and within reach of civilization my for-
tune would have been made for a short search re-
vealed the fact that the bed of the stream was literally

paved with the valuable ore here ready to hand
were missiles for our slings which were immeasurably
superior to ordinary pebbles and for several days we
carried loads of the nodules to our hut i laughingly
remarked to tom that if we had only possessed a can-
non and powder we would have had most excellent
ammunition and could make short work of any at-
tackers in fact this started me on a new train of
thought and a wild scheme of actually making powder
and firearms entered my head i had no doubt that
powder could be made for as i have said there was
a boundless supply of sulphur charcoal was to be had
for the trouble of making it and i knew that by a
little experimenting i could produce saltpeter by means
of a rubbish pile or nitraria such as i had seen
used in paraguay but i could think of no way of
making any sort of a cannon or gun of course i
knew that in ancient times the chinese used firearms
of bamboo or even of wood but even to fashion such
things was beyond our capabilities however just to
pass the time and to satisfy myself that it was pos-
sible to do so i decided to experiment with gunpowder
i therefore proceeded with toms help to accumulate
a quantity of rotten vegetation dung offal from game
we killed and other waste material and built up a
good-sized mound in a remote spot as it would be
several months before this would decay and produce
the nitrate i desired we set to work on other matters

  our hatchet-like weapons had proved most useful
and in pondering how we could improve upon these i
remembered the saw-edged swords of the aztecs and
it occurred to me that we might construct something
of a similar sort where we had destroyed the
drougher-ants there were a number of the hard ex-
tremely tough and sharp jaws of the defunct war-
riors jaws like enormous sharks teeth and we gath-
ered several dozen of these then with a great deal
of trouble we hacked and whittled out sword-like
pieces of palm wood with serviceable handles along
the edges of these we fastened the ant-jaws securing
them in place by means of fibre cords and a cement-
like wax that i made by a mixture of bees wax pitch
and the juice of some species of rubber tree i cannot
lay claim to any inventiveness on my part in making
this for it was nothing but the karamani wax used
extensively by the indians of brazil and guiana for
attaching their arrow-heads to the shafts but it served
our purpose admirably the savage-looking weapons
when completed were fearful things and tom grinned
from ear to ear as he swung his about his head and
expressed a desire to try it upon some enemy little
did we dream how soon that wish would be fulfilled

  so accustomed had tom become to the weird crea-
tures and unusual conditions that he frequently went
off alone in search of game or for other purposes and
it was not unusual for him to be absent for several
hours at a time oddly enough too the gigantic in-
sects had apparently acquired an instinctive dread of
us humans and for a long time we had not been
attacked by any of the inhabitants of the forest in-
deed several times when we met creatures which a
few months previously would have attacked us sav-
agely they showed every desire to get away from
us whether this was due to that remarkable inherent
dread of human beings which animals acquire after a
short acquaintance with man whether it was the result
of our activities or whether it was the result of expe-
rience i cannot say but even the predatory hornets
the terrible solitary-ants and the ichneumons seemed to
avoid us still we were usually accompanied by our
domesticated bombardier-beetles these were now of
the fifth generation and having been bred in captivity
the world of the giant ants



and descended from tame ancestors they were most
docile and intelligent creatures the agricultural-ants
even had become thoroughly accustomed to them and
they came and went about the colony and made friends
with the various inquilines and insect guardians of
the place also i must not forget to mention that
the latter creatures had become equally friendly with
us evidently having come to the conclusion that we
were recognized and accepted members of the colony
the huge dragon-flies in particular showed great intel-
ligence and would sail down and alight near us waiting
expectantly for us to toss them bits of meat while
we ate it was fascinating to watch these creatures
which i could only liken to living airplanes as they
turned their enormous thin-necked heads from side
to side and watched us with their gogglingv many-
facetted eyes and licked their chops and prbtruded
their remarkable folding jaws as far as our good-
natured ant hosts were concerned matters proceeded
much as before we had never learned to communi-
cate with them except by signs but we had developed
a fairly complete sign language and despite the fact
that the ants about us now were many generations
removed from those whom we had first met they
seemed to have inherited all their ancestors knowl-
edge of us and acted exactly as if they had always
had us with them

  all of these things i have mentioned at some length
for all have a very direct bearing upon that great
calamity which befell us tom had gone off on a
hunt but when he had not returned late in the after-
noon i began to feel uneasy then when late at
night his two bombardiers came home and i saw
that one was limping and badly injured i felt certain
that some accident had befallen my faithful friend
for i no longer looked upon him as a servant

  throughout that long night i paced back and forth
unable to sleep torn with fears and conjuring up
visions of the awful future in store for me in case
tom liad been killed and i should be forced to remain
alone in this terrible land of insects as soon as it
was dawn i started out but it was as i knew an
almost hopeless undertaking i had no idea in which
direction tom had gone and all i could do was to
wander aimlessly shouting and hallooing at night
i returned discouraged saddened despondent and
utterly heartbroken but i pulled myself together i
must not give up my life depended upon finding tom
alone i could not exist here and i determined that
should i fail to find him within a weeks time or
should i find his dead body i would do away with
myself rather than face the certainty of insanity which
i knew would result if i dwelt for long alone

so day after day i tramped the forest the valleys
the plains and the mountains searching for my
only fellow man in all this land forcing myself to
think calmly i laid out a regular course covering
a different area each day until on the sixth day only
that section near the slave-holders colony remained un-
searched i hated to go near this spot and i put it off
until the last partly from my inborn fear of the slave-
owners and partly because i felt sure that tom would
never have gone in this direction one day more of
fruitless searching and i would give up in fact i
was far more occupied with thoughts of how i could
commit suicide than with thoughts of facing the slave-
holders as i set off in the direction of their farms
nevertheless i proceeded cautiously i had no desire
to fall into the clutches of the big red brutes a second
time even though i could take my own life as readily
among them as elsewhere-a strange psychological

state of mind to be sure and neither did i fail to
shout toms name and to halloo as i proceeded i
had gone far and felt i must be nearing the country
of the slavers when i stopped my breath suppressed
my ears strained from somewhere in the distance
i thought i had heard a faint call could it be pos-
sible was tom somewhere in this neighborhood

  having no fear that my cries would attract the at-
tention of the ants for i felt certain they were deaf
to all human voice vibrations i bellowed at the top
of my lungs again i listened and again it seemed
to me i heard an answering cry but it might be echo
it might be an hallucination in short it might be
the result of my overtaxed nerves and brain forget-
ting caution i rushed forward shouting as i ran
suddenly beyond the fringe of forest i saw open
country and instinctively i halted and proceeded more
cautiously before me stretched a newly-cleared space
about the trunks of the aphid trees i knew so well

  here and there black slaves were toiling under the
watchful eyes of their horrible red masters and for a 
moment i watched them tom i knew could not be
here and i was about to turn away when i caught
sight of something which caused me to stare with wide
incredulous eyes close to the forest edge beyond
the other slaves and their masters two great red ants
were standing and beyond them working like the other
slaves was a single being as black as his fellows but
who was clad in rough garments instantly as i
rubbed my eyes and convinced myself i was not de-
lirious i knew it was tom strange that i had not
thought of this possibility before that it had not oc-
curred to me that he might have been captured by
these slave-owners but the joy that filled my heart
at seeing tom alive and apparently unharmed drove
all other thoughts from my mind but how to reach
him how to free him from his masters to rush
blindly forward and attack his guards was i knew
suicidal although the red ants had not harmed us
before i felt quite sure that should i attempt to rescue
tom from their clutches or should i attack them they
would fall upon me and end my career in short order
for a moment or two i pondered - then an idea the
only one i could see although mad and desperate
enough occurred to me tom was working close to
the forest within easy call and by carefully circling
the area within shelter of the trees i could i thought
reach a spot within a few yards of him then if i
could attract his attention or could talk to him with-
out his captors knowledge it might be possible for
him to make a quick dash for what might follow i
did not plan i felt sure that his two guards would
be the only ones to start in chase and these we might
destroy once they were out of sight of their fellows

  cautiously retracing my steps my heart beating
hard with excitement i crept through the jungle until
i felt i had reached a spot about opposite the place
where i had seen tom stealthily for while the red
ants might be deaf they possessed keen senses i stole
forward until i could peer through the dense growth
yes there within a dozen yards of the forest edge
was tom and at sight of him at such close quarters
unbridled rage at his captors possessed me evidently
he had not submitted tamely to captivity nor to forced
labor his skin was covered with wounds and i knew
from the expression on his face that he was suffering
regardless of all else willing to take the risk of the
vibrations of my voice alarming the red ants i called
his name and a cautionary warning i saw him start
listen and glance up but by no other motions did he
betray his surprise but to my dismay i saw that
the giant ants had also detected my voice they were
telling tom to indicate which flower ho had approached i extended the bill-hood spear until the point touched the blossom instantly from
behind the petals five long green tentacles shot out and entwined themselves about the spear


the world of the giant ants



glancing about and waving their antennae evidently
trying to locate the spot whence the unusual vibrations
had come luckily for us they were drivers and not
warriors for the latter possessed true ears and
would no doubt have located me instantly

  but even as it was there was no time to be lost
whatever we did must be done quickly and before the
ants realized what was afoot desperate measures
were essential and all my preconceived plans were cast
aside tom of course had no weapons and like a flash
i realized that he must pass close to one of his guards
if he dashed to me as i had planned quickly fitting
an arrow to my bow i raised my jagged sword with
my other hand swung it and shouting to tom-
here tom grab this and run i hurled it towards
him the weapon fell almost at his feet and scarcely
had it touched the earth when my arrow flashed
through the sunlight and buried itself in the soft
skin between the thorax and abdomen of the nearest
ant everything happened at once as the ant
doubled up and fell tom seized the sword leaped
forward dealt the prostrate ant a terrific blow that
crushed its head to pulp and gained my side the
other ant dazed at the suddenness of it all hesitated
a moment then he was after tom while his fellows
nearest to him came hurrying towards him

  again i fired but missed there was no time to fit
another arrow to the string if we tried to run we
would be overtaken there was but one course open
to stand and fight to destroy this nearest creature
that was now within a dozen feet of us and then
rush off before the other ants saw us in terse rapid
words i said as much to tom who seemed unable to
grasp the fact that he was free unable to speak for
the moment but he could act and backing against a
tree and grasping his sword he prepared for battle
my only defensive weapon was my knife aside from
the sword my bow and arrows and my sling and this
would be hand-to-hand fighting but tom gave me
no opportunity to use my weapon he had scores to
settle with the brutal red beast and all the long-
dormant savage blood of his african ancestors was
aroused with a hoarse yell he leaped forward swung
the jagged sword and with a vicious side-sweep sliced
the head from the oncoming ant at a single blow in
the winking of an eyelid the fight was over the
way lay open before us and at top speed we rushed
off through the forest

behind us now and then we could hear sounds of
the pursuing ants how far they followed us i
cannot say but at last the sounds ceased and feeling
we were in no danger we slowed down to a more com-
fortable gait poor tom was all in he had been
weakened by his wounds he had been almost starved
and the excitement of the duel and escape had about
finished him but as he limped slowly along he told
me bits of his story he had been surprised in the
forest by two red warrior ants and though he fought
savagely he had been overcome and made a prisoner
some of his wounds had been received in this struggle
but the others were the result of his refusal to herd
with the repulsive blacks or to work for his masters
he shuddered and actually wept as he related how
the red ants had bitten and tortured him although
with devilish ingenuity they avoided maiming him so
he would still be able to work how they had seized
his limbs in their jaws and had bitten until he felt
as if his bones would crack how they had nipped
pieces of flesh from his back and chest until screaming
with the pain he had submitted and during the six
terrible interminable days he had had no food except

the stinking offensive stuff fed to the horrible half-
human blacks

  undoubtedly the ants had thought him an escaped
slave and had therefore punished him the more severe-
ly but that made his condition no better and it was
days before the poor fellow was able to be up and
about meanwhile i was filled with a new dread if tha
red warriors roamed the forest searching for runaway
slaves they would be a constant menace no doubt
too they were untiring skilled trailers possessing all
the marvelous powers and instincts of anta combined
with a super-intelligence and sooner or later they
would locate us at any moment if we ventured into
the forest we might be discovered and attacked and
i had little doubt that after their recent experience
they would be in force and if we remained within
the confines of the agricultural-ants we would not be
safe although i had done everything to render the
place as nearly impregnable as possible still i knew
that the red soldiers if numerous enough could reach
us and that we could not count too much upon the
resistance of the agriculturalists the more i thought
on this matter the more certain i felt that sooner or
later we would have to wage a decisive battle with
these slave-holding ants and the more i thought of
them and talked the matter over with tom the more
i began to hate the creatures and to wish that we
could wipe them from the face of the earth in fact i
even thought of training our peaceful hosts of equip-
ping an army and of going forth to attack the slave-
owners instead of waiting for them to take the offen-
sive but before i reached any definite decision in
this direction another event transpired which for a
time drove all thoughts of the slavers from our minds

  whenever we went on any hunt we had long since
given up our hopeless seeking for an exit from the
valley we kept as far from the district of the slave
owning ants as possible and invariably bent our steps
in the opposite direction i thought that we had pretty
well explored the valley within a radius of eight or
ten miles of the colony of agriculturalists and that wo
knew practically every square mile of this side of tha
country but a tropical forest can hide most conspic-
uous things within a very small compass and i soon
had another proof of this passing through a rather
dense stretch of jungle tom stubbed his toe upon a
stone and glancing down i saw that the object was
a squared and sculptured piece of masonry instantly
my curiosity was aroused and intently i examined the
thing as we cleared away the moss and dead leaves
about it it was beyond question the work of human
hands and a sudden wild hope seized me that there
might be other men in the valley after all a moment
later i realized how groundless were my hopes for
the fragment of stonework was immeasurably ancient
but it proved at least that human beings had at one
time dwelt in the valley and the work upon the stone
showed that they were no savages that they were cul-
tured perhaps civilized beings

  where there was one bit of sculptured stone there
must be others and excited my interests all aroused
wre sought diligently amid the tangled vines and trees
presently our efforts were rewarded overgrown and
hidden so that even a dozen feet away they were in-
visible we came upon the ruins of a great stone
building concealed as it was i recognized it instantly
as being the handiwork of the same race that had
built tupec here indeed was an amazing discovery
and yet i should have known from the fact that the
tunnel from tupec led to this valley that the race must
have known of the spot everything else was for the
time forgotten and we devoted our time until dark

to clearing away the jungle and exposing more and
more of the ruins

  determined to learn all i could of the place although
what earthly good it would do me i do not and did
not then know we returned the following day with
our hammocks prepared to camp by the ruins and
pursue our investigations

  each hour that we worked increased my wonder
and my interest the first building we had found
was but one of a dozen or more each surpassing the
last in workmanship in beauty of sculpture and in
archeological interest indeed as we wandered about
in the forest we soon discovered that we were in the
midst of ruins far more extensive than those of tupec
ruins of what must once have been a magnificent and
large city what i wondered had become of the race
that dwelt here why had they vanished why had
no descendants remained cudgelling my brains for
answers to these puzzles i arrived at the conclusion
that the inhabitants of this city must have deserted
the valley and established tupec for all my investiga-
tions proved more and more conclusively that tupec
was the more recent of the two although that i knew
must go back for countless thousands of years what
i wondered were the conditions of this valley in those
far-distant times was it inhabited by overgrown giant
forms of insect life or had they been the result of de-
velopment after human beings had vanished from the
district and then one day the mystery was cleared
lup in many places the massive masonry was only
held together by the binding roots and vines and as
we cut away a mass of these a large section of a wall
gave way and came crashing down behind it yawned
a great black opening and peering into this i saw
that the entire walls were occupied by innumerable
niches and that in every niche was an earthenware
jar or vessel here was an archeological treasure-
trove although as worthless to me in my present
plight as were the dead and twisted lianas we had
hacked away to expose it but while i fully realized
this still my scientific ardor was in no wise diminished
and i was as filled with interest and delight as though
i could carry the specimens and my story to my fellow
men at any time

the light within the chamber was dim but on the
following morning with the sun shining into the
aperture all was bright and clear in the great room
and i gazed fascinated and entranced at the rows and
rows of magnificent decorated wonderfully moulded pots
i should not however say pots for aside from the fact
that they were all more or less pot-like in form i
knew at my first glance that they were not vessels in
the true sense of the word rather they were effigy
or portrait-jars of a type new to archeology and
modelled with truly amazing fidelity to nature there
were human figures in every conceivable attitude
figures of birds mammals crustaceans insects figures
of reptiles and molluscs figures of monsters unknown
to me and representations of fruits vegetables flowers
leaves and of every imaginable combination of all

  so perfectly were they made so beautifully colored
that i knew they must have been made from life and
i gazed spellbound at the counterparts in miniature of
the ancient inhabitants of the valley and of tupec

  then as i moved about studying these archeological
marvels it suddenly dawned upon me that they were
not placed within their niches hit or miss but were
arranged in some definite order that they were all
symbolic and that their relative positions conveyed
some meaning i felt sure of it i felt convinced that
before me was a history a codex telling the story of

the ancient race a story written in effigy jars in-
stead of in carved symbols on stone or in written
characters but a story none the less if i only had
the key if only i had some hint of the cipher
now they were as meaningless to me as so many
cooking utensils i did not even know where to begin
whether the symbolic figures started from right or
left from top or bottom or from which one of the
four walls of the chamber i stared at them as
though i might hypnotize the inanimate objects into
revealing their secrets and slowly as i gazed at the
nearest jars a strange almost uncanny feeling came
over me

  it seemed to me that i was beginning to see light
that comprehension was dawning upon me that my
mind was actually penetrating the secret of the sym-
bolic vessels there before me was a vessel bearing
the perfectly modelled figure of a stooping man and
upon its surface was depicted human beings busy at
some labor in the mans hand was a tool a hammer
or maul and before him a slab it was plain enough
now he was cutting a stone and the painted figures
were working on a stone building the next jar on
the right bore the figure of a woman and child and
on the right side of this the next vessel showed a bird
with wings wide spread but on the left side stood
a magnificent jar showing a man in elaborate head-
dress and costume holding his hands aloft and above
him was a flaming sun to the left of this was a
vessel of strange squarish form and covered with a
painting clearly showing a sacrifice being held upon
a pyramidal altar eureka i had it i fairly
danced and leaped about until tom must have felt
sure that i had gone mad in contemplation of this
trash as he called it i was more excited than i
had been for years i forgot my plight my surround-
ings i had made an astounding discovery and i felt
convinced that presently with a little study and
patience all the mysteries of the ancient race and of
tupec would be solved for me there could be no
doubt of it i could grasp the system now here was
the stone cutter symbolical of building next the com-
pleted edifice and the high priest worshipping the sun
and then the sacrifice almost feverishly i examined
the jars further to right and left the woman and
the bird seemed to have no relation to the stone-
cutter and those farther to the right seemed to have
even less i felt sure that i was right that the sym-
bols should be read from right to left and carefully i
examined those to the left of the sacrificial scene here
were jars bearing effigies of corn of cacao of various
vegetables and with painted scenes showing planting
harvesting and preparing food plants now that i had
solved the puzzle of the system i grasped the meanings
of the jars readily first the erection of a temple
sacrifices to the gods the tilling of land and cultiva-
tion of food-a veritable genesis stood before me with
the utmost difficulty i controlled myself for all i
knew i was beginning in the middle of the story i
must search about until i found a beginning then
calmly patiently i would set myself to decipher the
whole never once did it occur to me how absolutely
futile was this labor how foolish my elation how ridic-
ulous my interest my scientific brain demanded that
the history be read my archeological interests drove
all other thoughts and considerations from me for
the time i was oblivious to all else

  then as i examined the innumerable jars striving
to find some hint some indication of where the strange-
ly recorded history commenced i noticed that here
and there were empty niches that in others the jars
were plain monotone vessels here were puzzles what
the world of the giant ants



did the vacant places and the ordinary jars signify
were they meaningless or had they some significance
which i could not fathom or were they-yes i be-
lieved that was the answer-were they representatives
of lapses of years or of decades when no unusual
events occurred or of which no records had been kept
if so if the latter were the case i reasoned that in the
earlier periods of the races history there would be
more lapses more periods forgotten or lost and hence
the portion of the walls where the empty niches and
plain jars were most numerous would be the spot
where the records commenced and i cannot ade-
quately express my elation when i found that in one
of the walls the lowest rows of niches were almost all
filled with meaningless red or brown jars and that
many of the spaces were empty to the left thej sym-
bolic jars increased in number and to the right all
were symbolic and obviously of much more recent date
than those on theleft beyond question beyond doubt
this was the beginning of that marvelous unique his-
tory and only patience and concentration were needed
to make clear to me the whole story of the people who
had once dwelt within this weird land and who i felt
convinced had left the place and had erected those
magnificent buildings at tupec

  but all this had occupied a great deal of time the
sun had passed far beyond the meridian the room was
filled with dark shadows and only here and there did
enough light enter to enable me to distinguish the
designs upon the jars

  it was useless to try to do more until there was
better light and regretfully i left the chamber though
much to toms satisfaction he poor chap was half
famished although i had quite forgotten that we had
eaten nothing since the previous afternoon

chapter xviii

i cannot spare the space to record in detail our
work of the next few days controlling my im-
patience i set to work with tom to clear away
vines branches and debris until at all hours of the
day the sunlight could enter the room containing the
jars then methodically as painstakingly as though
identifying and cataloguing museum specimens i
worked upon the symbolic jars

  as i worked the meanings became plainer and
clearer and within a few days i could read the story
they told as readily as i could decipher the graven
symbols of the mayas or the codices of the aztecs
there is no necessity to enter into the details of this
work if i ever escape i shall make it known to the
scientific world and if i do not of what use will it
all be in fact i hardly know why i am writing at
all why i am taking the trouble to record anything
unless it be merely from force of habit and for my own
satisfaction suffice to say that the history revealed
by those magnificent examples of the ceramic art was
most fascinating most tragic and most remarkable
whence the race came or who they were is still a
mystery for as i have said the early periods of their
existence in the country were mainly blank or vague
but that they came from overseas and migrated across
vast stretches of country was evident also my sup-
position that they were a white race was borne out
by both the painted and modelled figures not until
they had settled in this valley had history been re-
corded systematically then it proceeded almost with-
out interruption each cycle of a certain number of
years as nearly as i could judge approximately each
century an empty niche indicated the beginning of
a new cycle and if i am right as to the length of
these cycles then the race dwelt here in this accursed

spot for at least ten thousand years originally the
place was the home of some sort of huge bird or
rather judging from the representations of the crea-
tures some long-extinct flying-lizards which preyed
upon the insect life even in those far-distant days
the insects here were of most unusual size for re-
peatedly upon the jars insects were shown in com-
pany with human beings and nearly as large as the
latter unquestionably the giant bird-like creatures
kept the insects in check and being harmless creatures
so far as human beings were concerned they were soon
hunted and killed for food with the short-sightedness
of all human beings the inhabitants continued to
destroy the feathered creatures until the last had been
killed no longer kept within bounds by their natural
enemies the insects increased in numbers and in size
crops were destroyed human beings attacked and
existence in the valley became a constant battle be-
tween man and the insects life became impossible
and the inhabitants sought to migrate to another land
but during the thousands of years since they had en-
tered the valley great changes had taken place great
walls of rock barred the pass through which their an-
cestors had come but in their desperate search they
found a cave a tunnel-like cleft in a mountain ex-
ploring this they found it led through the cliffs and
driven by necessity thousands of men were put to
work enlarging and strengthening this natural passage
until they had drilled a tunnel through the mountain
often terrific battles took place between the workers
and the giant ants but in the end the human beings
won deserting their great city taking with them
only the essentials of life they prepared to leave and
to prevent all possibility of being followed by their
insect enemies they planned to arrange the opening
to the tunnel so that it could be closed behind them
and could not be opened from the valley side

  during all these years another race had lived in the
valley a race of bestial black beings the savages we
had met beyond doubt and though the civilized white
race was forced to leave or succumb the semi-human
primitive savages continued to exist-a strange com-
ment on the boasted superiority of civilized man over
primitive man in the matter of survival here then
were all the puzzles and mysteries of tupec made clear
to me no doubt after escaping from the valley and
founding tupec a second history of symbolic jars was
maintained no doubt somewhere amid the ruins of
tupec that priceless ceramic story still lies hidden and
my greatest regret is that i am doomed to know this
and shall never be able to find it and learn the full
history of that ancient vanished race of white men
but the sculptured figures and carved effigies which
had so puzzled me at tupec are puzzles no longer

  they represented bits of the past story of the tupe-
can the giant insects the great feathered creatures
-birds or flying lizards i cannot say which-the ter-
rific battles with the giant ants all were perpetuated
there in tupec yes even the black savages and
within that tunnel the fragments of horny matter and
the bones which we found were the grim reminders of
those hand-to-hand conflicts waged between the build-
ers of the tunnel and their insect foes

  so interested had i become in this story of the
race and so much had i dwelt upon the history of
the escape from the valley that i became obsessed with
thoughts of possibilities of escaping that way our-
selves might it not be possible i thought to dig away
about the entrance until we two could enter would it
not be possible to pry cut or by some meansbreak
through the stone doorway i thought of the her-
culean labors of primitive races in stone cutting of the


amazing stories quarterly

 seemingly superhuman feats men had performed if
 one man could overcome such apparently insurmount-
 able obstacles could not we two do as much we
 had been too easily discouraged i decided we had
 been supine lacking in determination at any rate
 we would have another look at the place and so re-
 gretfully leaving the ruins and its treasures we re-
 turned to our hut and a day or two later set out
 for the tunnel

   upon our way we met with many adventures and
 constantly came upon new things but these were in
 a way merely repetitions of those that had gone before
 and are not worth the trouble of relating but when
 at last we came to the tunnel and i made a careful
 examination of the massive stone portal that blocked
 it my heart sank at a distance thoughts of forcing
 a way through had seemed reasonable plans for
 patiently chipping away the rock day after day month
 after month year after year had not seemed visionary
 but now beside the flinty mass of stone we seemed so
 puny so incapable of making any impression upon it
 that i was thoroughly discouraged a thousand wild
 impossible schemes passed through my mind i even
 thought of employing a horde of those ghostly blind
 mining termites to dig under the door only to discard
 the idea the next moment i could not direct their
 movements they burrowed aimlessly and moreover i
 could not use them without making our efforts known
 once they had burrowed beneath the door the way
 would be open for all the terrible creatures of the val-
 ley and even for the sake of escaping myself i would
 not let loose the horde of giant insects to overrun the
 country beyond and very probably spread over the
 entire face of the earth

 my thoughts were interrupted by tom beggin
 yo pardon chief he remarked ah was thinkin
 if how we had powder we right well might blow open
 tha door an ah was rememberin yo was thinkin
 of makin powder one time

   i slapped tom on the back until he coughed his
 mind had seen light where mine was groping in the
 dark why not if i could make powder even a
 miserable apology for the explosive a charge properly
 placed might well dislodge the door and once we had
 crawled through we could block the opening again
 even if to do so we were obliged to blast the tunnel
 down behind us

   fired with the idea more optimistic than i had
 been for months we hurried back to the ant colony
 going to my dung-heap i raked the pile carefully apart
 and to my delight saw that clusters of dull yellowish-
 white crystals had formed in the mess touching these
 to my tongue my hopes were confirmed they were
 unquestionably saltpeter and although in small quan-
 tities and very crude i had no doubt they would serve
 our purpose gathering every crystal with the utmost
 care i found i had nearly a pound of the precious
 chemical but we would require many pounds to make
 powder enough for our purpose and for the next few
 das we worked feverishly making additional and
 larger nitratarias

   it would i knew be weeks before we could hope
 for saltpeter crystals from these but time was no
 object in fact we had long before lost all reckoning
 of time meanwhile we would gather sulphur make
 charcoal and carry on a series of experiments on a
 pmall scale in order to learn the best proportions of
 the three ingredients to give us the explosive needed

 it is not necessary to recount the details of this we
 had many failures before we had even a modicum of
 success and on the day when touching fire to the re-

 sult of our labors the black mess puffed up with a
 flare and a cloud of smoke we felt as elated as though
 we had made a momentous discovery still we were
 far from having powder which could by any stretch
 of imagination be classed explosive it was slow-
 burning and although a charge placed in a section of
 bamboo split the tough fibres apart with a satisfying
 pop still a similar test with a pottery tube was an
 utter failure the powder blowing out the plug without
 smashing the inch-thick terra-cotta patience and
 perseverance will accomplish wonders however and
 by the time our new crop of nitrates was ready i
 had discovered the secret of mixing and grinding
 powder which although far less powerful than ordinary
 blasting powder or gun powder would i felt sure
 serve our purpose but it would require great care
 and the utmost caution to prepare a sufficient amount
 to blast a way into the tunnel and it would be a
 long time before we could hope to make the attempt
 that might win us freedom

   and long before that day arrived other events
 transpired which completely upset our plans we had
 been absent for two days at our sulphur deposit and
 upon returning found death and destruction in the
 peaceful industrious colony we had left our hut was torn
 to bits our belongings scattered dead and wounded
 agricultural ants strewed the ground and the sur-
 vivors rushed aimlessly about terrified out of their
 wits it was not hard to discover what had hap-
 pened one or two dead slave-holding ants told the
 tale but for a moment i was puzzled why should
 these creatures have raided the agriculturalists except
 in search of us they never molested other insects
 without reason they made slaves only of the black
 savages and if in search of us why had they attacked
 and destroyed the others when they failed to find us
 but those questions were soon answered cowering in
 a dark corner of the agriculturalists underground
 dwellings we found three of the black slaves my
 reasoning jumped to a conclusion at once the poor
 creatures had seen toms escape they had seized an
 opportune moment and had fled from their red mon-
 sters and either by savage instinct or by chance
 they had found refuge among the agriculturalists then
 the reds had trailed them and failing to recapture
 them had vented their anger and their vengeance upon
 the peaceful colonists who had given sanctuary to the
 slaves as they had to us no doubt the agricultural
 ants had fought valiantly no doubt their insect allies
 had aided them but the details of the fight we never
 learned

   this murderous raid made me determined to settle
 once and for all with those uncannily human and
 brutal slave-owners i flatter myself that i am a
 peaceful man and i have always decried war but
 now i was possessed with a most warlike and belliger-
 ent spirit neither was i content to wait until the
 reds should again take the offensive i determined
 then and there to carry war into the enemys camp to
 attack the reds in their own territory but there were
 many obstacles in my way for tom and myself to
 attempt such a campaign alone was out of the ques-
 tion even had we possessed fire-arms we would most
 certainly have sacrificed our lives in such a quixotic
 attempt and it seemed almost as hopeless to think
 of inducing the agricultural-ants to aid us in the
 first place we could not communicate our ideas or
 wishes to them in the second place they were not a
 warlike race then i thought of the black savages
 they after all were the most intimately concerned
 with the slavers and they had the greatest reasons
 of all for wishing to have their oppressors destroyed
the world of the giant ants



but how could i communicate with them how could
i make my plans and wishes clear

  help came from an unexpected quarter and in an
unforeseen way the three slaves had willy-nilly attached
themselves to us and particularly to tom perhaps
his color gave them confidence perhaps the fact that
he had also been a slave of the reds inspired them
or possibly they realized that we were enemies of the
slave-owners friends of the agriculturalists and hence
friends of them low as they are in the scale of hu-
manity i believe even these ape-like human beings
possess some sense of gratitude otherwise i cannot
explain why they acted as they did why they watched
our every move our every expression and listened at-
tentively to our conversation as if striving to under-
stand us why they should have been so anxious to
interpret our wishes and to labor for us if torn
started to do any simple task a black would leap for-
ward and perform the duty for him if i wished an
object i had to point and a black would hurry to
bring it to me and to my amazement i found they
were not the unintelligent dumb beasts i had thought
though bestial in appearance though unspeakably filthy
in habits yet they possessed brains and reasoning
powers far above those of the most intelligent quad-
rupeds to be sure all three were young specimens-
mere infants in point of actual age but they were fully
developed for like the apes these savages mature in
an astonishingly short time undoubtedly they had
been reared from the embryo stage by the ants and so
had been trained to work but their aptitude for read-
ing our expressions for interpreting our gestures and
even the meaning of our words and orders was truly
marvelous here i thought were creatures capable
of being trained and if men can train elephants lions
seals and other creatures as they do why i reasoned
could i not train these savages to a far higher degree
once trained they would be ideal soldiers for i had
seen enough of them to know that they were born
fighters that they had the brutes blind courage and
lack of fear once their fighting spirit was aroused and
if i could train these three individuals would it not be
within the bounds of possibility and reason that i
could make them understand my object that i might
be able to make them convey that knowledge to the
rest of their tribe and that eventually i might have
a horde of savage blacks to accompany me on my at-
tack upon the red ants

but i had not foreseen events which amazed me even
more and made my task far easier than i had
dared hope within a week after being with us one
of the blacks astounded me by pointing to my bow
and clearly pronouncing the word bow almost
dumbfounded at this demonstration of the fellows
intelligence and adaptibility i decided to test him
further and addressing him said arrow for a brief
moment he hesitated moving his thick lips as if pro-
nouncing the word to himself then with a glad
cry he bounded off and came back carrying my sheaf
of arrows i cannot express the astonishment that i
felt the fellow actually had learned a smattering of
english had th others done the same i was not
left long in doubt all three had not only learned
the names of various articles so they could pronounce
them but had learned to recognize the names of many
more objects when i uttered them from that time
on i bent all my efforts to teaching the fellows to
speak and understand english and with far better
results than i would have believed possible to be
sure there were certain words that were impossible
for them to utter or to understand but i soon found
that we got on famously by using words of spanish

french or some indian dialect in place of these also
i was trying my best to acquire a working knowledge
of their gibberish i cannot say i succeeded well in
this but tom very quickly learned their almost un-
intelligible and gutteral words probably because of
some inherited aptitude for the tongue of his african
ancestors of course this took time weeks passed
but so interested had i become in this work that i
had almost forgotten my scheme to escape from the
valley and my determination to attack the red ants

  in the meantime too i had made still another
epochal discovery i say epochal for had it not been
for this i doubt if my plans ever would have ma-
terialized as far as they have this was the fact
that our blacks could understand and even communi-
cate with the ants no doubt while they were slaves
of the reds they had acquired some means of grasp-
ing or receiving the vibrations by which their mas-
ters communicated with one another but it came as
a distinct surprise to find they could converse-there
is no other name for it although it was not conversing
in the ordinary sense-with the agricultural-ants also
and as a natural result with the giant dragon-flies
the huge bees the carib-beetles and even with our
bombardiers do not imagine however that i mean
to convey the idea that the semi-human beings could
carry on a discussion with the insects or could talk
freely with them they could convey meanings to the
ants and their allies and could understand the insects
meaning to a certain extent

  at the time this impressed me merely as being use-
ful for it paved a way for tom and myself to get in
closer touch with our hosts by using the blacks as in-
terpreters but later it proved of inestimable benefit
in a wholly unforeseen way

  i must however curb my desire to write so fully
of all that has transpired during the past months i
must confine myself to the most important facts and
events suffice it to say that eventually i set out with
tom and our three blacks for the savages headquarters
beyond the aphid-orchards of that memorable visit
i need only mention the results with our meagre
knowledge of the blacks language we- caught only a
word here and there as they conversed with their
swarming curious fellows no doubt they related mar-
velous tales but the main point was that they fol-
lowed my instructions and explained my ideas and
plans and of still greater importance is the fact that
their fellow tribesmen unanimously were with us in
our plans to attack the red ants heaven knows they
had suffered enough to make them welcome such an
opportunity but by themselves so great was their
terror of their hereditary enemies they would never
have attempted such a thing the first matter then
was to provide the blacks with weapons unarmed as
they were they were no match for the natural fighting-
machines in the shape of warrior-ants but with bows
and arrows even with hatchets spears and clubs they
would be in a different state indeed much time was
devoted to the preparation of weapons and still more
to teaching the savages to use them and i am sorry
to say that there were not a few casualties among the
blacks before i could make them understand that they
were to confine the use of their weapons to their
enemies and were not to practice on one another the
things were so new and strange to them that for some
time they could not overcome their curiosity to test
them upon any living thing they saw repeatedly one
savage would fire an arrow into the body of a fellow
savage and both he and the victim would stand gazing
with most ludicrous expressions of utter amazement
at the result never did i hear a wounded savag
utter any sound denoting pain and i am not sure that


amazing stories quarterly

they actually do feel pain in fact they are a most
puzzling lot and at times i cannot settle in my own
mind whether they are men apes or insects this
may sound like the ravings of a lunatic but these fel-
lows have some of the attributes of all three

touring all this time i had a vague fear that the
reds might raid the blacks prematurely for i
did not desire a battle until i was morally sure that
we could emerge victorious but luck or nature have
been with us and so far no reds have put in an
appearance my blacks are fairly well trained in the
use of their weapons and before very long i feel we
will be in a position to give a good account of our-
selves moreover i believe the agriculturalists will
join us they appear to have grasped the idea but
they are naturally and by instinct so domestic and
peaceful that i have little hopes in that direction i
have often thought of using my powder in connection
with my attack upon the reds but i hesitate to use it
for such a purpose i am still intent upon blasting a
way to the outer world and i only wish i had an inex-
haustible supply of explosive for i feel sure that prop-
erly used it would prove more destructive to the red
slave owners than anything else perhaps however it
would so terrify my own forces that its effects would
be nullified

  and now i must set down some incidents that might
seem incredible to us in this amazing place they do
not appear so remarkable as many other experiences

  discussing one thing and another with tom and re-
counting our adventures we brought up the matter of
the giant tortoises and into my mind flashed that
joking remark i had made to the effect that the giant
iand-turtles were like army-tanks an inspiration came
to me was it not possible to transform that semi-
humorous comparison into a reality could not those
monstrous armor-clad beasts actually be used in our
forthcoming war

  i had no expectations of training the beasts for i
well knew that the chelidae are among the most stupid
of creatures and as far as i know no one has ever
been able to train a tortoise of any species but a
turtle once headed in a certain direction will usually
travel in that direction almost as inexorably as fate
the immense beasts moving across the ants country
even over the ants themselves would smooth down
mounds and earthworks and crush the insects as effec-
tually as a steam-roller and no ant not even the
iant solitary species could make the slightest impres-
 ion upon the tough skins of the turtles moreover and
this was i felt the most important point a man or
men mounted upon one of these living fortresses would
le in a far more favorable position to bash in the
leads and jab spears into the vitals of his enemies
or even to shoot arrows or sling stones than from the
ground possibly i was a little mad perhaps i am
still but the idea took possession of me and the
very next day accompanied by our three blacks we set
off for the turtle hill we had no difficulty in locating
the brutes and no trouble in mounting them but to
drive them back to our home was a very different mat-
ter i have said that a turtle once started in a cer-
tain direction will continue to move in that direction
but while i found this quite true in the case of the
riant tortoises the direction in which they moved was
not our direction try as we might we could not
start them in the desired direction for the first
lime the black savages showed signs of enjoyment and
a bense of humor never before had i observed either
of these human attributes among them but here in
cur tussle with the ponderous but harmless turtles

they were as gleeful and joyous as children for hours
we labored trying to induce the turtles to head to-
wards our distant home we tried every device we
could think of-without success if a turtle was turned
in the direction we desired he would either refuse
to move and would withdraw into his shell or in-
stantly would wheel about and head another way never
have i dealt with such obstinate beasts an army
mule is the most tractable of creatures by compari-
son and it was as hopeless to try to use force as it
would have been with an elephant at last we gave
up in despair and weary with our effort left the tor-
toises to their hillside

  but our trip to the turtle hill brought results of a
very different sort as we were returning we came
upon a column of the terrible army-ants to be sure
it was not a large army such as that from which tom
and i had so narrowly escaped long before never-
theless it was big enough to strike terror to our hearts
and turning we were about to flee for our lives when
we stood rivetted to the spot at sight of the three blacks
instead of racing away from the voracious creatures
they were calmly approaching them in a moment the
foremost ants would be upon them the huge scissors-
like jaws would seize the savages and tear them to
bits before our eyes

  and then an amazing an absolutely incredible thing
happened the three blacks began dancing and leap-
ing about shouting shrill metallic sounds and instantly
as if obeying an order the advancing column of great
blind ants came to an abrupt halt i could scarcely
believe the evidence of my eyes by some uncanny
power by some miraculous means the three fellows
had stopped that army of the most terrible of all ants
and there they stood hissing and squealing uttering
strange high-pitched notes as if actually conversing
with the army-ants and that in effect was precisely
what they were doing what they said how they man-
aged it are matters entirely inexplicable to me but
the fact remains that somehow they controlled the
creatures and conveyed their meaning to them

  but still more incredible developments were to follow
leaving his companions one of the blacks came hurry-
ing to us and in his broken half-comprehensible man-
ner suggested to me that we should enlist the army
ants in our service

  now i was perfectly sure i had gone mad i began
to feel that it was all an hallucination that the
savages the ants my plans for a battle perhaps even
the valley itself were all figments of my mind the
idea was unthinkable too preposterous and yet i felt
as sane as ever in my life at any rate i thought if
this is madness if all i have suffered and undergone
are merely my fancy if it is all the workings of a
diseased mind i might as well carry on in the same
insane manner but in my heart i knew that it was
no question of insanity that i was neither dreaming
nor suffering from any mental derangement and that
considered calmly it was no more remarkable that these
blacks could communicate with army-ants than that
they could do the same with the red ants or the agri-
culturalists and if they could communicate with them
why should they not induce the army ants to join us
as allies for all i knew they also were natural ene-
mies of the red brutes for all i knew they were
friends of the savages and if the army ants did join
us heaven pity the red slave owners when we at-
tacked them

chapter xix

events have moved rapidly since last i wrote
describing our preparations for war upon the
red ants it seems scarcely believable but it is
the world of the giant ants



 nevertheless true that the army-ants have proved most
 tractable and have exhibited the most astonishing in-
 telligence neither tom nor myself have any influence
 over them but our three blacks appear to be able to
 control them absolutely i have come to the conclusion
 that it is some form of hypnotism that these savages
 only a step above the animals and insects are much
 closer to the lower forms of life mentally than are
 we and that their minds although far below ours in
 development are yet so immeasurably above those of
 the insects that they can dominate the latter by will
 or hypnotic power to draw a parallel just as the
 hypnotist with a powerful will and personality can
 hypnotize a weaker-minded man so these savages can
 control the actions and wills of the weaker-minded ants
 unquestionably it is this power that has enabled them
 to survive and hold their own in this land from which
 the civilized white race was forced to flee or pos-
 sibly it is the other way about and self-preservation
 and necessity have led to these humans developing
 their hypnotic power over their natural enemies cer-
 tain it is that without some such power these beings
 ignorant of the simplest weapons never could have
 survived amid the countless hordes of giant ravenous
 insects

  but the most surprising thing to me is that they
have not used the same power to control the red slave-
owners the only explanation is that these super-ants
are not subject to the mental power of the blacks
also it seems strange that being able to enlist such
beasts as the army-ants in their cause the blacks have
not long ago led an attacking force against their red
enemies

  but no doubt it never occurred to them for they
have no inventive ability no foresight and no imagina-
tion and having been for countless generations sub-
ject to the slave raids they have grown to regard
their plight as a natural condition not until i
brought the matter to their minds did they dream of
organized action to protect themselves

  but i am wandering from the more important mat-
ters of my records fortunately the army-ants needed
no especial training for they were naturally born
soldiers and possessed an organization and discipline
far more efficient than i could have evolved all i
would require of them would be to head them for the
red ants colony and they would do the rest and as i
thought of this i wondered why neither these slave-
holders nor the agriculturalists had been attacked and
overwhelmed by their army-ant cousins our peaceful
hosts had been raided by the droughers and by the
reds i had witnessed battles between them and the
solitary ants and yet for some reason they appeared
to me immune to attacks from the far more voracious
and savage army-ants there must be some explana-
tion i felt sure and i noticed that even with our
ant-army near at hand the agriculturalists came and
went and showed no fear of the terrible creatures
but the ways of the lower animals are past human
understanding and despite the years of study which
have been devoted to them and the voluminous works
that have been published we really know nothing about
the mental processes the innermost motives and the
instincts of the creatures all about us we observe a
certain trait or habit a certain reaction and judge
the reasons and the causes thereof by our own re-
actions and point of view which for all we know may
be totally at variance with the lower forms of life
never had these facts been made so obvious to me
as since i have been in this valley where insects rule
and predominate and such humans as there are are
the lower animals if i may so put it

  but again i am getting off my subject and must
stop dissertating i could not determine the reason
for our agricultural ants being on peaceful if not
friendly terms with our army-ants and there was no
use troubling my mind over it it was fortunate that
it was so and that was enough having seen the
strange power which the blacks exerted over the army-
ants i decided to determine if they possessed the same
or a similar power over any of our other neighbors
such as the giant bumble-bees the dragon-flies and the
carib-beetles for if they did and they could enlist these
creatures in our service we would possess a fighting
force which could attack from the air as well as on
foot the idea tickled me immensely for it savored
of modern warfare with airplanes and this conceit
brought another and more fantastic idea to my mind
why not go a bit farther and use other methods of
modern war why not employ bombs even gas in our
attack i might not be able to make firearms but i
certainly should be able to design and construct some
form of explosive bomb or grenade and sulphur
fumes would be as deadly to the red ants as the most
terrible of destructive gases to human beings but
would it be possible to train the giant dragon-flies to
carry and drop such things that was a great ques-
tion and i greatly doubted if the broad-winged insects
had enough intelligence to enable them to grasp the
idea even if by some means i could communicate with
them through the medium of the black savages how-
ever even if this were not possible i could make
grenades which could be hurled among the ants either
by hand or by some mechanical contrivance

there is no need to relate in detail all my efforts
my failures my disappointments and my experi-
ments i had comparatively little difficulty in induc-
ing the dragon-flies to carry objects into the air and
there was still less difficulty in getting them to drop
these objects the trouble was to get them to drop
the things at the right time and in the right place
they appeared to regard it as a sort of game and i
sincerely believe that these insects possess a sense of
humor repeatedly they would let their burden fall
within a few feet of me and i swear they actually
grinned when they saw me jump hastily to one side
it was hopeless to waste time and effort in trying to
train the creatures and i could foresee that if given
explosive bombs they were as likely to drop the con-
traptions upon their friends as upon their enemies
but if my ambitions in this direction were doomed to
be abandoned my experiments had led to another idea
i had observed that both the dragon-flies and bees
were natural retrievers and would swoop with the
speed of lightning the moment an object that glit-
tered was tossed into the air i could not train the
creatures to obey my signals or my voice and the
blacks had as little control over them as i had but
by throwing objects into the air i could bring the
insects dashing earthward hence if when we attacked
the reds i could manage to throw missiles of some
sort into the air my flying squadron would come
swooping down and seeing their friends fighting with
the red ants they would undoubtedly fall upon the
slave-owners with all the fury of their savage natures

  meanwhile the idea of using grenades and bombs
was still uppermost in my mind we now had a
sufficient supply of saltpeter to make a large amount
of powder and i decided that most efficient bombs
could be made of pottery by making globular ves-
sels with thick walls and leaving a small orifice for
a fuse we would have fairly good substitutes for the
old-fashioned spherical bomb-shells of course they

could not be accurately timed neither was it possible
to arrange them to explode by concussion for i had
no fulminate and no means of making it but it
would not matter if a fuse spluttered and smoked for
some time after it fell among our enemies they
would not know what it was and would never dream
of attempting to extinguish the fuse but there was
another and more important problem to be solved

   once we attacked the red ants it would i knew be
a hand-to-hand fight and a general mele and to at-
tempt to throw grenades into the struggling mass
would be to kill and maim as many friends as foes
no if my bombs were to prove of any value we must
manage to hurl them at the ants before the actual
battle began and to do this we must have some sort
of engine or machine	v

  small grenades might be fired from bows by being
fitted to the tips of arrows much as grenades known
as whizz-bangs were fired from mechanical devices
during the great war but the larger ones on which
i counted most would be far too heavy to be used in
this way the only device i could think of was a
sort of catapault and i spent many days experimenting
and working on that idea

  under normal conditions it would have been an
easy job to rig up a small catapault but we had no
tool worthy of the name except my hunting knife and
the simplest undertaking became a stupendous matter
under such conditions

   but at last i had the satisfaction of seeing my crude
affair complete and i was as delighted as a boy with
his first gun when we tested the machine and sent a
dummy bomb sailing far over the tree tops we could
not well use more than one of the things and i con-
tented myself with this first catapault meanwhile our
army-ants were literally eating their heads off our
black fellows had them in charge and allowed them to
roam about always accompanying them and keeping
them under control in order to forage for themselves
as a result the country for miles about was stripped
clean of almost everything edible and food became a
serious problem for us but we were now nearly
ready to launch our attack and in two days more
would start on our march for the red ants stronghold

  then all our plans were upset exhausted terror-
stricken two of the blacks came rushing to our camp
the red ants had made another raid they had carried
off more of the savages as slaves and had left scores of
dead and wounded behind them despite the re-
sistance made by the blacks and the good use they
had made of the weapons we had supplied they had
been overpowered

  but they had given a very good account of them-
selves and the reds had not gotten off unscathed by
any means for every black killed at least two of
the raiders had been destroyed but the odds in num-
bers had been overwhelming the hereditary fear of
the red ants had had its effect upon the savages and
having no leader and having been taken by surprise
they had fought without order or system too late i
realized my short-sightedness in not having posted
scouts to warn of such a raid but there was no use
in lamenting that now

   the allies on which i had counted the most had been
demoralized and decimated but to my surprise the
savages instead of being terrorized or anxious to avoid
further conflict were all the more eager to even scores
with their foes

  there was no use in waiting longer the blacks
were eager to regain their fellows who had been made
prisoners and to revenge themselves our army-ants
could not be maintained in idleness indefinitely we

had a supply of bombs and our catapault and i de-
termined to set off on our campaign at once my
chelonian army as i called it in honor of the turtles
we did not get was a strange weird organization the
strangest army that eyes ever looked upon there were
the horde of brutal ugly naked black savages-half
human half-beasts the swarming blind terrible-jawed
inexorable army-ants the great hard-shelled rapidly-
moving metallic-hued carib-beetles the peaceful agri-
cultural ants like ploughboys and farmers drafted into
a real army our retinue of tame bombardier-beetles
and tom and myself while overhead buzzed and
whirred the dragon-flies and bumble-bees like scouting
airplanes and never was there an army more difficult
to control to handle and to deploy it would have been
bad enough with the savages alone but with all the
diversified units each a law unto itself each with dis-
tinct ideas instincts and habits the most experienced
and efficient general on earth could not have pre-
vented it from being chaotic the carib-beetles would
dash off after prey whenever they pleased the blacks
pranced and shook their weapons and uttered bestial
shouts

   the agricultural-ants were thinking far more of their
crops and fields than of military tactics the dragon-
flies and bees flew here there and everywhere and
only the army-ants under control of their savage mas-
ters moved steadily irresistibly onward like well-
trained troops i had strapped our catapault to the
back of our largest bombardier another carried our
ammunition and bombs and these docile domesticated
beasts could be counted upon despite the seeming con-
trol exercised over the army-ants by the savages i had
little confidence in these blind scimitar-jawed creatures
and tom was deadly afraid of them hence for the
sake of safety and partly because they were to serve
as our shock-troops the army-ants were in the advance
with the blacks behind them and the agriculturalists
tom myself and our cohorts of domestic insects
bringing up the rear

chapter xx

looking back upon it i do not think that any of
the members of my army actually understood what
it was all about with the possible exception of the
blacks they of course had semi-human minds and an idea
of revenge of righting personal wrongs and of fighting
for a principle but the others were merely insects
with insects minds and habits and in the insect-world

i doubt whether there are such things as vengeance
wrongs or principles certain species are predatory
certain species are not some insects live on friendly
terms with others some are always at war but all
this is a condition of nature a part of the great plan
and as there are no family ties no feelings of blood
relationship no such emotion as affection among in-
sects there can be no ideas of right and wrong of
vengeance or of enmity aside from natural inherited
instinct all warfare among insects as far as i have
observed and it makes no difference whether or not
they are tiny thingsor giants creatures is either in
self-defense or to secure food countless millions of
larvie have been destroyed by ichneumons but the
butterfly or moth that develops from a larva which
has escaped bears no enmity towards the ichneumons
and has no fear of these terrible enemies of their kind
a wasp may swoop down and seize a spider but the
spiders never go out of their way to attack the wasps
a carib-beetle dashes in and seizes a victim from
among a busy colony of hornets but the hornets never
take concerted action against the carib-beetles nor at-
tack one whenever it is seen i could mention thou-
the world of the giant ants



sands of similar cases but i must confine myself to
more important matters and it was this lack of the
true militant spirit this entire absence of a true
purpose which i had not foreseen and which i now
feel convinced was our undoing it must be remem-
bered also that we could not really communicate with
any of our allies with the exception of the semi-human
savages to be sure all the various members of my
army had thrown in their lots with us but i feel
sure now that it was owing not to a desire to destroy
the red ants but was due entirely to the strange hyp-
notic power of the blacks and to the fact that tom
and myself were instinctively perhaps regarded as
beings so superior that we were dangerous and must
be humored possibly too the agriculturalists felt that
we were members of their colony and as suchvmust be
supported while their insect protectors accompanied
them as a matter of course

  i hate to record what transpired on that day i
had given far too little credit for intelligence to the
red ants perhaps they were apprized of our approach
by the swarm of dragon-flies and bees in the air pos-
sibly they had scouts posted in the forest perhaps
by some inexplicable instinct or intuition they learned
of our proximity or again perchance it was merely the
fact that they had developed far more intelligence than
their relatives and through countless centuries of life
maintained by warfare and raiding had developed
military instincts and tactics i confess i do not
know all went well until we came close to the orchards
of the slave-owners before us the forest ended and
the sunlight streamed upon the clearing in whose cen-
tre was the red ants citadel

  the place seemed strangely quiet strangely deserted
no slaves toiled under the watchful guardianship of the
reds onward we marched for a moment the army-
ants hesitated as they reached the cleared space they
moved their antennae about nervously stroked one an-
other seemed perplexed and then suddenly wheeling
abruptly they swung sharply to one side and hurried on
away from our objective in vain the blacks strove
to control them all their power over the creatures
seemed to have suddenly vanished

  heedless of the fellows the army-ants swept on their
course and presently were out of sight i was amazed
thunderstruck what had so abruptly influenced them
was there something about the red ants as about the
agriculturalists which prevented the army-ants from
molesting them prevented them even from trespass-
ing on their domains no doubt it was something
of the sort but i had no time to ponder on the causes
of their desertion

  the most powerful division of my army had van-
ished our forces had been deplorably reduced and still
there was no sign of the enemy quickly unlashing
our catapault i fitted a bomb to it and hurled the
missile into the red ants mound the next instant
it exploded and a cloud of smoke and sand flew up
from the spot this should bring the unsuspecting
ants swarming out i thought but still there was no
fign of life another bomb followed and then as
perplexed wondering we started forward a black
savage threw up his arms uttered a terrified cry and
vanished in the solid earth before i realized what
had happened two more followed then a carib-
beetle was swallowed by the earth and a dozen agricul-
turalists went with him scarcely had they vanished
when from every side came rushing the red warriors
bursting through the ground they had undermined to
trap us they surrounded us their great jaws clashing
their armor-clad bodies gleaming red as blood in the
bun

instantly the battle was on valiantly our agri-
cultural friends fought body to body jaw to jaw
they slashed bit wrestled with their red foes and
like the savages they were the blacks threw themselves
into the melee clubs and swords swung spears darted
arrows flew no quarter was given and every man
and insect fought for himself had our forces equalled
or even approximated those of the red ants we would
have utterly routed them perhaps annihilated them
but they were three to our one and despite the ad-
vantages of weapons i knew our forces were doomed
tom and i were in the thick of it but we had a tre-
mendous advantage we possessed explosives and each
time a red warrior or a group of warriors rushed
at us we hurled a grenade with ghastly results in
this way we managed to keep a cleared space about us
and as fighting groups separated from the mass and
our friends fell we threw bombs into the knots of
victors and helped even scores had it not been for
these missiles not one of us i believe would have
escaped as it was the red ants blown to pieces in
groups and singly unable to face this new form of
battle overcome by the acrid fumes of the powder
began to give way scores hundreds lay dead and
wounded all about as many more lay writhing help-
less overcome by the sulphurous smoke but the num-
ber of dead and wounded agricultural ants and savages
was apalling few of the agricultural ants survived
over half the blacks had succumbed and even the
armor-clad carib-beetles had fallen before the maniacal
fury of the giant red ants only the great bees and
dragon-flies had escaped without great loss and they
had taken little part in the fray once or twice a bee
had dashed down and had stabbed a red warrior with
its terrible sting once a dragon-fly had volplaned
down and had nipped off the head of a red ant and
had triumphantly borne it aloft to drop it a moment
later into a struggling knot of fighters and two of
the dragon-flies had fallen victims to their habit of
dashing after any bright object and to my bombs
swooping down as i hurled the missiles they had
seized them in mid-air and an instant later had been
blown to bits by the explosives 

  as far as the red ants were concerned the fight was
over as quickly as they had materialized from no-
where they vanished into their subterranean burrows
and we were left alone with our dead and dying

  the only consolation in the whole miserable disas-
trous affair was that not one of our allies had shown
fear or had given way there was no thought of
retreat in their minds and so filled were they with
the lust of battle that both savages and agricultural
ants fell upon the dead and wounded reds and tore
them to pieces and greedily deliberately the carib-
beetles gorged themselves upon the bodies of the fallen
warriors

  for a space i considered pushing onward and de-
stroying the homes of the slave-holders but i feared
the whole area had been undermined and i felt morally
certain that we would find no occupants within the
citadel it was obvious that the red ants had been
prepared for us that they had made the pitfalls to
trap us that their warriors had lain concealed under-
ground until ready for the attack and i had no doubt
that they had provided for all contingencies and had
removed all their fellows and their slaves to some secret
hiding place to keep them from falling into our hands
in case we were victorious no doubt too the scent
of the hidden red warriors had aroused the suspicions
of the army-ants and had caused them to turn aside
and thus avoid the pitfalls

  throughout the red ants had exhibited a high de-


amazing stories quarterly

gree of intelligence and a knowledge of military tac-
tics we had been rather squarely outwitted out-
generalled and beaten and there was nothing to be
done except to retrace our way to the colony of the
agriculturalists

  to return to our homes was more easily said than
done throughout our weary march we had to fight
our way for the red ants had closed in behind us
and beset us on every side only the fact that they
were so to speak out of their element saved us from
utter destruction they were however insects of the
open rather than of the jungles and were accustomed
to fighting in clearings and not in dense growth and
they had acquired a very great respect for our weapons
whenever we caught sight of a red warrior at a dis-
tance a discharge of arrows and missiles from qui-
slings would end in victory for us and i thanked
iieaven that these creatures had not reached a stage
of development that had enabled them to make use of
other weapons than their powerful jaws and feet often
however they would come unexpectedly rushing at us
from concealment and desperate hand-to-hand duels
would ensue but our black allies appeared rather to
enjoy fighting now that they possessed weapons and
they took the keenest delight in bashing in the heads
of the red warriors or slicing through their attenuated
necks with their saw-edged swords as for the agri-
cultural-ants they appeared to take the whole affair
as a matter of course in every respect they always
have reminded me of yokels or farmers among humans
having the same dogged determination the same bull-
dog persistency the same methodical way of doing
everything-fighting included they would plod along
the most peaceful-appearing of creatures until a red
ant would rush upon them when-presto they would
become fighting machines alert fearless possessed
with a sort of calculating calm ferocity that was far
more terrible than sudden anger or rage and more
than half the time they would come off the victors
tom and i had our share also to be sure our
superior brains our better weapons and the fact that
we were more accustomed to the weapons were all in
our favor but on the other hand the fearsome
aspect of these giant adversaries carried terror to our
hearts and i always felt-though i am rather ashamed
to admit it a sort of superstitious dread of the crea-
tures a sensation that i was fighting with some un-
canny monstrous beings not of this world and i
invariably felt chilly and shaky whenever one of the
reds rushed at me

npom was even more affected in this way than i
was he was deadly afraid of all the huge in-
sects and of the ants in particular like all of his
race he is extremely superstitious and while he had
-by the greatest efforts of self control-overcome his
dread of the agricultural ants he still insisted the
others were not real insects but jumbies moreover
his experience among the slave-owners had served to
make him still more afraid of the red ants

  but he is not lacking in courage and will fight as
desperately for his life as anyone and it is a brave
man indeed who can stand up and face a monstrous
six-foot creature all shining chiton with its six-
armed many-jointed legs its fierce staring eyes and
its great clashing keen-edged jaws capable of biting
a human body in twain neither of us escaped without
a scratch however toms body and limbs were cov-
ered with blood from cuts and slashes of the ants
claws and one beast had taken a good sized piece out
of my shoulder but i thanked god that his snapping
jaws had missed my neck by the fraction of an inch

most of our losses however were among the agricul-
tural ants who fought with natures weapons but
several of the blacks were killed others were badly
wounded and only the carib-beetles and our bom-
bardiers escaped unscathed the former did good
work and more than once pulled down and destroyed
our enemies while the latter although for some rea-
son refusing to use their gas discharges at the red
ants were most useful in giving us warning of the
slave-owners lurking in ambush

  it was a pitifully small remnant of my army that
at last reached the colony of agricultural ants only to
find that disaster had overtaken it during our unsuc-
cessful foray

  obviously the red ants had had full knowledge of
our activities for i cannot convince myself that it
was mere coincidence that the red ants had reached
the colony by a roundabout route and had vented all
their savage fury upon it while we were attacking their
stronghold

  they had slain for the mere lust of slaying had
destroyed crops and harvested grain had even entered
the burrows and galleries and had ruthlessly killed the
inquilines the larvre and every living thing they could
find

  scarcely an agriculturalist remained alive and unin-
jured and worst of all we could not retaliate or even
pay off a few pf the scores had we been able to do
so for the raiders had completed their destruction and
had departed before we arrived on the scene

  with the diligence and industry so typical of their
kind the agricultural ants in my army instantly fell
to work repairing the damages to their galleries and
homes presently several went hurrying off and within
an hour they returned leading a long column of their
fellows each bearing a burden of grain or corn i
was astonished the messengers had gone to a neigh-
boring colony had besought aid in their extremity and
their fellows had come to their rescue for hours the
string of ants came and went steadily until enough
grain had been stored to supply all immediate needs
but the neighbors did not stop there several hun-
dred remained at the stricken colony and aided in
repairing damages in starting new fields and in bring-
ing order out of chaos even larva were brought to
replace those killed or injured and in an astonishingly
short time the colony as far as outward appearances
were concerned might never have been attacked surely
among these creatures a friend in need is a friend
indeed

chapter xxi

since our defeat by the red ants a most deplorable
state of affairs has developed we have been
driven out by the agricultural ants and have been
forced to take up our abode among the black savages
how strange are the ways of an inscrutable providence
or of fate how strange a turn of the wheel of for-
tune that we should find our only friends and allies in
all this vast land are the beings whom we so despised
and shunned the beings who first showed hostility to-
wards us

  i cannot say and do not know why the agricultural
ants would not permit us to dwell with them longer
provisions were short and it would have been a long
time before the new crops were ready for harvesting
and meanwhile the larvse would have matured and
there would have been far too many mouths to feed
perhaps it was due to this fact and a fear that we
would take some of the slender supply of provender
that induced them to get rid of us

perhaps it was due to the fact that they regarded
the world of the giant ants



us as responsible for the defeat by the red ants and
the following raid or perhaps they felt that we were
the primary cause of all the trouble with the slave-
holders and that they would not be free from future
attacks as long as we remained in the colony

  whatever their reasons we were soon made to un-
derstand that we were no longer welcome guests we
returned from a hunt to find all of our belongings
moved outside the walls i wondered at this but did
not then realize what it meant and tom and myself
together with the two blacks one had been killed in
the battle patiently carried the things back to our
hut a little later several ants appeared and began
picking up our possessions and moving them again
still failing to take the hint i seized our goods and
had quite a tussle with the ants before i ecovered
them then as if by preconcerted arrangement a
horde of the ants swarmed down upon us and not
only bore all we owned outside the colony walls but
commenced tearing our hut to bits before our eyes
no one could mistake the hint and dumbfounded we
stood beside our few belongings like excited tenants in
a city homeless friendless and unable even to demand
an explanation to be sure we could again camp in
the forest as we had done at first i also thought of
returning to our cave in the mountain side but some-
how after dwelling for so long with the ants we felt
inexpressibly lonesome and friendless and i felt more
miserable and disheartened than at any time since
entering the valley but for the time being there was
nothing to do but to camp as best we might and
with the help of the blacks-who still stuck by us and
were most faithful willing fellows-we gathered what
we had under a clump of trees put up a rude shelter
and spent a miserable night

  but worse was to come the agricultural ants having
turned against us had no intention of allowing us in
the vicinity and it was barely light the next morning
when they appeared in force and by actions and man-
ner told us as plainly as in so many words to move
on they pushed and urged us though without rough-
ness or violence and despite my resentment and my
regret at thus being treated like a malefactor or other
undesirable i could not but marvel at the ants per-
sistence and bravery though they well knew our
strength and the efficiency of our weapons they laid
hold of us and showed no signs of fear that we might
resist and fight no doubt we could have inflicted
serious damages and killed many had we resisted but
i well knew this behavior would only make matters
worse i had seen enough of the agricultural ants to
know they were determined dogged valiant fighters
with an obstinate bulldog persistency and even if we
beat off the ants for the time scores hundreds of
others would take their places and in all probability
our lives would be sacrificed for nothing at all events
there was no reason why we should remain in that
spot more than in another and so shouldering our
burdens we left the ants and their colony and headed
towards our cave in the mountains

  our way led near the aphis-orchards of the blacks
and as we neared these the two savages with us
showed the greatest delight evidently thinking we
were headed for their home after all i thought why
shouldnt we take up our abode near the black fellows
they were degraded filthy brutal little above the
insects in the scale of evolution but they were after
all human

  we need not come into very close contact with them
need not share their dens and food any more than we
had shared the quarters of the agriculturalists and
surely if we had lived months with a colony of ants

we should be able to exist among human beings low
as these were moreover here was cleared land and
we could cultivate and raise crops for we were sorely
in need of some food other than meat and the grain
we had obtained from our ant friends in addition i
felt a greater interest in the blacks than i had before
the battle for they had exhibited a deal of bravery
had proven that they were capable of being trained
and educated and i believed i might be able to do a
great deal towards uplifting them of course i still
had in mind my scheme for blasting a way to free-
dom but i had exhausted my supply of powder in our
ill-fated attack on the red ants and weeks even
months would be required to accumulate a new sup-
ply meanwhile i could keep my mind busy in my
effort to educate and teach the savages while finally
they would prove most useful in aiding us by carry-
ing the sulphur and doing other heavy work

  hence considering these various matters i turned
aside and headed for the stronghold of the black sav-
ages although as i neared their settlement i began to-
have some doubts as to the reception they would accord
us after the battle they had gone off and while the
two who were with us had remained faithful and
friendly i was not at all sure that the others might
not have grown resentful when they thought over their
losses and might therefore treat us very much as
had the agricultural ants

but i need not have feared any such developments
as we came in sight of the clearing our blacks
shouted and yelled and instantly out from their bur-
rows swarmed a crowd of the savages one glance
and with wild whoops and dancing and leaping like
mad things they came rushing towards us their
greeting was vociferous enthusiastic and far too odor-
ous for comfort but there was no doubt about our
being welcome here to them we no doubt appeared
as most superior beings which i flatter myself we are
and even though they had lost heavily in the battle yet
they must have realized that we were their friends
and had done our best to free them from the ever-
present dread of their oppressors i was rather sur-
prised that the red ants had not included the blacks
village in their foray upon the agriculturalist but
when i came to consider the matter it was not sur-
prising to have wrought havoc here would have
availed them nothing and would have greatly decreased
their ever available supply of slaves also no doubt
they felt that we might fall upon their rear if they
delayed too long and hence confined their attack to
the agricultural ants looking back upon it now i am
fairly certain that the red ants attack on the agri-
cultural ants colony was a most devilishly planned
scheme to get rid of us i believe the creatures rea-
soned that if they injured the agriculturalists the
latter would blame us and would turn against us ex-
actly as they did and no doubt the red ants thought
that the agriculturalists would go to extremes and
destroy us

  having made up my mind to remain temporarily at
least with the blacks we lost no time in preparing a
suitable dwelling with hundreds of hands to help us
this was not difficult and it was surprising how
rapidly our hut was built and how much easier it was
to direct the savages than the ants here were beings
with whom we could at least converse after a manner
whereas among the ants our sole means of communi-
cation was by a most unsatisfactory lot of signs more-
over low as they were the blacks possessed semi-human
manners of thought and psychology whereas the ants
despite their intelligence and size were after all out

r-nd out insects with insects instincts ideas and habits
ind by no possible means could they ever acquire any-
thing approaching human intelligence

  our house here was built of stones and clay and was
a far better structure than was our former residence
in the ant-colony it was at some distance from the
blacks dwellings and pleasantly situated in the shade
of some large trees on the farther edge of the cleared
space by nightfall we were quite at home and would
have been comfortable enough had it not been for the
friendly though rather unwelcome attentions of our
savage hosts they insisted upon gathering about and
brought us innumerable offerings of aphis milk de-
cayed insect meat and other things which they consid-
ered delicacies but which were nauseating to us all
carried the weapons we had provided and to my sur-
prise and delight i discovered that they actually had
made duplicates of their own several had slings that
were as serviceable though more crudely made as
those we had furnished one or two had clubs which
were wicked-looking things though ungainly and cum-
bersome and one fellow had an apology for a bow with
which to my astonishment he could shoot far more
accurately than with the bows i had made here was
proof positive that these miserable ape-like beings were
far more intelligent than i had surmised they pos-
sessed an imitative instinct to a high degree and in
addition actually had a germ of inventiveness and
ingenuity in their dull brains

  how long i wondered would it take to raise these
blacks to the plane of ordinary savage races they
bred and matured so much more rapidly than other
human beings that i had no doubt that the under-
taking to develop them would be far simpler and
quicker than with barbarous races possessing more of
the human attributes in a way it would be like
training anthropoid apes creatures which at four or
five years of age are fully developed mentally and
physically but on the other hand would acquired
habits and characters be inherited if so with their
rapid growth and increase as much could be accom-
plished in a few years as in centuries with ordinary
humans it was a fascinating idea and my scientific
curiosity to experiment along these lines was so thor-
oughly aroused that i almost decided to delay attempt-
ing to escape from the valley but common sense over-
ruled scientific ardor if i escaped it would always
be possible to return and experiment to my hearts
content

  and what was to prevent me from taking our two
black adherents with me they would prove most
useful on our long dangerous return to civilization and
they would provide most perfect subjects for scientific
investigation yes when i made the attempt i most
certainly would try to carry our two savages along
with us

chapter xxii

we have been among the blacks for several weeks
and many new events have transpired which i
think worth recording although i am getting
woefully short of space in my notebooks however if
worst comes to worst i can make a fair substitute for
paper from the inner bark of the seda virgin tree or
i might even use parchment but i still hope to escape
from this valley before my paper is exhausted i have
found the savages even more quick to learn than i
had expected or hoped i have a number of them well
trained as agriculturalists and they take as keen an
interest in watching the plants sprout and grow as any
surburbanite in the springtime at home others i
have taught to dress and cure skins others to pre-

pare bark-cloth and i have spent a good deal of time
trying to teach the women to spin and weave the wild
cotton that grows here and also the silk from the huge
cocoons what a find this place would prove for silk
manufacturers here are silk-worms a yard and more
in length which spin cocoons containing thousands of
feet of silk so strong and perfect that it could be
wound upon spools and used as thread without any
preparation

  also i have employed a large proportion of the men
in fortifying this place for i am sure that sooner or
later and probably sooner the red ants will raid the
blacks in their customary manner although the sav-
ages settlement is admirably adapted for defense and
with a sufficient force could be held against a large
body of attackers more especially now that we are
well provided with weapons nevertheless we could
not have hoped to make a successful resistance it is
seldom that any great number of the denizens are
present during the day they are obliged to be absent
tending their aphis-herds cultivating the gardens we
have established and attending to other duties and
an attack would find us short-handed my first under-
taking was to surround the centre of the clearing with
walls these were not so much for defense-for the
red ants could surmount any wall with ease-but to
give our people the advantage of being able to hurl
missiles down upon the enemy and so to take the
latter at a disadvantage as they scaled the defenses
it was a huge undertaking but the blacks-though
without the least idea as to plans or purposes-took
childish delight in erecting the walls and the place is
now completely encompassed by a strong stone earth
and clay wall nine feet in height and nearly six feet
in thickness there are no openings in this and the
blacks and ourselves enter and leave by means of lad-
ders which are drawn up very similar in many respects
to the way in which the pueblo indians of our south-
western states protect their homes from attacks in
addition i have had a vast quantity of stones piled here
and there along the summits of the walls these can
be quickly rolled and hurled upon an enemy and i have
also provided many roughly-made containers which are
kept filled with powdered sulphur for i feel sure
that the giant red ants will be overcome by sulphur
fumes as quickly as are ordinary ants

  it was while i was having this sulphur prepared
that another means of defense occurred to me this
was to mine the area beyond the wall so that an at-
tacking force could be blown up at the proper mo-
ment the red ants had demoralized us by their pit-
falls but explosive mines would go them one better
the only trouble was to secure enough powder for
the purpose i had prepared quite a quantity of gun-
powder since my arrival here and much of this i had
used in making grenades or bombs to be thrown from
the wall in case of an attack but to make enough
explosive to lay a series of mines would be next to
impossible and would require many months of labor
and if i did succeed and used the precious powder
for this purpose it would mean that i would have to
abandon my hopes of blasting into the tunnel for nearly
a year one half the amount required to lay the
mines would be enough to blast down the tunnel door
and hence i decided that the idea excellent as it was
was not practical

  but a few days later a discovery we made com-
pletely altered my viewpoint

  to the south of the aphis-orchards was a stretch of
country we had not previously explored several times
we had started in that direction but each time some-
thing had happened to prevent us from carrying out
the world of the giant ants



our intentions the first time it was the discovery of
the aphids that had sidetracked us the next it was
the raid of the red ants upon the blacks and at an-
other time it was the discovery of a stream which i
thought we might divert to provide an ample supply
of water for ourselves and the savages

  it was not a promising looking country from a dis-
tance and appeared to be a barren sterile waste much
like the desert of the tarantulas but on a smaller
scale beyond it however the mountains were very
broken and rough and their slopes were covered with
a vegetation that appeared to be different from any-
thing else i had seen in the valley there really
seemed no -valid reason for my desire to visit the
place but very often i had little to occupy my mind
and despite all my experiences my scientific ardor for
exploration at times took possession of me

  we found the place even more of a desert than the
tarantula desert i have already described the surface
was composed of jagged broken rock and hard-packed
sand with numerous low ridges of rock laid bare by
the wind like the half-buried skeletons of some gigan-
tic pre-historic monsters not even cactus showed upon
the waste and i was about to turn back from the for-
bidding spot when a shout from tom drew me to
him

  tank de lord chief he exclaimed we dont
been have to go without salt no more chief no sir
just looka here bout heres salt a growin in tha
sand

  he was pointing at small veins and outcrops of dull-
whitish crystals in a seam of the outjutting rock our
need of salt had been most acute and delighted that
tom had discovered the much needed mineral i picked
up a few particleg and touched them to my tonuge
my first taste was enough the sharp bitter taste
told me instantly what it was and while i was dis-
appointed at finding we must still go saltless i was
overjoyed at toms discovery the material was salitre
crude nitrates much like those of the chilean desert
but apparently far purer and instantly i realized that
powder-making henceforth would be an easy and simple
matter

  no longer need we gather spoonfuls of nitrate crys-
tals at a time from our rubbish piles here was a
natural deposit large enough to supply all our needs
and more and while i felt sure it was most crude and
contained many other chemicals yet i felt certain that
even if it proved unsuited for powder in its natural
form it would not be difficult to clean and refine it

our trip to the desert had not been in vain and
gathering all we could carry of the stuff we
hurried back to our hut i was eager to test the
quality of our new find and busied myself mixing the
other ingredients with the best salitre the result was
not by any means as satisfactory as i could have
wished the powder to be sure exploded but it
lacked the power and rapidity of the powder i had
hitherto made but this i was sure was due to the
impurities in the saltpeter and i set about experi-
menting at refining it

  i racked my brains trying to recall all the details of
the process as i had seen it at the nitrate officinas in
chile but not being a chemist and lacking many of
the essential requisites and apparatus the best i could
do was to put the mineral through a washing and
recrystallization process

  the result of this was far better than i had hoped
the resultant saltpeter was even superior to that we
had secured from the nitrarias and the powder made
with it was the best we had produced the next day

we returned to the deposit accompanied by a dozen or
more blacks and at the close of our labors we had
several hundred pounds of the salitre ready for re-
fining and use

  there was now no reason why i should not go ahead
with all my plans to blast our way out of the valley
and also in the meantime lay mines about our ter-
ritory

  for days we worked like slaves for i dared not mix
powder in large quantities and prepared the explosive
in small batches at considerable distances from one an-
other realizing that we might at any time be raided
by the slave-owners the first lot of powder went to
placing my mines these were earthenware jars filled
with powder and buried a foot beneath the sand and
with powder-trains leading to convenient spots within
the wall i had found it so difficult to make reliable
fuses even of short lengths for my grenades that i
abandoned the idea of using fuses for the mines but
instead laid conduits of bamboo sections under the
surface of the earth and scattered a powder-train 
through these i was so anxious to prove the efficiency
of my mines that as soon as the first one was in
place i touched fire to the end of the powder train
almost instantly the mine exploded with a roar send-
ing a shower of stones and sand high in air for an
instant the savages threw themselves down fairly
quaking with terror then as they realized that they
were not harmed and i tried to explain the purpose of
the mines they leaped up howling and shouting as
though they had actually seen their enemies blown to
atoms

  with a number of the mines laid about the clear-
ing i felt we were fairly safe from a successful at-
tack by our enemies and turned all my attentions to
manufacturing enough powder to blast down the gate-
way to the tunnel

  this i knew would be a far more difficult undertaking
than to blow a few hundred pounds of sand into the
air and i used the greatest care to mix the in-
gredients to produce an explosive of high power of
course the resultant powder was miserable stuff com-
pared to ordinary commercial gunpowder or blasting
powder but what it lacked in quality i could offset
by quantity and having done my best i decided to
test the result upon solid stone this was somewhat
difficult for there were no large masses of stone near
the blacks homes and i wished to make a thoroughly
practical and convincing test for upon the results our
freedom and probably our lives depended

  the best and most available spot where this could be
done was on the rocky mountain side and carrying a
fairly large supply of the best powder tom and i
started off after a short search we found a large
mass of rock practically identical with that of which
the tunnel door was composed and with a small deep
fissure running across one outjutting mass into this
crack we forced and rammed several pounds of powder
tamped it with sand and clay laid a fuse and touch-
ing fire to it beat a hasty retreat several moments
passed i began to fear my fuse had gone out or
that the powder had failed and was on the point of
stepping forward to investigate when there was a
terrific report and bits of broken rock rained about us
rushing forward we found a mass of stone weighing
several tons had been dislodged and cracked like
boys tom and i locked arms and danced and pranced
about our powder was a huge success there was
no doubt that we could force the tunnel door and
escape from the valley and we saw freedom near
at hand

  all we needed was enough powder to insure tearing

down the door at the first blast for if we merely
cracked or moved it slightly our own efforts might
defeat us a bad crack which would not permit us to
cscape might render it impossible to place a second
blast properly and might very probably form apertures
or openings through which the exploding gases could
cscape without exerting any force upon the rock itself
so satisfied that our powder was all that we required
we hurried home and made preparations to produce
enough of the explosive to shatter the stone portal to
fragments we worked with light hearts and with
greater enthusiasm than at any time since we had
entered this place at last we were on the road to
freedom and we laughed and joked and made plans for
our futures as though we were already quit of the
valley in a few days the place with its gigantic
insect inhabitants its terrifying creatures its strange
half-inscct-like savages and its ancient ruins of an
unknown white race would be merely memories of
the past we would have our black servitors and our
primitive weapons and garments to assure us it wa
not all a dream in a few weeks we would be far
beyond tupec and approaching the outskirts of civili-
zation and within six months we would be back in a
land of electricity radio motor cars and modernities
where our adventures would appear so unreal and fan-
tastic that they would seem even to ourselves the
figments of imagination

all went well our powder-making progressed
rapidly and no signs of the red raiders caused
us any uneasiness

  we transported our explosive to the tunnel entrance
and examined the massive door minutely in order to
locate the best spot in which to place our blast which
was to prove our open sesame it was a difficult mat-
ter to find such a spot the door was perfectly fitted
and not a crevice or crack showed into which we could
hope to ram enough powder to even shake the portal

  for a time i began to think that i was to be balked
at this late stage and i wondered how i could have
been so stupid as to have failed to investigate before
going to all my trouble and making all my plans then
i remembered that when we had passed through the
door there had been quite a high step from the floor
of the tunnel to the earth outside of course the lower
edge of the door must fit against this ledge cut in the
rock and if i could somehow manage to get some
powder between the door and this inside sill the ex-
plosion would probably force the door open even if it
did not crack or break it with this idea giving me
renewed hope tom and i set to work digging away the
earth about the lower edge of the massive stone we
worked feverishly as if our lives depended upon it and
in a fairly short time had scraped away enough of
the sand and earth to expose the living rock below the
tunnel mouth as i had hoped there was a fairly wide
crack between the door and the sill behird it a crevice
as wide as my thumb and by inserting sticks in this
and probing about i found that the crevice extended
upward for nearly a foot and narrowed until the door
and sill fitted tightly together at the upper limit of the
crack to push powder up into this opening was a
slow and difficult job for it kept dropping out as fast
as we put it in but i solved the problem at last by
wrapping the powder in packages of thin papery bark
and after each was in place puncturing the covering
it was in fact the same method that was used in load-
ing big cannon and by the end of the afternoon we
had stowed fully fifty pounds of powder between the
door and the solid rock behind it by the time this
was tamped and the fuse laid it was dark well

satisfied with our days labors and with every expecta-
tion of being out of the accursed valley before an-
other sun had set we started back towards the sav-
ages clearing half way there and at almost the
exact spot where the blacks had first attacked my
indians we were met by a knot of wildly excited
blacks led by our two special friends they were so
excited and appeared so terrified that i could not
make head or tail of what they said all i could
gather was that ants had come to the village think-
ing that the red ants raid was under way tom and
i dashed forward as rapidly as our weary muscles
would permit while about us and urging us on were
the gibbering blacks

  but as we came within sight of the place there was
neither sign nor sound of battle although i could see
crowds of the savages gathered upon the wall hurry-
ing forward and wondering what all the excitement
was about we clambered up the ladder even then
i could not understand what was the matter but
tom who was far more proficient than myself in in-
terpreting the so-callcd dialect of these creatures at
last grasped their meaning

  he do say the ants been come he exclaimed he
say a-plenty come this side an show himselfs an not
been make fight he say they over yander behin we
house they don been tha monstrous red ants chief
they been tha farmer specie an they desire to meet
with yo chief

  what i w idered had caused the agricultural ants
to come here why did they wish to see me how had
they made their wants understood by these savages
and why did they remain hidden over by our hut at
any rate it was a relief to find it was no murderous
slavers raid and feeling sure the agricultural ants
were on a peaceful mission i hurried down the lad-
der and across the clearing to our hut as i came
close to it a score of most fearful terrible-appearing
creatures suddenly appeared from where they had been
concealed so monstrous and dangerous did they look
that i uttered an involuntary cry and leaped back
expecting to be attacked and destroyed the next in-
stant no insects i had yet seen had been so formid-
able in appearance unquestionably they were ants
but they were little more than living gigantic ser-
rated jaws and powerful clawed legs their bodies
were slender attenuated and lithe their motions were
so rapid the eye could scarcely follow them and yet
somehow somewhere they bore a strange familiar re-
semblance to something else all this rushed through
my brain in the fraction of a second then among
the creatures appeared several agricultural ants and
instantly the solution of the mystery flashed upon me
the monsters were agricultural ants not the ordinary
hard-working peaceful creatures we had known but
highly specialized fighting units ants developed trans-
formed-heaven alone knows how-by some treatment
of the larvie until just as special treatment of a bee-
grub results in a queen the larvse instead of becom-
ing ordinary workers had become veritable warriors

  what amazing incredible super-intelligence the agri-
culturalists must possess to have done this here was
exhibited reasoning powers equal to those of human
beings they had suffered at the hands or rather at
the jaws of the red ants they had realized that to
successfully combat trained warriors they must also
have warriors and casting aside all the age-old habits
and traits of countless generations of their species
they had produced a race of super-fighters in a few
generations perhaps in one generation they had de-
veloped physical characters totally distinct from those
of the normal agriculturalists how i wished i had
the world of the giant ants



had these fellows with me on our attack upon the
red ants but it was too late to think of that now
tomorrow i would be out of the valley forever the
ants could fight it out and be the masters of their
own destinies and the blacks would have to work out
their own salvation but why i wondered had the
agricultural ants brought their newly evolved warriors
to me what was their idea did they wish me to
return to their colony or was it a threat

  i was not left long in doubt our two blacks pos-
sessed an uncanny faculty for understanding these
ants and now in their scarcely intelligible half-human
lingo they explained that the agriculturalists had come
to offer their services in repelling and destroying the
red ants they had driven off a foray of the slave
owners in a second attack made by the latter apd now
they had come to volunteer their services as allies
of the blacks no doubt if the reds again attacked
the savages these terrible fighters would prove most
valuable aids but i could not see that it was of any
interest to me i was through with them all and
within twenty-four hours i would be beyond reach of
reds or any others i tried to appear nonchalant to
make it understood that i was in no need of rein-
forcements but i did not care to make known my
plans for tomorrow

  and so here we are tom packing our few belong-
ings ready to take with us myself writing these last
few lines of the record i have kept for so many many
months-or is it years-and outside our hut the newly
created warriors herded if i may use the term by
their agricultural fellows for so specialized have these
fighters become that they cannot feed themselves but
must be fed by the others moreover they are prac-
tically devoid of antennae these organs having been
reduced to mere rudiments in order to give room
for their awful mandibles and as a result they have
to be moved and handled like so many automatons i
wonder why on earth they insist upon remaining here
the savages have not taken them into their village and
seem to be rather in fear of the creatures they act
for all the world as if they were keeping some sort
of a watch over tom and myself as if they suspected
we were planning to leave the valley and were ready
to prevent us from going heaven help us if that is
in their minds though why they should care whether
we left or not after evicting us from their colony
is beyond my comprehension anyway tomorrow will
settle the question by the end of another day we
will either be outside the valley or torn to pieces for
i am determined that no beings here shall interfere
in my plans as long as i am able to lift a hand to
prevent any interference

chapter xxiii

how futile are mans best laid plans another day
has passed since last i wrote how glibly i
stated that before another sun had set we would
be out of this valley how confidently i stated that vve
would be either free or torn to pieces yet we are still
here and as yet unharmed rapid and unexpected
have been the astounding events that have taken place
within these past twenty-four hours

  now i know only too well why the warriors of the
agricultural ants refused to move away why they came
here faithful fellows they have proved friends to
the last even though they did drive us from our home
among them would that i might have been able to
communicate with them to understand them fully

  i must hurry on a battle is impending but i
forget things so plain to me may be a puzzle a mys-
tery to everyone if anyone ever should read these notes

this morning-though it seems much longer-one of
the black aphis-herders came dashing in from the
groves terror upon his face even i grasped his mean-
ing the red ants were approaching the long ex-
pected raid was about to take place almost at the
same time several agricultural ants came rushing into
the clearing hurrying from one to another of their
fellows they whistled and touched antennae almost
instantly the crowd of warriors was upon the move
never have i seen better disciplined better drilled
troops as if with one accord they formed into columns
each led by the workers and wheeling deployed and
took up their stations about the clearing i was as-
tounded beyond doubt the agriculturalists had known
that a raid was being planned unquestionably they had
come to us to aid us in repelling the attack obviously
they had posted scouts to keep them informed of the
movements of the reds but while i appreciated their
acts their friendliness and their value yet they hin-
dered and hampered my own plans i had counted
upon my mines and these allies were now stationed
over the hidden explosives to set them off when the
reds were attacking would be to destroy a many
friends as enemies in vain i tried to make the
warriors move in vain i endeavored to explain but
they were mere fighting machines endowed with life
creatures understanding knowing only battle and the
manipulation of their huge jaws it was useless my
only hope was that when the reds attacked the agricul-
turalists would fall back that my new chelonean army
as i called it would slowly retreat before the reds and
take its final stand close to the wall upon the wall
they would be useless their sole weapons were their
jaws and to use these they must come to grips with
the enemy

  as far as we were concerned all was in readiness
i had no fear of the ultimate outcome our combined
forces our defences those terrible specially developed
warriors would destroy the power of the slave-holders
forever

  hours passed i had begun to think there had been
a false alarm when among the trees of the aphis-
orchards we saw the advancing host of red ants i
gasped there were thousands tens of thousands it
seemed they were everywhere they came from every
side

  and they showed no signs of making an immediate
attack i wonder if they are besieging us if they have
some devilish scheme of which we are ignorant they
first appeared three hours ago i have had all the
subterranean galleries destroyed so they cannot enter
by the tunnels opening in the aphis-orchard i have
stationed blacks below ground to destroy any red who
happens to dig his way through but i am beginning
to fear for the result of the battle if battle it is to
be i have talked it over with tom i have pointed
out that no matter what happens if one of us is killed
wounded or captured the other must make his way
to the tunnel blast the door open and escape for
the survivor to remain here alone would be unthink-
able i hope and pray that such an eventuality will
not arise but we must be prepared i have made
tom promise though with great difficulty that if i
fall he will take charge of my notebooks and leave
the valley and make his way to civilization or die in
the attempt then i will know that my story has one
chance in many thousands of reaching my fellow-men

the first skirmishes have taken place a shock-
column of red ants rushed our agricultural allies
near our hut but few returned from their foray
they were mowed down cut up as if they had charged

doubt that but we could
do much more than we
are doing i want you to
devise some plan to stop
the errors

dr billings eminent bi-
ologist and sociologist
looked curiously at the
speaker he had worked
for jerome smith presi-
dent of universal utili-
ties for several years
and had always found
him an interesting per-
sonality and his problems
vitally important after
a moments pause he
asked

how many stenogra-
phers do you employ mr

smith

ten thousand in our
new york offices as you
know we decided to cen-
tralize all of our offices
some years ago we need
ten thousand-but usually

 ttere is a story that no doubt will arouse
 j jl a good deal of controversy it probably
 will be denounced in many quarters while
 in others it will be praised to the skies

        we live in a machine age only effi-
     ciency and accomplishment is of any im-
     portance in our present scheme of life
     everything works along the stencil line
     nowadays we wear the same clothes of
     which several thousand are cut with the
     same die we wear the same sort of shoes
     all made by the same machines and all
     alike including the polish we eat the
     same sort of food coming out of the same
     cans by the million we read the same
     kind of literature printed by the thousand
     and the hundred-thousand

        the stamp of the machine is upon our
     bodies and upon our minds we all act
     alike and come pretty near thinking alike
     it seems to be quite the thing for all of
     tis to be as exactly alike as we possibly
     can be if we vary this formula ever so
     little we become conspicuous at once
     which is not always to our liking

        and when it comes to the great indus-
      trial interests the big employers natur-
      ally expect to have efficiency which appar-
      ently they can only get by having their
      workers all perform along certain me-
      chanical lines all must- work alike in
      certain endeavors and all must perform
      alike if results are to be had

       what is the logical end read dr
     kellers most absorbing story it will
     open your eyes it will probably thrill
     you or perhaps you will wax hot with
     indignation-all depending upon your
     temperament

        at any rate this is one of dr kellers
      best efforts so far

we have only about nine thousand and have to replace
them constantly we handle millions of letters a year
personal individual letters-our business life depends
upon the character of these letters-and we cannot
secure the right kind of stenographers

why not raise their pay

that has been tried the more pay the more
pleasure the more pleasure the more fatigue and the
greater number of errors

then educate them

  they refuse we have free night schools-one
 fifteenth of one per cent attend they wont even
 go when we pay them claim they want relaxation at
 night do you know what the average stenographer
 does with her twenty-four hours

   dr billings laughingly confessed his ignorance of
 their special habits

  we studied a thousand of them and made a com-
                         posite picture of their
                         daily life said jerome
                         smith answering his own
                         question they are high
                         school and business col-
                         lege graduates about
                         twenty years old they
                         stay in bed as long as
                         possible dress as fast as
                         they can bolt an insuf-
                         ficient breakfast and
                         spend about one hour in
                         the subway or elevated
                         going to the office from
                          a m to noon their
                         work is fairly correct
                         during the noon hour
                         they window-shop and eat
                         a poor lunch they would
                         rather spend their money
                         on silk stockings than
                         beefsteak from  to 
                         their work becomes more
                         careless as they become
                         more fatigued it takes
                         them an hour to return
                         to their home where they
                         eat the only hot meal of
                         the day at  their boy
                         friends come and take
                         them to a movie or dance
                         hall they usually retire
                         between  and  on

                         go to coney island sun-

                         friends have a ford
                         after an average of two
                         years and three months
                         of work they marry and

                         they cease to work but
                         from the day of their

marriage they become less and less efficient if it were
not for humanitarian reasons we would discharge every
woman as soon as she is married the capable clever
ones become private secretaries the beautiful ones
marry or go into private apartments the dull ones are
discharged and last year our turn-over was sixty-five
per cent we can hardly hire and train them fast
enough something has to be done i engaged you
with the understanding that you could solve such prob-
lems and i want you to get busy

   dr billings looked irritated as he replied

  you talked to me about this a year ago and i
gave you several models of a phono-stenic machine in-
vented in our laboratories as i recall it i advised
that you have five thousand of these machines made
and discharge ninety-nine per cent of your stenogra-
phers you never commented on my suggestion

  we gave it a trial we are always willing to try
anything at first it looked as though it might work
it really was a beautiful piece of machinery all our
men had to do was to talk into a receiver and the
sound was transmitted to the machine transformed
into mechanical activity and the letter was finished a
second after the dictation ended as i remember the
details the machine was entirely automatic had a
paper feeder and discharged the letter into one tray
and the carbon into another as a machine it was
perfect but it could not think consequently there were
many words that could not be used-for example to-
too-two-three different words three different mean-
ings but only one sound for the three another diffi-
culty was in the matter of pronunciation in adjusting
the machine you used an actor who is credited with
having a wonderful voice and speaking perfect eng-
lish unfortunately in our office we have men from
every part of the united states and many foreigners
who have had to learn english all of our men spoke
english but they all had a different accent and none
spoke as perfectly as the actor the machine typed
exactly what they spoke but the letters it produced
were certainly queer affairs i was sufficiently inter-
ested in the proposition to invite the actor to come
and dictate for us and the letters he produced were
perfect so long as he was careful in not using words
with two meanings

  you could have had the machines adjusted to suit
the different accents replied billings in a rather
irritated voice

  certainly i knew that then they would have
been one man machines if adjusted to a pennsyl-
vania dutchman it could not be used by an english
speaking spaniard the invention was simply not
practical what i demand is better service from more
efficient stenographers

  i do not see hew that can be obtained

  you had better see that is what i hired you for
and let you write your own salary i am a business
man and not a scientist all i know is that the
stenographer is a human machine she uses her hands
to work with the hands are connected with the
brain brain hands and typewriter produce letters-
i must have perfect letters it is your business to
produce them get busy when you have a plan
come and see me till then stay away from me be-
cause the presence of inefficiency irritates me

   the biologist lost no time in leaving the office while
jerome smith turned restlessly to his next task
having given this definite problem to dr billings he
promptly forgot it-for the time being he knew and
so did dr billings that unless the problem were satis-
factorily settled there would be a new biologist em-
ployed within a few months

tor the next month dr billings and his subordi-
 nates studied the race of stenographers he found
that practically every statement that jerome smith
had made about them was correct those who were
capable ceased to be mere stenographers and filled
offices of trust as private secretaries they ceased to
function as mere letter writers many married the
dull ones remained dull gaps in the ranks were
easily replaced by very ordinary material from busi-

ness colleges replacements were frequent and the
yearly turnover large the average office worker was
fairly capable but absolutely undependable most of
them had ambitions and day dreams but these did
not extend in the direction of writing a perfect letter
a few grew old in the service but most changed oc-
cupations before twenty-five socially they were
middle class poorly housed inadequately fed but rather
elegantly dressed

  dr billings worked and studied and yet failed to
see how the work could be more efficiently performed
his inability fretted him his pride was hurt and
in addition he was faced with the loss of his position
in case he failed to satisfy his employer worry
nervous strain and overwork produced insomnia fi-
nally tired nature demanded sleep and in this slumber
came a dream from the subconscious

  from a high balcony he overlooked in his dream an
office where several hundred stenographers were work-
ing at noiseless machines he could tell from the con-
tinued intensity of their labor and the satisfied ex-
pression on their faces that they were happy in their
work someone put an opera glass in his hands and
he focussed on one individaul after another he was
at once impressed with the intelligent faces and the
enormous capable hands-large strong hands long
and wonderful fingers racing surely over the key-
boards in his dream he watched them hour after
hour as they wrote letters-and he knew without
reading that they were writing perfect letters at a
terrific speed

  waking with a start and shivering he turned on
the light unable to forget those hands he placed his
own between the light and the calcined wall making
huge extremities appear as shadows with twisting men-
acing fingers then he went to sleep and the next
morning after shaving more carefully than usual he
called to see jerome smith and in spite of his
efforts it was the scientist who was excited this time
and not the capitalist

  without preamble or delay he blurted out the mar-
velous solution which had come to him after his
dream

  we will secure better stenographers by breeding
theml

  the astonished leader of finance could only stammer
w-w-what

  breed them repeated the scientist when man
wanted to develop the carrier pigeon for speed the
trotting horse for racing the pointer dog for hunting
and the cow for increased milk production he bred
them burbank bred a spineless cactus-we will breed
errorless stenographers

  you must be insane doctor

  not at all but i cannot blame you for thinking so
the students of developmental neurology headed by
frederick tilney and dr huntington organized the
galton society of america they have for years studied
the growth of the brain and they have shown that the
development of certain areas in the cerebral cortex is
directly controlled by the use made of the hand they
believe that there are certain undeveloped areas in the
brain especially in the frontal lobes and that as the
use of the hand increases these lobes will correspond-
ingly be developed to greater usefulness

  you spoke of human machines you said that the
perfect stenographer would have wonderful hands and
an acute brain that made me think stenography
and typewriting are highly specialized uses of the
hand controlled by certain brain centers the more
expert the hand the more highly developed will be
the brain the finer the cerebral growth the more won-
stenographers hands



derful will the hand be in its accuracy if we can
develop new sections of the cortex deepen the grooves
between the convolutions we can produce stenographers
who are more nearly errorless if we can breed them
for accuracy and speed we will have creatures as
highly specialized as the racing horse or the bird-dog
these stenographers will remain faithful to their work
because they will be so bred that they will never want
to do anything else even if they are able

  they will be perfect human machines capable of
doing one kind of mento-physical work and unable and
unwilling to do anything else by a process of selec-
tive breeding we will increase their speed and decrease
their errors that is the solution to your question

  jerome smith remained silent for many seconds
even though he was accustomed to tremendous prob-
lems this was almost too much for his intelleot to
grasp finally he asked almost in a whisper

  but how can you breed them

  that is simply a matter of detail technique some-
thing for your experimental station to work out i
give you a fact-breed them the rest can be left
to your subordinates yet i will give you the main
outline of my plan you appreciate the fact that most
of your stenographers are women when they marry
they mate with artisans salesmen street car con-
ductors occasionally with a business man but never
with another stenographer i understand you have
about ten thousand stenographers in your employ
gradually replace five thousand of the dull ones with
five thousand male typists the best you can find in
the entire world build a suburban center with com-
fortable homes-and offer to every male stenographer
who marries one of your office a home rent free and
complete maintenance do not let them marry unless
they both pass certain examinations for speed and per-
fection of copy give an extra bonus for every child
born have a community hospital day nursery kinder-
garten and school thus the mothers can soon return
to their office but the children will remain under your
control from their youth they will be taught stenog-
raphy and typewriting they will be made to live
with their machines as soon as they are efficient
enough put them to work in your offices make them
independent of their families from the first control
their twenty-four hours activity always they will be
stenographers-encourage them to marry stenographers
-and breed stenographers i believe that in ten gen-
erations you will be able to produce office workers that
will turn out perfect letters and be glad to do it

  nonsense shouted jerome smith springing from
his chair and walking excitedly up and down the room
ten generations would take two hundred years you
and i would be worms food long before even a start
was made

  under ordinary circumstances your criticism would
be warranted replied the biologist soothingly but
wait till you hear the rest of my plan in this special
colony we will have complete control of the food sup-
ply the food will be part of the salary we will
furnish three meals a day-the nourishment of the
babies will lie completely under the control of our
dieticians with these foods we will incorporate cer-
tain chemicals especially some obtained from the duct-
less glands thus the growth of the babies will be
accelerated they will mature more rapidly than the
average children the first generation will be ready
to marry at sixteen whereas the next generation will
be working at ten and marrying at fourteen eventu-
ally these specially bred stenographers will be doing
full duty at six and marrying at eight i do not be-
lieve we should force nature beyond that point in

fifty years sufficient results will be obtained to make
the experiment profitable i thoroughly believe that
five generations of such intensive breeding will yield
a race of stenographers who are able to produce the
finest of work and absolutely incapable of doing any-
thing else

jerome smith shivered the idea for some rea-
son was distasteful to him-and he said so

  i admit that the average stenographer is rather
poor material but they are human beings dr bill-
ings i can hardly reconcile myself to your idea

  the scientist however was unable to brook opposi-
tion but it is for their own good mr smith if
you were just selfish in the matter it would be dif-
ferent you said yourself that their life was unhappy
and unsatisfactory you insisted that they had no
future that was worth while-that few of them could
advance your idea was that they were poorly fed
badly housed and that their sexual life was inadequate
and unsatisfactory if you follow my plan you can
make them comfortable and happy once they are
bred to be capable stenographers they will not want
to do anything else they will be able to attain the
greatest satisfaction in their work they will only be
happy when taking dictation and transposing it into
type their motto will be efficiency plus content-
ment no doubt the time will come when we can
have a new generation born every ten years and
every child will be born with the inherited desire to
become a perfect stenographer if it works you can
follow out the same plan with your other workers but
thatis for the future to decide you will be able
to secure a great advantage over your competitors in
fifty years universal utilities will control the market
of the world-in two hundred years you can have a
specially bred line of workers i can see that finally
your organization could so breed workers that they
would be willing to work for no other reason than
the pleasure they had in it or because they were forced
to by the inherited urge that is the picture of the
future we need only make a start

  but wont they object can theybe controlled
certainly at first they wont realize what is hap-
pening-all they will know is that they are being well
housed excellently fed and beautifully clothed the
changes in the generations will come gradually when
the realization comes it will be too late to resist
they will have only one ambition then-one primitive
urge-to write perfect letters then they will only
want to sleep and eat and work all initiative will be
gone except the desire to take dictation and write
perfect letters they will be machines but human-
they will know the difference between to and too and
two can they be controlled why mr smith the
only strike you will ever have will come when you are
unable to supply them with work

  and jerome smith president of universal utilities
was finally convinced he was big enough to see that
he was only a small part of an organization that might
some day control the destinies of the world that
would hold in its grip the commerce of a universe a
small man might plan for a generation but a big man
would arrange a programme that would carry on in
every detail a thousand years after his death alex-
ander might make macedonia famous for a generation
but william the conqueror would found an empire
that would grow greater for a thousand years

  jerome smith looked into the future he saw an
organization an office force that functioned perfectly
a sales organization of five thousand trained men dic-
tating to ten thousand errorless stenographers he


amazing stories quarterly

visioned a constant flow of perfect beautiful letters
streaming in every direction from the central offices
to all parts of the world bringing in a volume of busi-
ness that was the envy and despair of his rapidly
weakening competitors but he saw more than this
in his factories he saw specially bred workers working
rapidly with skilled hands perfectly co-ordinated with
highly developed brains he wondered if the same
principle could be applied to other departments of uni-
versal utilities-if salesmen could be bred to trail the
uninterested customer with the unflagging interest of a
blood-hound whether even the higher executive offices
could not be filled with specially bred managers

   realizing that time meant nothing if only in the
end the results were satisfactory he gradually thought
in terms of universal utilities rather than in units of
isolated humanity everything must be sacrificed for
the organization the individuals were of no value
in fact he considered them simply as pawns on his
chess board things hardly human living in human
shape but somehow not worthy of sympathetic regard
the more he thought about the breeding of capable
stenographers the more he felt that the end result
justified the means employed he even reached the
point where in his grandiose pride he felt that like
a true creator he was changing something useless into
a thing of beautiful utility without further delay he
gave the necessary orders the final arrangements
were made easily

   universal utilities manufactured everything neces-
sary for the building and equipment of the suburban
homes the arrangement of a new salary scale and
system of bonuses was also easy the hard part was
to find five thousand competent unmarried male stenog-
raphers to take the place of the five thousand incapable
females who were to be discharged yet even this was
finally done-social centers were organized-every op-
portunity was given the ten thousand young people to
spend their spare time with each other thus encourag-
ing matrimonial possibilities in every way as a re-
sult six thousand of the stenographers were married
within a year and another two thousand at the end of
eighteen months those who refused to marry were
discharged and their places filled by younger and more
socially inclined typists as fast as they married
each couple was given a comfortable home in one of
the apartments in the new community centers the
generous system of bonuses made the birth of a child
an unqualified pleasure rather than a foreboding of
disastrous poverty

   such a programme could not be kept a secret in
fact universal utilities used it as one of their most
striking advertisements-not only to bring their firm
into world renowned fame as unselfish philanthropists
but also to attract to their employ the most skillful
office workers from all over the business world for
several sundays the leading newspapers ran long ad-
vertisements in their magazine section one was
headed

       skillful

         tenographers

          eek

         uburban homes

     universal utilities promotes health and happiness
   among its office force by encouraging its employees
   in every way to lead normal lives marriage among
   the stenographic force is encouraged and every in-
   ducement given the young people to become parents
   stenographic suburban centers are thoroughly
   equipped with hospitals day nurseries and kinder-
   gartens for the first time in the history of the busi-
   ness world the lesser employees of a great corpora-
   tion arc being given an opportunity to live the kind
   of lives that the creator intended all men and women
   to live

  naturally children were born in these centers in
fact many more children were born than were either
expected or necessary for the continuation of the ex-
periment which both dr billings and jerome smith
were watching with the greatest interest when at the
end of five years the scientist reported to the corpor-
ation president that there were now over ten thousand
specially bred stenographic children he anticipated his
employers question by ending his report with the state-
ment 

  under the present conditions of life in the sten-
ographic centers there is no doubt but that there will
be many more children born and raised to maturity
than there will be needed to carry on the experiment
at the end of eighteen years this is really a neces-
sary part of the programme especially in the early
generations of breeding there will be many children
who will not be true to type later we hope by a
series of carefully conducted measurements to eliminate
the unfit at a very early age even now we believe
that much can be told by the shape of the hands and
the length of the fingers in this generation however
a certain number of the children will resemble their
grandparents more than their parents we feel that
we shall have to have thirty thousand children born as
soon as possible in this generation in order to be sure
of ten thousand adults who are perfect enough to carry
on the experiment realizing the necessity of having
as many children born as closely together as possible
we are now giving an extra bonus to stenographers who
are twins in this first generation we will begin at
once to teach stenography and typewriting in the pri-
mary grades and we believe that by the time the chil-
dren reach the age of ten we shall be able to pick
out one-third of them as giving promise of special
speed and accuracy these will be trained in separate
schools while the duller ones will gradually be isolated
and in the course of years be amalgamated with the
ordinary city workers i might add also that the
special diet is working favorably all the children are
on the average two years in advance of the ordinary
child in size weight and intelligence

nnwenty years passed and eighty per cent of the
- old stenographers were retired on a liberal pen-
sion being replaced in the offices of universal utilities
by the first generation of specially bred and highly
educated office workers one out of every four of the
children in the first generation had been able to pass
the necessary tests these had been sent to special
schools where the entire time was spent on spelling
punctuation grammar stenography and typewriting
at the age of fourteen they were working in experi-
mental offices while at fifteen they were being given
positions in the main offices of universal utilities as
a rule they were fine specimens of manhood and
womanhood having been given the best of care in
every way since their birth irrespective of any
ability they possessed none in this generation were
given positions unless they manifested genuine love
for the work records were carefully kept and every
precaution taken for the continuation of the work
after the death of jerome smith and dr billings
while the actual details of the proposed reform were
only known to a few of the higher officials still it was
generally understood that universal utilities was sold
to the idea that the business success of the future
lay in perfect letters written by errorless stenog-
raphers

  in such a company more like a machine than an
organization of human individuals events moved with
the regularity of clockwork jerome smith at seventy-
stenographers hands



five was still watching the daily curve of errors which
was placed routinely on his desk with grim satisfac-
tion he saw the line indicating the volume of business
and the daily number of letters rise steadily towards
a peak that could not even be estimated while at the
same time the number of errors per stenographer per
day was steadily falling this record was carefully
watched and the results published a definite scale of
advance in salary was the reward for weeks and months
of perfection some stenographers were able to go an
entire month without spoiling their record the per-
fect stenographer had not yet been born but a won-
derful advance was already apparent the gain in
speed was as remarkable as the improvement in ac-
curacy special inventions had to be devised in order
to allow the typewriters to respond rapidly enough to
the flying fingers it was even found advisable to de-
vise an automatic paper feeder so that the typist would
not have to stop to insert a fresh sheet of paper a
touch on the button put in a piece of correspondence
paper while pressure on a different button inserted an
envelope

  it might seem that with the increasing speed and
greater accuracy the correspondence of universal utili-
ties could be carried on with five thousand office work-
ers instead of ten thousand the truth was that the
ten thousand stenographers were doing ten times as
much work as the same number had accomplished
twenty years before the business had correspondingly
increased the carefully kept charts showed that the
experiment was paying for itself in every way when
the third generation was born there was a smaller
per cent to be discarded-the result of the intensive
breeding was beginning to show as an old man aged
in body but still active in mind dr billings in his
annual report to his employer jerome smith made
the interesting statement

  in the fifth generation we are finding less than
fifteen per cent of the babies who are not running
true to type

two hundred years passed universal utilities now
governed by hiram smith descendent of jerome
smith ruled the financial world during that two
hundred years the basic principle that better letters
produce better business had never been forgotten
there were new ways of reaching the ultimate con-
sumer the radio constantly endeavored to furnish new
contacts salesmen in monoplanes reached every small
town but still the great bulk of the business all over
the world had to be carried on by correspondence

  and that correspondence carried on by universal
utilities was now approaching a state of wonderful
perfection errors might be made in dictation ad-
dresses might be wrong but a mistake made by the
ten thousand stenographers was now so unusual that
the heads of departments were always inclined to
blame the mistake on the other portions of the official
force year after year the stenographers approached
the perfection of beautifully adjusted machinery with
this difference they could think reason evaluate
differentiate to their finely co-ordinated muscles were
added harmonious and specially trained minds and
most important of all was the pleasure that they took
in their work they were content only when working
they were happy only in the office nothing but severe
illness might keep them from their machines their
homes were simply miniature offices where they talked
over the work of the day helped their children write
letters and vied with each other in speed contests

  the increased love for their work influenced their
social contacts those who were recognized as being

ninety-nine per cent efficient hesitated in seeking the
society of the eighty-five per centers an unmarried girl
who was ninety-seven per cent perfect in accuracy and
speed was willing to keep company only with a young
man who was as brilliant as she was-she certainly
would not consider matrimony with one who was
rated at ninety per cent their one track minds ceased
to consider personal wealth beauty fame or sexual
allure as reasons for marriage all they could think
talk and dream of was their work and the possibility
of some one some time working a whole year without
making an error

  sundays and holidays were observed but were always
followed by days of increased production as the ten
thousand workers carefully rested avoided every form
of fatigue during their hours off duty and in every
way conserved their energy for the hours of produc-
tion following the holidays

  one afternoon hiram smith was entertaining a young
lady in his office in fact it was his daughter recently
returned from one of the most fashionable colleges in
massachusetts hiram smith was disturbed even
though he tried to conceal his annoyance his only
daughter in fact his one and only child had been
dismissed from college on account of complete failure
to make the necessary grades the father had tried
to keep her in college but even his great wealth and
unusual power had been insufficient to bribe the presi-
dent of the college who had simply saicpthat the
young lady was unwilling to study and could not stay

  there was nothing in the general appearance of the
late collegian to indicate mental deficiency i fact
she looked unusually alert and mentally active as she
sat on the other side of the central table

  well grunted her father savagely smoking a
cigar

  well answered the daughter is this the way
you welcome your only-only

  you have disgraced me hiram smith replied
only my position has kept it out of the afternoon
papers all of new york knows about it my daugh-
ter mirabella smith great great etc granddaughter
of jerome smith thrown out of college because she
could not pass the necessary examinations

that is wrong dad protested the girl i could
have passed them but i did not want to-i told you
that i did not want to go to college i simply abominate
mathematics and languages i did not try to study
what are you going to do marry at eighteen
no i want to be a stenographer

  hiram smith nearly swallowed his cigar

  a stenographer he whispered weakly

  yes your hearing is all right is it not you
heard me the first time didnt you i have been prac-
ticing on a machine for over a year and can do some
shorthand i want a job in universal utilities

  it was then that the great man laughed-so heartily
that his daughter began to blush- in anger

  i dont see anything funny she protested

  finally the man controlled his laughter

  have you ever seen one of our central offices he
asked

  no of course not you never let me know any-
thing about your business and you should because
some day i am going to run it

  he looked at her in astonishment but this time he
did not laugh he simply stood up as he asked her to
come with him

  walking through long halls they finally went by
elevator to the tenth floor of the building which cared
for much of the clerical activities of universal utilities
they entered a large room where in glass enclosed


amazing stories quarterly

 sound proof individual offices five hundred men were
 apparently talking into telephone receivers though not
 a sound could be heard as they walked slowly around
 the room the father explained the system to the
 daughter

   in order to handle our tremendous volume of mail
it is necessary to employ ten thousand specially trained
clerks who do nothing except dictate answers to the
hundreds of thousands of letters we receive daily
years ago these letters were all dictated and taken down
in shorthand now each clerk is connected by telephone
to a stenographer and as fast as a letter is dictated
it is written some of our men talk at the rate of
one hundred and fifty to two hundred words a minute
but we have never found one who could talk faster
than one of our average stenographers could vwrite
our business is a peculiar one and we take great pride
in our letters they have to be absolutely individualis-
tic for over one hundred years we have tried to
avoid the semblance of anything like a form letter
when john jones of honolulu receives a letter from us
it is a highly personal one from universal utilities to
john jones he likes it our millions of customers
like it we are able to establish an individual contact
and our customers stay with us we have the world
divided into ten thousand districts and the mail from
each district is answered by a man we have familiarized
with that particular district a man who is keenly alive
to the special needs of the people who seem to be
his neighbors he understands their habits thoughts
and reactions of course we write letters in many
languages but eighty-five per cent of all our corre-
spondence is conducted in english we try to answer
every letter within two days of the time it is received
of course some days are very heavy-mondays and
the days following holidays for instance-but we never
fall very far behind each one of these ten thousand
letter clerks dictates eight hours a day there is a
fifteen minute rest period after every forty-five minutes
of work and an hour off at noon-a fairly long day

at ira bella smith looked with interest around
-va the room there were fifty offices on each side
and above them in four rows were four hundred more
in each cell a man was dictating to an invisible
stenographer

  we will now go into the next room said her
father here you will find five hundred glass enclosed
rooms in a similar arrangement but in each of these
rooms is a stenographer connected in every instance
with a letter clerk they each have one of our noise-
less self-feeding electrical machines which automati-
cally discharge the letters with envelopes attached
into wide tubes these letters are then carried by
endless conveyors back to the dictator who takes the
fifteen minute rest period to sign the letters he has
dictated in the previous forty-five minutes all he has
to do is to sign them as they come to him and an-
other machine blots them folds and seals the envelope
during the fifteen minutes he is thus occupied his
special stenographer sits motionless eyes closed re-
laxing every muscle ready to spring into intense
activity when the dictating again begins of course
we have some stenographers who still take dictation
in shorthand but only from the higher officers who
have not learned to dictate at the high speed neces-
sary to make the most of this highly trained mechan-
ical ability

   mirabella looked at her father as he closed this
sentence with the words mechanical ability as
though understanding her questioning glance he went

on rather rapidly seemingly defending himself from
an implied accusation

   you know my dear that is what these stenogra-
phers are-simply human machines we take very good
care of them-feed house and clothe them nicely and
provide for their every need they are really very
expensive to produce but well worth all they cost
you mean they are slaves

   not at all-go near that glass window and look at
them you will see they are human beings

   mirabella stifled a swelling groan-like scream
mingled with nausea as she looked into the cell of
human machines live beings-god-like with the most
lovely most perfect long-tapering fingers she had ever
seen--hands the sight of whose beauty summoned
worship but ere the sacred rite was completed those
emaciated faces bulging foreheads staring eyes hide-
ous expressions met the view she was sick her
ancestors had done it-martyred humanity for com-
mercial greed

   but grasping a plan like a flash she covered her
feelings and enthusiastically answered

   oh father its all so wonderful-this working plan
 of universal utilities

   yes it is a great plan they have bodies very
similar to ours only there is a slight bulging to the
forehead and the hands are larger and the fingers
longer than in the average individual their shoulders
are broader and their arms longer and more muscular
our medical department says there is a shrinking of
the body and lower limbs but only slight you see
they take practically no exercise except what they
have at their machines we send them back to their
community homes in special passenger planes once
home they relax they go to bed early and have
practically no amusements or sports all they know
or want to know is how to write a perfect letter we
have ten thousand human machines like that almost
evenly divided between the sexes-for two hundred
years we have bred stenographers-we have raised
them on an intensive scale specially fed and educated
them i will tell you something that few realize be-
cause we have thoroughly bribed and controlled all
sources of information these human machines ma-
ture at the age of nine years marry at ten and pro-
duce baby stenographers at eleven years of age in
other words we have bred stenographers on a scien-
tific scale as race horses or blooded cattle your great-
number-some-odd grandfather started the plan-we are
reaping the benefit before his time they had a great
deal of trouble with their office force-now we have no
trouble whatever they are simply wonderful pieces
of living machinery now you understand why you
cannot be one of our stenographers you are a won-
derfully beautiful young woman these living beings
you see in these glass cells are simply machines-
living capable of some emotions able to reproduce
other generations of machines but absolutely incapable
of doing any other kind of work they are human
beings so highly differentiated in their heredity and
development that they are no longer to be considered
on the same level with the rest of humanity they
have gained efficiency in one direction at the loss of
initiative in every other plane of human endeavor

   the girl frowned

   and universal utilities did this to these people and
 their ancestors without their consent she asked

   certainly it would never have been done if we
had waited for their approval they were mentally
our inferiors-they made no attempt to progress by
their own efforts we took them and made them
worth while to themselves and to universal utilities-
stenographers hands



  i do not want to be that kind of a stenographer
said the girl hastily i want to be one of the old-
fashioned kind i have read about the gossiping gum-
chewing error-making soda-water-drinking flirtatious
kind of a girl who went into the business world for
the thrill she received i want to be a stenographer
but not like those poor things i think i will go back
to college and graduate

her father really meant to check up on her move-
ments but he was so busy with a new side
line which universal utilities had absorbed that
he had absolutely io time to think about his family
this new project was nothing less than assuming a
directing control of all the protestant churches of the
world by welding them into one gigantic merger the
plan had long been dreamed of but no one fovce had
been powerful enough to bring it about now with
universal utilities to finance it the scheme was accom-
plished and there were no longer baptists methodists
or presbyterians but over four hundred and twenty
sects united to form the university protestant church
in every small town the little churches were torn down
to be replaced by one beautiful chapel or cathedral
hiram smith attended personally to many of the de-
tails in the meantime he neglected his daughter

she never returned to college instead she stayed
in new york as the stenographer of a young physi-
cian he was poor and his patients were poorer but
he was rather rich in having mirabella in his office
in fact they had decided on such a future while he
was yet a medical student and she a student in a
college they had met at a dance in a moment of
confidence she explained to him that she wanted to
be a stenographer that interested him and he re-
turned her confidence by telling how he had bitterly
disappointed his parents by becoming a doctor instead
at that time he did not know that she was the only
child of hiram smith owner and president of uni-
versal utilities-she was just a rich girl who wanted
to be a stenographer while he was only a poor boy
who did not want to be one

  mirabella smith had gone directly from her fathers
office to the residence of the young physician she
lost no time in announcing her decision to him

  i have come to be your stenographer carleton she
said in a very serious voice more than that some
day i hope i have just had my talk with father
and he has told me some horrible things and shown
me even worse sights for over two hundred years
the company which i will some day own has been
deliberately breeding stenographers-as cattle or white
rats-breeding them to write perfect letters so uni-
versal utilities can become great and crush out its
competitors now after two hundred years the poor
things are just like machines i saw them writing
with the speed of a tornado for forty-five minutes
and then resting quietly for fifteen minutes more till
the sound of the dictating voice again spurred them
into an almost super-human frenzy i will own that
company some day and with it will come the owner-
ship of ten thousand human machines and their pitiful
little children think of the babies-i understand that
when they are old enough to talk they are put to
work on miniature machines they mature at nine
marry at ten they have no childhood no playtime
why even a hunting dog plays when it is a puppy i
wonder what they are like-socially can they talk-
as we do

  the doctor looked at her lovingly as he answered
i can tell you a lot about it mirabella i never wanted
to tell you before because i did not want to hurt your

feelings my father and mother were stenographers
working for universal utilities just as you say those
people are working today i was their first and only
child they had great hopes for me-i was a well
formed baby-they longed for me to grow to be the
perfect stenographer but when the time came for
my earliest training something went wrong i
screamed at the sight of the toy typewriter that they
put in front of me i never did learn to use it-
would not even touch it to my parents surprise i
only grew half as fast both mentally and physically
as the other children of my age at ten when the
other children were working and thinking of marry-
ing i had not yet entered my adolescence horrified
degraded by the thought that they had produced a
monstrosity my parents had me placed in an aver-
age new york city home where they contributed liber-
ally to my support though the family that cared for
me learned to love me and wanted to adopt me legally
as i grew older my mother lived in the hope that i
would change she would come to see me once a year 
carrying a portable underwood with her with tears
in her eyes she would beg me to try to write i tried
to humor her i even promised her that i would
take lessons but it was impossible finally she lost
hope and told me that she realized that i was right
in planning to lead my life in my own way

  last year i made an investigation an ancestor of
mine was a great new york surgeon his daughter
ran away became a stenographer and worked for uni-
versal utilities scientists tell me that i am a throw-
back-a case of atavism so you see i know what
universal utilities has been doing i am one of their
experimental babies i was born in one of their
colonies educated in one of their community schools

i will tell you one thing more-for the last year i
have been part time physician in one of their smaller
colonies it is a poorly paying position but it helps
me to meet expenses while practicing in this colony

i found out something-i will tell you what it is
when i am more sure of it just now it is so horrible
that i hesitate to believe that it is true

  carleton continued to practice medicine and mira-
bella wrote his letters now and then she sold one of
her diamond rings

  meantime life was not going smoothly for the
thousands of people working in the gigantic office build-
ing owned and operated by universal utilities at
first the truth was covered up but finally it could not
be concealed from hiram smith he sat silently white
sweating trembling as the chairman of the board of
directors told him the horrible fact

  the stenographic force no longer can be trusted
the number of errors they are making is inexplain-
able and unheard of mistakes in spelling punctua-
tion addresses use of capital letters-in fact they are
making every possible mistake the survey shows
that there is no change in the colony life-the habits
of these workers are unchanged they are still inter-
ested in their work-they are doing their best but for
some reason they are making mistakes by the million
and what is worst of all-they do not seem to be
conscious of the fact that they are making them when
their attention is called to the inaccuracy of their
work they seem unable to comprehend the gravity of
the situation as a result of the multitude of their
errors the entire machinery of the universal utilities
has become completely demoralized over eighty per
cent of the letters have to be rewritten the corre-
spondence is three weeks behind hand the letter clerks
are becoming exhausted and neurasthenic the sales

professor banning returns

y boy you and i are going to produce the
greatest invention ever made was the
extravagant announcement with which pro-
fessor banning greeted me when he
i stepped ashore from the dunard liner at
boston had this boast been made by anyone else i
should have dismissed it as an absurd emission of
superheated atmosphere but coming as it did from
a man of deep learning who was always meticulously
conservative in all his ut-
terances it commanded
breathless and expectant
attention

  i had journeyed to bos-
ton and had met the
steamship luxnnia in
response to a radiogram
which professor banning
had sent me while he was
in mid-atlantic
on the pier he ex-
plained the reason why
i asked you to meet me
here is that i want you to
come with me to parke
university my old friend
professor stoddard has a
model and a number of
diagrams of a contrivance
that id like you to study

  we were in morcester
for five days professor
banning and i spent most
of our available time in
the laboratories and li-
braries of parke univers-
ity both of us took co-
pious notes but at the time
i had but a hazy idea as
to their ultimate purpose

  it was not until we were on the west bound pullman
that professor banning gave me the slightest inkling of
his plans as the train pulled out of the station he
cried rapid transit thats the big thing today my
boy all other developments such as diplomacy legis-
lation literature art and science fade into insignifi-
cance compared with the importance of getting quickly
from one place to another

  rapid transit is the worlds greatest humanizing
influence it wipes out boundaries of states and na-
tions it breaks down racial and religious prejudices
it clears up misunderstandings and cements friend-
ships among all the people on earth it is the only
means through which the millennium of universal peace
can be attained

  that is why ive decided to side track our work
in four dimensional surgery-for a while at least-
and devote all my attention to developing a means
of transportation that will be safer more economical
and vastly more speedy than any mode of conveyance
known today

  with your help my young friend i expect to build
a machine that will enable us to circumnavigate the
globe in less than a day

  i	almost gasped thats ridiculous but caught
myself with the words half way out of my mouth
nothing that professor banning sponsored could pos-
sibly be ridiculous no matter how preposterous it
might sound if professor banning made a serious
statement i could always rely on the soundness of his
premises so what i did say was that certainly
would be a wonderful thing around the world in
twenty-four hours seems almost impossible but if you

say it can be done-thats
all there is to it will you
give me the details of
your plan

  youll learn all about it
in due time hasnt any
possible solution of the
problem occurred to you
i havent had much
time to think about it yet
but from the studies we
made at parke university
id judge that you intend
to make use of the rocket
idea

  thats a question we
may possibly incorporate
the rocket principle in our
machine but if we do it
will be merely in the na-
ture of a safety device
in case-but im getting
ahead of my story

  ive gone into the
rocket idea pretty thor-
oughly while i was
abroad i spent some time
in vienna conferring with
doctor franz knoff i
also visited the camp at
lake constance where a
group of scientists are preparing to send a registration
rocket into space in the direction of the moon

  in addition i had an interesting interview with
max vallier the german astronomer and with ivan
vederof who has invented a combination of airplane
and rocket by means of which he and vallier and
three others hope to fly to the moon

  my private opinion is that the idea of placing
human beings inside a huge projectile and shooting
them through space far enough to escape from the
gravitational pull of the earth is not practicable to
leap in a single instant from a position of rest to
a speed greater than eight miles per second would
hurl the bodies of the passengers against the rear wall
of the rocket with such force that they would be
instantly crushed to death

  vallier and vederof propose to get up their initial
velocity by means of an airplane but this would alter
the situation but slightly the effect on the passengers
in that case would be the same as if they were in an
indestructible steel railway coach crawling along at

 e have published many four dimensional
 stories both in the quarterly and the month-
 ly but we unhesitatingly state that the
 present story is without exception the best
 one we have ever published along these lines

    this is the sort of story you will read
 and re-read during the months to come and
 you will never get quite enough of it and
 what is more this is a story that will make
 you think

   every high school and every physics
 teacher and professor will wish his class to
 read this story due to the most excellent
 astronomical data contained in it this
 story not only contains excellent astron-
 omy but excellent physics as well

    the theme is as good or even better than
 jules vernes famous classic around the
 world in eighty days indeed it parallels
 that story in cleverness and in the same
 sort of unusjial clever ending

    in addition to all of this it is an unusu-
 ally good interptanetarian story and we
 know that it will be joyfully received by
 every scientifiction fan


    bgt tbq blgffcal fluxphso of all came one day when i was sitting on the toil of the almost completed machine attaching the rods and wlrej
                          conncctlng the four dimensional rudders with the controls which were to operate it




amazing stories quarterly

the rate of four miles an hour which was in a rear
end collision with an express train traveling at the rate
of sixty miles per hour they would likewise be an-
nihilated unless by some means they could acquire the
extra velocity gradually

  possibly there may be some way to produce a tre-
mendous acceleration in speed so gradually that the
human beings inside the device would not be injured
but it doesnt sound feasible to me

  you may have heard perhaps of the plan pro-
posed by two french engineers messieurs mas and
drouet who think the trick can be accomplished by
means of centrifugal force their idea is to build
an enormous wheel about six miles in diameter with
its axle resting on two lofty mountain peaks this
gigantic wheel would dip down into a deep excavation

  they think that by attaching a projectile-like car to
the circumference of this wheel and by increasing its
speed of rotation a little at a time the car when re-
leased at the proper moment could be hurled into
space at a terrific pace without injury to its occupants

  while it may not be absolutely impossible this
plan is too fantastic and too impractical to merit
serious consideration even if it were possible to
overcome the many difficulties such as preventing a
wheel as big as this from flying into a million pieces
when the speed reached a certain point the cost of
such a contrivance would be so colossal as to be posi-
tively prohibitive

  an article published some time ago in science and
invention suggested a means of getting up speed which
while expensive enough could be tried at a much
smaller cost than the six mile wheel of mas and
drouet this is a tube or tunnel curved in a form
that is almost a circle but with both ends straight-
ened out even with an arrangement of this descrip-
tion i doubt if sufficient acceleration could be de-
veloped to enable the rocket principle to be used suc-
cessfully

  you see the real problem is to get started and
stopped so gradually that the passengers will not be
injured by sudden acceleration or retardation of
speed have you thought of any possible way of doing
this

  ive thought about it but thats as far as ive
gone i had to admit

utvo you know what the three greatest enemies of

  - speed are 

  friction is one of them i should say

  thats correct and what are the other two

  would you include inertia

  inertia may be either an enemy or a friend of
speed an enemy when the object is at rest-a friend
after it has been set in motion i wonder if you
are not thinking of gravitation when you travel on
the ground as for instance in an automobile every
time you pass over an elevation or even the smallest
bump in the road you have to use up energy to lift
the weight of the machine and its contents against
gravity and this steals just so much from the force
that is driving the car forward there is a tre-
mendous waste from this source even on the smoothest
levelest roads and it doesnt take much of a grade to
convince you that gravity is a tremendous dissipator
of power

  a corresponding loss of energy is caused by the
effect of gravitation on a flying machine a large
amount of the energy transmitted to the propeller of
an airplane is constantly being squandered just to keep
the plane in the air against the downward pull of
the earths attraction

  now can you tell me what is the third enemy of
speed

  im afraid i cant

  then ill tell you its the low efficiency of present
day machinery

  according to my analysis of the matter the first
steps toward increasing substantially the speed of
human conveyances is to subjugate these three enemies
friction gravitation and wasted power

  to the work of cutting down the resistance of the
air aeronautical engineers have already devoted a great
deal of study and research the fleetness of the mod-
ern airplane as compared with its earlier prototypes
is partly due to the application of scientific principles
in designing the conformation of wings fuselage struts
and other parts which are exposed to the air but
you being a mechanical engineer are of course fa-
miliar with these matters

  i know a little bit about it i qualified but aero-
nautics is an extensive and specialized branch of
mechanics and i have to admit that i know but a
smattering guess ill have to brush up on the sub-
ject

  while i was abroad he continued i had an op-
portunity to acquire some odds and ends of informa-
tion on air travel but my knowledge of the subject
is still quite superficial as i understand it however
the shape given to struts airfoils and similar parts
of an airplane is planned in such a way as to mini-
mize the formation of vacuum pockets and vortex
currents which tend to hold the plane back you prob-
ably know that when a cylindrical rod with a circular
cross section is moved rapidly through the air a par-
tial vacuum is created behind it which materially in-
hibits further increases in speed except at a high
expenditure of additional energy by altering the
shape so that the cross section is an elongated oval
the strut is enabled to pass through the air without
forming vacuum pockets and resistance is correspond-
ingly reduced

  with all the work which has been done along these
lines it is singular that so little attention has been
devoted to the equally important task of reducing the
friction of the air against the exposed surfaces of
the plane

  even the dumbest layman or an immature child knows
that to run a piece of mechanism at a high rate of
speed without lubrication is impossible yet nobody
seems to have thought of using the same principle to
reduce the external friction of the air against the
surface of a moving object

  i have worked out a method of lubricating an
airplane on the outside if it works as well in practice
as it seems to figure out in theory it ought to add
at least fifty per cent to the maximum speed of any
airship or other means of transportation

  still another method of getting away from the
resistance of the air is to use a machine capable of
reaching such great altitudes that it can travel through
the highly rarefied strata of the atmosphere

  this is one of the means by which a german in-
ventor hopes to attain a speed of  miles per hour
i suppose youve heard of arno boerner

  i believe i have didnt he invent the three cham-
ber motor cylinder

  yes and let me tell you that boerners motor is
going to revolutionize the gasoline engine design i
visited boerner at dresden while i was in europe and
he was good enough to supply me with blueprints and
even a duplicate set of patterns for making his motor
they are now on this train-in the baggage car
ahead i also have boerners written consent to make
four dimensional transit



use of his motor in the machine which we are going
to construct

  boerner estimates that a speed of from  to 
miles per hour can be achieved by using an extra
large propeller made possible by the superior driving
power of his engine i have gone over the calculations
on which boerner bases his expectations and have
checked them with exacting care if anything i be-
lieve he has underestimated the capability of his motor
his figures are based on using gasoline as fuel but
im going to try out a new synthetic fuel its called
larsene in honor of the inventor ole larsen who
i believe is a countryman of yours

  already it is being manufactured in commercial
quantities i have ordered several thousand gallons
it was loaded on a fast steamship before i left europe
and is now on its way to san diego i havealso ar-
ranged for adequate supplies of larsene to be stored
for our use in other parts of the world

  freight included a gallon of larsene costs about
seven cents its latent energy is at least double that
of an equal quantity of gasoline and it weighs about
thirty per cent less this will help build up additional
speed in two ways first by delivering more power to
the pistons and second by materially lightening the
weight of fuel needed for a given cruising radius

  with the aid of this efficient fuel and several
other revolutionary improvements i confidently be-
lieve that we can at least double the speed that
boerner predicted in fact we ought to be able to
travel at least  miles per hour

 but you also said something about overcoming
gravitation i interposed you havent told me about
that yet

  theres where you come in my boy to get away
from the restrictions of gravitation i propose to
project our machine into hyper space and this you
are to make possible by constructing a four dimensional
rudder

chapter ii

the four dimensional rudder

under ordinary circumstances i would have
been flabbergasted by such a statement but
professor banning pronounced it so glibly with
such a matter-of-fact thats-all-there-is-to-it air that
it did not occur to me how preposterous his plans
might sound to some people

  i pressed him for further particulars but he merely
answered lets wait until we get to san diego ill
have to explain all the details to bryan and i may
as well kill two bulls with one bullet by giving it to
both of you together

  that was my first inkling as to our ultimate destina-
tion i discovered that professor banning had already
made telegraphic arrangements with milton bryan
the famous manufacturer of airplanes to make use
of his mechanical staff and plant at san diego cal-
ifornia

  as soon as we had deposited our baggage at the
hotel in san diego we immediately went to the bryan
factors making himself known to bryan professor
banning at once launched into an explanation of his
ideas for building a super airplane he exhibited
the blueprints of boerners motor supplementing them
with verbal explanations of which the following is
a condensation

  briefly the boerner device converts a single cylin-
der into three cylinders each with an inlet exhaust
and spark plug by this means a greater proportion

of the latent energy contained in the gas is utilized
and the amount of power is enormously increased

  he also explained his idea for reducing air friction
by lubricating the external surfaces of the plane

  the progress of man has depended to a certain
extent on his ability to overcome or rather reduce fric-
tion in the conquest of friction the first battle was
won by the inventer of the sledge men discovered that by
placing a pair of smooth runners under the carcass
of a large animal or other heavy weight it could be
dragged along the ground much more easily

  but the greatest genius was the man who devised
the wheel and thereby originated the cardinal idea
of replacing sliding friction with rolling friction
greasing the axle of the wheel to make it run smoother
was the next step then there was a long stretch of
time before some one thought of utilizing the rolling
principle for reducing the friction between the wheel
and its axle and ball bearings and roller bearings
were invented

  that was many years ago and since then very-
little progress has been made in combatting friction
every engineer knows that a terrific amount of energy
is squandered in overcoming friction between the air
and the exterior surfaces of automobiles airplanes
ships and other conveyances yet except for the slight
improvements in the shape of wings struts and other
exposed parts of airplanes practically nothing has
been done to reduce this force-consuming condition

  i have a plan that will accomplish this reduction
in two ways first by forming an oily film over the
entire surface of the flying machine and second by
using the well established principle of substituting
rolling friction for sliding friction

  my system is to cover the exterior of the airship
with a special kind of oil which has previously been
whipped into millions of tiny bubbles i have already
conducted successful experiments with a small inex-
pensive device by means of which i can convert a
quart of oil into over a thousand gallons of small
bubbles-enough to lubricate the outside of an air-
plane for at least seven hundred miles these bubbles
are forced to the surface through small openings
distributed at various points on the machine to be
lubricated the force of the air currents will dis-
tribute these bubbles evenly over the exposed portions

  each tiny bubble is like a well oiled ball bearing
which doesnt slide but rolls over the cushions of
air what do you think about that idea mr bryan
rather startling and revolutionary but i see no
reason why it wouldnt work replied the manu-
facturer

  youll probably think that my other innovation is
still more astounding the professor resumed i
propose to overcome or at least materially reduce
the force of gravitation by equipping our airplane
with a four dimensional rudder by this means
we ought to be able to steer the machine in and out
of hyper space at will i presume you are familiar
with four dimensional theory are you not

  im afraid this four dimensional business is a
little beyond me bryan apologized but perhaps
if you feed it to me slow and easy i may be able
to digest it

cnce you grasp the fundamental idea its really
v- quite simple the professor encouraged him
four dimensional mathematics has the same relation
to solid geometry that solid geometry bears to plane
geometry in plane geometry all the figures have only
two dimensions length and width while solid geometry
merely adds another dimension which we call height

  if you move a square having a side one inch long
for a distance of one inch at right angles to both its
length and width you generate a three dimensional
solid or cube all you have to do is move the cube
for a distance of one inch at right angles to each of
its three dimensions and you have a hyper-cube or
tesseract we know exactly what such a figure looks
like and can tell you precisely how many lines sur-
faces and corners it has

  getting at it from another point of view we can
generate a four dimensional object by rotation ro-
tate a line about its central point and you form a
circle rotate this circle about one of its diameters
and you have a sphere if you go one step further
and rotate the sphere about a plane passing through
its center you have a hyper-sphere	v

  by moving through four dimensional space somfe
remarkable feats can be accomplished if a man turns
a somersault through the fourth dimension he would
vanish for a moment and when he became visible
again everything about him would be reversed in posi-
tion his heart would be on his right side and his
appendix on his left side to his friends he would
look exactly like his image in a mirror-with every-
thing bilaterally inverted

  ordinary walls and other confining boundaries mean
little or nothing to the denizen of hyper-space he can
step out of a locked prison cell without even touching
the walls ceiling floor door or windows he can eat
an egg without cracking or puncturing the shell and
can turn a football inside out without tearing or
injuring it

  possibly you have heard about the hyper-forceps
wnich our young friend here made with my co-opera-
tion it has actually been used for removing foreign
substances from the stomach of a goat without cutting
its skin with it we have also removed gall stones
and other objects from the abdomens of human beings
without the slightest shock or injury and withuot mak-
ing even the smallest incision

  i have heard of that bryan asserted but to tell
the truth i thought it was just a lot of bunk from
what ive heard about this speculation concerning
the fourth dimension ive always thought it was pure-
ly theoretical-something like the arguments the old
philosophers used to have over how many million
angels could stand at the same time on the point of
a needle of course i dont doubt you for a second
but youll have to pardon me for being a bit skeptical
about the practical use of the fourth dimension is
there any other real proof that such a thing as the
fourth dimension actually exists

  to which professor banning responded theres
fully as much proof of the existence of the fourth
dimension as there was of the law of gravitation at
the time when the historic apple bumped isaac new-
ton on the head proof of a new theory is largely
a matter of consistency it usually originates in the
form of a hypothesis which in the mind of at least
one man seems to offer a logical explanation of phe-
nomena otherwise inexplicable so long as this hypoth-
esises reasonable and consistent and so long as it
is not contradicted by any single conflicting fact or
circumstance it may be considered as an acceptable
theory but the instant some incongruity or incon-
sistency is found between the hypothesis and a scien-
tifically recorded fact the theory immediately becomes
untenable

  so far i have never been able to find any incon-
sistencies in the theory of four dimensional mathe-
matics nor have i ever heard of any fact or circum-
stance that proves the existence of a fourth dimension

impossible on the contrary the theory is surpris-
ingly consistent and is the only means i know whereby
certain mystifying phenomena can be explained

  take electricity for instance after many years
of exhaustive research and practical application by
some of the greatest scientists in the world we dont
even know what electricity is or how it is transmitted
yet if you are willing to grant the possibility of a
fourth dimension some of the most mystifying of
electrical phenomena can easily be explained i cant
take time now to give you all the details but you can
take my word for it that several prominent physicists
have seriously advanced the theory that certain elec-
trical manifestations are due to vibrations or other
motions in the fourth dimension

  another scientific mystery that can very readily
be explained by four dimensional mathematics is the
behaviour of polarized light there are two varieties
of tartaric acid absolutely identical in their proper-
ties except that one turns the plane of polarization
to the right and the other to the left the crystals
of one variety are shaped exactly as the others would
be if they were inverted through the fourth dimen-
sion and thats the only way such an inversion could
take place

  a similar example is that of dextrose and levelose
both of these carbohydrates are found in honey and
they are similar in their properties except that
dextrose as its name indicates turns the plane of
polarization to the right and levelose to the left if
we can conceive of atoms moving in four dimensions
this phenomenon is easily accounted for

  there is also a species of snail of which there
are two varieties-one with the spiral twisted in clock-
wise rotation from the center outward and the other
in counter clock-wise rotation-just as it would be if
turned through a fourth dimension when the juices
of these snails are examined by polarized light the
fluids from one variety turn the plane of polarized light
to the left and those of the other variety to the right

  to take a more familiar example lets consider the
right and left symmetry of a solid object such as an
apple we are accustomed to explaining the sym-
metry of a leaf-which though it is a three dimen-
sional solid may be considered as almost two dimen-
sional because one dimensional is so small-by folding
it through the third dimension so that the two halves
will fit one on top of the other if we could fold an
apple through the fourth dimension we could make
the two halves fit over one another just as the parts
of a folded leaf do

  my own private opinion is that every object in the
universe has some extension in the fourth dimension
compared with the other three dimensions this fourth
dimension is extremely small-but is still appreciable
in size and is variable in different kinds of substance

  this may be likened to the thickness of a sheet of
tissue paper or of the finest gold leaf  inch
which is so small a quantity that it is almost equal
to zero for purposes of comparison we may con-
sider that a sheet of gold leaf is but two dimensions
yet we know that if we pile enough square sheets of
gold leaf one on top of the other we can build up a
solid cube with a thickness equal to its length or
width in the same manner by joining together three
dimensional solid cubes we can build up an extension
in the fourth dimension until we have constructed a
hyper cube or tesseract by combining spheres we
can construct a hyper-cylinder in a similar manner
we can construct a variety of other four dimensional
objects such as the hecatonicosahedron which has one
four dimensional transit



hundred sides and the hexacosahedron which has six
hundred sides

  on two separate occasions our young friend here
has actually succeeded in constructing four dimensional
objects-first when he built the four dimensional
roller press for william james sidelburg and second
when he constructed the hyper-forceps for me

  with my aid he is going to attempt to make an
airplane rudder having appreciable extension into the
fourth dimension with such a rudder as part of the
equipment of a flying machine i believe it will be
possible to pass in and out of hyper-space at will and
thus produce a variation or even a complete nullification
of the force of gravity acting on the machine do you
comprehend the idea

  im afraid i dont understand completely bryan
admitted though im beginning to get the drift
would you mind explaining this thing to me a little
more fully

  perhaps an analogy will help clarify the matter
the professor suggested let us imagine a perfectly
flat airplane having only two dimensions flying over
an earth which is a flat circular disk instead of a
spheroid since every portion of this flatland air-
ship must be in the same plane the propeller would
have to move like the paddle-wheel of a mississippi
steamship something like this

  he picked up a pencil and made a sketch somewhat
like the one reproduced here

  such an airplane could move only in one plane
hopping off it would fly away from the circumference
of the disk and in landing would return to the circle
but it couldnt travel in any direction that would take
it outside that one plane

  now suppose we attach to this two-dimensional
airplane a rudder having three dimensions and capable
of being extended at various angles away from the
original plane with the help of the momentum al-
ready created by its motion in the single plane the
airship could be lifted away from the earth-disk as-
suming that this disk has a gravitational pull tending
to draw every article in its own plane towards its
center of mass it is clear that as soon as the object
is lifted out of the plane the attraction acting at an
angle and over a greater distance will be reduced con-
siderably if the object is moved far enough away
from the plane of the earth-disk the gravitational at-
traction may be diminished to the point where it is
practically equal to zero

  in a similar manner by equipping a three dimen-
sional airplane with a four dimensional rudder i ex-
pect to reduce materially the force of the earths attrac-
tion for the machine or even to remove it completely
from the gravitational pull in this way i hope to
attain a much greater speed than is possible with a
machine that has to waste a tremendous amount of
power in overcoming gravity does that make it any
clearer

  a little bit the way you explain it this four
dimensional business sounds as simple as a b c

but im afraid if i tried to work these ideas out
myself id go nutty so i guess you two had better
look after the four dimensional rudder and ill see
that the rest of the airplane is made according to
specifications

  thats all we expect you to do and you may de-
pend on it that the four dimensional features will be
taken care of properly

  fine said bryan and now if youll pardon me
id like to ask an important question you understand
that while i am intensely interested in your inven-
tion i am also a business man all these things
you have enumerated are going to cost a pile of money
has that part of the proposition been satisfactorily
attended to

  you need not worry about finances im glad you
brought that up though because its only natural that
you should expect a teacher of mathematics to be as
impecunious as a mouse in a scotch church if i had
depended exclusively on my salary i should indeed be
indigent however it so happens that when i waa
still a young man i wrote a series of text books on
the various branches of mathematics ive been rather
fortunate and my modest works have been endorsed
by school boards and colleges all over the united
states and have enjoyed a steady substantial sale

  practically all my income from this source has been
saved until a few months ago i havent had to dip
into it at all about half of it went into conservative
bonds with the other half ive taken a few flyers
in real estate som of them proved remunerative to
a very gratifying degree so you may rest assured
that whatever money is needed will be forthcoming
just let me know how much cash you will require from
time to time and ill see to it that you are paid in
advance will that be satisfactory

  you just bet it will bryan almost shouted

chapter iii

building the super airplane

since the work which i had been delegated to
perform required meticulous care and intense
concentration a corner of bryans factory was
partitioned off for my exclusive use professor ban-
ning spent about half of his working hours with me
preparing the complicated formulas diagrams and
models without which i was powerless to carry out
the mechanical details of the four dimensional rudder
the remainder of his time he devoted to the work of
supervising the building of the airplane itself

  constructing a machine of this sort which departed
radically from airplane designs as commonly used
naturally took a lot of time it was several months
before the task was completed

  in outward appearance the banning invention
looked very much like a standard type of all-metal
airplane however there were a number of details
of its internal make-up which were entirely unique
the boerner motor with its triple unit cylinders was
perhaps the most notable of these outstanding features
the entire fuselage was constructed with double walls
-like a thermos bottle the hollow space between the
walls was filled with a special insulating material the
nature of which the professor did not reveal until
later

  there were several heavy plate glass windows also
double they were arranged in such a way as to give
the passengers an unobstructed view in every direc-
tion-up down forward rear right and left the
walls were penetrated by ten tubes one terminating
at the center of the machines nose one at the tip


amazing stories quarterly

of the tail one at the extremity of each wing and
six others distributed at various angles along the
sides these tubes protruded for short distances be-
yond the exterior of the plane and were flexible by
means of an ingenious mechanism they could be turned
to point in any desired direction all the tubes were
connected with an apparatus which produced a steady
spray of burning larsene through any one tube or
combination of tubes

  professor banning explained that the rocket device
did not constitute a major feature of the machine
they were incorporated in the plans as a possible
auxiliary source of power and also as a safety device
to be used in case of unexpected contingencies as
you shall learn later it was eventually the means of
saving us from a horrible fate-which no one-with
the possible exception of professor banning had an-
ticipated

  the other unusual feature which gave the banning
airplane an odd and distinctive appearance was the
four dimensional rudder this was fastened to a rod
extending about eighteen inches from the extreme
tip of the tail it is rather difficult for me to describe
this peculiar device without using the terminology of
hyper-space which would be unintelligible except to a
student of higher mathematics perhaps you can get
a faint idea of its conformation if i compare it to
to one of those collapsible tissue paper decorations that
are used at christmas time some are shaped like bells
others like spherical balls when purchased they are
usually flat and may be opened out to form the decora-
tive ornament

  the four dimensional rudder was somewhat similar
in form to one of these familiar articles when fully
extended it was like a sphere made out of a large
number of small sections by means of a delicately
adjusted control in the cabin the parts of the rudder
could be pressed together or spread apart

  this was the device by means of which we hoped
to steer the machine in and out of hyper-space and
thus regulate the amount of gravitational force on
the plane at any given time

chapter iv
the arrival of colonel berghlin

my association with banning had constantly been
pregnant with unexpected eventualities but the
biggest surprise of all came one day when i
was sitting astride the tail of the almost completed
machine attaching the rods and wires connecting the
four dimensional rudder with the controls which were
to operate it

  i could hardly believe my eyes when i saw the slim
young man who accompanied professor banning as he
entered the airdrome

  of course you know who this is was bannings
informal way of presenting him

  who wouldnt know him-a man whose likeness is
probably familiar to more people in all parts of the
world than anyone who ever lived-colonel charles
berghlin 

  i nearly fell off my perch when i recognized him
but i had sense enough to take the hand he reached
up to me and to stammer of course everybody
knows colonel berghlin

  im sure you will be glad to learn that colonel
berghlin has consented to be the pilot of our ma-
chine banning announced

no news could have been more welcome to me
truth to tell the question as to who was to handle

the controls of our wonder plane on its trial flight had
given me considerable concern for some time the
most carefully constructed creation on earth would be
foredoomed to failure unless it was properly manned
as soon as i learned that berghlin was to be the
nurse of our mechanical baby my mind was com-
pletely set at rest

  while our machine was basically an airplane and
included all the fundamental features of the standard
bryan type of flyer there were enough radical dif-
ferences and additions to make it necessary for our
prospective aviator to spend several days in studying
the unique portions of its mechanism

  when the time came for professor banning to ex-
plain the four dimensional rudder to him berghlin
merely threw up his hands

  excuse me he said but id rather not meddle
with something i dont understand as far as oper-
ating the regular controls of the airplane and navi-
gating in the ordinary way are concerned i can handle
the whole business but when it comes to working a
rudder that is going to steer us into the fourth dimen-
sion im afraid ill want help from either or both
of you

  professor banning looked straight at me and said
its up to you then my boy

  me go along on the first trip i gasped i should
say not i nothing doing

  i hate to give the impression that i was afraid to
go it wasnt so much lack of courage as it was an
innate common sense caution that prompted me to
refuse so emphatically ever since i was twelve years
old i have been compelled to rely largely on my own
efforts the hard bumps i have received have taught
me to look after number one and to follow the well
known aphorism discretion is the better part of
valor

  but between the two of them they talked me into
it of course

  it was professor banning who hammered home the
clinching argument when he said did you ever stop
to think boys that when this task is accomplished it
will mean a great deal more than the enormous speed-
ing up of the worlds transportation which we expect
to achieve in addition it will place two glorious
feathers in the cap of youth it will set up two bril-
liant examples to act as beacon lights for the guidance
of all the young men and women of our land

  berghlin has already accomplished unbelievable
wonders in turning the minds of thousands of young
people away from jazz and petting and the mad pur-
suit of exciting pleasures and in directing these fine
youthful minds toward serious thinking and useful
attainments this splendid work is certain to be multi-
plied many many times after you two young men-
the one with his mechanical skill and the other with
his grit and his skill as a pilot-have succeeded in ac-
complishing a feat that will go down into history
as the dawn of a new era

  im afraid youre spreading it on a little thick i
told him and im sure i dont belong in the class
with colonel berghlin but if you and he both think
i ought to go along on the trial trip i suppose ill
have to i can operate the four dimensional rudder
 k but how will i know which way to steer when
we get to rambling through hyper-space navigation
is greek to me and i dont know the difference between
pi and phi it looks to me like well need you too
professor

  our pilot promptly agreed i think so too pro-
fessor banning i dont know of anyone else on earth
that is as well qualified as you are to navigate the
four dimensional transit



machine through the fourth dimension youve simply-
got to go along too

  much to my surprise professor banning was as
tickled as a kid who has been invited to accompany
his dad on a fishing trip

  ill be mighty happy to be with you boys he re-
joined to tell the truth i was afraid that you
wouldnt want an old codger like me along i know
berghlin usually likes to fly alone but if he thinks
we can help-lord love him-well give him every
ounce of support he needs

  whereupon the three of us grabbed each others
hands as if we were about to play ring around the
rosie but there was nothing but the most serious
thoughts in our minds as we silently and solemnly
pledged ourselves to unified loyal effort toward the
accomplishment of our great purpose	

   professor banning broke the silence i just thought
of a name for our baby how do you like this name-
the spirit of youth

  i assented and berghlin cried great and dont
forget for an jnstant professor that of the four that
make up we this time you are by far the youngest

chapter v

the trial flight

we had tried to keep our plans a close secret
but berghlin carried with him an ever present
brilliance that could not be hidden under a
bushel it wasnt long before the reporters ferreted
him out and insisted on getting an account of his
activities

  he merely told them that we were working on a
new type of improved airplane by means of which we
expected to surpass all previous records for speed

  came at last the day of days the last nut had
been screwed into place the last coat of lacquer had
been blown on every piece of mechanism had been
timed up with the most exacting care the tanks had
been filled with larsene and the sprit of youth was
ready for her maiden flight

  we started in the early hours of an april morning
just as the first faint heralds of the coming dawn
began to thrust their wan fingers into the murky sky
behind the eastern hills the exact time of our hop-
off we had successfully kept under cover and only
bryan and two of his most trusted assistants were
there to see us off

  no eagle has ever taken wing more gracefully
than did the spirit of youth as with her oversized
propeller beating the air at a furious speed she shot
down the runway like an arrow from a bow it seemed
as if she were off the ground almost the same instant
that her restraining bonds were released within a
few seconds san diego and the pacific had vanished
out of sight

  for the first hundred miles or so we were content
to run the machine as an ordinary airplane without
bringing into play either the external lubricating sys-
tem or the four dimensional rudder we climbed rap-
idly to an altitude of approximately twenty-five thou-
sand feet where our extra large propeller was able
to develop a substantially accelerated speed in the
rarefied atmosphere

  we found it necessary to start our compressor
which drew air from outside and condensed it so that
the atmospheric pressure inside the cabin was auto-
matically maintained at what would correspond to
normal barometer pressure a thermometer specially
designed for recording the temperature outside the
machine registered thirty-four degrees below zero but

we were kept quite comfortable-partly through the
exceptional insulating properties of our walls and
partly through the aid of a small electric heater oper-
ated from storage batteries

  our super speedometer-which had been invented
by professor banning for the particular purpose of
measuring extremely high velocities-indicated the
astounding speed of eight hundred and forty-one miles
per hour this remember was accomplished without
making use of the two revolutionary features on which
we depended more than anything else for extra ac-
celeration

  when our chronometer showed that we had been
in the air for about twenty minutes professor ban-
ning announced that we ought to be somewhere in the
vicinity of phoenix arizona to verify this berghlin
turned the nose of the plane downward at a steep
angle and we dropped to an altitude of about fifteen
hundred feet we were just in time to catch a fleet-
ing glimpse of roosevelt dam and to see the buildings
of phoenix fading into the vague outlines behind us

  up to this time we had been flying almost due
east we now veered to the northeast and again
climbed to the twenty-five thousand foot level

  then for the first time professor banning turned
on the external lubricating device there was an un-
mistakable quickening it was like coasting down a
steep grade with a car in low gear and then suddenly
throwing out the clutch a glance at our speedometer
revealed that we were traveling at the amazing rate
of nine hundred and seventy-two miles per hour

  but while our initial trial of the external lubri-
cating system proved that it was a glorious success
it also brought out a small fault which might have
had serious consequences no sooner had the fine
jets of oil bubbles been released outside the airplane
than every one of our windows became clouded with
oil so that it was impossible to see through them

  we were reasonably safe in flying blindly so long
as we kept at this high altitude but the possibility
of something unexpected happening-made even more
likely by our tremendous speed-prompted professor
banning to shut off the external lubrication within
a few moments the film obscuring the windows had
completely cleared

  professor banning then announced that we were
ready to try out the four dimensional rudder you
may well imagine what the coming out of our debutant
device meant to professor banning and me we could
well appreciate the feelings of a composer who has
spent years of labor and has poured his very soul into
a symphony and then waits with thumping heart to
hear how the critics receive his creation

  following professor bannings orders i took my
place at the delicately calibrated wheel which con-
trolled the four dimensional rudder

  take it easy he shouted in my ear turn it
just a fraction of a degree and lets see what happens

  i followed directions there was no result except
my disappointment

  give it a bit more ordered banning

   still no effect was noticeable

  this time move it about five degrees

  i did so then something did happen the plane
gave a sudden lurch and i felt that sinking helpless
feeling that i once experienced when a small car i was
driving skidded on a wet pavement and spun around
through a semi-circle

  for a second or two the spirit of youth slid side-
wise through the air but berghlin with masterful
skill got it under control and headed back to the
course we had been following
                                    imk

instead of a wide strctch of earth which from an airplane ordinarily looks cither flat or elso concave uko the inside
of a saucer the earth beneath us was a well defined ball


four dimensional transit



we all kept our eyes fixed on the speedometer it
registered eight hundred and thirty-nine miles
per hour-exactly the same speed as we had been
holding when the four dimensional rudder was first
put into play then to our surprise and dismay the
needle indicating our speed began to slip backward
until it finally steadied at eight hundred and fifteen
miles per hour

  what do you know about that i yelled instead
of speeding us up the fool thing makes us go
slower all that work for nothing ding bust it
dont be so sure that your efforts have been
wasted banning tried to reassure me im not a bit
surprised myself in fact its just what i expected
just what you expected then why in the world

  dont you get the point cant you understand
that it makes a lot of difference whether we are mov-
ing from west to east or from east to west just
now we are traveling in the same direction as the
earth as long as we are tied to the earth by
gravitation our movements with respect to any
point on its surface are the same as if the earth
were standing still but as soon as we cut off some
of the gravitational force our plane becomes a sep-
arate body competing in speed with the earth itself
the ground just beneath us is moving forward at the
rate of approximately one thousand miles per hour
and since our speed is only about eight hundred and
forty miles per hour it is but natural that we should
lag behind a bit

  then what good is the four dimensional rudder i
asked anxiously

  havent you figured it out yet when we move
in the opposite direction conditions are reversed then
we will be traveling from east to west and the earth
will be spinning in the opposite direction-which will
have the effect of increasing our velocity by that
amount besides the extra speed we will gain by sav-
ing the power otherwise needed to keep us in the
air against gravitation im getting tirec of yelling
ill write the rest of my explanation

   he picked up a pad and pencil and rapidly wrote the
following

  imagine yourself on an enormous steamship as-
sume that this hypothetical craft is one hundred miles
long and is capable of developing a speed of one hun-
dred miles per hour you are in an airplane which
can travel at the rate of one hundred miles per hour
while taxying and at exactly the same rate while in
the air if your plane taxies along the deck of the
boat it will take just one hour to travel from stem to
stern the time required to make this trip will be
precisely the same whether the ship is stationary or
is moving ahead at top speed

  but suppose you hop off into the air while the
ship is steaming ahead at the rate of one hundred
miles per hour a moment after the take-off the
initial speed of your plane would be two hundred
miles per hour one hundred of which would be de-
veloped by the airplane motor and one hundred by
the momentum borrowed from the forward motion of
the ship

  the speed created by the motor would continue at
the rate of one hundred miles per hour but the extra
momentum due to the speed of the ship would grad-
ually decrease in this case it would take consider-
ably longer to fly from stern to stem than to taxi the
same distance and if the extra momentum happens
to become exhausted before the airplane has finished
the trip the airplane would never be able to reach the
prow but would remain directly above the same point

on the ships deck since it would be flying at exactly
the same speed as the ship is traveling

  he tore a sheet off the pad and handed it to me
while i was reading it he wrote the following

  this accounts for our decrease in speed after we
detached ourselves partially from the gravitational at-
traction of the earth while our motor was pushing
us ahead at the rate of eight hundred and forty miles
per hour we were also being carried along with the
atmosphere of the earth at an additional velocity of
approximately one thousand miles per hour as long
as we remained completely within the gravitational in-
fluence of the earth we continued to acquire this extra
speed but the instant the four dimensional rudder
placed us in a position where we were influenced by
only a portion of the earths gravitational field we
began to lose some of the momentum given us by the
earths rotation

  when we start traveling from east to west it will
be a different story to return to the analogy of the
airplane on the giant ship it will be like flying from
stem to stern instead of from stern to stem

  if the plane taxies from stem to stern it will
take it exactly the same amount of time as to make
the trip in the opposite direction regardless of how
fast or how slow the ship may be moving but when
the airplane rises into the air and flies from stem to
stern at  miles per hour while the ship is travel-
ing ahead at the same speed the velocity of the plane
with respect to any point on the ship will be the
sum of its own speed plus the speed of the ship-
or  miles per hour in that case it would cover
the  miles between the stem and the stern in half
the time or  minutes

  i nodded to show that i understood this explanation

ccohall i point the four dimensional rudder in
the other direction before we lose any more
momentum i shouted

  professor banning signified assent i carefully
turned the control until the indicator pointed to zero
nothing happened except that our velocity continued
to diminish banning waited for me-to do the thing
which to him was apparently quite obvious-then he
yelled

  i thought you said you were going to steer in
the opposite direction youll never get back with
the rudder in a neutral position

  that sure made me feel dumb rather sheepishly i
adjusted the rudder so that it was turned about five
degrees in the opposite direction for a few seconds
nothing happened then there was another sickening
skidding jolt and our machine began to spin in a
plane parallel to the surface of the earth the peculiar
movement reminded me of a plate which a vaudeville
juggler sends spinning through the air in such a
way that it comes back to his hand

  once again the masterful skill of our pilot saved us
before the airplane got completely out of control

  immediately we began to pick up speed until we
had settled down to a gait of approximately eight
hundred and fifty miles per hour while flying at an
altitude of over twenty thousand feet this velocity
was reduced by nearly one hundred miles per hour
when following professor bannings instructions we
dropped to the four thousand foot level

  within a few minutes we had shot completely over
and beyond a large city as quickly as an express train
dashes through a tank settlement

  that was denver berghlin shouted

  might as well turn here and head back to san
diego professor banning ordered


amazing stories quarterly

  berghlin brought the plane around in a wide circle
and a few seconds later we were over denver again
banning then yelled these instructions

  i want to try a little experiment lets just circle
over the city for a while fly low enough so we can
see the details of the buildings thats fine then
he commanded me now for the four dimensional rud-
der give her just enough to steer her to the edge of
hyper-space

  with the plane still circling about the city i care-
fully manipulated the control this time berghlin was
ready for the skidding spin and in a jiffy had the
airship under perfect control then a most prepos-
terous series of phenomena burst on our consciousness

  during our previous trial of the four dimensional
rudder we had been flying over uninhabited territory
and at an altitude so great that the earth was nearly
out of sight for that reason we had noticed nothing
especially unusual about the appearance of visible
objects but in flying over the metropolitan city we
had plenty of things to look at and an excellent op-
portunity to study four dimensional perspective

  the insides of all buildings were visible to us they
looked like doll houses that are open at the tops or
fronts so that all the furniture and other objects in-
side the rooms are plainly visible the most peculiar
thing was that the roofs and the nearest walls did not
look transparent or totally absent as they should logi-
cally have been in order to expose the interiors to
our gaze on the contrary they seemed to be as solid
and substantial as the rest of the buildings

  another amazing thing was that we seemed to be
able to view the objects beneath us from all direc-
tions at once for instance i caught a fleeting glimpse
of a red-faced corpulent human biped dressed in
his bvds and manipulating his body into ridiculous
postures i swear that at one and the same time i
could see the top of his head the soles of his feet his
right and left sides his chest and his back

  without intending to peep we found ourselves wit-
nessing some intimate and funny scenes as we whizzed
by hotels and apartment houses

 im afraid we are committing a reprehensible
solecism by spying on the privacy of our fellow hu-
mans in this way professor banning yelled so lets
be on our way

  as soon as we were headed westward it became in-
stantly apparent that the four dimensional rudder had
more than fulfilled our expectations although we
were just on the border line of hyper-space and were
only partially outside the gravitational field of the
earth the effect of having the globe spinning in the
opposite direction beneath us became apparent

  we were also anxious to try out the external lubri-
cating system so i rigged up a crude device by
means of which we could from time to time wipe off
a clear place on the oil covered windows then we
turned on the oil globules and at last were shooting
through space at what we thought was the maximum
limit of our speed

  from the time we left denver until we landed at
san diego we were in the air for approximately forty
minutes-which indicated the astounding speed of
about  miles per hour

  our trial spin had proved the spirit of youth to be
a wonderful success the only flaw we had been able
to discover in the entire mechanism was the clouding
of our windows by the oil-mist and this was trivial
all we had to do was to install automatic windshield
wipers on each pane of glass and our mechanism was
ready for its trip around the world

chapter vi

pontius bragg butts in

having demonstrated that the boerner motorthe
external lubrication system and the four dimen-
sional rudder were all practical and having sat-
isfied himself that the spirit of youth would do all that
he had expected professor banning consented to furnish
the newspapers and magazines with a description of
his invention and his plans for circumnavigating the
globe in less than eighteen hours

  you probably recall the interest and excitement that
were stimulated when this astonishing announcement
was first made public perhaps it was only natural
that most of the newspaper writers treated the story
as a joke some were even bold enough to hint that
professor bannings brain had become slightly addled
through too much ratiocination over tesseracts hecato-
nicosiahedragons and other four dimensional nonsense

  it was gratifying to note however that the news-
papers of the better class gave the matter serious con-
sideration and attention even the yellowest of the
publications that were inclined to ridicule us made no
attempt to explain the definite account of what took
place on our trial trip which was released in the form
of an official statement signed by professor banning
colonel berghlin and me of course they gave no par-
ticular weight to my corroboration and many were
inclined to discount professor bannings assertions
but to ninety-nine and forty one hundreths per cent
of the inhabitants of these united states the word of
berghlin was as good as the word of george wash-
ington

  the controversy was at its zenith when pontius
bragg butted into the argument

  everybody has heard of pontius bragg-the most
colossal bluff four-flusher and egoist that ever-ried
to get his name in the papers

  bragg you will remember first came into promi-
nence several years ago when after having led an ex-
ploring party into central asia he returned with the
announcement that he and a single companion named
story had succeeded in scaling the highest peak of
mount everest

  the world in general accepted his claim without ques-
tion and for about a week bragg was on the front
page of nearly every newspaper throughout the world
wherever he went he was the center of hero-worship-
ping and adulatory mobs he was feted and decorated
by the governmental and scientific leaders of several
great nations

  it was not until a committee of eminent scientists
appointed by the national geographical society inter-
viewed bragg and story in a sincere effort to elicit
valuable contributions to the worlds knowledge that
the real truth transpired the utter inability of bragg
and story to furnish a plausible and consistent ex-
planation of how they were able to survive the ter-
rific blizzards that are incessantly raging on the slopes
of mount everest and how they were able to con-
serve enough physical energy to struggle through the
extremely rarefied atmosphere at the tremendous alti-
tude of  feet was the first thing to excite their
suspicion

  the committee organized to glorify braggs supposed
achievement ended by making a gruelling investiga-
tion they unearthed some startling information
story the sole corroborator of braggs claim turned
out to be a notorious swindler liar and ex-convict as
for bragg the committee became firmly convinced that
he had not been within one hundred miles of mount
four dimensional transit



everest they issued a formal statement denouncing
bragg and story as imposters and branding their
claim to have scaled mount everest as a gigantic
hoax

  for some time after that bragg disappeared from
public view only to pop up again a year or two later
as the promotor of a questionable gold mining scheme
from these mining and stock selling operations bragg
is reputed to have cleaned up over a million dollars
most of which came out of the pockets of people who
could ill afford to lose their meager savings

   the next effort which bragg had made to grab the
spotlight had occurred just about the time we started
work on the spirit of youth he had then announced
his intention to fly in an airplane across the south
pole and aukland to capetown he even went so far
as to make the journey to aukland taking with him
a specially built airplane and a crew consisting of three
mechanics and two pilots

   after several delays and false starts he finally
hopped off only to return in a few hours with the
report that he had run into a terrific storm this
performance was repeated no less than four times
until the public got so sick of bragg that practically
all of the newspapers ignored him and consigned to the
waste basket the reams of publicity which were pre-
pared and planted by braggs paid press agents

   then bragg returned to the united states and suc-
ceeded in getting a few newspapers to print the an-
nouncement that he had postponed his flight across the
south pole until the following fall when he expected
weather conditions would be more favorable

   braggs most recent opportunity to break into print
 came after professor banning released his startling an-
 nouncement regarding the spirit of youth and our
 plans to circumnavigate the globe in less than eighteen
 hours

an open letter signed by bragg was published
simultaneously in several of the more sensational
newspapers throughout the united states it started
out by affirming that professor bannings theories
were ridiculous and absolutely impracticable in sup-
port of his statement bragg offered to wager 
against an equal amount to be posted by banning that
the spirit of youth woulld not succeed in its initial
trip in circumnavigating the globe in less than eighteen
hours

   following the publication of this challenge a flock
 of reporters called on us professor banning made a
 dignified reply to braggs letter he stated that he
 did not approve of betting or any other form of
 gambling for gain but in order to justify his
 faith in the spirit of youth and to prevent bragg
 from getting away with what looked like an egregious
 bluff professor banning made the following counter
 proposal

   instead of  banning offered to post 
 providing bragg would put up a like sum in case
 the spirit of youth succeeded in circumnavigating the
 globe in less than eighteen hours making one or
 more stops on the way around all of the 
 was to be used to endow a fellowship the income
 from which would make it possible for some young
 man of unusual promise to devote his life to the ad-
 vancement of aviation if the spirit of youth did
 not get completely around the earth on its first at-
 tempt or if the feat of circumnavigation was accom-
 plished in more than eighteen hours the 
 was to be devoted to any charitable or educational
 purpose which bragg chose to name

   braggs rejoinder was a typical reflection of the

mans character he consented to raising the ante
from  to  but when it came to the clause
regarding any charitable or educational purpose he
stated

   i believe that both education and charity begin at
 home the only charity i am interested in is the
 future welfare of pontius bragg and his immediate
 family the only education i care anything about is
 the education of the bragg offspring by this he
 could have referred only to pontius bragg jr his
 only child who had already been expelled from two
 eastern colleges and had acquired considerable no-
 toriety through his mad pranks in the night clubs
 of new york

   you can well imagine that this statement did not
mitigate braggs unpopularity with the public and
the press

   much as he detested braggs principles and braggs
attitude professor banning accepted his final stipula-
tion he insisted however that the  be put
up in cash by each party and placed on escrow at a
bank in order to guarantee the fulfillment of the
agreement

   this was done

chapter vii

across the pacific

while the controversy was going on between
messrs banning and bragg we had been busily
engaged in grooming the spirit of youth for
her crucial flight mechanically there were only a few
additions and changes needed the most essential
of these was the installation of the automatic win-
dow wipers already mentioned

  although the machine was capable of carrying
enough larsene to propel it  miles or com-
pletely around the earth and although we had every
reason to believe that we could easily circumnavigate
the globe and return to our home port without stop-
ping professor banning very wisely decided not to
make it a non-stop flight

   this is not to be a mere stunt it is to be a
practical demonstration he stated there is no
practical value in flying completely around the world
and ending up at the starting point without making
any stops on the way thats why we intend to
make at least one stop-possibly two or more the
first will be at shanghai if we decide to alight a
second time it will probably be at paris

   over a month previous to our departure professor
banning had arranged to have  supply of larsene
shipped to each of the two cities just mentioned al-
though this was not exactly necessary it was done as
a measure of precaution in order to make sure that
we would have a large reserve of fuel to draw on if
needed

   as is usually the case on long flights our store of
 fuel constituted the major portion of our cargo a
 few sandwiches and three large thermos bottles full
 of hot malted milk was all the food we expected to
 consume during the journey we also had a five
 gallon keg of fresh water and enough concentrated
 liquid food to last us a month in case we should be
 forced to land in some remote place

   in addition to the regulation equipment the spirit
 of youth was provided with a specially constructed
 telescope which had a camera attachment the tele-
 scope was operated somewhat on the principle of a
 submarines periscope except that when in use it pro-
 truded from the bottom of the airplane instead of the
 top with this device it was possible to turn the ob-


amazing stories quarterly

jective of the telescope in any direction it could
even be extended at right angles far enough to one
side to clear the body of the plane and in this posi-
tion afforded an unobscured view directly overhead

  there was but one opening to the cabin and the
door had double walls like the rest of the body wht
closed it was absolutely air-tight since we expected
to do most of our flying at an altitude of over 
feet in order to take advantage of the low resistance
of the more rarefied air our equipment also included
a small compressor which i have referred to pre-
viously this operated automatically drawing air from
outside and compressing it until it was just the right
density for comfortable breathing for use in case
of emergencies an adequate supply of oxygen was
provided we also were supplied with a chmical
apparatus for absorbing carbon dioxide from the air
after we had breathed it

  after all these devices and supplies had been care-
fully inspected and checked over the spirit of youth
was wheeled out on the runway and we were ready
to start it was in the middle of june-the fifteenth
to be exact-close enough to the summer solstice to
assure us of having the maximum amount of daylight
for our trip for certain reasons professor banning
had set the hour of  noon as the starting time

  at about nine in the morning we started getting
the spirit of youth ready for the great adventure
the tanks were filled with fuel and a plentiful supply
of oil-both for internal and external lubrication-was
put into the storage compartment

  everything was carefully inspected by all three of
us and each of us was also held individually responsible
for a complete and painstaking checking of all details
which came within our own particular jurisdiction
for instance berghlin went over every cap lever and
bolt of the motor and the control mechanism pro-
fessor banning saw to it that the equipment of instru-
ments accessories and supplies was complete and i
inspected with meticulous care the four dimensional
rudder and everything connected with it

  this work was all completed by ten forty-five and
we had an hour and a quarter of idleness before the
time set for our take-off that brief period of wait-
ing seemed like months it was the hardest most
nerve racking part of the entire adventure

  at last the zero hour arrived

  though we had done all we could to keep the exact
date of our departure a secret the news had leaked
out and there was a goodly coterie of newspaper men
photographers and motion picture camera men-as well
as several hundred other spectators present to see us
off

professor banning and berghlin stepped into
the cabin as nonchalantly as if they were going
on a short jaunt to los angeles as for me i made
no bones over the fact that i was both scared and
nervous i felt a great deal as i did the first time i
ever dove from a spring board twenty-five feet above
the water i hated to take the jump and at the same
time i didnt want the people who were watching me
to see me hesitate too long

  and so with a sinking heart and with shimmying
knees i scrambled through the narrow opening and
berghlin clamped the air proof door shut

  a moment later we heard the barrage of the motor
and we were darting down the runway with his
consummate skill our pilot maneuvered the heavily
laden machine off the ground and headed her nose
westward for several minutes we climbed upward
until we had reached an altitude of several thousand

feet professor banning then turned on both the ex-
ternal lubricating system and the mechanism for
keeping the air inside the cabin at a comfortable
breathing pressure

  then professor banning signalled for me to deflect
the four dimensional rudder i gradually turned the
wheel until we felt the peculiar skidding motion which
told us that we were being steered into hyper-space
berghlin soon had the airplane under perfect control
and we all settled down for a monotonous steady
grind

  at about one forty-five banning scribbled a note
and held it up where both the pilot and i could read
we ought to be pretty close to the hawaiian islands
now

  sure enough a few moments later after we had
descended to an altitude of about  feet we were
able to make out the distinctive outlines of the island
of hawaii with two small specks which we knew to
be hilo and maui lying to the west of it

  in a few minutes we had left the paradise of
the pacific far in the rear and were flying high above
the vast expanse of ocean everything went smoothly
and that part of the journey was uneventful

  shortly after five oclock we again dropped down to
the lower levels and all three of us kept a sharp look-
out for land

  it was berghlins keen vision which first caught the
dim outlines of the chinese coast i dont believe
any member of christopher columbus crew was more
delighted to see land than i was

  berghlin justified his reputation as a genius for
locating his objectives by finding shanghai and mak-
ing a perfect landing on an airport which he had
never seen before

  an unwieldly mob of hysterical people had collected
on the field and the police were powerless to keep them
in check

  with only one-third of our journey completed and
with none too much time left in which to finish the
trip according to schedule we were hardly in the mood
for hero worship but despite our protests and
desperate struggles the crowd dragged us out of the
cabin and carried us about the field while the air
was made hideous by the raucous honking of auto
horns and the shrieking of human voices

  by the time we had persuaded our well meaning but
rone the less troublesome admirers to permit us to
return to the spirit of youth and to get it refueled
and into the air again we had lost over an hour out
of our precious eighteen

chapter viii

far into hyper-space

when we finally found ourselves once more off
the ground we all three heaved sighs of relief
it was then that professor banning did an
astonishing thing he scribbled a note and handed it
to berghlin looking over his shoulder i read head
due east

  i could hardly believe my eyes and berghlin seemed
equally puzzled at first i thought that the excitement
at shanghai had brought on a brain storm but he
hardly looked or acted like an insane person antici-
pating our objections he hastily wrote the following
please do as i ask ill explain later

  that was enough for berghlin while he was bring-
ing the plane about professor banning was busily
engaged in scribbling another note this he handed
to me it said turn the fdr until i signal you
to stop
four dimensional transit



  with infinite care i slowly turned the wheel at
about five degrees there was the usual skidding sensa-
tion i stopped but professor banning motioned for
me to continue turning it in the same direction i
obeyed when the dial pointed to twenty-seven degrees
the plane gave a terrific lurch and the profeasor sig-
nalled stop

  with another note banning then directed the pilot
to make a wide semi-circle which would gradually
bring the airplane around until it pointed west again
this maneuver completed the professor scribbled off
his promised explanation it read like this

  to make up for the time weve lost we must do
something to increase our speed i figured out a way
to do this when we were traveling from west to
east at the rate of  miles per hour we also were
riding along with the earths atmosphere which is
moving from west to east at the rate of approximately
 miles per hour for convenience i am using
only round numbers this made our total absolute
speed about  miles per hour

  by steering with the fdr for a considerable
distance into hyper-space we have been able to de-
tach ourselves almost entirely from the gravitational
attraction of the earth-while still maintaining our
speed of  miles per hour

  now that we are headed east again the surface
of the earth is moving beneath us in the opposite
direction with a speed of  miles per hour while
we ought still to be making nearly  miles per
hour suppose we assume that in making the turn
and getting headed west again we lost some of our
velocity-say  miles per hour we would still have
left a rate of  miles per hour which added to
the speed of the earths rotation would make our
velocity with respect to any point on the earths sur-
face approximately  miles per hour

  i shook my head to indicate that i did not compre-
hend fully professor banning amplified his explana-
tion as follows

  lets go back to the analogy of the airplane on
the deck of the imaginary steamship  miles long
and traveling at a speed of  miles per hour if
the plane taxies toward the bow at the rate of 
miles per hour and then flies off its initial velocity will
be  miles per hour

  now suppose it makes a hairpin turn so that it
moves in the opposite direction from that in which
the ship is sailing if it is able to maintain its origi-
nal rate of  miles per hour its velocity with re-
spect to any point on the boat will be  miles per
hour enabling it to travel the  miles from stem
to stern in one-third of an hour or twenty minutes

  in actuality of course it would quickly lose its
original speed due to the resistance of the air

  up here however the atmosphere is very rarefied
and also because of our special devices for reducing
both friction and gravitational attraction our loss
should be very slight if it were possible to reduce
this loss to zero heres how our present speed would
work out

  speed due to motor  mph approx

    extra amount due to
      earths rotation  mph approx

    total speed during
     brief period while
     we were traveling

      from west to east  mph approx
    speed of earths ro-
    tation which since
    we are now travel-

     ing from east to
     west is in the op-
     posite direction mph approx

    total speed with re-
      spect to any por-
      tion of the earth

below us  mph approx

  as i indicated before i do not think we are actu-
ally traveling quite that fast since we must have lost
some velocity while we were making our right-about-
face maneuver but i wouldnt be surprised if we are
traveling at the rate of at least  miles per hour
right now

we had no way to measure our speed since our
specially designed speedometer could register no
higher than  miles per hour to estimate our
velocity from the movement of objects beneath us was
also impossible due to a large cloud bank which com-
pletely hid the earth from view

  one thing that was quite noticeable however was
the rapid acceleration of the motor it began racing
at an alarming speed and it had to be throttled
down finally the flow of fuel was reduced to the
amount required for idling while on the ground still
the propeller whirred faster and faster when it
sounded as if the motor would fly apart the power
was turned off completely

  just then we reached the edge of the clouds and i
was able to secure an unobscured view downward

  what i saw made my eyes bulge and brought to my
scalp that tingling prickly feeling that we always as-
sociate with intense and sudden fear

  instead of a wide stretch of earth which from an
airplane ordinarily looks either flat or else concave
like the inside of a saucer the earth beneath us was
a well defined ball to be sure it was an enormously
large ball which completely filled the space beneath us
but it was rapidly becoming smaller before our very
eyes

  i must have uttered some fearful cry for both
berghlin and banning looked at me with startled con-
cern  tried to say something but the words caught
in my throat and nothing but an incoherent gurgle is-
sued from my numb lips i finally pointed through
the window and following my gesture they looked
downward

  i saw a look of amazement come to berghlins fea-
tures and his lips formed an exclamation which must
have been

  my god whats happened

  only professor banning preserved his usual calm
equanimity he even had the nerve to smile

  berghlin frantically manipulated the controls in an
attempt to coast to a lower altitude but all his efforts
were fruitless instead of descending we seemed to be
falling rapidly away from the earth

  my own attempts to reverse the direction of our
machine by working the four dimensional rudder were
equally futile

  with the motor shut off we could now converse
easily without shouting or resorting to notes profes-
sor banning was the first to speak calmly

  i was afraid this might happen but dont worry
i have prepared for it

  prepared for what afraid what might happen
i gasped

  i knew the answer before he gave it

  dont you see what weve done the four dimen-
sional rudder kept steering us further and further
into hyper-space until we have been projected clear

chapter ix

banning makes an astounding proposal

 you mean to say that we have risen to such
a high altitude or have gotten so far into
hyper-space as you call it that the earth no
longer exerts any attraction for us berghlin asked
professor banning

i woke with a start to find myself floating in rald-alr and
bumping against the ceiling of the cabin the professor
grasped my leg and pulled mo back to the floor

gravitation which may be expressed something like
this

         every body in the universe attracts every
     other body with a force that varies directly
     as the product of their masses and inversely
     as the square of the distance between them

   that means exactly what it says it means that
 the spirit of youth-or for that matter even this tiny
 match which i now hold in my hand-is being at-
 tracted in some measure by the sun by the earth and
 all the other planets from mercury to neptune and by
 every other object in the universe including the small-
 est asteroids and the remotest stars

   the force with which we are being attracted by any
 individual body depends on two things its mass and
 its distance away from us when we were flying
 within a mile or two of the earth its gravitational
 attraction for us was of course infinitely greater than
 that of any other body in the universe this was
 due partly to the enormous mass of the earth but
 principally to our closeness to it

   if the mass of the earth were doubled the weight
 of every object on the earth or close to it would be
 doubled that is providing the weighing is done with
 a spring balance you can readily see that if things
 are weighed with scales depending on balancing stand-
 ards of known weight a change in the mass of the
 earth would have no effect on the weight registered
 since the standard weights themselves would be al-
 tered in exactly the same proportion as the objects
 weighed

   let me call your special attention to the fact
 that the distance between two objects has a much
 greater effect on the amount of the gravitational force
 than their joint masses if this distance is doubled
 the attractive force becomes one-fourth as great if
 it is trebled the attraction is only one-ninth as great-
 and if the distance is multiplied one thousand times
 the gravitational force is diminished to one one-
 millionth of its original magnitude that is what
 we mean when we say the force varies inversely as
 the square of the distance

   you can easily see therefore that we dont need
 to get so very far away from the earth before its at-
 traction for us becomes extremely small and since
 out here there is practically nothing else to offer any
 resistance to our progress or to reduce our speed our

beyond the gravitational field of the
earth the spirit of youth is now like a meteor
or small comet we are flying through
space absolutely independent of any
direct connection with the earth or
any other body

  not at all was the answer that would be im-
possible no matter how far away we go youve studied
physics of course and you will recall the law of
four dimensional transit



tendency will be to keep on moving with uniform
velocity in a straight line until some other large body
gets close enough to us to deflect us away from our
course

   it took several minutes before the full significance
 of these startling statements registered clearly on my
 brain when they finally did sink in i was surprised
 to find that i could take the shock quite calmly a
 person would reasonably be expected to get a bit ex-
 cited when he was told that he was flying through
 interstellar space with no particular course or destina-
 tion it didnt take me long however to conclude
 that there wasnt much we could do under the cir-
 cumstances and hence we might as well make the
 best of it

  berghlin also was as calm as well water and
equally cool that was natural enough in view of the
many chances he had taken in the past which had
undoubtedly steeled him to look danger in the eye with-
out flinching

  of the three of us the professor was the most
excited not that he showed any indication of fear
or regret on the contrary he seemed to be elated
to the point of exultation

  just think of it boys he exclaimed we are
the first human beings who have ever traveled beyond
the earths atmospheric envelope what a wonderful
contribution we are making to science

  a lot of good our contribution to science will do
with us doomed to go crashing through space until
we hit something or run out of the things we need
to keep us alive i cried bitterly well soon be
slowly starving to death if we dont smother first or
freeze or burn up or meet some other horrible fate
and then what good will our contribution to science
be

  dont be so pessimistic my young friend was
the professors mild reproof who said we are going
to smother or starve or freeze not if i can help
it as i told you a moment ago i foresaw that this
might happen and i have tried to make adequate pro-
vision for every eventuality

  do you mean to say that you deliberately planned
to have us shot off into space like this on a-on a-
i hesitated for a suitable phrase on a wild comets
chase

  though he must have known that i was tragically
serious the professor chuckled i didnt exactly plan
it but the possibility that it might happen did enter
into my calculations when i designed the spirit of
youth

  then why in sam hill didnt you tell me all this
before i consented to go along on this fool expedition

   it was then for the first time that berghlin inter-
 posed a remark he merely said quietly whats the
 use of all this argument were in it now so lets
 see it through like men

piiat was all i needed to put me straight again

 youre right and i ought to be kicked i
admitted then turning to the professor im sorry
and i apologize guess my scandinavian temper got
the best of me

  thats all right my boy glad you got it out of
your system and now if youll just trust me as
you used to i feel sure that well come out of this
unharmed

  that trust me as you used to made me feel like
a pimple on a microbes proboscis-if a microbe
has such a thing as a proboscis like the boy who
was caught in the melon patch i had nothing to say

   berghlin picked up the conversation

  do you mean professor that you actually think
there is a chance for us to get back to earth again
without being annihilated

  just as good a chance as you had of reaching
paris when you were flying alone through the atlan-
tic fogs but it seems to be getting a bit stuffy in
here ill turn on the air purifier he pressed a but-
ton and a small machine at the rear of the cabin
began to give off a whirring sound

  this is a new invention i havent told you about
before it was designed for use on submarines but
will serve our purpose equally well mechanically it
is as simple as a vacuum cleaner nothing but a small
motor and a fan operated from storage batteries it
keeps the air inside the cabin in constant circula-
tion the important principle of the device is a chem-
ical one it absorbs the surplus carbon dioxide and
other waste matter which we put into the air when
we breathe an automatic apparatus also keeps sup-
plying just the right quantity of additional oxygen to
compensate for what is used up it will take care of
our breathing needs for at least two months-which 
is considerably longer than i expect to use it we
also have plenty of food aboard so dont worry about
that

  but how are we going to keep from freezing to
death was my query according to our physics text
books the temperature of interstellar space is abso-
lute zero which as i remember is the same as minus
 degrees on the centigrade scale or about  de-
grees below zero on the farenheit scale what about
that

  nothing to worry about whether or not the writer
of your physics text book is correct in his assumption
is one thing we shall probably find out undoubtedly
it is true that space itself is not heated by the rays
of sunlight which pass through it but when these
same rays impinge on a solid object such as the
earth or the surface of this airplane we know that
they are capable of producing immense quantities of
heat

  bear in mind that out here we have no atmosphere
no fog no clouds and no night time to reduce or tone
down the strength of the suns rays as long as we
are in the open it will always be day time on the
side of the machine nearest the sun and night time
on the shaded side and since the rays must hit at
least part of our surface at right angles i expect a
climate to be more like that of the sahara desert than
that of the arctic regions

   instead of being in danger of freezing i think if
anything well find it uncomfortably hot however
im relying on the insulating material between the
walls combined with the neutralizing effect of the
shaded portion of the plane which ought to absorb
enough heat from the sunny side to keep us comfort-
able and if the worst comes to the worst we have
both an electric heater and a refrigerating plant
aboard so were prepared for anything that is likely
to happen is there anything else thats worrying
you

  yes what about the cosmic ray ive read that
even after penetrating several miles of the earths
atmosphere it is strong enough to affect the indicator
of an electroscope several hundred feet below the sur-
face of a lake isnt it likely to have some injurious
effect either on us or on our machinery as soon as
we get completely outside the earths atmospheric pro-
tection

  if anything like that was going to happen it
would have been all over before this and i dont for
a minute doubt that serious consequences might have

taken place if i hadnt thought of that too and
guarded against it
i dont know whether you noticed it or not but
the material which we used for filling the space be-
tween the two walls of our airplane is a vitreous
jelly-like substance known as cosmotite it is not
only a remarkable insulator against heat it is also
an insulator against the cosmic ray experiments
have proved that one inch of cosmotite offers as much
resistance to the passage of cosmic rays as eight miles
of atmosphere at normal barometer pressure the
thickness of the insulation inside our hollow walls is
enough to give us approximately the same protection
as is afforded by the earths atmosphere fortunately
this insulating material is transparent to ordinary
sunlight so i have been able to use it between the
double windows as well	v

  one more question if you dont mind i said
how are we going to get back to earth even if we
could make our motor run slowly enough to operate
the propeller without racking it to pieces it wouldnt
do any good because the propeller cant move the plane
except by creating a current of air in the opposite
direction and since there is no air up here the pro-
peller has nothing to take hold of

  thats quite correct and here is where our rocket
tubes come in remember when you and i were dis-
cussing this part of the design before we started
building the spirit of youth i told you that i in-
stalled the rocket tubes as a safety precaution in case
of emergency well the emergency is here and we
are prepared to meet it

  ill have to hand it to you professor i eulogized
you sure thought of everything didnt you

  i hope so ive tried my best to anticipate and
provide for anything that might happen i may have
overlooked something but i trust that i havent

  when you tackle a job like this you dont usually
overlook anything-so i guess we are safe

  im glad to hear you say that thank you very

much		t

  thats all right now is there anything i can

do	 

  yes there is i want you and charley to help me
make a very momentous decision shall we turn back
to the earth right now or shall we go on

  go on i gasped what in the universe do
you mean

  just this we already have a good start on a
trip that may develop into the greatest adventure
that any human beings have ever undertaken outside
of a book of imaginative and sensational fiction

 you mean 	

  a trip around the moon and back to the earth

chapter x

we try the rocket tubes

ou mean you think it will really be possible

   v	for us to land on the moon i asked pro-
   i fessor banning

  i didnt say anything about landing on the moon
while i believe it could be done i wasnt thinking
of attempting that on this trip my suggestion is that
we fly within a thousand feet or so of the moon make
a hairpin turn around it and return to the earth
without stopping in this way we could make close
observations and perhaps get some good close-up pho-
tographs of the moons surface

  as you know the moon rotates in such a way that
it always turns the same face toward the earth for
that reason nothing whatever is known about the

opposite side of the moon i propose to find out what
this hidden face of the moon looks like

  what good will that do i asked

  no practical good perhaps any more than the
expeditions of amundsen and byrd and wilkins across
the polar regions had any practical value but i
think that they were justified because they added to
the store of human knowledge just think what it
will mean to contribute a new page to the worlds
book of knowledge isnt that worth striving for
isnt it worth taking risks for

  if you want my honest opinion i grumbled im
for hitting it back to good old mother earth while
the hitting is good

  when i saw the pained look of disappointment on
professor bannings face it made me feel ashamed

  he appealed to berghlin what do you say
charlie

  it looks to me to be worth trying if you think
there is a good chance for us to make it to the moon
and to get safely back to earth im for going on

  i knew there was no use holding out any longer
after that so i said if both of you feel that way
about it far be it from me to throw sand in the gear
box so lets make it unanimous

  thanks boys said the professor as he grasped
my hand warmly with one hand and patted berghlin
on the shoulder with the other

  during the time we were holding this conference
the spirit of youth was hurtling through space with-
out a guiding hand our pilot to be sure had stuck
to the joy stick but he might just as well have left
the machine entirely to its own devices for the con-
trols no longer exerted the slightest influence in our
course

  from the moment he had found it necessary to shut
off the motor he had given practically no attention to
navigating or controlling the planes flight now he
turned his attention to this important matter

  what id like to know is how we are going to
navigate now that none of the controls will work he
remarked and if we do succeed in figuring out some
way to steer how are we going to know what direc-
tion we are supposed to go

  steering is easily accomplished by means of our
rocket tubes the professor responded the reason
why your motor races and your controls wont work
is that there is virtually no air or other fluid out
here on which your propeller or your rudders can take
hold for the same reason there is practically no
resistance being offered to our progress so we are
shooting merrily along at about the same speed we
were going when we shut off the motor this is in
accordance with newtons law of motion

       a body in motion tends to continue moving
     with uniform velocity in a straight line un-
     less acted on by some external force

  under the circumstances the only way we can
change either the speed or direction of our flight is
to apply newtons third law of motion which is

       for every action there is an equal reaction
     exerted in the opposite direction

  to produce the requisite reaction all we need to
do is project something out of the plane through one
of our rocket tubes this may either be a single
shot like a bullet from a gun or a steady stream of
sparks or burning gases like the tail of a rocket
like the kick of a gun this produces a reaction which
will push the plane in the opposite direction

  since there are ten tubes-all capable of being
four dimensional transit



pointed in different directions-we can easily steer
toward any given point merely by turning one or
more of the tubes in the direction opposite from that
in which we desire to go and shooting a charge of
explosive gas through the tubes

  but how shall we know whether to steer north
south east or west berghlin asked

  my dear boy there are no such words as north or
east-or even up or down in the universe even on
earth these terms are very ambiguous for example
when amundsen flew across the north pole in the
norge he traveled due north until he passed over the
pole then he immediately began to travel southward
or in exactly the opposite direction although he didnt
change his course a particle and continued to move
in the same direction he was going when hf was
headed north	

  likewise when an aviator flies around the earth
from east to west his direction while he is flying
over china is exactly opposite to what it is when he
is over pennsylvania and yet in both cases he is
traveling toward the west

  the terms up and down are also inexact what
they really mean is away from the center of the
earth and toward the center of the earth at twelve
oclock noon the steeple of a church points in exactly
the opposite direction from what it does at  oclock
midnight at six oclock it points at right angles to
the original direction yet we say the steeple always
points up

  when you get away from the earth such terms as
up or down north or south east or west have abso-
lutely no significance that is unless we adopt some
system of definition and arbitrarily assign meanings
to them for instance we can draw an imaginary
line from the north star to the center of the sun
and continue it for an indefinite distance beyond the
sun this we can call our north and south line
through the center of the sun we can then pass a
plane of unlimited area meeting the north and south
line at right angles some prominent star which
happens to fall within this plane may now be selected
and named the east star a line drawn from this
star through and beyond the center of the sun will
give us our east and west line if we wish to in-
clude hyper-space in our chart it will be necessary
to draw a fourth line through the center of the sun
at right angles to each of the other three lines this
line will extend into the fourth dimension to it we
can give any name we wish-as for instance the in
and out line

  with these four co-ordinates we can easily locate
with definite exactness any object in the solar sys-
tem or for that matter in the entire universe a com-
plete science of navigation for space flyers could be
built up using this conception as a basis

  and do we have to figure all this out in order to
find our way to the moon and back asked berghlin

  oh no indeed our problem is quite simple-as
simple in fact as it would be for a pilot to steer a
straight course toward a brilliantly visible lighthouse

  our beacon light is the moon itself which will
always be conspicuously present in the heavens all
we have to do is fly straight toward it when we get
fairly close well have to do a little navigating to
steer around the moon and to escape from its gravita-
tional clutch afterthat it will be plain sailing with
the great ball of the earth as our goal

  isnt it about time we got our bearings and set
our course berghlin suggested

  i think youll find we are traveling in approxi-

mately the right direction right now the professor
assured him

  our pilot looked through the front window and
said i cant see the moon at all

  come here and take a look through this window
said the professor

both berghlin and i looked in the direction indi-
cated and there sure enough was the moon-but
such a moon as human eyes had never before seen
it looked as big as a medicine ball half of it was
illuminated with a dazzling brilliancy that almost
rivalled that of the sun the outlines of the other
half though dark could be very plainly distinguished

  but its behind us and to the starboard side of
us instead of straight ahead cried berghlin we
must be flying away from the moon instead of toward
it

  if we were moving in the direction that our nose is
pointing that would be true but i think if you watch
the moon for a while you will see that it is gradually
growing larger indicating that we are traveling toward
it even though our machine itself is moving backward
and sideways

  since there is no atmospheric pressure or other
resistance up here it really doesnt matter how our
machine is headed so long as the whole plane itself
travels in the right direction

  to make sure ill take an observation all i need
to do is to point our telescope toward the center of
the moon take a reading of the scale and then point
it toward the center of the earth if we are traveling
in a straight line between the earth and the moon
the angle between these two lines of direction will be
exactly one hundred and eighty degrees

  he adjusted the telescope and pointing it first at
the moon and then at the earth took a reading of
the scale

  hm one hundred and seventy-three degrees and
forty-two minutes we are six degrees and eighteen
minutes off our course lets see if we can correct
this and while we are about it well also try to
turn the nose of our plane toward the moon

  he jotted some figures on a scrap of paper figured
rapidly for a few seconds and then said seven units
in number three and sixteen in number eight ought to
do the trick then the professor made some adjust-
ments on a special keyboard which operated the me-
chanism of the rocket tubes and we heard a hissing
sound exactly like that of two big sky-rockets being
fired off at once we felt a slight jar which was
followed by a change in the direction of the airplane
in a moment it had swung around until the moon was
visible through the front windows a few degrees
to the port side of our normal line of flight

  that isnt perfect but i think it will be close
enough for now my mechanism for controlling the
rocket tubes is very crude and imperfect when i get
time i expect to work it out in such a way that the
rockets can be operated automatically by means of
the joy stick-just like ordinary flying for the time
being however our present method will serve the
purpose i think

  cant we use the rocket tubes to increase our
speed inquired berghlin

  certainly but i dont think we had better waste
any of our fuel now we are speeding along at a
pretty satisfactory gait as it is and we may need all
the power we can develop to get us around the moon
and back to earth again so i believe we had better
conserve our resources


amazing stories quarterly

the machlnc veered to one aide until wc were flying in a direction parallel to the surface of the moon intcad

of pointing directly toward it

the moon and another sixty-three to get back making
a total of over four months for the round trip
phew i ejaculated

  but continued the professor i dont expect to
consume anywhere near that amount of time there
are two ways in which we can accelerate our speed
one is by making use of the gravitational attraction
first of the moon and then of the earth and as a
last recourse we can always boost our velocity by
means of the rocket tubes with these aids we ought
to be able to make the complete journey and be back
on earth inside of thirty days

  thats plenty long enough for me i exclaimed
but so long as we get back safe i should worry
about how long it takes us by the way i wonder
what time it is

since the sun doesnt rise or set here there is noth-
ing to do about it though so far as i can see

chapter xi
we lose track of time

until i found myself absolutely bereft of any
basis for recording or even estimating time i
never realized how much we human beings de-
pend on the clock in regulating our activities to be
lost in time was to me far more serious than to be
lost in space-and lost in time we certainly were

  it is the weirdest feeling i have ever experienced-
the utter inability to distinguish between weeks and
days and nights or even between hours and seconds
the ability to estimate the time of day within a half

  how long do you think it will take us to complete
the trip this was my question

  thats hard to say since we have no way to
measure our velocity with any degree of accuracy
well have to estimate it my guess is that we are
traveling about  miles per hour i obtain this
figure by adding the approximate speed which our
motor was developing or about  miles per hour to
the velocity of the earths rotation which in round
numbers is  miles per hour and then making a
reasonable deduction for loss of motion while passing
through the upper more rarefied strata of the earths
atmosphere

  the distance from the earth to the moon is 
miles if we maintain a uniform speed of  miles
per hour it will take us about sixty-three days to reach

  simultaneously we all looked at our wrist watches

  mine says seven forty-eight berghlin announced
as he held his watch up to his ear that cant be
right must have stopped just after we left shanghai

  my watch is also stopped the professor declared

  mine too i chimed in

  the chronometer on the dashboard also was stopped
with the hands pointing to seven forty-eight we all
tried to get our time pieces going again but neither
of them could be made to work

  it must have been the jolt when we took that sud-
den dive into hyper-space just after leaving shanghai
that put our chronometer and watches out of com-
mission professor banning explained thats too
bad now we have no means whatever for measur-
ing time we cant even count the days that pass
four dimensional transit



hour or so-which almost anyone can ordinarily ac-
complish with ease-was completely lost to us here

  of course we had no way of knowing how many
days were passing by on one side of the plane the
sun shone continuously the other side was in dense
shadow

  i told professor banning that my conceptions of
time were completely disrupted and asked him if he
was affected in the same way his answer was cer-
tainly not i feel sure i can estimate the time that
elapses just as well as if we were on earth i guess
its my mathematical training that makes this pos-
sible

  if thats the case youd better be our time-piece
i cant answer for berghlin but as for me im com-
pletely at sea-or rather at space-so youll have to
tell me when its time to eat and sleep	

  that reminds me the professor remarked weve
been a long time without food lets eat right now

  we made a meal out of the rest of the sandwiches
which we had taken along thinking that they would
be ample for the entire journey since banning had
assured us that we had an ample supply of concen-
trated food we all ate heartily making no attempt
to conserve our rations

  when it seemed to me but a few minutes after we
had finished eating banning said well -boys its past
midnight now arent you going to bed

  im not a bit sleepy i assured him you two go
ahead and sleep ill stand watch

  so will i our pilot volunteered im too nervous
to sleep

  well if you boya dont mind i believe i will take
a nap if anything unusual happens be sure and wake
me with this the professor stretched himself out
on the floor of the cabin drew up a blanket and almost
instantly began to snore contentedly

  with professor banning asleep berghlin and i
were at loss for something to occupy our minds since
we had not expected to have any time to kill on our
rapid trip around the earth we had brought with us
neither books cards nor other means of passing away
the time while banning was awake we were con-
tent to ask him questions and listen to his interesting
explanations but since neither of us two knew any-
thing about interplanetary navigation we soon had
to give up trying to figure out what the result of
our amazing voyage would be

  there wa nothing to do but stare out of the win-
dow and we soon found the vista quite monotonous-
astonishing and spectacular as it was at first sight

  were it not for the brilliant sunlight streaming
through the windows that faced old sol we might
have thought we were flying through stygian dark-
ness the sky was as black as a windowless cellar
full of coal the milky way the great dipper and
all the other stars and constellations were all shining
with a brightness never perceived from the earth

  three great glowing orbs hung in space against the
sable sky the largest of these was the earth now
far behind us and looking like a gigantic push-ball
floating in space we could make out the form of the
entire globe and could even distinguish the familiar
outlines of the eastern hemisphere about half of
the globe was brightly illuminated and the other half
but faintly visible

  much the same half lit up appearance charac-
terized the moon which had grown until it looked as
large as a medicine ball little change had taken
place in the apparent proportions of the sun-but it
was a far different sun-a sun the like of which human
eyes had never before beheld the corona was con-

stantly visible it shot out gigantic tongues of daz-
zling flame in all directions

my contemplation of the heavens was interrupted by
a cheery good morning boys from the pro-
fessor who had just awakened

  good morning i questioned arent you a bit
too soon it cant be much after midnight youve
been asleep for an hour or so

  pardon me my boy but there you are sadly mis-
taken i am positive that i have slept at least eight
hours otherwise i should certainly not feel as re-
freshed as i do at present

  i hate to contradict you professor but heres once
i can prove you are wrong until just a few minutes
ago i kept my eye on the earth almost constantly
and i know it hasnt moved much take a look your-
self and youll see that we are still over the center
of asia if we had been away as long as eight hours
the earth would have made one-third of a rotation-
which would have made the entire atlantic ocean
visible to us now will you admit for once that
you are wrong

  it was a disrespectful thing for me to say but i
couldnt resist the chance to gloat over the professor
who had so many times shown me up as an ignoramus
but as usaul he had a come-back and as usual i
was quite properly and deservedly squelched

  he glanced through one of the rear windows and
said its impossible to tell what portion of the earths
surface is turned toward us now but its just as likely
as not to be the atlantic ocean since its completely
obscured by clouds and fogs

  i looked and what he said was true

  my gosh i wailed even the elements are
conspiring to make a simp out of me but ill leave it
to charley whether you slept eight hours or less than
one hour

  id guess about five hours but it might have been
eight he repudiated me

  whats the use i gave in you win ill have
to quit

  that being the case suppose we eat breakfast
the professor handed us each a stick of chocolate
and a small bottle of reddish brown liquid which he
said contained concentrated nourishment sufficient to
sustain the human body at maximum efficiency for
at least twenty-four hours

  we ate and drank in silence after which banning
said i think you two youngsters had better lie down
and get some sleep theres nothing to do and the
more we sleep the less food well need

  this sounded sensible so i lay down and had no
sooner closed my eyes than the mysterious glue of
which stevenson speaks slipped in between the lids
and i drifted off into the sea of sleep

  the most ridiculous and preposterous dream popped
into my head i was in an open birch bark canoe
paddling for dear life in the interstellar space after
an interminable length of time i finally reached
the planet mars which i found entirely deserted and
uninhabited i pitched a tent and spent a restless
night on mars after exploring this planet for about
a week i again embarked in my space flying canoe
and paddled millions of miles until i reached venus
in this way i journeyed from one heavenly body to
another spending several days on some and months
on others i finally turned the prow of my craft
toward the earth but on the way i ran afoul of the
moon and found to my dismay that i could neither
get to the moon nor away from it no matter how
furiously i paddled and steered my canoe continued to


amazing stories quarterly

circle the moon at last i realized with horror that
my boat had become a satellite of the moon doomed
to continue whirling around it through eternity

  i woke with a start to find myself floating in mid-
air and bumping against the ceiling of the cabin
the professor grasped my leg and pulled me back
to the floor

  how long do you think youve been asleep he
asked

  at least two years i answered

  he thought i was trying to be smart and to ridicule
him until i told him about my dream then he
laughed youve been sleeping less than five minutes
this i know positively because i started counting my
pulse the moment you lay down when i reached
 which would make it a trifle over four minutes
you began to wave your arms around and to kiek
until you managed to get up in the air about some-
thing i woke you immediately so you see it couldnt
have taken very long however this is an excellent
illustration of how indefinite and unreliable our con-
ceptions of time are unless we have some standard or
form by which to measure it

  but how in the world did i get to floating up there
by the ceiling

  that is because now that you are away from the
earths gravitational field your body has practically
no weight about the only gravity that is acting on
us now is the attraction of the airplane itself for
our bodies i have tried to put as much weight as
possible under the floor of the cabin but it isnt
enough to exert a very stong attraction especially
when our bodies are moved even a short distance away
from the floor as long as we dont take long steps
or make any sudden motions we ought not to have
any difficulty however

  but now that youve gotten that dream out of
your system suppose you go back to sleep

  i followed the professors suggestion

chapter xii

the turning point

there was little or no variety in the events
which happened during the long period imme-
diately following our first night in the really
great open spaces

  berghlin and i slept and ate when professor ban-
ning told us to sometimes the days seemed sur-
prisingly short to me and at other times they seemed
interminably long but i had learned my lesson and
no more did i offer any protests or suggestions re-
garding professor bannings methods of estimating
time

  meanwhile the moon continued to grow larger and
the earth smaller at last we came so close to our
satellite that it nearly filled the entire expanse of sky
ahead of us

  isnt there a danger that well fall right into the
moon i asked the professor one day

  there might be if we didnt do something to pre-
vent a catastrophe like that it all depends on our
velocity and on the direction in which we approach
his lunar highness to be on the safe side i believe
ill give the rocket tubes another shot or two

  he made the adjustments and a moment later we
heard the fizzing sound which told us that the burning
gases were being projected through one of the tubes

  the machine veered to one side until we were fly-
ing in a direction parallel to the surface of the moon
instead of pointing directly toward it

  im going to steer in such a way that well pass

around the moon in the opposite direction from its
motion around the earth the professor explained
that will make our speed with respect to the surface
of the moon greater than if we traveled in the same
direction the moon is moving

  it wasnt long before we were close enough to the
moons surface to observe all details of its configura-
tion quite plainly and to distinguish objects even as
small as a few feet in height

  if i were writing a piece of extravagant fiction and
had the creative imagination of a jules verne or an
edgar allan poe to help me i could undoubtedly make
a fascinating and amazing chapter out of what we
were supposed to see on the moon

  i could clothe it with grotesque vegetation and peo-
ple it with preposterously queer beings i could de-
scribe the peculiar buildings and fantastic monuments
of a departed race of former inhabitants gigantic
insects and abortive monsters could be made to prowl
amid lakes of blood and mountains of glittering jewels
had there been any such freaks on the moon we could
easily have distinguished them clearly-even without
the aid of our telescope

  but whats the use of idle speculation my job is
that of a historian rather than a fabricator of color-
ful yarns-so ill have to stick to the truth much as
i regret to report them the facts concerning what we
saw on the moon were exceedingly drab and uninter-
esting

  true we did get excellent vistas of the portion of
the moon on the side away from the earth-which
never before had been seen by human eyes-but these
views were quite commonplace any astronomer-mere-
ly from logical deduction-could easily infer with rea-
sonable accuracy what the other side of the moon
looks like

  except for the natural differences in the size and
locations of the craters and ring mountains the sur-
face of the far side of the moon had practically the
same characteristics as the portion that is constantly
facing the earth-which has been repeatedly photo-
graphed and charted

  our observations verified conclusively the belief of
scientists who have become convinced that the moon
is absolutely devoid of both moisture and atmosphere
there is no life of any sort-vegetable or animal-on
the moon to live on the moon a man would have
to bring air water and food with him

  this ought to settle definitely the question some-
times brought up by some pseudo-scientific people as
to whether or not the moon is inhabited or capable
of sustaining life

  it took but a short time for us to complete the semi-
circular journey around the moon after which the pro-
fessor fired a couple of shots from the rocket tubes
and thus changed our direction until we were headed
straight toward the earth

  only a few minutes had elapsed-though the moon
was already becoming perceptibly smaller-when
berghlin suddenly exclaimed how about the photo-
graphs

  my god what a dumb-bell i am professor ban-
ning yelled it was the first time he had ever used
either profanity or slang in my presence to think
of coming clear out here with a first class camera
all ready for use and then start back without taking
a single picture weve got to go back-thats all there
is to it

  and before either the pilot or i could say another
word he had fired three more shots and our machine
was speeding -back toward the moon this time we
approached even closer than before and completely
four dimensional transit



circumnavigated the satellite following the pro-
fessors instructions i focussed the camera and clicked
the shutter as fast as i could wind up the film while
banning in the meantime was busy steering the
plane by means of the rocket tubes

  the task completed we again took leave of the moon
and started on our homeward journey during the
return journey professor banning made frequent use
of the rocket tubes-not only for changing our direc-
tion but also for accelerating our speed

  when we were about half way home a distressing
realization suddenly dawned on me which i voiced
to the professor

  it looks like were going to make it after all-but
theres one ugly fly in the ointment

  what do you mean

  bragg youve lost your  bet to him
oh lets not worry about that whats  to
a man who has been around the moon

  but i hate to think of that old blatherskite getting
any enjoyment out of spending your money

  let him enjoy it for all i care it will be nothing
compared to the pleasure ill get from knowing how
he will feel when he learns that we are back safe and
sound with a number of irrefutable photographs to
prove that weve actually made the trip around the
moon

  as we sped closer and closer toward the earth we
were like a trio of school boys who had just completed
the last stiff examination and were journeying toward
home and vacation time

  just think what a sensation well make when we
get back i said on one occasion they must have
given us up for dead long ago of course nobody
would miss me but ill bet there has been a heap of
mourning for you two-especially charley and when
we land on earth again and tell what weve done-
the folks who see and hear us just wont believe their
senses i

chapter xiii

homeward bound

nothing of special consequence happened until
we were quite close to the earth it seemed to
increase in size much more rapidly than it had
diminished on the outward journey indicating that our
speed was considerably greater this could easily be
accounted for by the extra impetus imparted by fre-
quent discharges through the rocket tubes

  as the earth loomed up until it obscured nearly all
of the sky ahead we could catch an occasional glimpse
of a patch of water or land through rifts in the
banks of cloud that enveloped the globe but we could
not get a clear enough view to identify any portion
of the earth with certainty once i felt sure that
i recognized the outlines of spain and the straits of
gibraltar and professor banning altered our course
slightly toward the direction of north america at
the same time he turned on the external lubricating
system and fired several shots through the tubes in
the forward end of the machine he explained his
reasons for doing tbis as follows

  it wont be long now before we shall enter the
more rarefied portions of the earths atmosphere just
how fast we are going now is pretty hard to estimate
but it is quite possible that if we continued at our
present velocity-even with our external lubrication in
operation-the friction caused by our passage through
the earths atmosphere would generate a terrific amount
of heat-just as it does in the case of a meteor or
falling star

  to be on the safe side i think wed better slow
down considerably the discharges through the rocket
tubes pointing straight ahead should have a powerful
braking effect reducing our speed to safe degrees

  it was a good thing he thought of this when he did
because he had hardly spoken before it began to be-
come uncomfortably warm inside the cabin indicating
that the heat of friction was even intense enough to
penetrate the special insulation

  with the sweat streaming from his forehead pro-
fessor banning directed a continuous stream of burn-
ing gases through the forward tubes finally the
temperature began to fall again showing that the
crisis had passed and that disaster had been averted
through the resourcefulness and quick thinking of
our learned commander

  by this time berghlin had taken his place at the
controls

  turn on the motor and lets see what happens
banning directed

  an instant later we heard the welcome hum of the
engine as if the entire performance were part of a
great preordained comic play the clouds beneath us
parted and we found ourselves flying over a landscape
that looked like paradise to us

  the gulf of mexico berghlin yelled i know
where i am now by ginger leave it to me to find
my way home

  down down we slid at a dizzy angle until we
reached an altitude of approximately thirty thousand
feet after which we straightened out and headed in
a bee line for the west

  it seemed but an hour or so before we saw the
familiar glint of the pacific in the distance to
slacken speed somewhat and to prepare for a landing
the professor instructed me to adjust the four dimen-
sional rudder in such a way as to bring the plane
back into three dimensional space

  the skid which accompanied this maneuver was
considerably more severe than on any previous occa-
sion but though we spun like a windmill for several
seconds our pilot finally righted the plane

  theres one good thing he shouted this time
we wont be bothered by a crowd because they cant
possibly be expecting us now

  in this however berghlin was wrong

  for some unaccountable reason there were three
airplanes hovering over the landing field as we sped
toward san diego they must have sighted us and
recognized the spirit of youth because two of them
flew toward us while the other descended apparently
to carry the news of our arrival to the officials on
the ground

  the escorts sent to greet us circled and attempted
to accompany us but we were miles beyond them be-
fore they had time to turn

  when we came within sight of the airport we
were astonished to discern thousands of jostling mill-
ing human beings tightly packed around the edges
of the field a space had been roped off and a num-
ber of men in uniform were trying to keep the crowd
in check just as we were on the point of landing the
mob broke through the ropes and quickly swarmed
over most of the field

  with his usual skill and resourcefulness berghlin
checked his downward plunge just in time and zoomed
up to a safer altitude after circling the field several
times vainly hoping that the crowd would have sense
enough to clear a space large enough for him to land
he finally spied a small patch of open ground in one
corner shut off from the rest of the field by a line
of parked automobiles
ss

  barely grazing the tops of the cars he made a
beautiful landing bringing the spirit of youth to rest
with the propeller but a few inches from a barbed
wire fence

  in an instant the crowd was around us and our
ears were almost deafened by the most raucous con-
glomeration of cheers yells laughter-and even
weeping

  berghlin was the first to step out of the cabin
with characteristic sang froid he said sorry were
late folks you see we got a little bit oft our course
and took a trip around the moon before we found our
way back again

the few persons who heard this remark were prob-
ably too excited to pay much attention to lis
amazing announcement even if they heard and under-
stood they undoubtedly took it as a joke

  before either of us could utter another word we
found ourselves being carried around the field on the
shoulders of hysterical men and women finally the
police came to our rescue and escorted us into the
office of the airport where berghlin went through
the customary routine of signing in as he was filling
out his report he asked one of the officials what
time is it my watch is stopped

  exactly five forty-seven

  and whats the date

  june sixteenth of course

  june sixteenth berghlin ejaculated are you
trying to kid me

  certainly not thats the right date if you dont
believe me theres the calendar he indicated a huge
figure sixteen printed on a card which hung on the
wall

  you mean to say weve only been away for a day
less than a day seventeen hours and forty-three
minutes to be exact

  if you say so i suppose you know what youre
talking about i cant begin to understand it-but
if what you say is true then professor banning has
won his bet with bragg

  why of course youve won what do you think
all the celebrating is about

  well ill be horns waggled

  just then banning leaned over and whispered some-
thing in berghlins ear he also gripped my arm be-
fore i had time to say anything and in a low quiet
tone he admonished me lets not tell them anything
about the trip around the moon yet without the
proper preparation im afraid the true story will only
bring us ridicule

  thats why you havent read anything in the news-
papers about the extra journey we took around the
earths satellite

  on the suggestion of professor banning and with
the consent of colonel berghlin i was appointed the
historian of our expedition

  fearing that the narration of adventures as extraor-
dinary as ours might seem impossible and ludicrous
to the rank and file of newspaper subscribers we de-
cided not to give it to the daily press

  instead we agreed to submit this official account to
a publication which appeals only to readers of more
than average intelligence-readers who are progressive
and open minded and are accustomed to judging the
verisimilitude of amazing stories

  so to you who are now reading these lines is
granted the first privilege of learning the true facts
regarding the spirit of youth and her remarkable
journey

chapter xiv

professor banning explains

as soon as we had completed the customary for-
malities at the san diego airport bryan said
to us you fellows must be pretty well fagged
better let me drive you to your hotel

  neither of us had the nerve to tell him that we
actually thought we had been away for over a month
and that each of us-in imagination at least-had
enjoyed more than thirty full nights of slumber we
did want to be alone however for there was much
to talk about

  when at last everybody had left and the three of
us were closeted in bannings room i broke out
well professor so far youve been able to account
for everything that has happened in a satisfactory
way but now you sure have a lot of tall explaining
to do

  just let me have a pencil a scrap of paper and
about five minutes and i think i can explain every-
thing in such a way that it will be as clear as the
road to the moon

  in the first place let me remind you that when we
shot off into hyper-space after leaving shanghai we
had for the moment turned the nose of our plane
toward the east that gave us the benefit of the mo-
tion due to the rotation of the earth ive already
explained this to you but what i didnt mention before
is that during the few seconds prior to our extended
projection into the fourth dimension we were also
traveling in a direction which gave us the added
momentum due to the revolution of the earth about
the sun

  you will also recall that after detaching ourselves
from three dimensional space we made a hair-pin
turn which brought us around so we were moving
in the opposite direction do you happen to know how
fast the earth moves around the sun

  not off-hand i admitted but i think i can
figure it out-approximately at least i know that
the distance between the earth and the sun is about
ninety-three million miles and that the orbit of the
earth though elliptical is near enough to a circle
so that if we multiply the radius by two pi or six
point twenty-eight well get the approximate circum-
ference of the earths orbit without multiplying it
out id guess that this will give us something under
six hundred million miles all we have to do is
divide this by the number of hours in a year and
the result will be the speed with which the earth re-
volves around the sun

  very good the professor commended and to
save you the time it would take to do all that cal-
culating ill tell you right now that the earth and the
moon together travel around the sun at the rate of
eighteen and one-half miles per second or sixty-three
thousand miles per hour

  another thing that helped us was that the moon
at that particular time was on the side of the earth
away from the direction of rotation when we left
the earth we were traveling at the rate of about sixty-
three thousand miles per hour in the opposite direc-
tion from that in which the earth was moving while
the moon was shooting toward us-also with a speed
of about sixty-three thousand miles per hour

  if we had continued at the same speed without
any loss of momentum we would have approached
the moon at the terrific speed of one hundred and
twenty-six thousand miles per hour

  since the moon is only  miles from the
earth it would have taken us less than two hours to
four dimensional transit



reach the moon at that rate in actuality it took us a
trifle more than two hours since we lost some of our
speed in making the turn and in getting away from
the earths gravitational pull

  when we circled the moon we still retained almost
all of our original momentum of somewhat over sixty
thousand miles per hour which i nearly doubled by
means of charges shot through the rocket tubes
though the trip back seemed to be faster it really
took us about twice as long or over four hours be-
cause then we were moving in the same direction as
the earth and had to consume a lot of our speed in
our efforts to overtake the earth does that make
everything clear

  i guess so i hesitated that seems to account
for the possibility of our making the trip in such a
remarkably short time-but how about the me we
thought it took i can easily understand how we could
make a mistake of an hour or so-or even two or
three days-in estimating the time that was elapsing
but to be convinced that over a month was passing
when it really was only about six hours-i dont see
how the dickens that could possibly happen

  if youll stop to think a minute the professor re-
joined i believe you will be able to explain that your-
self remember the dream you told me about in
which you took a trip through the universe which you
thought must have consumed several years it seemed
real to you while you were dreaming didnt it yet
the entire dream lasted but a few minutes

  i suppose i may as well confess now and tell you
that-in the interests of psychological research-i
played a little trick on you and berghlin

  during the excitement just before we left shanghai
i managed to doctor up the timepieces we had with
us so they wouldnt run i did this by the simple
expedient of passing a strong magnet a few times
across the faces of your watches and our chronometer
this magnetized the mainspring and all steel parts
and put them out of commission

  unknown to you however i kept tabs on the time
by means of my old time-piece with which i didnt tam-
per of course i had this watch in my vest pocket all
the time and consulted it repeatedly while you and
berghlin were looking out of the window then by
the power of suggestion i made both of you thinlc
that several weeks were passing

  what happened proves pretty conclusively i think
the hypothesis that once we are removed from the
physical means for measuring or estimating time our
conceptions of the duration of given intervals are
absolutely inaccurate and undependable under such
circumstances a second may seem like a year and a
year may seem like a second

  just a minute berghlin interposed let me get
this thing straight do you mean to say that you
put our timepieces out of commission purposely

  the professor nodded

  and then you kidded us into eating our meals only
five minutes apart and taking our nights sleep at
intervals of half an hour or so in such a way that
we were following our ordinary daily routine

  another nod

  i might be willing to grant the possibility of the
sleeping part of it-but how in the world could our
digestive systems take care of so much food

  you will remember that most of the so-called food
i gave you was in liquid form i told you it was a
very concentrated form of nourishment as a matter
of fact it was nothing more than water with a little
coloring matter and a dash or two of epsom salts
mixed with it

 then you mean to say that the trip which we
thought was taking over a month really consumed
only a few hours

  thats precisely what happened the professor
admitted but remember boys i did all that in tho
interests of psychological research

  all berghlin could say to that was

  well ill be honiswaggled

  the end

ncredible cried captain cavendish as
he paced nervously from one side of his
cabin to the other i tell you jopplin that
such a thing is wholly unbelievable no
man mad or sane can accomplish the im-
possible and this he continued almost angrily is
not only an impossibility it is a rank absurdity at
absurdity which you professor as a man of science
should be the first to repudiate

  professor jopplin gazed meditatively at the ceiling
for a moment in silence when at last he spoke his
voice was low and decisive

  that the extraordinary news we have just received
is indeed incredible i readily admit and my personal
attitude is far from being one of belief and yet he
continued as if speaking for himself as a man of
science i cannot honestly pronounce it impossible per-
haps this word like so many others is just another
name for our own ignorance no my friend i regret
to say that i am unable to share your certainty
when confronted with the actual science while it may
observe cannot deny

  for a moment it seemed as if the captain could
hardly credit his own hearing then as the full im-
port of the others words took possession of his mind
his bronzed countenance changed to an unnatural pallor

  jopplin he exclaimed tensely my god you can-
not mean    you who are universally recognized
as one of the foremost scientists of the age you whose
simple word would be sufficient to prevent a needless
panic throughout the
whole world you henry
jopplin of all men can-
not be in earnest when
you say that this thing is
possible

  old friend replied
the other not without
emotion i am after all
only a man my word is
not infallible you must
believe me when i tell
you that for the present

i am as completely in the
dark as yourself how-
ever i am now going to
work fortunately the
necessary reference books
are in my trunk you
will see that i am not
disturbed in an hour
at the most you will
have my answer and professor jopplin disappeared
in the direction of his own cabin

  for several moments captain cavendish continued to
pace the floor his long deeply wrinkled face betraying
his anxiety and indecision finally seating himself at
his desk he picked up the scattered papers which lay
before him glancing hurriedly through them he
chose one and read

  secret of the stars at last
  discovered by science
  long sought source of stellar radiation
  revealed in sub-atomic energy scientists
  claim latest discovery may revolution-
  ize life upon earth

   london sept -the mystery of the stars has at
last been solved by man through a series of brilliant
investigations covering a period of sixteen years pro-
fessor ivan teranhoff of the university of moscow
has discovered the existence of a force immeasurably
greater than anything hitherto known to science the
name of this stupendous power whose existence has
long been suspected is sub-atomic energy

    as scientists have long been aware stellar evolution
is carried on by chemical reactions which due to the
enormous temperatures existing within stars have
heretofore proved incapable of duplication in terrestrial
laboratories these chemical reactions are as we now
know nothing else than the transmutation of one ele-
ment into another according to professor teranhoff
hydrogen the chief element found in nebulae and stars
in early stages of evolution is unquestionably the basic
element from which all others are eventually evolved

   however in the course of this evolution of the hy-
drogen atom into heavier and more complex elements
a certain amount of energy is liberated this same
terrific power which is inconceivably greater than that
of the most powerful explosives known to man has
been experimentally released by the russian scientist
by subjecting small quantities of specially prepared or

activated hydrogen to
conditions analagous to
those found in stars of
spectral class a and b-
that is to say a vacuum
with the highest possible
temperature

 this remarkable
achievement has needless
to say been the cause of
the greatest excitement
throughout scientific cir-
cles in all parts of the
world while the effect
of the discovery upon
economic and industrial
problems cannot as yet be
predicted many promi-
nent physicists and chem-
ists have expressed the
opinion that sub-atomic

 ere is a story which we recommend warm-
 ly to you it has a number of new angles
 that we know you will enjoy greatly we
 all know that we are held doivn to earth
 by the indefinite something which we term
 gravitation we also know that if the
 earth were spinning about seven times
 faster than it does now gravitation around
 the equator would be nil and we would all
 be sailing into space the present story is
 based in part upon these premises  is all
 good science and the author of the lost
 comet has made good use of this idea

energy will eventually
bring about radical and revolutionary changes in living
conditions upon the earth

   that said captain cavendish thoughtfully was
the beginning and would to god he continued it
were also the end after a momentary pause he took
up another of the papers from the heap before him
turned a few pages in a methodical manner and con-
tinued reading

amazing stories quarterly

  strange rumors afloat re-
  garding well known scientist
  sudden disappearance of discoverer of
  sub-atomic energy causes much anxiety
  among colleagues sinister motive be-
  hind teranhoffs discovery now suspected

  london sept -the sudden disappearance of
professor ivan teranhoff the discoverer of sub-atomic
energy still continues a mystery and all attempts to
ascertain his whereabouts or determine the cause of his
absence have proved unsuccessful

  many strange rumors however are now afloat re-
garding the motives behind the scientists researches
as well as the reason for his disappearance in fact
it is suggested although without tangible foundation
that teranhoff who is known to be interested in tlie
subject of interplanetary travel discovered sub-atomic
energy with the sole purpose of utilizing it as a hiv-
ing power in ultra-terrestrial locomotion a strange
corroboration of this theory is said to be furnished
by the fact that a large metal sphere which the pro-
fessor had recently completed from a small model of
what he termed a space-ship has vanished as com-
pletely and mysteriously as its eccentric owner

  but the wildest rumor of all which would be de-
cidedly sinister if it were not so utterly incredible
is that professor teranhoff in company with two as-
sistants has sailed perhaps in the space-ship itself
for some region situated near the equator with the
intention of accelerating the rotation of the earth
by means of sub-atomic energy to such a degree as
to launch his celestial bark into interstellar space
the source of this preposterous story is not known

  scientists while concerned over the professors dis-
appearance are unanimous in considering the space-
ship idea as a hoax perpetrated by some pseudo-
philosopher with a mistaken sense of humor

  mistaken sense of humor indeed cried cavendish
to himself as he glanced impatiently from the printed
sheet to the message he had received but a few mo-
ments before by wireless these words he felt that
he would never forget they were stamped indelibly
on his mind

chapter ii

the lithuania queen of the orange star line
was already four and a half days out from new
york bound for valparaiso before leaving port
captain cavendish had received the first intelligence
of the strange events which were now so rapidly and
ominously reaching their culmination for over four
days he had received no information upon the rus-

sians activities aside from that contained in the out-
of-date new york papers then  miles off the
coast of panama already in  north latitude he had
received the warning vessels remaining within ten
degrees of equator will meet with almost certain
destruction

  what could it mean had the world indeed gone
mad and the impossible come to pass could the earth
a body weighing six sextillion tons be lightly tossed
about and changed at the caprice of a madman all
the orderly inexorable laws of nature seemed to pro-
test against the possibility of such an occurrence

  no time to lose captain

  captain cavendish looked up hurriedly before him
stood the thin form of professor henry jopplin whose
strangely bright eyes and flushed cheeks betrayed an
unwonted state of animation

  no time to lose he repeated evenly the lith-
uania must make port at once even now i doubt
if we shall have sufficient time

  are you serious jopplin replied the captain
searching the others face doubtfully do you fully
realize the importance of what you are saying

  my answer said the professor slowly is before
you although this is hardly a time for lengthy ex-
planations upon abstract principles of science i can-
not but sympathize with your attitude consequently
my friend i shall endeavor as briefly as possible to
unfold to you the conclusion which my hurried and
imperfect investigation has revealed

  laplace continued jopplin warming to his sub-
ject left the world a much greater contribution than
either he or his contemporaries realized as a system
of cosmogony the nebular hypothesis is untenable
as a model of celestial travel it is superb that this
fact should have been overlooked by the scientific
world for over a century is almost unbelievable the
principle of conservation of angular momentum which
was sound in  is equally so today moreover
when centripetal and centrifugal force are exactly
balanced gravity as you know ceases if instead of
rotating upon its axis once in twenty-four hours the
earth should complete its rotation in one hour and
twenty-five minutes what would happen to objects
situated at the equator such objects would as you
have no doubt already surmised remain utterly devoid
of weight until such time as the rotation became
slower and centrifugal force diminished but let us
assume that the contrary should take place and in-
stead of decreasing centrifugal force should increase
then what would be the result there my good
friend you have a clear theoretical possibility of
ultra-terrestrial locomotion assuming the proper con-
ditions it is theoretically possible for any object no
matter how great its weight to leave the earths sur-
face without the slightest danger or difficulty

  now to an investigator possessing the scientific
ability of teranhoff such an obvious principle of
mechanics could not have long remained unnoticed
but as he himself must have realized terrestrial
chemistry offered nothing that could even approximate
to the results he desired terrestrial analogy afforded
no solution so teranhoff quite logically took his
model from the stars regarding the nature of sub-
atomic energy-whose development would be a most
glorious achievement in the proper hands-i have no
first-hand knowledge yet by means of theoretical con-
siderations i have already formed some idea of the
extent of its power and assuming that the proper
methods were employed i have no doubt that the
earth stupendous as its weight appears to our minds
could be either retarded or accelerated at will
when the world went mad



  so much for theoretical considerations but the
facts of the case are that the matter is no longer in
the domain of theory captain cavendish ten minutes
ago i made an observatioon of the suns position
the rotation of this planet upon its axis has already
been accelerated nearly an hour

  the captains air of incredulity had now disap-
peared with blanched face and trembling hands he
turned to the speaking-tube at his side when at
length he again faced the scientist his gaze was sup-
plicating pathetic

  jopplin he cried suddenly what will happen to
the sea

               chapter iii

the message which had startled the captain of
the lithuania had produced identical effects in
hundreds of ships on both sides of the equator
on some ships the warning had met with utter in-
credulity and their captains had continued their courses
unchanged believing the whole affair to be either an
ill-timed joke or the result of superstitious credulity on
the part of the ecuadorian officials others possess-
ing greater respect for the possibilities of twentieth
century science had steered for the nearest port hop-
ing to receive more complete information upon their
arrival

  in the meantime the report had reached washing-
ton the naval authorities while in the main skepti-
cal were nevertheless sufficiently concerned to start an
immediate investigation instructions to the national
observatory were dispatched at once unfortunately
however the sky was heavily overcast and in conse-
quence neither solar nor sideral observations could be
made accordingly an official telegram was immedi-
ately sent to the mount wilson observatory in cali-
fornia where a clear sky was virtually certain to be
found

  but before the california astronomers had time to
reply the boyden station branch of the harvard ob-
servatory situated in the southern hemisphere had
already spoken the authoritative tone of its message
left no room for doubt

  it was a fact incredible as it appeared the earth
was actually increasing its rotational speed science
which had hitherto been mans chief benefactor was
no longer merely a useful servant it had now become
master of the earth not metaphorically but in grim
earnest in a few short hours indifferent humanity
would at last be brought face to face with the terrible
grandeur of mans greatest creation science had in-
deed mastered the earth but in doing so if had little
regard for the planets tiny inhabitants the biped
organisms called humanity

  at every street corner the stupendous news was
being bhouted newspapers proclaimed it in three-

inch headlines and extra editions wires and cables
transmitted it across continents and oceans yet out-
side of purely scientific circles no one seemed to
have any clear idea of what was taking place to the
layman centrifugal force and sub-atomic energy were
only names-vague incomprehensible terms lying far
beyond his everyday experience yet the very sound
of the unfamiliar words was sufficient to awaken a
strange foreboding sense of dread

  even the worlds greatest physicists and astronomers
acknowledged themselves unable to make definite asser-
tions general forecasts of course could be made
gravity for instance would be reduced in effect
everywhere except at the poles the weight of objects
varying according to their distance from the equator
weight and monetary systems would become obsolete
overnight time so far as the old method of reckon-
ing was concerned would be annihilated the sun
would rise in the east only to rush madly across the
sky and set almost as soon as its presence was felt
the seas drawn irresistibly toward their common cen-
ter of attraction upon the equator would meet with 
titanic fury inevitably destroying everything in their
path-ships islands and even continents-all would
be as one before the monster which was even now
being loosed in short the world it seemed was
going mad

  it was at first thught that an attempt should be
made to send airplanes over the suspected zone in
order to locate the scene of teranhoffs activities and
with this object in view an air squadron-armed with
complete bombing equipment and furnished with special
impellers and built-in superchargers to withstand low
atmospheric pressures-was hurriedly dispatched from
panama all this however required time and in the
meanwhile gravity was alarmingly decreasing and not
only was gravity decreasing but the day was rapidly
advancing although at washington the sun which
was now breaking through the clouds was already
past the meridian it was not yet ten oclock as reck-
oned by the chronometer

  such were the first precursors of the terrible and
devastating events which were to follow it is doubt-
ful whether people fully realized at the time what
these curious happenings actually portended indeed
considering the suddenness with which the catastrophe
had come upon them their almost apathetic indifference
to their fate is not surprising and for many mil-
lions of the earths inhabitants the absence of such
realization proved a blessing in disguise-a merciful
anaesthetic which dulled the awful reality of the blow
that was to fall   

 chapter iv

as professor jopplin stood upon the deck of the
swiftly moving lithuania he meditated silently
upon the chain of circumstances which had
brought him so close to the scene of the most momen-
tous experiment ever attempted in the history of
science already at the age of forty-five recognized
as one of the worlds foremost authorities upon astro-
physics the scientist had sailed from new york to
collaborate in a series of investigations about to be
commenced in the southern hemisphere by the chilean
government

  now however his thoughts were far away from the
original purpose of his trip henry jopplin would
never have given his consent to an experiment carried
out at the risk of a single human life but as a true
man of science it was impossible for him not to ex-
perience a keen sense of professional curiosity in the
stupendous achievement of the russian scientist ter-

anhoff the professor reflected was undoubtedly a
heartless fanatic perhaps even a madman but there
was nothing wrong with his science despite his fan-
aticism the man was clearly no mere empirical dabbler
but a genius combining mathematical theory with in-
telligent experimentation and that his latest experi-
ment would prove only too successful jopplin now had
no doubt

  the lithuania her mighty engines running at their
full capacity was already in sight of the panama coast
nor had the professors desire for speed been without
cause the sea which during the earlier part of the
day had been usually calm had now completely altered
and from the east came a wind which threatened soon
to become cyclonic in its fury

  an hour later the lithuania riding safely at anchof
professor jopplin was seated before the chief military
officer at colon owing to his reputation the scientist
had encountered no difficulty in obtaining the informa-
tion he desired the officer was now informing him of
the measures which had already been taken in wash-
ington of the observational data which were rapidly be-
ing accumulated and finally of the air squadron that
had departed but a short time before

  jopplin listened to the steady voice of the officer me-
chanically a far-off look in his eyes suddenly his ex-
pression changed the thin countenance revealing a new
resolution

  commandant said the scientist hurriedly can you
spare one more plane

  but - stammered the other visibly astonished

you cannot possibly mean to say-

  exactly snapped jopplin in a tone which was
strangely reminiscent of the laboratory that is pre-
cisely my intention of course he added quickly you
will understand that i am not an aviator an oper-
tor will be necessary may i have your answer at
once

  professor jopplin replied the officer clearly grop-
ing for words in your capacity as a man of science
i have no doubt of your ability but the present situa-
tion appears to me to call for prompt and drastic mili-
tary action rather than for scientific speculation be-
sides he added thoughtfully the risk-

  the risk sir interrupted jopplin visibly stung by
the others attitude will be no greater for me than for
some hundreds of millions of this planets inhabitants
moreover i consider your forces utterly incompetent to
deal with the man against whom they have been sent
this man he continued not without a touch of pro-
fessional pride whatever his faults may be is a real
scientist even though your men should through the
merest accident succeed in killing him they cannot
check the forces he has set loose only one power could
have effected the terrible changes that are now taking
place only one power can stop them that power sir
is science

professor jopplin won his case a half hour
later seated in the after cockpit of a bombing
plane specially constructed for high altitude flying he
watched the narrow strip of land dividing the two
great oceans gradually recede from sight there was no
death-dealing instrument of modern warfare grasped
in the scientists hand his thin hawk-like fingers held
a small and well worn notebook the leaves of which he
vainly endeavored to prevent from being whipped to
and fro by the ever-increasing wind yet oblivious to
all henry jopplin figured on stimulated by the desper-
ate nature of his mission and strangely exhilarated
by the swift motion of the plane he seemed to experi-

ence all the joy of the mathematician whose goal is
already in sight

  at length the long southwestern coast of columbia
came into view the aviator was now directing the
plane inland at the same time increasing its altitude
in preparation for the great mountain ranges which
would soon be encountered

  in another hour jopplin saw that they had already
passed the ecuadorian frontier below were spread out
the snow-capped peaks of the andes and among them
as if surrounded by a diadem of sparkling diamonds
could be discerned the city of quito the ecuadorian
capital

  at the scientists suggestion the pilot decreased the
machines speed and circled over the picturesque city
of the andes that a state of unwonted excitement
reigned among the inhabitants was now clear and
then a strange thing happened startled by the sound
of a muffled detonation toward the east the scientist
turned to see two army planes circling about the sum-
mit of a broken cliff far in the distance

  my god exclaimed the pilot excitedly theyve
found him

  hardly had the words been uttered when a thin
bluish ray of light leaped suddenly from the earth
striking the lower machine for a moment the plane
appeared to be suspended lifeless in the air suddenly
without warning it was seen to crumple and a second
later only a charred and twisted mass was plunging to
the ground not the slightest noise accompanied its
destruction

  the other plane now warned of its danger sped
swiftly from the scene only to reappear a few mo-
ments later at a higher altitude circling above the
region of the disaster the aviator carefully took aim
and released the deadly missile at his side a few sec-
onds later the air was split by a terrific concussion
and the great cliff itself seemed to shake visibly at
the impact

  good lord cried jopplin tensely they shouldnt
do that once that teranhoff and his secret are de-
stroyed all hope for the world will be lost

  look shrieked the pilot his bloodless face turned
once more in the direction of the circling plane

  for the space of a moment jopplin saw nothing
except a momentary spurt of blue as the seconds
sped by he doubted if this second discharge of the
strange destroyer could have taken effect watching
intently through his binoculars he saw a curious
change come over the suspended plane it did not
seem to move a thing wholly inanimate quite sud-
denly all the fabric of the machine seemed to dis-
solve into nothingness leaving a bare horribly distorted
frame the aviator had completely vanished yet the
disabled frame-work remained suspended in mid-air

  the thing was astounding incredible nevertheless it
was a fact his eyes were not deceiving him the
crumbled hideous thing that had once been a delicately
wrought mechanism and human flesh was hanging un-
supported in the atmosphere twenty-five thousand feet
above the level of the sea for an instant jopplins
brain reeled madly then the man of science reappeared
figuring hurriedly in his notebook his bewilderment
gave way to understanding with blanched face he
turned suddenly to his companion the time has come
what i have been expecting has at last come to pass
there is no time for delay we must land immediately
if we are ever to touch the earths surface again

  at first the pilot did not understand then as the
truth gradually dawned upon him his terror-stricken
countenance betrayed the fact that reason had de-
parted from his already over-taxed brain with a
when the world went mad



piercing cry of fear and madness the aviator jerked
loose the belt that held him and jumped wildly from
the plane

  stunned and bewildered by the rash act of his com-
panion the professor gazed mechanically at the void
below shuddering involuntarily at the thought of the
madmans fate then struck by a sudden thought he
looked behind him the man had not fallen but re-
mained suspended in the air as the scientist realized
the others real fate he shuddered even more violently
than before

   but in another instant all thoughts were driven sud-
denly from his mind the plane by some freak of
chance was headed directly for the spot where the
strange battle had occurred but a few moments be-
fore driven by its own motive power the machine
was able to overcome the inertia which had already
overtaken the inanimate bodies overhead

  professor jopplin was no aeronaut and as he was
already directed toward the one spot in the world that
he wished to reach he made no attempt to control the
machines course moreover due to the almost total
absence of gravity his descent was far from being
precipitous describing a long majestic curve the
plane scraped against the side of a huge boulder
careened drunkenly upon its side and finally came
to rest to the scientist it seemed as if the earth it-
self was coming up to meet him-a shock a crash-
and then oblivion   

when jopplin regained consciousness he was
aware of the sound of voices bruised and
shaken he lay half supported by a crumbling wall of
rock which he surmised was hiding him from the
speakers upon the other side the american listened
intently recognizing the language to be russian al-
though possessing some knowledge of that tongue the
meaning of what was being said came to him only in
fragments yes that was it something about a sphere
the man had undoubtedly mentioned a sphere the
professor recalled the accounts he had read in the
papers the sphere he decided could be no other
than the space-ship whose launching was to cost the
earth so dearly

   in another moment however all doubt was dispelled
cautiously raising himself to a better position the
scientist peered through a small opening among the
rocks before him extending for a distance of per-
haps four hundred feet was a level surface of pure
rock resting motionless upon an elevated steel sup-
port not more than a hundred feet away loomed a
huge metallic object whose form closely resembled that
of a prolate spheroid not the slightest sign of the
speakers however was visible

  greatly puzzled jopplin gazed attentively at the
scene before him suddenly one of the voices spoke
again a single passage stood out clearly

  my friends the voice was saying the time for
which we have been so long preparing has at last ar-
rived my last observation shows that at the end of
fifteen minutes gravity at the equator will have prac-
tically ceased you know what this means every-
thing within the ship is in order only one thing re-
mains to be done-to impart to the ship its initial
momentum to you comrade morensky shall fall the
honor of liberating the force which is to set in mo-
tion the most stupendous enterprise that has even been
undertaken by man let us drink my friends to the
success of our journey and also to the memory of a
dying world

   as the full import of this last sentence became clear
to the professors mind a look of mingled awe and

wonder spread over his countenance the speaker
whom the american believed to be no other than teran-
hoff himself could have meant only one thing that
the rotational acceleration which was even now
causing tremendous upheavals upon the earth would
have no end once safely launched into space and their
goal attained the occupants of the spheroid would
leave the world to its own fate the unknown mech-
anism which they had set into operation would con-
tinue its deadly work unchecked in less than an hour
nearly half of the worlds inhabitants would be the
victims of a fate infinitely more dreadful than had
ever been conceived by a dante or a milton

  involuntarily the american shuddered and an icy
chill seemed to be clutching at his heart slowly the
thin features of americas foremost astrophysicist be-
came hard and grim and into his clear gray eyes came
an expression which had never been seen in classroom
or laboratory

  in another moment he was startled by the sudden
appearance of two men who were standing at a dis-
tance of only six feet from the protecting wall an
instant later the mystery of their appearance was dis-
pelled by the emergence of a third man from behind
a sudden turn in the ledge which the professor sup-
posed to lead into some natural passageway beneath
the surface

  with quick strides the three russians advanced to-
ward the metal sphere the surface of which they in-
stantly subjected to a rapid examination apparently
satisfied with the result of their scrutiny one of the
men turned a small lever attached to the side of the
ship at his touch what appeared to be a panel swung
open disclosing an aperture just suffciently large to
admit the passage of a man without a moments
hesitation or a backward glance the men entered into
the interior of the ship in another instant the panel
had closed behind them and to all outward appear-
ances everything remained the same as before

  slowly the moments passed and jopplins impatience
became almost unbearable with the suspense then
with a sudden start he realized that the base of the
ship was no longer resting upon its support next pro-
pelled by its steady growing momentum the sphere
was now a hundred feet in the air as the rate of re-
cession increased the shining object disk-like as it
rose into space grew rapidly smaller in another mo-
ment only a tiny dark speck was visible in the sky
the space-ship had at last started upon its journey

chapter v

on the afternoon of september th  the city
of quito ecuador was visited by a series of
phenomena never paralleled in the history of the
earth although warning of the impending catastrophe
had been broadcast throughout the civilized world only
the higher classes of the ecuadorian capital had been
able to realize the full significance of the russian
scientists experiment the disaster consequently fell
upon a populace almost wholly unprepared

  the first warnings of what was to follow were so
inappreciable in their effects as to cause but little
anxiety in fact the peoples only sensation was one
of strange exhilaration and vigor even the heaviest
labor could be done with an amazingly small amount of
exertion children found running and jumping pecu-
liarly attractive small boys and girls could be seen
traversing the most prodigious distances with leaps
and bounds sometimes rising several feet above the
ground to the ignorant these manifestations while
curious offered no special cause for alarm

as time went by however this feeling of lightness

grew less agreeable in fact even the most thought-
less began to realize that after all weight may be an
excellent thing drivers of automobiles soon discov-
ered that it was virtually impossible for their machines
to hold the road in all parts of the city tramcars
were leaving the rails horse-drawn vehicles also
were not immune to the mysterious influence and the
sight of madly galloping steeds rising from six to
eight feet in the air after every step was sufficiently
startling to arouse even the indifferent latins from
their traditional apathy finally after the occurrence
of several serious accidents all traffic was suspended
by order of the authorities

  further developments of the phenomena were not
long in making themselves felt as the wind which
had been blowing steadily from the east increased in
violence strange things began to happen newspapers
hats and parasols were snatched from their owners
and carried to unprecedented heights and never re-
turned the atmosphere overhead was now darkened
with flying objects of every description loose boards
clothing multi-colored birds and even domestic poul-
try all remained suspended in the air a workman
making a false step upon a scaffolding high overhead
suddenly lost his balance but instead of being dashed
to pieces upon the pavement below he was seen to
float gracefully through the atmosphere carried upon
the wings of the wind in mingled wonder and stupe-
faction hundreds of spectators saw the man become a
mere speck upon the western horizon only to disap-
pear completely from view an instant later

  it was at this moment that the citys inhabitants
began to understand the fate which was in store for
them with shrieks of terror and dismay the panic-
stricken populace took refuge within the walls of the
nearest buildings among many the illogical idea pre-
vailed that the civil authorities might possibly have
jurisdiction over natural phenomena as well as over
human affairs and fear-maddened mobs made up of
thousands of persons forced their way into municipal
institutions in search of protection

   the authorities however had no protection to offer
due to the effects of lessened gravity and lower atmos-
pheric pressure upon the human frame a weird in-
definable sensation of nausea and physical helplessness
descended upon even the most robust individuals
within the great buildings the most ghastly scenes
were being witnessed in some of the buildings many
persons were already hanging suspended unable either
to descend or ascend higher others terrified by the
grewsome and unnatural sight were clinging desper-
ately to tables chairs and every other available piece
of furniture men vainly endeavored to throw them-
selves flat upon the floor only to find that it was im-
possible for them to regain their feet mothers clutch-
ing frantically at their children were horrified to dis-
cover that their feet were no longer touching the floor
beneath

  to add to the panic the sun which had long since
disappeared now began to rise in the east announc-
ing the advent of another day yet according to all
known standards of time the sun should still have
been shining in the west not far from the meridian
at a rate which rendered its movement almost per-
ceptible to the naked eye the brilliant orb of day
steadily advanced along the ecliptic barely had the
first lurid streaks of dawn shot across the sky when
the suns position seemed to be a quarter of the way
up the zenith

   suddenly a large stone edifice began to totter upon
its foundation as it occupants became aware of the
movement their stupefaction was succeeded by cries of

horror and consternation gradually the heavy build-
ing freed itself from its supports rising perceptibly
above the ground in another instant scores of other
buildings could be seen rocking under the same in-
fluence the entire city of quito it appeared was
about to leave forever the planet which had given it
birth

   

in cities situated in the temperate zones scenes of a
somewhat different character were taking place as
the earths rotational speed had increased many start-
ling and extraordinary changes had occurred it was
soon discovered that railway systems could no longer
be controlled and reports of accidents were rapidly
multiplying northbound trains found progress virtu-
ally impossible while those running south were pre-
cipitated at such speed that the most powerful brakes
were of little avail as a matter of fact every mov-
able object seemed to possess an irresistible inclination
to move southward rivers running north which had
hitherto been but sluggish streams now were con-
verted into raging torrents levees were broken and
banks were undermined and whole territories were in-
undated even the human body was not free from the
same impulse and in order to maintain their feet
people were obliged to lean forward at an angle of
nearly  that is to say in facing north  facing
south the conditions were exactly reversed and every-
one traveling in this direction had the same sensation
as if he had been descending a steep and endless hill

  despite the seeming futility of any measures they
might take civil and military authorities were de-
termined to do everything in their power to minimize
the effects of the disaster accordingly as soon as
gravity tests had shown the imminence of the peril
all buildings of more than two stories in height had
been evacuated by order of the police

  in new york the exodus from the great buildings
in the downtown districts had been especially impres-
sive the streets were soon veritable rivers of surg-
ing humanity all traffic by vehicles had long since
been suspended and only the quick tread of human
feet upon the walks and pavement could  now be heard

  from the windows overhead police officers were
shouting orders through megaphones directing the
people to form into lines nor were these precautions
unnecessary already the increasing congestion had
slowed up the progress of the marching columns ma-
terially manhattan island which the authorities had
decided must be totally abandoned offered the greatest
difficulty the giant bridges connecting the island to
the mainland and to long island were already filled
to their greatest capacity yet it was doubtful whether
manhattans three million inhabitants could escape
from the doomed area before the destruction would
begin

   in many districts in which all order had been for-
gotten crowds of fear-maddened men and women were
fighting desperately to make their way through streets
which had already become too narrow while overhead
the increasing inclination of the tall buildings gave
warning that there was no time to lose

   on lower broadway scenes of indescribable confusion
were taking place as the solid mass of humanity
swept forward the steeple of trinity church was seen
to be reeling drunkenly upon its base suddenly as
if pushed by an invisible hand the narrow spire tot-
tered swayed and collapsed bearing beneath it
scores of persons and obstructing traffic in all direc-

 in the southern hemisphere these directions were of course completely
 reversed
when the world went mad



tiona stunned and bewildered people looked above
them to see the sky completely hidden by dark and
menacing shapes in the distance the form of the
woolworth building giant of skyscrapers could be
discerned its colossal tower writhing helplessly in the
grip of the invisible destroyer the destruction of this
masterpiece of modern engineering skill seemed now
but a matter of a few moments a mass of steel and
concrete weighing over  pounds would come
crashing down upon the highly organized sensitive
organic matter which was pulsating with life be-

chapter vi

upon recovering from the surprise occasioned by
the sudden disappearance of the spheroid pro-
fessor jopplins first thought was of the mys-
terious hiding-place which had been abandoned by the
russian scientists but a few moments before with
great difficulty making his way to the ledge from
which the three men had emerged he perceived an
opening which appeared to lead into a sort of cave or
natural passageway clinging desperately to the wall
in order to resist the insidious influence which threat-
ened to unbalance him and lift him off his feet the
american decided that his only hope of entering the
cavern lay in reaching the ceiling and walking along
its surface putting his decision into instant practice
by catching hold of the jutting rocks which lined the
tunnel on either side he crawled to the top of the cave
and started toward the interior

  for the space of a few moments the blackness of
the tunnel seemed to increase then almost impercept-
ibly at first but with ever-increasing dictinctness a
faint glimmer of light could be seen far in the dis-
tance animated by a newly born hope the professor
btruggled on oblivious to everything except the strange
luminosity which lay before him as the passageway
suddenly widened he was rewarded by a sight which
made him catch his breath in amazement not more
than forty feet ahead illuminated by a dazzling glare
of almost supernatural brilliance was a huge subter-
ranean chamber over fifty feet in height and at least
two hundred feet in diameter

  for the scientist a casual glance was sufficient to
inform him that the cavern had been the recent scene
of laboratory work upon a large scale rows of pow-
erful storage batteries motors and various electrical
appliances-whose framework was bolted securely to the
bolid rock beneath-still occupied their respective posi-
tions upon the floor while against the ceiling where
ns the professor at once understood they had been
thrown the moment that gravity had been conquered
by centrifugal force were lying dozens of cylindrical
containers delicately wrought tubes and other pieces
of apparatus in an evident state of disorder

  yet the eyes of the astrophysicist rested upon none
of these things standing motionless as though he
were under the influence of some hypnotic spell henry
jopplin was staring straight below him in the very
center of the floor of the weird laboratory and as in
the case of the machines which surrounded it securely
fastened to the rock beneath stood an object which
it would be impossible to describe in any precise terms
of known science although its general aspect some-
what resembled a huge multi-polar dynamo at this
point all resemblance ceased despite its great curi-
ously shaped armature the machine was clearly no
ordinary dynamo such as had ever been known to
twentieth century mechanics

  it soon became apparent to the scientist that if
anything was to be accomplished he must descend to

the floor at once cautiously making his way down
the nearest wall he at length found himself within a
few feet of a row of small pipes which led directly to
the center of the laboratory at this point the pro-
fessor was confronted with a sudden difficulty inas-
much as there was not only a total absence of gravity
at this particular region of the earth but an actual
predominance of centrifugal force he would if attempt-
ing to walk upon the caverns floor without assistance
be thrown immediately back upon the ceiling with per-
haps disastrous results only one alternative remained
-to make his way upside down by clinging to fixed
supports glancing hurriedly about him his eyes rested
upon the row of pipes beneath in another instant
jopplin was making his way hand over hand toward
the center of the laboratory and the strange mechanism
which it contained

  as the scientist drew nearer he suddenly became
conscious of a low droning sound in his ears simul-
taneously a terrifying conviction impressed itself
forcibly upon his mind the machine whatever it was
was still functioning

  with the trained eye of a physicist the american
examined the thing before him almost intuitively the
realization came to him that it was solely upon this
mass of inanimate metal that depended the fate of a
world-a planet supporting nearly two billion feeling
reasoning beings like himself

  methodically jopplin considered the various hypo-
theses that presented themselves to his mind discard-
ing each in turn as it failed to account for the data
before him mentally he reviewed every aspect of
teranhoffs startling experiments and the long series of
phenomena to which these had given rise he must
make no false step even though the passing of each
minute might now mean the sacrifice of thousands of
lives yet the duty of the man of science was clear-
his conclusion must be accurate there was no time for
mistakes

  all at once the scientists thin countenance was lit
by a sudden conviction recalling an independent in-
vestigation made in his senior year at college upon the
little understood subject of terrestrial magnetism the
true solution of the mystery was apparent the diurnal
oscillation of the magnetic compass the variation in
strength of the earths magnetic field the periodic
shifting of the agonic lines upon the terrestrial surface
lines on which the magnetic needle points due north un-
accountable seismic phenomena invariably accompanied
with abnormal manifestation of aurorae all the baf-
fling and inexplicable phenomena of polarity-all this
and much more could be easily accounted for in tha
light of the russians experiments no doubt could now
be entertained that the earths core many times more
dense than the crust and consisting almost wholly of
iron and nickel was in reality a gigantic magnet-a
magnet which could be made to serve a variety of pur-
poses when acted upon by the proper agent teranhoffs
method beautiful for its simplicity had been merely
to shift the magnetic fields by means of electro-mag-
netic currents in such manner as to accelerate the ro-
tation of the central nucleus and thus cause a conse-
quent increase in the rotational speed of the entire
lithosphere 

  in another moment the professors indecision had
completely vanished examining the great machine
more minutely he discovered that this dynamo-like
structure was in turn coupled with what appeared to be
a curious development of the ordinary vertical motor
some distance apart half hidden by the strange lum-

thc solid part of the earth the air is the atmosphere and the ocean
waters are the hydrosphere the word means sphere of stone

inosity which surrounded it stood a gigantic electroly-
tic hydrogen generator connected with the largest
tungsten filament lamp that jopplin had ever seen
farther on an immense tubular projection was il-
luminated by the rays of an electric arc it was evi-
dent the american reflected that a period of several
months if not years must have been necessary for the
complete equipment of such a laboratory in this isolated
spot involving endless difficulties in transportation as
well as in installation

  things were at last becoming clear to the astro-
physicist the passing of hydrogen gas through in-
candescent tungsten filaments at temperatures un-
dreamed of by older orthodox science led to but one
conclusion-the production of atomic or activated hy-
drogen beyond that much still remained unexplained
but upon one point there could be no doubt an en-
ormous inconceivable amount of energy was being de-
veloped within the subterranean laboratory-energy
in fact sufficient to throw the whole world into chaos
if its devastating effects were not immediately checked

  following an intricate system of wiring the ameri-
can suddenly came to a stop before him in spite of
their many peculiarities stood an unmistakable po-
tentiometer and switchboard with a shout of triumph
jopplin rapidly examined the wiring system which led
to the switch here he felt lay the key to the whole
problem in a few moments at the most he would be
able to release the earth from the relentless forces
which were destroying it

  and then at the very moment of his triumph the
scientist realized that he was already too late for even
though the supply of energy should be immediately cut
off and all further acceleration cease this would not
undo the damage that had already been accomplished
only one course remained-a complete reversal of the
electro-magnetic currents and desperate as this chance
seemed the american lost no time in coming to a
decision clinging with one hand to the support that
held him he made a connection and turned one of the
levers before him simultaneously there came the
sound of grinding motors a blinding flash of multi-
colored light swept the laboratory from end to end the
air became heavy with electrical discharges-then a
heavy numbing jar that seemed the end of all
things   

  yet the world was saved

chapter vii

yes the world had been saved the terrific jar
that had shaken the earth from pole to pole had
been the recoil of six sextillions of tons against a
force which will now never be measured by human
physicists and this recoil although it had sunk thou-
sands of ships upon the sea and demolished millions of
buildings on land had on the whole been for the good
of the planets inhabitants never again will terrestrial
days be measured in units of twenty-four hours yet
neither will the sun race across the heavens with the
sickening speed it exhibited during the twelve hours
of terror inaugurated by ivan teranhoffs mad ex-
periment

  eighteen hours and fifty-one minutes is the time
which will henceforth be consumed by the third planet
of the solar system in making one complete rotation
upon its axis for many months to come weight and
monetary systems will remain in a state of complete
chaos the painstaking observations of scientific men
accumulated through centuries of toil will be obsolete
in many departments of science the agricultural map
of the world will be greatly changed for many old
countries have been swallowed up by the sea and many

new ones have arisen in regions which had hitherto
been covered with water

  panama the galapagos sumatra borneo and a part
of the philippines have entirely disappeared and upon
a line drawn from quito to the northern tip of new
guinea upon the equator only the slightest traces of
human occupation are to be found whether the in-
habitants were carried too far from the earths gravita-
tional field ever to return or whether they were de-
stroyed by atmospheric friction is still an open ques-
tion the lithuania as well as hundreds of other ships
within the canal zone has made its last port a port
from which none will return nor owing to the total
submersion of the isthmus of panama will there ever
exist a need for further inter-oceanic canal systems upon
the american continent

  the scientific secrets of ivan teranhoff have un-
fortunately been lost to the world the exact formulae
for the conversion of sub-atomic energy as well as the
composition of the death-dealing blue-ray seem to
have been known only to the scientist and his assistants
however it is not unlikely that with the information
they now possess other scientists will in time be able
to duplicate many of teranhoffs discoveries-in which
case it is hoped they will be used for purposes more
conducive to human welfare the fate of teranhoff
himself remained a mystery forever whatever wonders
of space the russian may have encountered upon his
celestial voyage the world will never know for the
space-ship never returned

  the manner in which professor henry jopplin of
the astrophysical department of carlyle university was
finally rescued from an isolated spot in the andes and
brought home to one of the greatest ovations ever re-
ceived in human history is now too well known to re-
quire much comment after the first effects of the jar
that had shaken the world had worn off scientific ex-
peditions had set out by aircraft from practically every
nation upon the american continent the professor
after having wandered for over a day and a half had
at last been discovered by a famous american flyer
within only a few miles of the spot where once had
stood the lost city of quito this much at least has
long been known to every newspaper reader in the
world

  what has not been divulged by the press and what
is known only to the scientific circles which have re-
ceived jopplins professional report are the reasons
which led to the latters abandonment of the subter-
ranean laboratory before the earths rotational period
had been restored to its normal length this as the
scientist has repeatedly stated to his most intimate
colleagues is a thorn upon his conscience which will
continue to prick him for the rest of his life not of
course that from a worldly standpoint the professors
course was not entirely justified the facts briefly are
these

  no sooner had jopplin reversed the electro-magnetic
currents and felt the jar that followed than he found
himself lying flat upon the caverns floor realizing at
once that his returned bodily weight meant the re-
storation of gravity to the earth he had assumed an
assumption he now claims which he had no right to
make that his plan had been entirely successful and
that nothing further remained to be done it was
therefore only natural that upon experiencing the first
tremor foretelling the earthquake which was subse-
quently to destroy the entire mountainside he should
have decided to leave the laboratory to its own fate
yet even after the first shock professor jopplin
states in his report that he remained sufficiently long
in the cavern to discover that all the motors as well
when the world went mad



as the apparatus from which they derived their energy
had been rendered useless owing to the terrific strain
which had been placed upon them past all hope of
repair as it was the professor was quite badly shaken
up and escaped the final crash only by the rarest good
fortune

  now however he has become obsessed with the idea
that it is solely his fault that the earth has lost over
five hours of its normal day in fact the plaudits of
the multitude the congratulations of his friends and
the assurances of his colleagues are alike incapable
of ridding him of this conviction for this reason it is
only too clear that the professor in spite of the warmth
of his first reception could never become a popular
hero indeed he feels that it is he who owes the
world an apology rather than that the world should
owe him gratitude

  after a short stay in the united states professor
jopplin again sailed for valparaiso-this time by air-
plane-in order to carry on the investigations which
had been so rudely interrupted aside from occasional
notices in the scientific journals which publish his re-
ports nothing has been heard of him for many months
and so far as the vast majority of the worlds in-
habitants are concerned he will probably never be
heard of again

  for already another evangelist has been kidnapped
new political scandals have been exposed thrilling mur-
ders have been committed daring bank robberies have
been successfully carried out and the greatest worlds
championship bout on record has been scheduled who
indeed will have time to remember henry jopplin in
the face of such important matters as these

the gravity king



jlias craig president of the american air-
plane co inc swung slowly around in his
swivel chair and faced his secretary who had
just entered his private office

  well he growled tersely what is it

  there is a messenger outside sir the secretary re-
plied who has a letter which he insists upon deliver-
ing to you personally

  hmm- well maybe its concerning that lake ar-
bor deal show him in and craig turned back to his
desk

  the secretary slipped out quietly and almost imme-
diately the door opened and admitted a self-possessed
young man of about twenty-six years for an instant
he paused at the door and surveyed the broad back and
bullet head covered with iron gray hair of the mn be-
fore him was it the shadow of the cloud that passed
over the afternoon sun that darkened his eyes or was
it a look of bitter hate but whatever it was it was
gone almost as soon as it appeared and he advanced
with a quick firm step to the desk before him and laid
a sealed envelope before the president

  theres no answer he said as craig looked up curi-
ously and before he could be questioned further he
was gone

  quickest messenger i ever saw growled craig sar-
castically to himself wasnt from the lake arbor peo-
ple either as he opened the envelope with a quick
movement of the cutter unfolding the letter he read
with growing amazement the following

may th 

american airplane co inc

  elias craig president

     city

dear sir

  the airplane of the present type is destined in a few
years to be entirely obsolete no doubt you will smile
at this statement but i have the proof at hand in my
latest successful invention-a super airboat which can-
not fall to the earth and which should attain a speed
of three hundred miles per hour

  you will be startled to learn that after years of in-
tensive experiments i have

finally discovered the great
principle that makes my
airboat a success namely
the repulsion of gravita-
tion

  further details i cannot
discuss in this letter i
have written you because
of the immense capital
you and your company
represent this capital is
needed at present in order
to properly place my in-
vention before the public

  i shall be pleased to
give you and your directors
a demonstration with a

small model tomorrow evening at  oclock at my present
address

  you as a business man must realize what it will
mean to the company that first secures manufacturing

rights to my machine a word to the wise- you

know very sincerely

 rjlhe repulsion or nullification of gravitation
     is ever a live topic in the minds of practi-
     cally every physicist and inventor today
     will it ever be possible fortes to devise means
     of negativing gravitation we do not know
     so far we have only the most incomplete
     knowledge about gravitation itself the au-
     thor in the present story has used an anti-
     gravitation theme with excellent results
     perhaps after all it might be best for us
     not to know so much about the final solu-
     tion of the problem

abraham norton

   oakhurst ave

  now presidents of large companies are accustomed
to receiving letters from all grades of inventors most
of whom offer world revolutionizing inventions which
however revolutionize nothing but the inventors pock-

et books-but abraham norton-ah he was a different
proposition appearing in the city a few years before
the opening of this story he had already produced sev-
eral small but important and successful inventions and
he was known as a man of keen intellect and logical
mind while craig did not know the man personally
he had often heard of him consequently he stared dumb-
founded at the letter in his hand for hearsay told him
that norton was not the man to say one thing and mean
another

  god he breathed the repulsion of gravitation is
it possible

  sinking back in his chair his crafty brow wrinkled
in thought and his active mind swarmed with a thou-
sand pictures what an invention to control exclusively
high in the air he could see huge fleets of airboats-
his companys airboats - mammoth beyond wrights
wildest dreams-speeding meteorlike in all directions
he saw distance annihilated - the worlds barriers
broken down he saw railroads and steamship lines
falling into disuse his puffy hand clenched itself as
though in its merciless grip he was already crushing
his business rivals who were still manufacturing the old
style planes he sensed the power that would be his-
elias craigs- could his company but corner this
gigantic enterprise but hold-what would the inven-
tor demand as his share or perhaps his invention
after all would prove a fizzle

  slowly slowly old boy craig said to himself you
build air castles like a school child-but real or false
we must investigate this thing if it should prove true
and some other company should get control wed be
forced to close our doors

  now closing the doors of his large concern was the
last thing craig intended to do in the first place the
business was too profitable and in the second place his
iron nature would not permit defeat defeat to which
he had so often forced smaller concerns by certain
methods commonly known as strong arm for craigs
operations although they kept the letter of the law at
least were absolutely merciless in driving possible
rivals to the wall

  craigs interest in such methods was eminently per-
sonal for he and his com-
panys three other direc-
tors controlled all the stock
starting with a few thou-
sand dollars capital he
and his three partners had
built up the present im-
mense business this was
accomplished by means of
an invention - an auto-
matic airplane stabilizer-
to which the company
owned the sole patent
rights just where they
had obtained the invention
was never disclosed al-
though the public com-
monly supposed that craig
was the originator a supposition by the way that craig
never denied now as he read the inventors letter over
he again smiled well if they could get hold of an in-
vention like that the public would have something to
talk about

  turning to the phone craig called up each of his
three associates in turn and requested them to attend
a meeting at his office that evening on very important
business

  when the hour arrived the president turned to the
other directors and read the inventors letter which nat-
urally caused quite a sensation while some doubted
that the inventor had really accomplished what he


amazing stories quarterly

claimed they all agreed that the matter was of too
much possible importance to neglect therefore the
following evening the presidents limousine containing
the four men drove out to  oakhurst avenue which
was the inventors residence the place was located
near the outskirts of the city and proved to be a mod-
est dwelling of two and a half stories located among
some gloomy pines

  upon ringing the bell the door was opened by an
elderly man apparently sixty-five or seventy years of age
he wore a flowing white beard and on his head was a
close fitting skull cap his piercing gray eyes surveyed
the party finally resting upon craig

  mr craig and associates i presume step right in
gentlemen ive been expecting you he said my
names norton craig started-where had he lird
that peculiar ringing voice before but the memory
eluded him and the inventor was speaking again

  you are all familiar with my letter of course and
are anxious to see my-pardon the natural pride-
epoch-making invention i have the model in my work-
shop upstairs if you will kindly follow me he said
courteously i shall be pleased to give you a demon-
stration and explain such things as are necessary to the
proper understanding of the value of my invention
turning abruptly he led the way up several flights of
stairs to the upper half story and paused before a door
unlocking this he switched on a shaded light in the
center of the low-ceilinged room and entered eagerly
followed by his guests

  the single light that norton had switched on was so
shaded that it cast most of its illumination on a mas-
sive table beneath leaving the rest of the room in com-
parative obscurity craig half unconsciously glanced
around and was surprised at the extreme lowness of the
ceiling but quickly remembering that this was the up-
per half story of the house and that therefore the ceil-
ing must necessarily be low he turned his eyes to the
table

  resting on the table was a metallic cigar-shaped ob-
ject looking for all the world like a submarine without
a conning tower it was about eight feet long and wide
in proportion

  the model gentlemen said norton passing his
hand caressingly over the shining metal this is an
exact representation of the way i shall build my pas-
senger airboat with the exception that on this model
the forward-driving apparatus is left out however
with this boat i can show you the main principle-the
annulling of gravitys effect please be seated

  the little party afire with expectation seated them-
selves about the table and watched the inventor intently

  you will notice norton continued the utter ab-
sence of cumbersome planes also how the shape of the
airboat is made to offer the least possible resistance to
the air when traveling at high speeds here he paused
and sliding back a cover in the top of the model he
reached inside and slightly moved a small lever across
a dial withdrawing his hand he watched the boat
for an instant it rested quietly then amid a gasp of
astonishment from the little circle of watchers it arose
as lightly and noiselessly as a balloon and mounted
steadily to a height of about three feet above the table
and then remained there absolutely motionless after
the expressions of amazement had subsided a little the
inventor reached up and again touched the little lever
the boat settled gracefully back to the table

  now will two of you gentlemen kindly sit astride
the machine norton asked his request was quickly
complied with and he again slid back the metal door
this time shoving the lever far over on the dial as
easily and as silently as before the cigar-shaped object
arose until the directors heads touched the ceiling
norton then mounted a chair and reversing the lever

gradually the machine descended and came to rest on
the table the two men dismounted from their metal
pegasus and craig said looks good but now lets
have a little explanation of just how your machine
overcomes gravity you know sometimes things are
not what they seem this half sneeringly

  nortons eyes flashed for an instant but he said in
a controlled voice you will find no trickery connected
with my invention in fact significantly i am sure
before the evening is over you will be more than con-
vinced of its genuineness he paused again craig
had a fleeting impression that he had somewhere
heard this man speak before but rack his brain as
he would he couldnt remember the incident

  you will pardon me norton resumed if i digress
a little before i explain the really simple process by
which i turn earths attraction as it were against it-
self thus leading to my most marvelous results it is
necessary for your proper understanding of the sub-
ject he said with what craig thought concealed sar-
casm to recount a little personal history which hap-
pened twenty-five weary years ago he paused bitterly

  at that time i was a young man of thirty-five
years working as a mechanic in a factory which man-
ufactured airplane propellers i was happy and con-
tented in my work i had a loving wife and little
baby boy to keep me cheered up and altogether the
world looked rosy fortune seemed to favor me when
one day i got an idea for a much needed invention
on an airplane which i was sure would be a winner
wishing to be sure of the value of my idea i con-
sulted with four of my associate mechanics who i
had every reason to believe were honest faithful
friends here norton looked keenly at his auditors
who squirmed uneasily beneath his glance he con-
tinued they readily saw the importance of my idea
and urged me strongly to go ahead with my plans
little did i suspect that they met that very evening
and planned not only to rob me of my invention but
to put me forever out of the way as well at the
telling of this remembrance nortons eyes grew som-
bre and threatening a cold sensation started at the
base of craigs spine and moved upward that voice
was knocking knocking at his brain wilfully buried
memories began to awake-he gazed half fearfully at
his colleagues and he saw that they too were looking

questioningly at him could this man be- but no

that was too absurd a mere coincidence listen he
was speaking again

  it was the old old story of the lamb and the
wolves my so-called friends invited me to a little
party with the boys drugged me and stole my plans
which i carried in my inside pocket but mark you
not content with robbing me they must needs put me
out of the way where my future outcries against
them could not be heard so they took me down to
the factory drugged as i was clubbed the watchman
into insensibility from behind and left me before
the companys safe with a kit of burglars tools i
presume they then notified the police for there they
came and found me struggling to get up they ar-
rested me and with all that circumstantial evidence
against me i was sent to prison for ten years

the effect of nortons story upon his auditors was
startling the blood had slowly drained from the
faces of all of them and they had risen to their feet
with straining eyes that voice was now only too
familiar-you are-you are- they murmured

  jim rodman the man you heartlessly betrayed
-his voice rose-the man you sent to prison for ten
long weary years-leaving his wife and the baby to
die of privation and shame while you you damnable
slinking hypocrites taking the fruits of my labors
the gravity king



made yourselves rich and powerful look at me an
old man at sixty broken with suffering and prison
indignities his voice broke with passion but he
resumed quickly now however ive got you where
i want you damn you 

  dont be too sure said craig whose hardened
nature had recovered from its temporary fear he
drew an automatic from his coat pocket stand
aside he said sneeringly i havent time to listen
to your yelps further he strode to the door and
jerked it open then stood petrified with amazement
gone was the narrow hallway-gone were the stairs-
the room in which he stood hung five thousand feet
in midair far above the quiet moonlit streets of the
city craigs eyes bulged with fear and unbelief he
rubbed them violently thinking himself the victim
of a troubled dream but no it was reality-the room
like mahomets coffin hung suspended between heaven
and earth

 ashen-faced craig turned and dropped into a
chair all the bluster taken out of him what in-
fernal magic is this he whined put me on earth
again rodman and ill do anything give you any-
thing

    norton or rodman rather as we will now call him
surveyed craig contemptuously whine you cur
whine just as i thought-like all traitors you are a
coward at heart do you think that anything you
could do now would erase those ten years of hell
from my memory can you offer me anything that
would resurrect my darling wife and babe from the
darkness of eternal sleep no no youve had your

fling-now you must pay-pay- his voice shrilled

and craig shrank back as from a madman

  oh dont be afraid im not going to kill you out-
right youre going to be my guests for some time
yet then with mock politeness pardon me gentle-
men for not relieving your curiosity as to your pres-
ent aerial location sooner i am certain youd like to
know you see this room you are in is really only the
center section of my airboat the gravity king
the men started yes resumed rodman i merely
disguised it from the too curious gaze of passers-by
it was very simple i tore the roof off the long nar-
row room at the back of my house leaving the floor
and walls intact within these protecting walls my
faithful assistant and myself gradually assembled the
different sections of the gravity king consequently
instead of entering my workshop this evening as you
supposed you entered my airboat as you perceive
this room is enclosed at each end by metal walls
beyond these partitions is housed the machinery for
raising and lowering the gravity king and also for
propulsion while you were so interestedly watching
the small model my assistant was guiding our air-
ship high into the sky he hesitated then called
oh harry

  a door in the forward compartment opened and a

young man stepped into the chamber and looked coldly
at craig and his party craig noticed that it was the
young man who had brought him the inventors letter
and he swore silently

  is everything working all right harry rodman
asked

  splendidly said the other your instructions are
being carried out this with a significant look at the
inventor

  good said rodman and his assistant disap-
peared

  these instructions by the way continued the in-
ventor grimly may prove of interest to you as they
are concerning your future home he watched their
faces would you care to know where that is well
listen

  far to the south of tierra del fuego well within
the antartic circle is a small island it is well
stocked with game and seafowl but it is absolutely
uninhabited and is not even charted as a peaceful
place to rest from civilizations strife and to recuper-
ate shattered nerves it is unexcelled this island
gentlemen in a mocking tone you will grow to
love as the years roll by for it is your future home
then sternly you have proven yourselves unfit for
civilization so civilization casts you out to the beasts
where you belong

 you devil craig shouted-our business-our
homes-well pay anything but dont bury us alive on
one of those god-forsaken antarctic islands

  too late murmured rodman did you think of
that when you buried me alive between those cold bleak
walls of san quentin  he gave a short sardonic laugh
and turned on his heel

  at that craigs restraint blew up completely he
raised his revolver and aiming it at rodman shrieked
turn around damn you and order that mechanician
of yours to take us home or ill blow your brains
out

  rodman turned smilingly shoot you coward if
you have the nerve-but you havent you know only
too well if you shoot me youll neverreturn to earth
and leaping suddenly forward he knocked craigs weapon
upwards the pistol roared but the bullet went over
rodmans head and pierced the forward compartment
at this there came a sharp crack from the front
end of the boat and the men were all hurled to the
floor by a sudden upward lurch of the gravity king
a yell came from the mechanician that bullet has
broken the control-were shooting away from the earth
and i cant stop it

  the men staggered to their feet and gazed through
the glass it was true insane terror filled their eyes
and reason tottered but the gravity king unheed-
ing hurtled upward like a metallic demon released
from the pit and was lost forever in the illimitable
reaches of space

the world of the giant ants

by h hyatt verrill

icontinued from page 

a row of slashing steel blades a little later we dis-
covered a patrol of the reds approaching across an
area temporarily unguarded by the agricultural war-
riors rushing to the powder-train leading to the
mine in that spot i fired it the next moment only
a yawning hole in the sand and fragments of dead
ants remained to mark their attempt

  i fear we are in a bad fix we have little water
little food and the reds are in incredible numbers all
about us if only i could induce our agriculturalist
warriors to rush the enemy if only the reds would
come on and attack but the agriculturalists developed
their fighters with one point in view and one only
they produced creatures with fearful natural weapons
great strength quick motions and utter lack of fear
but in doing so they sacrificed all intelligence all in-
dividuality and initiative the reds on the other hand
seem to have developed even greater intelligence and
a greater instinct for military tactics than before and
yet they have retained all their fighting characteristics
to attempt to make a sortie with the blacks would be
suicidal my handful of savages would literally be
eaten up by the hordes of reds and the latter have
learned to keep beyond reach of our weapons at first
arrows and slings did considerable execution among
them but now they have withdrawn just beyond range
i am beginning to feel that we are doomed how i
blame myself for not having attempted our escape
sooner had we made our preparations to blast the
tunnel door a day earlier we would now be out of the
valley and safe and now with all prepared with
only a spark needed to open our way to freedom we
are more helpless more prisoners than ever but of
what avail to regret what cannot be remedied there
is a chance a very slender chance that we might
escape through the lines of the red ants under cover
of darkness

  they are strictly diurnal and are dull and semi-
dormant at night but they are so sensitive to the
slightest sound or vibration to sounds or perhaps
scents undetectable to humans that such an attempt
would be a most perilous and desperate undertaking
moreover i feel that it would be a cowardly despicable
act to desert these blacks who look to me for their
salvation my presence in the valley-though heaven
knows i had no wish to remain here-has been the
cause of all this trouble and warfare i am in a way
responsible and in addition i have developed a hatred
of the reds more intense than i would have believed
possible to me they seem living incarnations of every-
thing evil and yet i suppose they are merely follow-
ing out their natural instincts are merely fulfilling
their destinies as planned by the creator most of
all i am worried and troubled over tom

  i have got him into this mess and he poor boy
must be sacrificed on the altar of science because of
his faithfulness and devotion to me my own life is
of little consequence i am well along in years i
have done my part-small as it is-in the scientific
world and it is no worse to meet the end here at the
hands of savage insects than elsewhere at the hands
of savage men or by some accident or disease i do
not hold life cheaply but in many ways i would prefer
death to longer imprisonment in this valley my great-

est regret would be that all i have learned would perish
with me that the place would remain unknown and
unsuspected indefinitely that no fellow scientist would
be able to complete my work and thoroughly investi-
gate the marvelous ruins of the pre-historic white race
i had hoped planned to return with a large party and
proper equipment but i can see no hope of that now
i could face my future my probable death with equa-
nimity if i could only be sure that my notes would
reach the outer world but i fear that tom if i fall
might forget his promise and would remain faithful
to the end

the suspense is getting unbearable i am de-
termined that in a short time i will force the
issue unless the reds change their tactics and attack
us i shall lead an attack upon them the inaction
is more trying than the most desperate hand-to-hand
fighting

	 

  i have been thinking deeply upon the matter of
toms escape i believe he with his latent savage
instincts and his african ability to move stealthily in
the darkness might get safely through the red ants
lines especially as there seems to be an area to the
west that is not so closely guarded and patrolled as
elsewhere if he could do this if he could reach the
outer world with my notebooks my own fate would
not matter so much moreover if he could reach the
outposts of civilization-and i have no doubt that he
could do this if he gets through to tupec-he could
summon aid and return with a large party equipped
with fire-arms if i still live when they arrive i
will be rescued and none the worse off the valley can
be pacified the red ants annihilated and the scientific
world enriched by a study of this place my life may
be sacrificed it is true but if tom remains and the
reds are triumphant his lot would be worse than any
death he would be made a slave of the inhuman
monsters and treated far more brutally than the ordi-
nary slaves

  i must use every argument to induce him to attempt
to get away without me i must play upon his terror
of falling into the slavers clutches again i must
promise that if the reds are defeated i will follow
him but the all important matter is to save him from
the fate that i feel sure will be his if he remains
and to carry my notebooks to my fellow men i do
not feel at all confident that i can induce or force
tom to do this but he is obedient he is brave he
is resourceful and it is my only hope

decided tom will attempt to reach tupec he
will go through the tunnel as planned and i be-
lieve he can make it giving him my notes as only
proof tom can bring a rescue party back from tupec
he has full instructions as to forces arms etc the
chilonean army will attack today

my chiloneans victorious the reds annihilated
am mortally wounded tom leaving at once no
use for rescue party now my last words -

stenographers hands

continued from page 

force is discouraged and our shipping department no
longer can work in harmony and with accuracy un-
less something is done at once universal utilities will
lose eighty per cent of its customers

  something had to be done but first of all the cause
had to be determined the reason for these errors all
the science-the entire skill of the research depart-
ment of the company was put to work and yet at
the end of a week nothing was learned and another
week of disastrous errors followed

in the strain of events hiram smith died his
daughter mirabella at once took charge of uni-
versal utilities her first act was to call a meeting of
her board of directors and speak to them she began
her address

  over two hundred years ago an ancestor of mine
decided to breed stenographers he succeeded rather
well he not only bred like to like but eventually had
a great deal of inbreeding in this last generation
almost every husband and wife were cousins of some
degree no individuality was allowed and no initia-
tive he merely bred for accuracy and speed all of
you have followed in his footsteps you have mated
human beings as if they were rats or cattle if you
had studied the nervous systems of horses and dogs
that have been bred in this way for many generations
you would have suspected the trouble with your pres-
ent generation of stenographers any dog fancier
will tell you how careful he has to be of white collies
and fox terriers one of your community doctors
last year suspected what was going to happen

  over eighty per cent of your stenographers have
nocturnal epilepsy that means that they have con-
vulsions which occur at night during their sleep after
the tonic and clonic muscular movements they drop
into a deep sleep from which they only waken in time
to dress eat breakfast and go to work they
have no consciousness of the convulsion and no
memory of it on account of the intense muscular
activity during the attack they are tired sore and
bruised when they start to work that in itself
would produce fatigue and errors but in addition there
is in epilepsy especially the nocturnal type a very
definite deterioration of the higher mental faculties
these unfortunates become dull listless incapable of
highly specialized cerebration they degenerate into
listless animals in their work dress and speech they
give plain evidence of this dullness of the mind emo-
tionally they change become quarrelsome abusive and
indolent this is what hn appened to your office
force two hundred years bo my ancestor started
it you have tried to carry out his plans-to breed
stenographers instead you have bred a race of de-
mented epileptics my medical friends who are in
your employ as physicians to the colony children tell

me that almost all the little children are showing
definite signs of the same nervous disease you were
not told of it sooner because they were afraid of my
father

  the chairman of the board looked dully at the
young woman then he roused himself to action
how did you learn all this

  oh the doctor who made the discovery was a
colony child for some reason your special foods and
glandular preparations did not work on him and in
his tenth year he was taken away from his parents
and put in the home of common people during those
ten years he saw a great deal of the colony life-he
used to play with the other children and spend the
nights with them things happened during the night
that he could not understand but he remembered them
especially when he started to study medicine after
he graduated he worked for universal utilities as one
of their colony physicians and his observations there
made him positive of the presence of nocturnal epilepsy
since then the disease has developed rapidly

   is there no cure

   none whatever universal utilities has on its hands
and conscience ten thousand epileptics and their chil-
dren all that can be done is to allow the defective
race to die out you will have to reorganize your entire
office force-go back to the old system of incompetent
error-making stenographers who in spite of their
faults are at least intensely human

   the chairman in his indignation at a womans talk-
ing so disrespectfully and at such length to a dignified
board of directors demanded what the result would be

   under the stress of reorganization mirabella calm-
ly replied universal utilities will lose over eighty
per cent of its business the time will come how-
ever when once again it will function smoothly under
conditions similar to its competitors i will try to
make the lives of the new stenographers happy but
never again will any effort be made to interfere with
the normal progress of nature in the breeding of
human beings tho unfortunate epileptics will be well
cared for but will die rapidly and in twenty-five years
the colonies will be converted into suburban homes
for normal workers from the great city

  enough of this outrage stormed the chairman
this meddling physician you speak of-who is he

where is he well teach him-

   in reply mirabella smith simply called a young man
from the back of the room where he had been silently
listening to the entire proceedings

  this is my husband dr carleton thoney she
said softly he used to be a colony child but provi-
dence made him a healthy physician instead of an
epileptic stenographer together we will do all we
can not only to make universal utilities a great busi-
ness once more but also to make full amends for the
errors its leaders have committed in the past

 editorials from our readers

  rphis being your publication you the reader have certain ideas not only about this publication but about scientifiction as well the

  	editorsbelieve that their mission is complete when they selcct and edit stories that go into the making of this magazine on the
  other hand they feel that you the reader have a more detached view of the magazine itself and that very often your ideas as to the
  magazine and as to scientifiction in general arc not only unique but are original and instructive as well for that reason it has been
  decided to print the best letter-about  words-which can be used as an editorial on the editorial page and be awarded a prize of 

  the letters which do not win the quarterly prize but which still have merit will be printed in the editorial from our readers
  department newly created in this magazine starting with this issue	

  laudatory letters containing flattering remarks about the stories themselves or of the magazine are not acceptable for the editorial
  page we want inspiring or educational letters embodying material which can be used as an editorial along scientifiction themes

  remember it is the idea that counts a great literary effort is not necessary as the editors reserve the right to edit all letters
  received in order to make them more presentable for publication

  remember too that anyone can enter this contest and everyone has an equal chance to get on the editorial page of amazing
  stories quarterly hereafter

  this contest will continue until further notice contest each issue closes the th of month preceding date of issue-vizcontest clos-

beyond the realm of known possibilities

mans mastery of the earth was not a result
of physical prowess strength alone would
have achieved but little in overcoming the prob-
lems confronting civilization put a jungle sav-
age well versed in the ways of the jungle and
in primitive living down in the midst of a jungle
minus weapons or companions and he is imme-
diately at the mercy of nearly any wild animal
that cares to attack he cannot outrun nor best
in combat any animal of equal size nor many
much smaller even a few bees will put him to
flight and an aggressive poisonous reptile will get
in a strike in spite of his best efforts

but give him materials and he will fashion
for himself defensive weapons with which he need
not fear any animal regardless of size his
superiors in strength and speed are summarily
dispatched at a distance that precludes possi-
bility of injury to himself and the lowly club
mans first auxiliary weapon is still suffcient
protection against the average reptile

why do not other animals do likewise why
is man the sole originator of auxiliary weapons
with which he may protect and preserve him-
self far better than with those supplied by na-
ture alone undoubtedly there was a large ele-
ment of luck attached-something in the unknown
past that deprived him of all defensive means ex-
cept those that he might conceive since lie was
forced to use his brain in his fight for life it
was only natural that the brain would develop
out of all proportion to other parts of the body
just as the breast muscles of birds the leg
muscles of swift animals or the horn of the
rhinoceros have developed

brain however develops not directly with
time or use but we might say as a mathe-
matical power of time and use this is perhaps
not technically correct but it expresses well the
idea the more the brain developed the faster
it developed and of course the faster it de-
veloped the more it developed a sort of nega-
tive resistance effect one might say the best
and most advantageous feature of which is the
fact that there is no saturation point-no limit-
such as there is in physical development

there has probably been more advance in the
last hundred years than in two thousand years
previous and more in the past twenty years
than in the hundred previous to that etc tho
advance in knowledge does not follow any law
with mathematical precision but the negative
resistance effect is plainly apparent

it brings to mind the story of the blacksmith
who offered to shoe his customers horse at the
rate of a quarter of a cent for the first nail a
half a cent for the second each nail costing
twice as much as the preceding nail on first
consideration such an offer may sound ridiculous
but the average worker would be financially wise
if he were able to do it to work under similar
terms for an employer receiving one cent for
the first year two cents for the next and so on
for thirty years the total amount received at
the end of the thirtieth year will be more than
many successful business men make in a simi-
lar period of time

   who then dares limit the ability of man to
advance himself or who cares to risk future
ridicule by saying it will never be done or
it may be done sometime but not in our day
impossible as some things seem to us now they
become simplicity itself as soon as we learn how
to do them houdini nor marconi nor the wright
brothers were possessed of the devil yet they
would have been burned at the stake a short
while ago if they had performed their respective
deeds then yet it was no more impossible then
than now we simply considered such things
impossible if thought of at all because we did
not know how

  with such brain power available to mankind
and with its use unlimited in the manner physi-
cal things arc limited it is to be regretted that
only a small percentage of people use any ap-
preciable amount of it one of our human frail-
ties is brainlazincss we would rather read in-
teresting fiction or go to a photoplay for mental
relaxation than to read something which requires
real thinking ability to absorb this is true re-
gardless of the recognized benefit that would be
returned in knowledge we shy at reading a book
on medicine-even one on first aid-yet the value
of such knowledge cannot and is not disputed
and the personal satisfaction of knowing what is
to be known today about the structure of the
atom or the universe is ample compensation for
the time required to read it and to give some
thought to it

   since this is realized only by those who like
to study such subjects what is a better carrier
of scientific knowledge or a better furtherance
of interest among the disinterested than a com-
bination of absorbing fiction with science a
combination that will hold a readers attention
by its interest arouse his imagination by its
hint of prediction of the future or the hint of
uncovered insight into the past and that will
bring into play a trend of thought that crcatc
greater interest in and understanding of life

   a little love and sex is sometimes included for
they will always stand out as a source of in-
terest in life but they are not treated sordidly
in scientifiction the nature of such writings is
such as to make these subjects of secondary im-
portance thrills and adventure are unlimited to
the writer of scientifiction because he is not held
down to human experiences and to the realm of
known possibilities instead -his imagination may
wander into the unknown past the unforeseen
future the limitless space that surrounds us
the infinitesimal volume of the atom or the fu-
ture possibilities of electrical chemical and me-
chanical research and invention

  whoever can sit down and read such a tale
without thoroughly enjoying the play of imagi-
nation it creates and without learning something
deeper in life than he knew before has no
place among those who may claim credit for
being an asset to mankinds progress through the
ages for his brain-power the power that placed
man on his present pinnacle must not be of the
constructive type that is continually by well
planned efforts pushing on

title purposes of scientifiction

are the two title purposes of scientifiction
equal if not there is danger of slighting
one of them but if they are equal we must
struggle hard lest wo slight both

to the purpose of refreshing entertainment we
must give expert attention as this is the aspect
we are most liable to slight each love-theme
should carry personality and be so woven into the
rost of the story that it takes mental effort to
isolate it as an axiom we may say that real
science is not cold and we may carry it out by
giving to the majority of our stories a pleasing
dominant tone and we need not bo afraid of
fairy tales as the average popular story is a fairy
tale if you compare it with probability or wonder
why the two lovers are not followed through their
happiness ever after

to the purpose of inspirational understanding
of science we have already yielded attention
faithful psychology should be used throughout
and a special study of the subject should be used
wherever convenient

now returning to the opening question we note
that equality has not been quite fulfilled the fic-
tion often getting the worst of it pure scientifio
speculation alone if continued for years is apt
to get monotonous likewise pure fiction is apt
to run dry if then the two purposes are unequal
they arc liable to approach cither of the two
extremes as the case may be and share the cor-
responding fate but if the two objects are equal
the possible combinations and results are probably
at a maximum and that is why i believe that the
closer we come to attaining general equality the
stronger will be our magazine

is scientifiction changing so simple was the
original idea better expressed probably by jules
verne than by edgar allan poe that one would
not expect change of an innocent thing like pre-
diction in pleasant narrative form yet we may
sec a faint outline of different stages of develop-
ment rather more logical than chronological for
some authors have almost jumpod to the higher
stages and some authors may never reach them
though they write forever

the first stago with its good taste and sim-
plicity needs no commcnt in the second stage
we have isolated specialization corresponding to
tragedy jn ordinary fiction wo have stories show-
ing a dark future for civilization to comedy a
dark present nd alluring future more personal
subdivision has appeared in love stories humorous
stories dramatic tragedy ohenry endings etc
but no deep-seated farce in the same vein as on
the stage has appeared tho possibilities of a
dramatic farce in which the characters get all
mixed up but do not know it until the reader
has nearly died of rapture arc almost infinite

the third stage was totally unexpected several
stories appeared lending a peculiar emphasis to
beauty we thought when we started one of
those stories that it was a casual arabian nights
dream of riotous beauty but we found the
author trying to express an elusive thought an
uncrystallized goal and trying he gained artis-
tic taste and succeeding he did not produce a
mere fairy talc but thrilled us with a new phase
of art-shall we call it esthetic scientifiction f

true we are prone to smile at times and ridi-
ctile the writer of scicntifiction yet i think the
more we read and listen to the urge to know the
less wo will do this

  i have read stories that caused me to think a
great deal especially as to the mechancial and
technical side i wonder if certain mechanical
principles arc probable from the writers view-
point i believe that therein lies the secret of
scicntifiction its method of world progress and
the resulting advancement

  a fellow reader once came to me with an object
that roughly resembled a telescope he cxplaind that
it was an arrangement of lenses for the purpose
of peering into the fourth dimension of course
i laughed as i gazed through it he wanted to
try it out in the projection room where i work
he believed the carbon light and the lens would
disclose the fourth dimension between the machine
and the screen

  the experiment failed and i must confess i
was almost as disappointed as he as far a
t know he is still seeking the one arrangement
nor can i laugh at him for i believe that of such
is the realm of science

  i believe anything possible yet i do want to
draw the line sometimes on probability i be-
lieve that an atom is a hollow sphere containing
a universe as relatively perfect as our own yet
it is hard for me to comprehend our universe or
a scries of universes encompassed by a sphere
that is probably an atom to someone still if wc
admit relativity we must admit such a probability
following this we arc confronted by the still
more incomprehensible probability of life within
the atom

  the theory of atomic energy used to stump me
until i debated the question of the atom itself
i avc ancc tried to picture a thousand suns in
titanic confusion if one can do that ono can
respect the atom

  yet i like to think of the infinite in small
doses and of the amazing unknown that baffles
our ignorance

  so into mysterious realms we seek for more
reality blindedly yet boldly thus we are ever
pioneers

history of scientific fiction

of the origin of scientific fiction little need be
said there arc traccs of the type in greece
where aristophcncs play the clouds took
place in an alchemists laboratory the arabian
thousand nights and a night offers various
examples of science in some of the stories

  until the time of poe however there was no
scientific literature of an influential character
written with the exception of a few stories by
bergerac voyages to the sun and moon and
swift gullivers travels the evolution of
the type really begins with stories such as
scheherazades thousand and second tale
mesmeric revelation and the balloon
hoax

  for fifteen years after poe there was a little fic-
tion of this kind written in  however jules
verne turned his pen toward the scientific story
and published five weeks in a balloon this
was followed by a trip to the center of the
earth  from the earth to the moon
 twenty thousand leagues under the
sea  the english at the north pole
 and around the world in eighty days
 in these books together with hector
servadac  were begun the scientific typo
f fiction and though their structure has been
modified their subject-matter expanded and their
craftsmanship developed they remain almost per-
fect models of their kind and they will always
o remain because their fundamental psychologi-
cal qualities-the very essence of their appeal-
embody the animating and motivating forces of
this branch of fiction one can no more ignore
their basic form when writing a scientific novel
than one can ignore the experimental researches
of marconi when building a radio

  after hector servadac probably his best
novel vernes work began to declinc and a new
author took his place in  appeared wells
time machine and the stolen baccillus and
others in the same year he wrote the won-
derful visit these were followed by the
island of dr moreau  the plattner

story and others  war of the worlds
 when the sleeper wakes  the
first men in the moon  food of the
gods  and the war in the air


  it was wells who carried on the tradition of
verne in england and by giving impetus to the
scientific-fiction idea and purifying its technio
paved the way for the numerous writers of the
present day

  until this time little had been done since poes
death in america there had been one little-
known writer lu scnarens whose stories writ-
ten about  have proved marvelously pro-
phetic with this exception no books had been
written which added to the technic or subject-
matter of the scientific story

  after wells however many american writers
entered the field at the head of a long list
are such names as a merritt garrett p serviss
and a hyatt vcrrill

  of the foreign writers germany has woll-
stonecraft who wrote frankenstein and many
others in england there are many writers in-
cluding winsor author of station x france
and sweden also have many contributors

  in closing a word should be said as to the
composition of the modern scientific story this
should contain about twenty-five per cent pure
science woven through almost any other type of
story this may be a romance as in gerns-
backs ralph c -f or a detective story as
in arthur b reeves novels

               words

to most minds the word science conveys the
idea of verity the writings or statements of
a scientist are accepted as authoritative and so-
called scientific conclusions are supposed to bo
absolute facts

  to the same minds the word fiction presents an
exactly opposite idea

  whether the meanings commonly given to
words should be the accepted ones or not is de-
batable but there is no question that a new word
like sciontifiction designed to present a definite
idea to mans mind should be exactly defined un-
less the definition is to be fabricated without re-
gard to the moanings of the sounds and forms
that have been used to convey certain ideas to
hearers and readers it should be constructed on
the basic meanings of those elements rather than
on the possibly erroneous one that usage has
given

  contrary to what might be expected one finds
that science does not need to mean in fact
basically does not mean fact without entering
into an extended discussion the real meaning of
the word leans more toward that of study investi-
gation research and collection of data than it
doe toward definition construction discovery or
even conclusions in fact a scientist is in reality
nothing more or less than a student and pure
science as such has never helped him to do other
than take what already has been found to exist
and by tests experiments and repeated analysis
or synthesis find out what results appear to follow

  on the other hand fiction is invention it is
always basically possible

  perhaps science says such is or is not possible
the truth is that most accepted facts of today
and yesterday were the fiction of the day before
which the science of the same day said and
proved were impossibilities

  scicntifiction then should mean and it should
be emphasized that it does mean a statement of
virtual possibilities that after they have becomo
or been found to be actual science can and will
classify dissect and otherwise take the eredit for
discovering

  there are several old sayings supposed to be
japanese in origin two of which are in substance
as follows

  it is impossible to think of something that
cannot be and one can not make a picture of
something that never was

  think them over

  science

from the beginning when he first discovered
that he could reason man has been search-
ing for the meaning of it all

  as he gazed into the infinite extent of the
heavens and beheld the twinkling of the evening
star as he cowered in the entrance of some dark
cavern watching the fury of the elements de-
vastate his choice hunting grounds or as he gazed
in awe at the little green thing which had sprung
from the little seed which he had hidden in the
ground he wondered in his primitive mind was
bom that little spark which has meant more to
mankind than any other single emotion-the de-
sire to know the desire to seek out and find
the meaning of all things

  today that little spark has grown into a mighty
conflagration we call it scientific investigation
or just science so far-reaching is it in its effect
on mankind that the very basis of our modem
civilization is founded on it no matter which
way we turn or what we do in some manner wc
come in contact with the products of science

  not only has it lightened the burdens of human-
ity conquered most of its curscs but it has
brought forth innumerable pleasures and con- s
vcniences and has brought forth the greatest
civilization the world has ever known

  more and more we are coming to recognize in
it tho greatest of all arts and to realize that the
greatest achievements of human endeavor are but
offspring of scientific investigation yet past
achievements in comparison to what is yet to be
discovered leads us to believe that wc are still in
the dark ages of scicntifio discoveries and that the
great truths yet loeked in the bosom of nature
are infinite in their possibilities thus the great
field of science is ever a great lure to the adven-
turous mind taxing the keenest intellects by its
unfathomable mysteries

  through the application of the laws of chem-
istry and physics man and nature have changed
the first elementary forms of matter into an in-
finite number of different forms these change
are continually going on and each day brings
forth at least one new discovery in the scicntifio
world

  we have made wonderful strides in the last
few years and as we advance in wisdom and un-
derstanding even greater discoveries will reward
our efforts yet regardless of our wisdom and
understanding regardless of our wonderful
achievements now or henceforth man will have
created nothing he will even as nature has
for countless ages merely have changed it in
form and substance man does not create tho
iron or steel which goes to make the great locomo-
tive or the steam that runs it he merely changes
and adapts it to his own ideas the power of
creation has and always will belong to the su-
preme architect alone and man is merely fulfill-
ing his destiny in adopting it to his own needs
and uses

  in the advancement of scientific endeavor per-
haps no other single thing has played a greater
part than scicntifiction or scientific imagination as
we shall cll it when we consider that prac-
tically all of the great inventions reforms and
ideas have been foretold in fiction long before
they became a fact when we consider that ali
of the great products and ideals of life must
first have been formed in the imagination of some
mans brain we can readily comprehend how
great an effect scicntifiction has had on tho
progress of science and invention this scien-
tific imagination or scientifiction need not be the
product of some inventors or scientists mind
and in most cases is not it merely starts a new
line of thought in their creative mind which
when worked out in its minutest details gives
to the world some new marvelous invention or
scientific discovery

  each new scientific story no matter how fan-
tastic it may sound is a new step on the ladder
of scientific endeavor which some day will con-
tribute to the realization of some great scientific
discovery or invention

  thus as the rugged pioneer was the fore-
runner of civilization so is scientifiction the fore-
runner of the marvelous inventions and scicntifio
achievements which arc to come

amazing stories quarterly

scientifiction th century prophet
and historian

the reading of scientifiction as  pastime can
hardly be equalled this type of literature
being a past master as an entertainer

  a person in a leisure moment picks up a copy
of this magazine one not blessed with a little
imagination picks up a mere magazine contain-
ing hosts of mad dreams a nightmare from cover
to cover impossible fairy tales belonging to a
past day

  a contrast as different as night from day is
present when a person with some imagination
does the same thing imagination that great
creator of arts machinery and civilizations not
unlike a great ray of brilliant light cutting the
surrounding blackness of established barriers
fortunate for us indeed the majority of us have
some imagination

   almost at once our instrument scientifiction
may become a mighty telescope dwarfing all
others in existence great as they are planets
and suns of other worlds arc brought nearer and
nearer at last they arc so near that after pick-
ing one at random its surface is minutely ex-
amined the topography studied strange cities of
other intelligent beings observed their machinery
methods and processes are watched

   the adjustment is changed our instrument be-
comes a gigantic interstellar ship of incredible
speed and power a destination is chosen among
the innumerable planets of space our giant ship
true to the directional impulses given by the
operator points her nose in space our chosen
destination rushes to meet us at an unbelievable
speed we land upon the strange surface of this
foreign land many are the adventures we meet
with strange creatures are met some with in-
telligence far below our own some with intelli-
gence as far superior factories wrokshops
chemical plants may be visited some equipped
with machinery and methods that stagger tho
earthling

  again the adjustment is changed our in-
strument becomes stationary but sends forth swift
messengers in the form of electrical energy they
return lo and behold before us are presented
scenes from the remotest past our very earth
may be observed in the making mountain river
ocean or lake the picture changes-come scenes
swarming with life some tiny creatures some
monsters some crawl fly or walk prehistorio
monsters all of whom have come and gone in
the place time provided for them

  again the adjustment is changed man has
become master kingdom court and palace are
seen from their beginning to their fall and end

   in fact the prehistoric record of anything from
insect to man from crude stone implements and
levers to modern day machinery may be ob-
served at the operators will truly a wonderful
instrument this scientifiction

is progress destructive

hold that evolution destroys nothing that
upon the contrary it ro-forms everything ever
bejter ever greater on and on throughout eternity
on beyond the scope of finite mind and that
finito mind is itself a part of the process which
expands its scope in ceaseless endlessness

   the success of scientifiction rests upon pre-
cisely the same factors as everything as life
itself those factors being the elements of which
it is composed the same as those of any other
body together with the elements influencing or
being influenced by it it remains with the
directing power of the body to determine whether
it is to expand through the harmonious process
of evolution or be destroyed through the revo-
lutionary process of conflicting elements

  science is one of the most absolute factors
known to man beyond its finality tho human
mind does not function though it blends with
and lends itself more readily to romance and
adventure than any subject yet discovered its
only parallel is perhaps the positivencss of the
sun in its relation to its own negative light

   only limitless things endure no less the hopes
of man than all else upon the summits just
within the horizon of imagination we erect struc-
tures of our desires toward which we struggle
and for which we are paid in the coin of hopes
and realization only to find that nature is
boundless affording new material new horizons
with their ceaseless fulfillment and their endless
pi rations

   this should be the goal of scientifiction cease-
less realization and endless inspiration to this
end we would suggest without in any way dis-
crediting such that stories too prolific in tech-
nical science for the average reader to grasp
those in which fiction is too detached from known
facts and those implying that evolution and
science aro fundamentally destructive be cur-
tailed in favor of those of greater inspirational
value

   of the latter the sunken world is an ex-
cellent and highly interesting example instead
of the pessimistic conclusion that evolutionary
development of mind is only at the sacrifice of
all things beautiful with the human form de-
generating into hideous creatures and that in-
tellectual development leads inevitably to self
destructive creatures a conclusion unsupported by
any known fact in the larger sense this talc
pictures evolutionary development always and
eternally hopeful aqd inspirational

   not only does tho author of this delightful ro-
mance appeal to the higher instincts he has i be-
lieve struck an entirely new chord in literary
harmony having arrived at what appeared to
be the ultimate of perfection in human rela-
tionships which would doubtless leave humanity
stagnant and inert he discovers in the new
conditions which he created a new horizon as
suggested by the emergence party of
atlantis

   this author creates a condition of ceaseless
fulfillment and endless aspiration as opposed to
the limitations of those who would destructively
circumscribe life

   it is so with scientifiction if its goal is cease-
less fulfillment and endless inspiration it will
carry absolute science entertainingly into the men-
tal atmospheres which it helps to create and ad-
versely if it creates a mental atmosphere of
limitations in which the future is not worth the
effort to attain satiated the mind will revolt
and for scientifiction oblivion along with its
fictional creatures of destruction

scientifiction an inspiration for future
scientific progress
ilthat magazine publishes the most ridiculous
x absurd and insipid stories that have ever
been placed before the public remarked an execu-
tive whoso entire life had been spent in the pro-
saic confines of a san francisco office

   why feel that way i inquired

   because it publishes trash rot piffle  the
pictures are onough to warn any sane person not
to waste time reading it

   they call the stories scientifiction meaning
scientific fiction they dont claim them to be
possible and readers like myself find many po-
tential scientific conquests in them

   scientific conquests be damned i youve been
telling me of machines that travel through space
-sunken cities-fourth dimension-visiting other
planets bah i its all rotl a fine young man
like you should find a more educational way to
spend his time

  but i find the magazine inspiring so do
many others dont you think your prosaio sur-
roundings and uneventful life have made you

the future of scientifiction

scientifiction romances quite commonly
deal with the likely social and scientific develop-
ments of days to come but the future of tho
scientifiction story itself is not often considered

  we believe it merits as much attention as has
 been given for example the art of the short
 story for it is form peculiarly adapted to the
 modem age and its astonishing growth in popu-
 larity is rapidly lifting it from a dangerous prox-
 imity to tho nickle library

  this rise into good favor has been not a little
 aided by the contributions of established authors
 too there have been writings on scientifiction
 themes of such delicate beauty and astounding
 imagery that they can hardly be denied a place in
 the worlds literature

  the novel as a literary form is not very old
 a hundred and fifty years or so has seen its rise
 and development it has been concerned with
 the interrelations of mon and women with em-
 phasis upon character portrayal as a form it
 will probably continue to lead all creative writing
 for we do not mean to suggest it is to be sup-
 planted but a now element has entered into our
 life touching every point and now entering our
 literature this is the machine

  literature must welcome it from all indica-
 tions our living will be based upon machines for
 some years at least until the destructive folly of
 man again halts progress and as some of the
 tales have it this may not be in any far dis-
 tant day

  until such a time we look to scientifiction to
 supply a considerable amount of imaginative im-
 petus necessary to further inventive advance in
 ventors and experimenters ace being presented
 with a wealth of refreshing and stimulating ideas
 which will multiply as time goes on

  this value is supplemented by another the
really important educational work performed by
these stories in making their large group of read-
ers well represented by the younger generation
scientifically minded we can picture almost any
cataclysmic crisis finding numerous folk quite fa-
miliar and able to cope with it

  these are the obvious benefits that the future
 will bring as our life grows more complex we
 will demand more of fantasy in our reading as a
 relief from the strain of existence and since
 scientific progress is continually catching up fu-
 ture scientifiction writers will have to push
 further into the unknown there can be no pre-
 dicting what trails they will blaze or what king-
 doms of nature they will throw open the amaz-
 ing story of a hundred or even twenty-five year

some comments on the sunken
world

editor amazing stories quarterly

these remarks concern chiefly the story-
the sunken world by stanton a cob-
jentz which not considering its length was
to my mind the best story in the summer
 edition of the quarterly i note that
mention is made in the editorial comment on
the story of the likelihood of certain critics
picking out flaws in the hydraulics in tho
story this set me thinking and i have just
completed figuring various pressure values and
looking up the tensile strengths of glass and
teel here are my conclusions

ordinary fresh water weighs approximate-
ly  pounds per cubic foot but in the
case of atlantis we are dealing with sea
water which has a higher specific gravity
 consequently sea water weighs 
pounds per cubic foot so that at a depth of
exactly one mile i am imagining that the
mean or average depth of the dome of at-
lantis is exactly  feet the pressure would
be  pounds per square foot or
 tons per square foot this is exactly
 pounds per square inch which is a
small pressure when compared with those ob-
tained by investigators such as basset the
french experimenter he obtained a pressure
of  kilograms per square centimeter
page  of july  science and in-
vention which corresponds to 
pounds per square inch this enormous pres-
sure in liquid media by-thc-way was re-
tained by a steel cylinder two inches thick

on making references i found the ratio
in tensile strength of crown glass to united
states tool steel to be  therefore a
similar ratio should exist with respect to abil-
ity to withstand pressure if  am wrong
here please inform me mr editor

however the fictitious atlantcans were said
to have a super-glass which would no doubt
be much stronger than ordinary glass-and
tho ratio given in the preceding paragraph
would be smaller

if these figures are correct i do not think
a single flaw can be found in the hydraulics of
the sunken world

as to the other stories in this edition-all
i can do is to quote the frenchman superb 
sincerely yours

        frauds d uffelman

                  mechanic street

                          camden n j
ps-i think the sunken world should
have a sequel and i will send in an idea for
one in my next letter i havent forgotten the
prize editorial

this is the second criticism which mr
coblcntzs story has received we are glad
that you liked it there is no doubt that
atlantis was subjected as regards this dosing
case to an enormous pressure per square inch
atlantis was subjected to a greater compres-
sion of course the compressive strength of
steel is very much greater than that of glass
but the inhabitants of the atlantis may have
had a special glass it is enormous pressure
exerted by water of great depths that limits
the vertical range if we may so term it of
the submarine if a submarine snk when in
the depths depicted in this story it would un-
doubtedly collapse the resistance of a ma-
terial to compression cannot be deduced from
its tensile strength-editor

a difficult point in out of the sub-
universe

editor amazing stories quarterly

i was very much interested in the story out
of the sub-universe by r f starzl which
you published in tho summer edition of the
quarterly but i was quite puzzled by a few
points

the story states that the eloktronites were
admitted to citizenship after they had been in-
creased in size now the professor says that
due to the great difference in size between the
sub-universe and our own there is also a
great difference in time therefore before he
tould blink his eye ilalc and shirley and
many generations of their children had lived
their lives and died if this is true how
could the elektronites who were brought to
earth live longer than the smallest fraction
of a second of our time

  even if the elektronites were transferred to
the earth wouldnt the length of their life
cycle remain the same i would like to know
if i am wrong about this

everett beran

                      mitchell ave
                     waco texas

  you must not take stories of the type of
out of the sub-universe too seriously we
can assume in transferring the elektronites
to our sphert that their life cycle might be
increased in length although the stories are
supposed to embody correct science there must
be room for fancy and invention and that
gives the nicest possible touch to our authors

a pleasant letter from a reader of
the quarterly

editor amazing stories quarterly

  i have been reading amazing stories
quarterly for the second time but it didnt
take me as long as that to discover that it is
an excellent marazine the reason that i
first bought the quarterly was because of an
advertisement in the monthly i found that
although the reading matter was very good
it was the ideas that wero by far the best
part of the magazine

  i usually read before i go to sleep and i
found that after reading a storv i could lie
awake for hours just thinking of the different
ideas expressed in it i would weigh the facts
and reasons for theories until i reached my
own conclusions and then satisfied i would
fall asleep quickly and perhaps dream about
the story

  often upon reaching my own conclusions i
spend many pleasant hours trying to imagine
what would happen if the theories were facts
i also enjoy placing myself in tho position of
one of the characters in the story and like to
ponder upon what i would do if i were that
character

  not only do i get enjoyment from these
stories but i learn many interesting factslthat
i never knew before however aside from
that it ha also awakened my interest in
science as a result of that i am now sav-
ing money so as to be able to subscribe to
the amazing stories quarterly and month-
ly

  i also find it very interesting to compare
some of the theories of writers such as poe
and verne to the modern inventions which
their theories greatly resemble of course
when they lived modern inventions such as
the submarine and airplanes lived only in the
minds of those men and that makes it all the
more remarkable

next we come to the magazine itself i
believe that the length of the stories picked i

srfcct because it should please the multitude
a reader likes book size stories there is al-
ways at least one of those stories in every
issue if a reader finds that short stories are
what he likes best he is also bound to find
a few short stories i personally think that
a serial would not only please many readers
but that it would greatly increase the number
of copies sold

  although the amazing stories quarterly
is a very good magazine i believe it could be
greatly improved if a few more illustrations
were added i also think that it would be an
excellent idea to have an artide in which
you publish sdcntific news

  next we come to the discussions depart-
ment i believe that it is the best feature of
the whole magazine not only docs it give
me the opinion of others but it also gives me
an enjoyable hour comparing my ideas with
the ideas of the contributors to the discussions

  this is from a youthful reader

  there are certainly ideas in the stories we
publish in many cases it may be said there
is a lot of impossibility contained our point
is to give stories to make our readers think
it has been very truthfully said that an hour
of thinking is worth a great many hours of
reading if the spending of four or five hours
of reading amazing stories can effect your
thinking for a like number of hours we will
feel that wc have accomplished our mission
it is interesting to find this exact idea brought
out in your letter-editor

a lot of advice and suggestions
about the quarterly

editor amazing stories quarterly

this idea of your viewpoint is good

  may i give my opinion of some of the
stories

   to be fair i might start with the annual
in the first place i wish you would design
the cover design of the quarterly after that
of the annual ie the arrangement of
words it was mach more novel and digni-
fied please consider that

   and now for the stories published in the
annual they were the best you have ever
published that issue was the best you have
ever put out better than the monthlies and
better than any of the three quarterlies and
though i dont always like pauls drawings
they were wonderful in that issue why dont
you repeat by bringing out another wonderful
issue like this what you need arc more
stories by a merritt and a hyatt verrill and
edgar rice burroughs those three authors
are of high order but their stories appear so
seldom in the monthly and quarterly that
one would believe theyre lost austin hall
the author of the man who saved tho
earth is a good author why dont you
get some more stories by him

   the master mind of mars was wonderful
the face in the abyss in a merritts
poetical prose was indeed a masterpiece you
promised a sequel that has never been forth-
coming for heavens ake hurry it up
the man who saved the earth was fine
give us more like that the people of the
pit was certainly a great atmospheric story
give us more like that

   in the winter edition of the quarterly the
only things that i liked were when the
sleeper wakes and the moon of doom
terrors of the upper air was also right
good but most of them were modiocre

   in the spring edition a modern atlantis
was good but i got tired of it before the end
came it was a good story though the
nth man was good too but a little impos-
sible even though the author made it almost
convincing it was well written and i liked
it when a hyatt verrill wrote the king
of tho monkey men he certainly wrote some
story it was great get some more by this
author the second swarm was very good
and the vibrator of death contained a
good idea and was well written but not even
these carno up to the stories in the annual

   the summer quarterly is the nearest ap-
proach to the annual of anything you have
put out sometimes i am almost convinced
that the summer quarterly is as good as
the annual was frankly i dont know
out of the sub-universe was very good
but it seems to me that the prof would have
to work pretty fast or the people would die
before he could grow them to any size at all
in other words they would die and their chil-
dren with them very likely not one would
have lived through the process why count
less generations must have been born and
died even while the prof made them grow
sounds impossible but it was a good story

   the menace was the finest set of short
stories you have published dr keller has
certainly found his medium let him stick to
it if all the detective stories you ever pub-
lished were as good as these i would have
no kick otherwise lets have no detective
stories the best thiags about these stories
is their possibility they are very human too
dr keller can certainly handle pathos but
i do think that ebony kate should have known
what senile means since she could speak
the language so well whenever the mood took
her that was one incongruity but it was
not sdentifical ten days to live was
right good but i dont see yet why the ma-
chine should have been in the tree neverthe-
less the story was good but how in the
dickens did he expect to get the earth nearer
the sun with a disintegration wave i dont
think this was made plain but what does it
really matter when we get so much pleasure
from the story itself

   now the sunken world was wonderful
i dont pretend to believe that a continent
could be gradually lowered into the depth of
the seas as the author would have you be-
lieve i dont see it also what did the

people use for building material after the
ages had worn away the houses but why
break the wonderful spell to me this story
is a wonderful though not always competent
fusion of the powers of h g wells and a
merritt it reminds me somewhat of wells
men like gods though the latter is a
more beautiful story however onco in a
while we catch a glint of a merritts poetry
but he is sadly commonplace at times and
ruins his own castles in the air or water
without seeming to realize that he always
calls aelios- the blue-eyed golden-haired
one which to my mind is not poctio at all
he should have been sincere and called her
aelios all the way through

   in spite of this stanton a coblentz has
certainly created a modem satire almost com-
parable at times to swift with his biting
gullivers travels mr coblentz is never
quite so bitter as swift but when the climax
the destruction of the sunken world comes
he undoubtedly though maybe not con-
sciously climbs te very heights of satire all
the way through wc can see cruel arrows shot
at the heart of the modem world until in the
end he has torn down our veneer and dis-
graced us forever the story is powerful i
have no doubt it will live i wonder whether
the story was written consciously as a satire
or merely as a gem of scientifiction at any
rate it is a gem i hope to hear more from
stanton a coblentz

   the pictures to this story were perfectly
wonderful paul certainly scored this time no
matter how bad some of his material has
been now to my young mind it seems
strange however to find the author say the
hero had a board and find the artist draw a
handsome clean-shaven man why do you
let paul do it the author didnt mention a
shave

  heres to a better amazing stories
quarterly though it couldnt be much bet-
ter but one bit of advice a new name a
new style of presentation and better stories
in the monthly after a while everybody
will desert tho latter and buy this publication
exclusively

   now dont forget to consider the idea of
modelling the quarterly after the annual
and why dont you publish the magazine tho
size of the litcrarv digest you would save
postage and thus be able to give us a better
binding and better paper

   think it over-and best luck

   what you say about our stories in this
letter put us to a certain extent before a
troublesome proposition it is not easy always
to get stories by specific authors the stories
we have published by mr merritt were re-
prints and buitoughs story the land that
ime forgot is a reprint we shall keep in
mind what you say and try to correspond with
your desires see how you like mr verrills
story which appears in this issue you seem
to want us to model the quarterly after the
annual but immediately before that you say
that there is danger of people deserting the
monthly for the quarterly what we will
do is to try to keep them up to a uniform
standard your letter shows that you do ap-
preciate our efforts to please our many read-
ers-editor

more frequent publication asked for
by a reader professional men
read amazing stories

editor amazing stories quarterly

   after having been addicted to your maga-
zine since its first appearance on the market
 thought perhaps you would be interested in
an idea of mine which concerns the so-called
wild stories which you publish

   in the manuscript enclosed under separate
cover i have tried to show that the afore-
mentioned wild stories have an important
place in literature and are of inestimable
value to the average office man

   i have made inquiries concerning the types
of people who read your publication and have
formed not to my surprise ideas which have
always seemed to be the concensus of opinion
in your discussion columns

   i have found that doctors lawyers and busi-
ness men nuke up the most of your readers
in not a few cases i have also found that the
newsstand salesman himself is an avid reader
from one of the latter i received a sugges-
tion which might be of interest to you he
said that for the most part people coming in
to his store were discouraged by the weird ap-
pearing covers and the title amazing stories

   it has always seemed to me a little child-
like for a person of normal intelligence to
wish to be amazed it is a hard thing to ex-
plain but i have had the feeling myself when

 picking up your publication that i was afraid
 someone was watching me-like a grown man
 found playing with his small sons toy train

 it is probably a neuropathic viewpoint but
 why would scientifiction not serve equally
 well 

 there is another publication weird tales
 by name which is quite similar to your own
 the only difference seems to be that they occa-
 sionally print morbid articles and stories which
 lack the sparkle and science of your contribu-
 tions i hope that your magazine never be-
 comes weird the name weird tales
 by the way is another instance of the same
 nature s that i have just observed upon i
 always hated to be seen buying it at a news-
 stand much the same feeling exists when a
 gray-haired old lawyer is asked to buy a true
 confession magazine for his young daughter i

 the average man is looking for something
 clean and different from the ordinary sex stor-
 ies sea stories and so forth i think that
 your publication supplies this want and has
 also promoted a greater elasticity of mind
 among its readers i know that it has been
 the basis of several scientific arguments among
 my friends-arguments which were only settled
 by reference to books of physics and chem-
 istry in this way the public will force them-
 selves to read books which they have heretofore
 erroneously considered dry if there is any
 way in which it would be possible to print
 amazing stories oftener i for one would
 willingly go without dinner to make up the
 extra expenditure

 wishing you all the luck in the world in
 your forthcoming publications i remain

 the subject of frequency of publication of
 amazing stories has been much discusscd and
 carefully considered and we felt that the
 quarterly with its increased size solved the
 problem of suiting everybody those who wish
 a more frequent magazine can buy both while
 those who are content with a monthly publica-
 tion can buy the monthly only wc are very
 gratified if you have found that doctors law-
 yers and business men make up the most of
 our readers if anybody would take the
 trouble to look at our covers they will see
 they are not weird in any sense but arc care-
 fully studied out by the artist who has proved
 himself to have a special talent for scientific
 subjects popularly treated we certainly do
 not propose to let our magazine become weird
 we can ny say regarding the more frequent
 publication that it is still in the future and
 that the quarterly indicates at least one step
 in that direction-editor

 educational value of amazing stories

 editor amazing stories quarterly

 let me take this opportunity of complimenting
 you on your quarterly for spring everv story
 was interesting especially the second swarm 
 about the only story i didnt care for was the
 vibrator of death i think that you can get
 enough scientifiction stories without using detec-
 tive stones your monthly is also a wonderful
 book and i look forward to getting it every month

 i am a high school graduate and am at present
 working as an assistant shipping clerk in a clothing
 concern in my city if it were not for your maga-
 zine all that i ever learned about science would
 have been forgotten long ago really the stories set
 me to thinking and i get more out of this
 magazine in the way of education than i learn
 in a months time in any other way your
 magazine is surely proving a cultural benefit to
 myself i am interested in forming some kind
 of a science club as has been discussed in your
 magazine and would deem it an insult if i were
 not considered when such a club is organized

 i liko stories of interplanetary travel and works
 by such authors as a hyatt verrill francis flagg
 and burroughs let us have fewer stories by
 verne and poe and those other old timers these
 stories may have been good fifty years ago but
 arc old and no good now

 you must not overlook the fact that we have
 a varied circle of readers to please and that de-
 tective stories which give plenty of scope for
 science are favorites with many you speak of
 our magazine setting you to thinking thinking
 is a most important thing in this world an
 hour of thinking may be worth many hours of
 reading and our best work we may assume is in
 tho direction of making our readers think you
 are now in business bnt we strongly advise vou
 to keep up your culture your appreciation
 of tho importance of thinking which is implied in
 your letter is a very good sign when the
 science club is organized your application for
 membership will receive tho fullest consideration

various notes on the quarterly stories

  editor amazing stories quarterly

i certainly have welcomed the quarterly

   i like it because the stories arc au in one
   issue and not in serial form this is the
   sccond year i have been getting the monthly
   and was glad to sec the quarterly i will
   not comment on the first two issues only the
   latest one or the summer issue the first
   story i turned to was the out of the sub-
   universe i enjoyed it because of its sur-
   prise ending which was some surprise to me
   next i read the series of four stories and
   found them interesting toward the end of
   the first story the menace the events came
   as it seemed to me so rapidly that i had
   to read it over in order to get it dearly the
   other three stories were interesting too they
   are tho type of story i like and i hope to sec
   jnore of them

    the next story i read was ten days to
  live i thought that it was very good and
  interesting it kept me in suspense and i felt
  relieved at the end when the inachiue was dis-
  covered and stopped

    the last story was the sunken world
  which  consider after just finishing it ex-
  cellent there is only one slight criticism
  which i have to make that is when the
  water was rushing in through the crack why
  did not the surrounding edge give way under
  the strain and the water rusk iu and inundate
  everything at once or if it did when the sub-
  marine went to the upper world for help why
  did it not happen before they left soon after
  the water began to come in

the story ccrtainly makes some of our pres-
ent day customs and habits look ridiculous

 some of the ways of the submerged city seem
so simple compared to our complicated ones

     as to the ending i do not see why when
  they saw the sunken world flooded they re-
  turned to investigate it did not seem quite
  finished the way it stood

    now for something else why not have a
  questionnaire as you have in the monthly

     also i hone that you get more letters of
  commcnt and that your viewpoint grows
  as has discussions in the monthly

                       sanford avenue
                            irvington n j

     your very dear letter tells its own story
   it was rather natural that water should not
   succeed in enlarging the crack but as ono
   looks hack to the story it makes one sorry
   for the poor inhabitants of the modern atlan-
   tis who seem to have solved the problem of
   virtuous lives only to be drowned it was
   natural that an effort should have been made
   to return do not people try to go to the
   arctic and antarctic poles of the earth-

the effect of cover designs on circulation

editor amazing stories quarterly

  just recently received my copy of tho spring
edition quarterly amazing stories and wish to
compliment you at this time on the cover design

   a design of this kind appears to be much more
appropriate than some of the pictures that arc
used if you would allow me to offer a sugges-
tion i would say that cover designs of this de-
scription on the regular monthly would i be-
lieve help your drculation for many people
have a bug-a-boo about purchasing literature
with as wild fantastic covers as some of your
editions have displayed

  as far as i am concerned personally your
magazine meets with my entire approval and i
believe the day will come when people who sneer
at it today and consider it a compilation of non-
sense will say amazing stories was the pioneer
and forerunner of present day literature

   as i have not as yet completed the lost at-
lantis i cannot tell you at this time just how
these stories appeal to me but as far as i have
gone into this first story it is vary interesting
and at the same time is very probable

   i trust you will allow me to express my opin-
ions in your discussions department when i havo
finished the edition

  your magazine is the only magazine which i
read at present in fact i have read no other
magazines or periodicals of any description with
the exception of astronomical data sincc your
first publication of amazing stories

  your remarks about the covers are interest-
ing our artists and editors give a great deal of
thought to those designs and with their represen-
tation of apparatus and the imaginary products
of the authors brain they show much ingenuity
we want our cover page illustrations to be good
we want them to fit the story thoroughly and this
is really a controlling thought and it is not
merely a question of how they will affect the
public but if they are good the desired result

an interesting theory about the maximum
possible speed of an airplane

 editor amazing stories quarterly

   in your last quarterly edition of amazing
 stories i found the moon of doom by mr
 earl t bell a very fascinating educating and
 scientific story one critidsm that i make re-
 fers to the fact that mr bell states in his story
 that an airplane suspended by wings and driven
 by propellers is capablc of attaining a speed of
  miles per hour this i believe is quite im-
 possible

 my theory is

 	physics gives us the rule

    a	molecules of air travel no faster than 
       miles per sccond

   b	this would equal  meters per
      hour

    c	but one mile equals  meters

   d	therefore - miles per hour

    e	therefore the airplane would be traveling
 faster than the molecule of air which would cause
 a permanent ffcrtial vacuum behind the wings and
 propellers 

 it is easy to sec that an airplane could not pro-
 gress against the opposition of such a vacuum

               cadet douglas riccks

kemper military school
boonville mo

 your critidsm is a little far-fetched if a vac-
 uum is created back of the airplane a compression
 of the air will be crcatcd in front of it so that
 tho propellers would seem to have better material
 to work on if we may so express it and even the
 wings might benefit by the vacuum as it is now an
 accepted theory that tho principal support of an
 airplane is due to a partial vacuum on the upper
 surface of the wing but for the benefit of the
 story it would seem to be an authors license to
 speed up his airplanei a bit beyond probabilities or
 perhaps possibilities-editor

a voice from india

 editor amazing stories quarterly

   as you know i am a regular reader of
 amazing stories and have taken great in-
 terest in the two quarterlies that have been
 out and which arrived in bombay a few days
 ago

   i	am very much in favor of such quarter-
 lies and the stories up to now have been very
 good but what i dont like is the crowding
 out of good-sized stories by very long ones
 for example in tho winter edition when
 the sleeper wakes occupies full  pages
 and all the other five stories or at least four
 of them arc very short

   in the second quarterly the system in
 which the stories were arranged was very
 nice all the stories are moderate in length
 and there is no story the length of which
 makes us afraid to begin it

   when the sleeper wakes is more or less
 a novel which can be had anywhere and to
 print it in a magazine of less than  pages
 docs not sound correct

    another thing in your magazino that i like
 most are the illustrations i should like the
 amazing stories to contain as many

   its a very great bother to buy the
 quarterly here in bombay and it is an
 equally great bother to subseribo to it every
 year because the system of exchange and the
 sending of money in any form to america is
 very troublesome can you suggest any way

                             bombay india

    one point about the quarterly is that it
 must have no continued stories and we have
 always felt that to a certain extent it is a
 magazine for the longer typo of stories and
 this is the reason why as much as over seventy
 pages were given to one story very numerous
 stories that come to us vary greatly in length
 and in many cases the long ones arc very
 good tho principle of the editors is to do as
 little editing as possible so that the author
 shall tell his story in his own way we aro
 sure that if when the sleeper wakes had
 been cut down by us the story would have
 been injured if not ruined our readere should
 feel that the quarterly has a definite work
 to do one of the things being to take care
 of long stories when they seem to us to be of
 a high degree of merit with regard to sub-
 scribing can you not send an international
 money order which would completely solv the
 problcni for you and wc can give vou the
 magazine regularly so that you would get more

general approval of our efforts

 editor auazixg stories quarterly

   having subscribed to amazing stories since
 its first issue i think that i must express my
 thanks for tho instruction and entertainment
 which i have derived from it

    in the spring quarteiuv i think the sccond
  swarm is about the best interplanetary story
  ive read the modern atlantis and the
  nth man were extremely good

    i have liked every story you have ever printed
  so far dont stop letting us have plenty of
  h g wells ho sure can write your artist
  paul has a difficult task which he performs excel-
  lently i think that it would be better to change
  the name of our magazine to scientifiction as i
  think the came amazing stories gives many
  people a wrong impression making them class it
  with weird talcs mystery storiea etc i
  like amazing stories however

   the quarterly i think is a very good com-
 promise between a monthly and semi-monthly i
 dont think a semi-monthly would be a good idea
 too much of  good thing is cloying you know
 all complete stories in the quarterly and serials
 in the monthly i think should be continued

   i think that amazing stories is filling a
 definite want to the reading publiq which has
 long needed a magazine of this type

    heres hoping for even greater success for our
  magazine

baldwin anciand

                  george school bucks co pa
  your point of view as regards the frequency
  of publication of amazing stories goes to justify
  us in what wo are doing giving a monthly and
  a quarterly and keeping them distinct so that no
  story is continued from one to the other and in
  the quarterly no continued stories arc given so
  as to avoid a jong wait between the success-
  sive instalments we are glad to find you calling
  amazing stories our magazine we want it to
  be such-editor

perpetual motion a science club
suggested

 editor amazing stories quarterly

   i have been reading your amazing stories off
 and on and i have bought two quarterlies and
 enjoyed them all the moon of doom the
 sccond swarm and the terrors of the upper
 air were splendid when the sleeper wakes
 was too dry for me baron m finch hausen is a
 good story the invisible man and the blue
 dimension were the best in june the yeast
 men and the revolt of the pcdstrians were
 about the best in april

    as i am a freshman in high school i hope you
  will try to explain the enclosed clipping because i
  am deeply interested in anything pertaining to
  science

          louis gardner

              north lawndale chicago iii
  we do not publish the clipping you refer to but
  the subject of perpetual motion i very interesting
  at the present time it is in a sense entering on its
  third stage a number of years ago a doctrine
  which was absolutely wrong was evolved and was
  known as the conservation of force this was
  to the effect that the total amount of force in the
  universe never changed tho truth is that it is per-
  petually changed and this is the first stage of the
  doctrine affecting perpetual motion in the second
  stage tho doctrine was made intelligible and sen-
  sible by stating that the sum of energy in the uni-
  verse was fixed and unvaried this was held as
  an absolute matter of faith until recent times when
  some doubt is beginning to be felt about it if a
  machine in running or moving would supply or
  create the necessary energy to keep in motion for-
  ever that would be perpetual motion from the
  standpoint of ordinary physics and mechanics no
  such machine can be constructed and perpetual mo-
  tion seems absolutely impossible in the mechanical
  sense it is hard to see how any development of
  molecular atomic or electronic developments can
  ever mako perpetual motion possible-editor

amazing stories and its cover

   editor amazing stories quarterly

       i am writing this letter to express my ap-
    preciation of amazing stories it has been
    the means of passing many pleasant hours voy-
    aging into the deathless realms of the imag-

   ination and i have derived from those month-
   ly trips through its pages knowledge inspira-
   tion and pleasure

     i have very little criticism to make of tho
   magazine or of the authors i read ihe dis-
   cussions each and every month and for the
   most part i cant sec why so many of the
   readers delight in tossing brickbats at you
   they speak of your covers if it hadnt been
   for the covcr i dont believe i ever would
   have noticed the magazine

     the quarter y is excellent it is improv-
   ing with each issue i have all the issues of
   amazing stories from the first one and i
   treasure it as a valuable library of information
   l ou should publish more stories like the
   second swarm and the skylark of space
   this latter one is the best of all to date in
   my opinion it has humor intrigue plot aus
   pense and all the elements that go to make up
   a great story i have enjoyed every chapter of
   this story to the full

     amazing stories has such a hold on me
  that i have almost decidcd to try my hand at
  writing a story but since its rather hard for
  new authors to break into print i am waiting
  until such time as i can improve inv tcchniqufe
  more power lo amaziso stoxibs

                 harry r wickline

        	ilinton west virginia

     we do not pretend to enjov brickbats but
   we are going to go on and pul tlierolex-
   eept when they arc ajionymous we have no
   comment to make except-to the effect that wo
   appreciate thoroughly your good wishes and
   your compliments-editor

continued from poor 
from now will be built upon a wealth of inven

   e and social progress that we can imagine how-
   ever inaccurately -only through the pen of -one
   present scientifiction writer

   we believe further that much development ii
   coming in ihe use of psychology and the mind as
   themes and that mental and spiritual forces will
   be more and more commonly dealt with these
   elements belong to the subject as surely os the
   latest model space-flyer

   more than any other a scientifiction author is
   unrestricted to conventions in his choice of mi-
   ilis treatment only some degree of
   plausibility is asked however unlikely it should
   rot be inconceivable this freedom should work
   ns a unifying influence and must eventually bring
   many subjects and views to serious consideration
   that have hitherto been overlooked and scorned

   whatever the plot and scene variation of future
   romances we are certain that kaleidoscopic imagi
   nation and beauty of expression will continue to
   make for popularity
