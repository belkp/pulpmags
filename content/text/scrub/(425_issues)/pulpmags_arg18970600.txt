chapter i-startling news

t t was four oclock of a warm september afternoon a heavily built
striking looking fellow of three and twenty came rapidly along the nar-
row streets toward the water front and halted at the door of the shipping
firm above which was the sign of undercliff  monckton his height and
breadth of shoulders were noticeable even among the brawny truckmen and
roustabouts who loitered on the curb and his carriage and alert movements
betrayed the all round athlete

   as he entered the outer office a group of clerks was gathered about
an individual who leaned negligently against one of the desks this central
figure was a fellow of about the newcomers age of slight build a dark
complexion and dressed in the heght of fashion

      hullo  heres another harvardite    exclaimed one of the clerks  how
are you mr thorne

   the newcomer returned the greeting cordially but did not appear to
notice the man of the dark complexion

    howdy deah boy drawled the latter languidly extending his gloved
hand

    but thorne bowed coolly failing to see the hand and passed on to a rear
door marked  chas under cliff private

     hes a regular bore dont ye know he heard the languid individual
say as he opened the door

    there was but one occupant of the room a man of fifty years perhaps
with iron gray mustache and an upright carriage he was pacing the floor
when thorne entered but turned to him with outstretched hand and a wel-
come smile as he heard the latch click

    ah howard  im delighted to see you he said returning the
younger mans warm pressure  ive been looking for you for an hour

      i was on the river when your note reached me and had to go to my

      a
 

a secret of the south pacific

rooms to change my boating flannels for something which i could appear
down town in and thorne with a laugh dropped into a convenient chair
before the baize covered table  but whats in the wind guardy 

   the expression of the elder mans face changed instantly his eyes
shifted their gaze from the frank countenance of his questioner and a deep line
appeared between his brows he set to pacing the floor again with nervous
strides

    oh-ah-well howard i hardly know how to tell you i received
some news today that has quite upset me

    on which ou want the benefit of my experience laughed the other
   a little smile played under mr undercliffs mustache for an instant

    not exactly my boy but it is something you must know

    drive ahead then sir

   i-i wish i could drive ahead returned the older man hesitatingly
 but to tell you the truth i scarcely know how to begin

   the others face betrayed his surprise and curiosity

    you wonder what has shaken me so pursued mr undercliff  all
howard old memories have been stirred today that have slept for years
little wonder that i am shaken  

     has it to do with me t 

        yes  

    about me

    no my boy it is about your father

   the young man started

    my father  he repeated  i should like to hear about him it is true
i believe you have never told me very much concerning him he died
twenty years ago-before i could remember him-did he not  

   undercliff halted in his walk and faced the younger man he placed
both hands upon the table and leaned forward with his shrewd eyes fixed
upon thornes face	

    it is a fact howard  i have never told you much about your parents
otherwise i think i have done my duty by you he said with some emo-
tion

    my dear friend cried the other  you could not have treated me more
kindly or liberally had i been your ovn son

    thank ou my boy i have looked upon you as my son but perhaps
i should have told you something more about your own father ere this but

i had always believed him dead- 

   believed him dead interrupted thorne springing to his feet

 then-then-

   today i have had news which leads me to believe the opposite said
charles undercliff quietly

    for heavens sake sir explain  gasped the young man  do you
mean that my father is alive   

    something that has occurred on the opposide side of the globe news of
which only reached us toda leads me to believe that he is but sit down
howard calm yourself let me tell you the whole story-and a sad
a secret of the south pacific



bitterly sad one it is if you can forgive me the mistake which i made in
the past  

   his voice broke a little and he turned his eyes away from the younger
mans face  my dear guardian exclaimed thorne  i can forgive you any-
thing  

   thank you my boy now listen to me you father edgar thorne
and i were friends all through our boyhood and room mates at college
when my father died and left me his shipping business i at once took your
father into the office as confidential clerk monckton had filled the same
position with my father and it was at the old mans request that i gave
him a partnership in the business your father married soon after coming
with s and your mother-who was one of the finest women i ever saw-
died a few weeks after you were born i have always let you suppose that
your father died soon after your mother

   but he did not he was completely broken down by your mothers
death he had seemed almost to live for her and cared for nothing when
she was gone not even for you my poor boy but you mustnt feel harsh
toward him for that he would have loved you as you grew older

    edgar was an entirely different man from me continued mr under-
cliff retrospectively  when he was younger he had been a little wild at
times-especially during our college days but i think that my influence-i
was always a regular sober sides you know-i think my influence did much
to keep him straight then when he was married he was so much in love
with your dear mother that he hadnt a thought for anything else outside of
business

    i think he began to drink a little at first to drown the thoughts
of his loss then he got to gambling he craved excitement-anything
to deaden the remembrance of his happiness

     finally his mode of life came to my ears i remonstrated with him-
at first as a friend afterward as i saw it did no good i spoke to him as an
employer god forgive me if i spoke harshly i meant it for the best he
promised to brace up only a few days after that he changed the combina-
tion of the firms safe we did that quarterly i was away that day and he
did not tell monckton the new combination he wrote it upon a slip of
paper and placed it in his own desk he was the only person who knew it

      when the safe was opened the next day a package containing five thou-
sand dollars which had been drawn from the bank the day before for a special
purpose was missing we searched everywhere the clerks swore they
saw the money placed in the vault your father himself said he saw it there
when he locked up but it was gone

     i would not believe at first that edgar had taken it but i learned he
had got very deeply into debt through his gambling and the very night before
had paid several debts of honor monckton accused him of the robbery
and i could not but believe the evidence

    but i would not allow my partner to call in the police i talked with
edgar plead with him to confess and make a new start he indignantly
refused to confess anything of the kind he denied all knowledge of the


a secret of the south pacific

lost money blamed me for suspecting- him and refused to listen to me
further he left me in a rage and from that day to this i have never seen
him

   mr undercliff was silent a moment while he sought to control his voice
howard i couldnt believe him guilty moncktons declaration over-
powered my mind for the moment but when poor edgar was gone i could
not rest i set detectives to work one man followed your father in his
flight he had crossed the continent by slow stages and finally sailed in the
ship juan fernandez for australia the juan fernandez did not reach her
port nor was she ever heard from we supposed him dead

    meanwhile the other detectives worked upon the mystery here in bos-
ton for two years i kept them in my pay then one day while the
offices were being repaired and the vault enlarged a workman found a
package wedged in between the metal sheetings it was a package of bank
notes the very package your father had been accused of stealing  

   howard said nothing but turned away his head for his eyes were wet
oh my boy you cannot know the pain i felt i had suspected my
dearest friend unjustly he had gone to his grave misjudged i determined
to do all in my power for his son as i could not bring edgar back i had
already taken you under my care you had been in the charge of an old
aunt of your fathers since your mothers death she was the only living
relative you had and she passed away soon after you came to me i have
tried to do by you as i know edgar would have wished  

   and you have done much for me guardy interrupted young thorne
brokenly

    can you forgive me for so harshly judging your father  

   indeed there is nothing to forgive cried howard he leaned for-
ward and seized the others hand god bless you sir  youve been more
than a father to me  

    but this is not all i have to tell you said the older man  i have
had wonderful news today

    what was it sir

    news which leads me to believe your father is or was quite recently
alive captain eatimer of the brig naida got in today he made his re-
port to me and then gave me a draft on an english banker at aukland new
zealand for a thousand and thirty odd pounds and this note

   as he spoke mr undercliff drew from his wallet a folded paper and passed
it to thorne the latter opened it and read 

                                               aukland n z november  
the inclosed draft is to reimburse messrs undercliff  monckton boston u s a
for certain moneys which were missing from their safe on the morning of july  
this money is not devoted to this purpose because the man accused was guilty for he
still declares his innocence  but it is sent that the firm might not lose the sum through
his carelessness or negligence this is his last duty to a harsh world that will hear of
him no more

    what does it mean cried thorne

    cant you read 

    but who wrote it
a secret of the south pacific



    that was written by jour father edgar thorne declared mr under-
cliff  although written in the third person the handwriting is not dis-
guised it is your fathers-i would stake my life upon it  

    then he is alive  murmured howard

    he was al ive two years ago he may be alive now  

      but where  

     that is the mystery but what the banker told captain latimer points
to an explanation

    according- to the bankers story and what latimer could learn from
other people who met edgar in aukland he had come from some island in
the marquesas or the american archipelagoes-or near those islands at least
-and had returned to the unknown islet after completing his business in
aukland

      an island in the pacific   

    in the south pacific many of them are occupied captain latimer
tells me by small parties of whites or natives the vessel your father sailed
in from america may have been wrecked there and he only saved and he
has-lived there since believing that the smirch of an uncommited crime still
rests upon his name

    by lieaveu  it is terrible   cried thorne leaping up and pacing the
floor  what can i do  

   what can we do rather said mr undercliff quickly there is only
one thing we can do

     what is it sir 

    search for that island

    but sir it will cost-

     if it costs the last cent i possess ill not begrudge it

    god bless you sir  and ill go to the south pacific and find him

    you shall my boy ill send you out on the naida she goes back to
aukland in a month or six weeks  

   at that moment there was a rap upon the door of the private office
wait exclaimed undercliff it is captain latimer you shall
hear the story from his own lips  

chapter ii-a telltale discovery in dates

   the senior member of the shipping firm hastened to open the door
there were three men without

    here is latimer again undercliff said the sharp voice of the foremost
of the newcomers he was a tall spare man with dark hatchet features
and a shifting gray eye it was mr monckton and following him closely
came the very much dressed young fellow whom thorne had so coolly greeted
in the outer office this was carter monckton son of the junior partner
behind them was a grizzled mahogany faced man of fifty odd who looked
every inch the sea captain

   good afternoon young man said monckton senior bowing coldly to
thorne


a secret of the south pacific

    come in come in gentlemen said undercliff with some nervousness
 take seats do how dye do carter

   thanks im well responded the younger man  but by jove isnt
this a start  i shd think youd feel knocked all of a heap thorne at such
news

   thornes brow grew dark and he made no reply mr undercliff hastened
to get down to business

   monckton he said turning to his partner  i have just been telling
howard the sad story connected with his fathers disappearance 

   the elder moncktons thin lips contracted unpleasantly

you should have told him before undercliff he said sourly  i have
often said so there was no use in covering up the-the unfortunate affair
 you were glad enough that i refused to have it made public when
the money was found at last said mr undercliff you know that
monckton

   the other grunted but made no audible reply

   but we havent time to discuss that pursued the senior partner
 captain latimer this is howard thorne  edgars sou you know

    and he looks a sight like him responded the captain giving thorne
one of his stumpy hands  im pleased to meet you sir an im willin to
wager youre thinkin of takin a trip to the southpacific about as quick as
you can get ready eh sir 

    i am replied thorne gravely

   just so said the mariner  i says to myself  that boyll be about
starting off immediate to find his father if so be hes above board j et

    reglar romance isnt it  murmured carter from the opposite side of
the table

   his father fixed him with his cold eye and he subsided for the moment
thorne controlled a longing to shake him out of his boots and turned again
to captain latimer

   mr undercliff has only given me the barest outline of the affair he
said  wont you tell me all about this-this man who is supposed to be
edgar thorne  

   i will sir though it wont take me long to tell all i know im
sorry to say if id been a prophet or one o these here clairvoyants i
might have been able to tell ou a deal more i had a chance to learn it

    what do you mean  inquired mr undercliff

 why sir i didnt tell you all the particulars as to how i come by
what information i got you know we was pressed for time this morning 
true iva tinier but howard here is desperately interested i know hell
be glad to hear every scrap of information bearing on the appearance of
edgar thorne in aukland

    very well sir ill spin my yarn

   he settled back in his seat and leaning his elbows on the chair arms
twirled his stumpy brown thumbs as he talked

     the very day we got into aukland a fellow came aboard the brig claim-
ing to be an american seaman in distress he wanted to be took home an
a secret of the south pacific

i

was anxious to go with me he reeled off a yarn that sounded so fishy that
i didnt give him much encouragement so he sheered off and went aboard a
british ship that lay in the roadstead she sailed tha very flood an i
reckon he went with her the yarn he gave me was like this 

     he claimed to be the sole survivor of the coal laden bark anna pixley
bound from sydney to san francisco shed met a heavy blow somewhere
off the america group an lost her spars an to cap it all her cargo took fire
the captain and mate was blowed up by an explosion of gas and in trying
to put off from the burning bark in a gale the other officers and most of the
men lost their lives the boats was all stove an he and his mates built a
raft an put off durin a lull in the storm but the raft went to pieces before
morning and his comrades went down

     he clung to the wreck of the raft for twenty four hours and then the
weather cleared an he floated ashore on an island and accordin to his
tell it was a good sized lump of ground but it was uninhabited he said
there was the wreck of some craft in a sheltered cove but not a sign of a
man  the island-or  that part of it he could get to a good portion of
it was unscalable cliffs volcanic i spose lot of them pacific islands are
-what aint coral

     well i remember he said he was there some weeks when one morning
he found a boat drawn up  the sand before the hut hed made for himcelf
and a man waiting for him to come out this stranger wouldnt answer any
questions about himself or how he got there in that open boat  but he told
him he was going to new zealand and he could go along if he liked and
help work the boat

     the mans craft was a ships long boat furnished with a sail and well
provisioned they made a good passage to aukland where the man went to
two or three bankers and sold some pearls he had with him gave the sailor
a five pound note and left in the boat they had come in the sailor hung
around aukland while his money held out and when i saw him being on a
lee shore he wanted to ship again

     as i say i didnt take much stock in his yarn at the time two men
sailing something like fifteen hundred miles in a ships long boat sounded
pretty fishy but afterward when the banker give me that draft and told
me about the man that left it i wished id paid more attention to what the
fellow said the sailor told me the latitude and longitude of the anna pixley
the day before she foundered but when i looked at the chart i couldnt find
an island anywhere around the locality thats one reason why i didnt be-
lieve him

     and you think this man who brought the sailor to aukland was my
father asked thorne

        sure  

    if we only had that sailor he might be able to take you to the very
island suggested mr undercliff

     you say he gave you his vessels position a day or so before he saw the
island   queried howard  wouldnt that help us  

    a little-if i can remember it but bless you i dont believe i could


a secret of the south pacific

you see i paid so little attention to his yarn still i know about where it
was  within a couple of hundred miles or so  

    a couple of hundred miles   exclaimed mr monckton

    thaf s not so bad at sea sir said the captain  if mr thorne gets
a tidy little craft at aukland-and ive little doubt he can-hell soon search
a bit of water like that

    its my opinion youve got a contract for all winter thorne said car-
ter drily

    well said thorne with a sigh  it does look a big undertaking  but
ill find the island if its above water

    little doubt you think of his getting the sort of a vessel he wants at
aukland    inquired the merchant

    there or at sydney sir if he was putting in to valparaiso id say
that would be the port to pick up what he wants but if we went there
the naida would be a long way off her course

   that would never do interjected monckton senior sharply your
last voyage was quite long enough captain latimer

   true true responded undercliff mildly

   by this time thorne was walking the office with nervous strides and
scarcely noticed what the others were saying

    it will cost a fortune he groaned  do you realize it guardy
dont ou worry about that returned charles undercliff quickly
 my last cent shall be spent if necessary in finding edgar and bringing
him back

     pooh  pooh    exclaimed monckton senior  let us not have heroics
undercliff young thorne shows a deal of good sense it will cost you a
large sum for this venture which i believe will simply be wasted

    wasted   cried thorne

    yes sir despite the fact that captain latimer looks upon the search-
ing of a portion of the ocean about as large as the bengal gulf as a small
matter  do not consider it such it will cost a vast amount of money and a
vast amount of time  and the end will i fear be disappointing

    come come   cried undercliff dont throw cold water monckton
as for the money howard dont let that worry you it shall be forthcom-
ing see here

   he rose hastily and opened a safe which stood behind him-his own
private one pulling out a drawer he brought forth a flat package and flung
it down upon the table in front of thorne

    that will do to start you off he said  it is the very money that
was so strangely lost and found i never felt as if i could use those notes
the senior monckton uttered a slight exclamation and sank back in his
chair thorne sat down and took the package in his hand

   they are just as your poor father put them away said undercliff as
thorne undid the wrapper absently   somehow it seemed to be blood
money-i could not touch it i meant you should have it some day

   thorne ran over the bills carelessly suddenly he stopped and scrutinized
one closely
a secret of the south pacific



    look here he said  i dont understand this

     what is it   asked mr undercliff drawing near

    when was the money lost  

    in -july i 

     but is this the very same money  i understood you to say it was

    yes i have never touched it excepting when it was first found

      but somebody else has touched it  

     impossible 

     then how is it i find a ten dollar note here of the series of  cried
thorne 

chapter iii-high words

   thornes announcement was received by the group about the table with
ejaculations which signified their surprise mr undercliff looked at the
young man in blank amazement his partner shut his teeth tightly upon
his lip and a strange grayish pallor settled about his mouth the captain
simply stared with bulging eyes at the note in thornes hand carter monck-
ton strange to say looked only at his father  but nobody else noticed the
junior partners distressed features

    do you understand   repeated thorne  here is a note dated a year
after the robbery

     let me see it   cried mr undercliff finding his voice at length
    thorne passed it over the other examined it wonderingly

    you are right he muttered  i-i cant explain it

   but-but sir dont you see that it must be explained   blurted out
thorne  if the notes were simply laid in the vault and recovered after
two years how did that one get among them unless they have been tampered
with while in j our possession   

   that is impossible cried undercliff nobody can get into this
safe but myself i alone have the key even monckton yonder does not
know the combination in fact nobody but myself was aware that the notes
were there eh monckton it was a surprise to you was it not  

    the junior partner was forced to wet his lips before replying

     i certainly had no idea you kept them he said

    then said thorne calmly those notes were never lost-they wet e
stolen and put back again by the thief 

     impossible   murmured undercliff

   it is not impossible cried thorne doggedly whoever took the
money wras able to return it after a time i thank god that no suspicion
can rest upon my father for he had gone from here but whoever com-
mitted the crime was familiar with your office and knew when the vault was
to be repaired  

   my dear boy the character of every one of our clerks was beyond
question interposed undercliff yet to prove to myself that none of
them was guilty of the crime in the first place i had every one followed by
my detectives until i was absolutely assured that he was trustworthy no


a secret of the south pacific

the thief was not among our clerks that i will swear to will not you
monckton 

   yes replied his partner huskily

   thorne for the first time looked across the table at the junior partner
his eyes gazed searchingly into moncktons own the latters gaze fell
for several moments there was silence

   then the young fellow turned abruptly to captain latimer

   well captain he said as though dismissing the subject of the bank-
notes entirely it is settled that i shall sail with you  

    thats as you please sir i shall be glad to have you aboard

    but when is your naida to be ready for sea  

   not under a month sir

    and i must wait all that time   exclaimed thorne

    patience my boy said undercliff

    patience  why i could start tomorrow

    but you would gain nothing by it youd have to go to san francisco
and across to sydney if you did so for theres no direct route to aukland
except by sailing vessel

    a months the best we can do sir said captain latimer rising  i
shall take her down to rivermouth tomorrow and save wharf rent you
might join us there mr thorne and be gettin your sea legs on the way
round to new york

    ill do it returned thorne and with an awkward bow to the others
the old mariner went out

   immediately the door closed behind him thorne turned to his guardian

    guardy he said quietly  there is no possible way in which anybody
could have exchanged that note for another since you have had them in your
possession  

     positively none i have not had the money in my hands a half dozen
times since i first locked the package in that drawer  

    then i must have an explanation you can plainly see that there was
a crime committed either the money was stolen and replaced by the thief

or else-

   well what  demanded undercliff

    it was a plot to ruin my father in your estimation  

     tut tut  what do you mean   

   thorne looked at monckton again

     that money was removed from the safe- 

    but the combination was known only to your father cried the senior
partner nervously

    it was transferred to paper though

    and locked in his desk he admitted it himself

      and nobody could get into that desk but himself   

    why-no-i could replied undercliff slowly

    you only 

  and-and-mr monckton

   monckton sprang up with a stifled exclamation
a secret of the south pacific



  what do you mean you young rascal he demanded what do
you impty by these insinuations   

    hush hush   exclaimed undercliff  you forget yourself monckton
and you howard are talking wildly

   but thorne had risen also still with his eyes fastened on the junior part-
ners face

    perhaps i am talking wildly he said  but i mean to probe this
mystery to the bottom i believe there was a thief  but it was not my
father but if i live to return to boston i  find the guilty scoundrel 

   you are a fool young man exclaimed monckton regaining his
mental equilibrium when you have recovered from these paroxysms of
foolishness i shall expect an apology for your insinuations i shall listen no
longer to you 

   he strode to the door and went out carter silently following him when
they had gone undercliff turned to thorne with pallid face

    howard he said brokenly  you have hurt me deeply your insinu-
ating words were uncalled for  

    guardy replied the young man seizing his hand  you are the best
and most unsuspicious man who ever lived i suppose i spoke without
thinking of the consequences-i always was impulsive forgive me do
and i will keep my suspicions to myself-for the present at least

    i forgive you for i know your words were the outcome of impulse
but i could never even hint at such infamy as you suggested-not now after
having once accused a man wrongfully of a crime oh no never  

    but answer me one question guardy and ill promise not to refer to
this painful subject again  

      what is it my boy   

     did mr monckton ever have any occasion to dislike my father   
   undercliff hesitated a moment

    well there may possibly have been some little ill feeling between them
at one time he admitted slowly

    what was the cause of it  

   to tell you the truth howard they both fell in love with the same
woman-something which often occurs in this little world it would seem
that as many women as there are there would be enough to go around and
he smiled a little sadly

    who was she  asked thorne

    why your mother of course

    ah  then mr monckton did not like my father because my mother pre-
ferred to be mrs thorne rather than mrs monckton   

    well there was a little feeling at one time as i say but monckton is
a sensible man he was married even before jrour father and his wife is a
very charming woman indeed

    that is enough responded thorne quickly  ill say nothing more
about it now

    you have always disliked the moncktons my boy and i never could
understand it said the senior partner sinking wearily into a chair


a secret of the south pacific

    i guess my dislike is heartily returned replied thorne grimly  as
for carter hes a contemptible puppy

   oh hell get over that  believe his father gives him too much
money and he doesnt dig into his books enough that is all said undercliff
leniently

    well hell have to  dig more and keep out of scrapes in future or
hell have to satisfy his thirst for knowledge-and his other thirst-at some
other seat of learning hes been up before the faculty twice in a year and
a half and the third time means dismissal im told

    well hes a foolish boy i suppose i wish you could have an influence
over him

   i cried thorne in disgust id like to influence him with a
club

     well well let it pass youll have no trouble with either carter or
his father while you are away i shall miss you sadly my boy but i want
you to go i know its not necessary for me to tell you to put forth every
effort to find my dear old friend-you have a stronger reason than even i for
wishing to bring him home

    i have said thorne wringing his hand  and if human power can
find that island ill get to it  

chapter iv-a lively incident at the outset

   thorne spent little time in preparation for the voyage in three days
he was set down with his baggage at the little station of rivermouth

   the naida lay at one of the rotting wharves and was by far the largest
craft in the harbor she was an old fashioned bluff bowed vessel about as
graceful as a dutch man o war or a chinese junk but with great carrying
capacity

   rivermouth boasted a hotel and after paddling about in the rain to find a
native to cart tiis belongings to the wharf thorne sought the hostelry for
dinner having his doubts as to the ability of the naidas cook he intended
once in new york to lay in a supply of canned provisions for his own use

   the hotel was kept by a long legged sharp voiced yankee in a house of
colonial architecture while thorne waited for the meal to be made ready
the proprietor engaged him in conversation with the laudable intention of
pumping him upon all sorts of personal topics as he thwarted the
fellows inquisitiveness more amused than angered by his pertinacity captain
latimer entered

   the captain did not see thorne who sat back in the corner and the hotel
proprietor at once turned his attention to the newcomer as offering a more
promising field for the exercise of his unnatural curiosity

   when doos th nady sail capn latimer he asked by way of lead-
ing interrogation

    i expect to go out on tonights tide replied the captain shortly

    why ye haint got a crew hev ye  

 ive enough men to work the brig to new york brought her down
a secret of the south pacific



from boston with four men in the focastle an  reckon i can get around to
new york without any more

    les see whered i hear the nady was bound fur this vyage 

    i dunuo herrick im sure you can hear almost anything in this town
of busybodiesreplied the captain sharply

    oh not that im curous the other hastened to assure him  but i
jes asked

   yes well shes bound back to aukland new zealand an mebbe to
australia for a return cargo

   satisfied on this point the hotel keeper began on another tack

    hem  i spose the housell be opened now he said  seein sydneys
got back from college

   sydneys going this trip with me as second mate returned captain
latimer and thorne detected a note of triumph in his voice

    sho  yeou dont say  exclaimed the other  well well  thats sar-
tainly surprisin i persumed college d change all that didnt know but
mabbe yeoud settle daown here in rivermouth yersslf an give up goin
ter sea  

    let me tell you herrick that sydney latimer graduate of a high
toned college is just the same as to sense as sydney latimer without a
college education

   just then he saw thorne in the corner

    how dye do sir  he said taking the young mans hand in his tar
stained palm  i got your telegram and well be afloat tonight the car-
peuters and riggers have got their work done an the naidas as trim as a
young girl the cargos all ready an by working a night shift as well as a
day well have ft all stowed down in ten days or so

    thats encouraging

    oh  know just how anxious you are pursued the captain while the
inquisitive herrick listened with both eyes and ears wide open  but you
go down to the brig sir and sydney will show you your quarters the
cooks made things as comfortable for you as can be

   he strolled out of the hotel and after thorne had eaten his dinner under
a perfect fusillade of questions from the landlord he went down to the water
front the rain was still falling in an uncertain drizzling fashion three
men in tarpaulins were rolling heavy casks from the wharf to the brigs deck
and a figure in a long rubber coat reaching from neck to heels and a mon-
strous souwester directed their movements from the quarter

   this must be sydney latimer thought thorne the college bred
second mate of the naida i hope hell be good company wonder what
university he hails from 

   it seemed odd for a college graduate even though he was the son of the
captain to be tramping the quarter deck of a sailing vessel

   the three sailors were still struggling with the cask as thorne clambered
over the rail to the brigs wet deck as he stood there a moment watching
them lower the unwtieldy article into the hold a voice said overhead 

    do you wish to see captain latimer sir


a secret  of the south pacific

    thorne wheeled about recognizing the tones of the seconil mate who had
crossed the quarter and stood leaning on the rail above he opened his lips
to reply and then to his disgrace stood there dumb as an oyster and with
probably as idiotic an expression on his face as was possible sydney lati-
mer second mate of the brig naida was a girl 

    thorne saw a flush steal into her dark face but she repeated her question
very coolly

    meanwhile he had opportunity to note that hers was a remarkably attrac-
tive countenance nothing mannish about her despite the long rubber coat
and the big hat she was a most pronounced brunette with small features
and rebellious ringlets of short dark hair framing her face

     i suppose you are mr thorne she said as he still remained dumb
 father said he expected you this morning

    by this time thorne had regained his voice

      i am delighted to meet you miss latimer he said laughing  par-
don my discourtesy but i was considerably surprised when i discovered that

the naidas second officer was-

     was a girl  finished the other again blushing

     yes he said  i hope you wont think me rude  but really it was
most unexpected

     ill forgive you she returned frankly  now sir if you will find
tonio he will show you to your cabin i cant leave the deck at present
thorne found the cook a huge mulatto with a rather pleasing face and
was ushered into his stateroom it was a good sized apartment and he found
his boxes already stacked at the foot of the bed but he was not anxious to
unpack then and despite the rain went on deck again

    he hadnt been on a vessel like this since he was a boy and used to spend
his holidays about the east boston docks he wanted to pull on the ropes
with the men at the falls and get tar on his hands and have a sniff at the
stuffy focastle

     i feel like a boy again he said to sydney  i want to poke into all
the corners of the brig and mess around i think there must be a streak of
salt water in my blood

      im afraid the brig will be cramped quarters for you before we reach
aukland she replied with a smile  but you are at liberty to poke around
to your hearts content

      i havent been aboard an old vessel like this for years he said

     and you wont get aboard many like it she returned  she is one
of the oldest vessels in the american trade but you will have to excuse me
as i am the only officer aboard just at present

    she nodded her curly head with a smile and turned away to attend to the
lowering of the stores into the brigs hold as thorne went forward he heard
her voice ring out again from the quarter 

   now then men hurry along these casks two of you roll them
aboard the others can-by the way where is the fourth man  whats
his name tom 

      its atwell sir-i mean mum one of the sailors replied
a secret of the south pacific



    where is he

    hes below mum

    whats the matter with him and the clear voice became suddenly
stern  didnt he understand that all hands were called 

   the three sailors shuffled their feet and looked at one another uneasily
meanwhile thorne reached the forecastle and descended losing the answer
to the question

   the brigs forecastle was a low dark musty smelling place there were
two tiers of bunks on each side a big mess chest and several stools in the
center and piles of dunnage in various corners the place was unoccupied
save for a man asleep in one of the lower berths and it didnt take a second
glance to assure the passenger that the fellows torpor was induced by liquor
the smell of the vile stuff pervaded the atmosphere of the forecastle and the
neck of a black bottle protruded from beneath the blanket that was partially
drawn over him

   while thorne stood looking about the place one of the other men came
below evidently to fetch the delinquent atwell

    hi mate  get up out o that and come on deck cried the sailor
punching the sleeping man vigorously to arouse him

   a sailor hates nothing as much as he does a shirk and considerable energy
was expended in this case with evident good will

   ow  get out  whatre you about demanded the man sitting up
suddenly and swinging his legs out of the berth

    all ands ave been called mate didnt ye ear the summons 

    who sent you down here to bother me  demanded the half drunken
sailor fiercely

    she did

   who

    that bloomin second mate

   a torrent of oul language and abuse poured from the man atwell and
thorne turned back to the deck unwilling to listen to it it made his hands
tingle to get hold of the brute what could captain latimer be thinking of
-to put his daughter in the way of hearing such talk 

   the other sailor quickly followed him and went aft again and a moment
later the delinquent stumbled up to the deck he was in an ugly mood
having imbibed just enough liquor to enhance his naturally surly disposition
as he passed thorne the latter heard him muttering and swearing to himself
and looked after him a little uneasily as he approached the main hatch near
which miss latimer was standing having descended from the quarter

    you have been long enough a sailor to know that no idlers are allowed
aboard ship atwell he heard her say severely  turn to with tom there
and lower the casks as theyre run aboard

    ill turn to when i get ready declared the fellow with an oath

   it made thornes blood boil to hear him he expected to see her back
down before the man  but she was made of sterner stuff and thorne mentally
applauded her pluck though he so strongly disapproved of her position

      how dare you answer back    she exclaimed   turn to at once or- 


a secret of the south pacific

    or what   demanded the fellow taking a step nearer arid clenching hi

fist

   thorne believed the cowardly brute would strike her  but she held her
ground although her face went white all of a sudden

    belay that mate   cried the cockney sailor tom springing forward
but the passenger was before him shifting his umbrella to his left hand
he swung his fist and delivered a scientific blow just under the fellows ear
atwell went skating across the deck and landed like a log under the rail

   at that instant there was a quick step on the gang plank and thorne
turned to see captain joshua latimer coming aboard on the run

chapter v-an unwelcome arrival

    what does this mean demanded captain latimer without a glance
in thornes direction his eyes were fixed angrily on atwell who was just
picking himself up from the deck  you atwell

   the sailor pretty well sobered by the blow held his hand to his head and
said nothing

   he has been drinking i think father interposed miss latimer her
voice trembling a little  he refused to go to work with the other men
and-

    after what i ve done for him too   exclaimed captain latimer  you
scoundrel you  if we werent going to sail tonight i swear id make an
example of you

    youve done a lot for me you have   said atwell in surly tones  a-
cutting me down from my billet of second mate an a-putting her in my place
and he pointed his finger at the girl

    answer me back will ye cried the captain then he raised his voice

    tonio  he shouted bring the irons from under my berth be
quick about it  

   atwell started as though to escape but captain latimer laid a huge
hand upon his shoulder and he stopped where he was thorne measured the
old man and did not blame the sailor for backing down a moment later the
cook ran from the cabin and handcuffs were snapped upon atwells wrists
then he was hustled forward and dropped down the hatchway   i reckon
youll cool down some if youre left to yourself my man remarked the
captain grimly

   but thorne saw the look the insubordinate sailor cast in the direction of
miss latimer and himself as they stood together in the background it was
not a pleasant thing to remember he was sorry he was to be in the narrow
quarters of a sailing vessel for some weeks with a man like that but when
the incident was over and the sailor disposed of captain latimer seemed to
think very lightly of the matter

   got liquor somehow i spose he remarked as his daughter went
calmly back to her duty with the other three seamen  hes a good man
when i can keep drink from him and no mean navigator i had to cut him
down from second mates berth last voyage because of it
a secret of the south pacific



   but its dangerous to have a man like that aboard expostulated
thorne

   its the best we can do these times few americans-and fewer decent
men-sail before the mast nowadays atwell is an able seaman in every
sense of the word

    but your daughter-i shouldnt think you would want such men sailing
in the brig for her sake

   the captain looked as though he thought of telling the young man that
it was none of his business but thought better of it and replied 

    hed never raised his voice to her if hed been sober im obliged to
you young man for the way you used your fins  but as a usual thing the
fact that sydnej is a woman would have protected her from insult aboard
ship these rough fellows respect a woman and she gets better service out
of them than any officer i ever had  

     then this isnt her first voyage with you  said thorne

     bless you no  shes been to sea with me off and on most of her life
but there was something in it all that went against thornes grain he
couldnt understand how a girl of refined tastes could wish to associate with
the rough men of a ships company even if her father was a member of it

   yet sydney latimer was a perfect lady during the afternoon while set-
ting his own quarters to rights he obtained a glimpse of her private cabin
and it was the most homelike little room he had ever seen

   thorne got himself settled and was on deck in time to observe the work
of getting the brig under way the fellow atwell thoroughly sobered by
captain latimers discipline was at work with the other men and did not
raise his eyes from the deck the huge sails were spread by means of patent
hoisting apparatus miss latimer took the wheel and the great vessel
sheered off from the dock the little donkey engine amidships made more
commotion than the engines of an atlantic liner and the mulatto cook
stripped to his waist shoveling coal into its maw looked like an imp in a
pantomime

   them patent windlasses are great inventions remarked captain lati-
mer chewing hard on a black cigar as he watched the brigs leeway  saves
a good haf of the help neverd be able to work the naida to new york
with fourmen and a cook in the old days why a craft like this useter ship
twenty men before the mast bsides carpenters an sailmakers i never ship
but twelve haf to be economical nowadays

   thorne discovered that captain latimer was great on  economy  he
had all the true yankees thriftiness was sharp at a bargain and was more
than a little   near   as the saying is

    it was quite dark before the naida cleared the bar and the swinging lamp
was lit in the cheerful cabin when they sat down to supper captain lati-
mer ate hurriedly and went back to the deck but sydney who had laid aside
her mannish attire presided and thorne began to realize what a really charm-
ing girl the second mate of the naida was

      i have been to sea with father a great deal   she told him frankly   i
was a very delicate child you wouldnt believe it now would you and

      b


a secret of the south pacific

she laughed the color coming and going in her round cheek  the bracing
sea air was what i needed i brought my books aboard and studied hard i
learned navigation too ive performed the duties of second mate before
but i was never rated as such till this trip this is my first voyage for three
years and i enjoy getting back on the old brig once more

     but said thorne doubtfully  didnt you find it hard to get on with no
other woman aboard  

    oh tonios wife used to go with us when i was small in fact she
was always aboard until she died four years ago

    i should think you would be lonesome for female society

   oh that she said dont think me unwomaly but girls weary
me most of those i met at school were afflictions you see being so much
in fathers society i am more of a mans woman than a womans woman
do you understand me

   thorne thought he did but he was doubtful such sentiments from a
girl were so entirely unlooked for that he didnt know what to think

   the run to new york was very pleasant and thorne began to take con-
siderable interest in the working of the ship especially was this interest
manifested when it was miss latimers watch on deck while the naida
was being loaded thorne found the time hanging heavily enough on his
hands he tried to busy himself in plans for his voyage of exploration he
purchased charts and books about the south pacific but the month which
was occupied before the naida was ready to sail dragged on leaden wings

   still he was glad mr undercliff had advised his coming on to new york
with the brig he could never have been able to stand the delay at home
he received and answered a few letters among them one from a college friend
a paragraph in the latters epistle thorne read over several times

    the news has gone forth that our friend monckton has left our classic town he
goes on a sea voyage in one of his fathers ships i understand for his health but a little
bird has whispered in my ear that another investigation bythe powers that be  was
pending and that he saved himself from expulsion by resignation

    i wonder what craft of undercliff  monckton he sails in thought
thorne  hed be a nice addition to any ships company-i dont think 
well thank the lord its nothing to me

   but it did concern him only it was several days before he found it out
then he saw  tonio doing a vast amount of cleaning in one of the unused
staterooms

    whos this for he asked the officers had already come aboard and
had been assigned their places

    goin ter hab anoder passenger sah replied the mulatto showing his
teeth passengers meant unlimited tips to tonio and he would have wel-
comed a dozen

    that so 

    yes sah de son ob one o de owners goin for hes healf 

   thorne turned on his iieel and went to his cabin had his journey not
been so urgent he would have given up his berth in the brig rather than sail
with carter monckton
a secret of the south pacific



     sent with us to keep him from becoming a common drunk i suppose 
he thought bitterly  hes a nice specimen to sail with decent people 

    but thorne was a gentleman and he could not poison the minds of cap-
tain latimer and his daughter against monckton and when sydney mentioned
that they were to have the company of another passenger on the voyage he
kept silence he was tempted to run on to boston and see mr undercliff
but there was hardly time for that that very evening the crew came
aboard and the brig was made ready to pull out into the stream at daybreak
monckton had not arrived although his luggage had come and thorne de-
voutly hoped that he would not show up in time

    as he sat writing in his cabin after supper there came a sudden rap on
the door he opened it and found captain latimer and a short swarthy
looking sailor standing without

     a word with you sir said the captain

     a dozen if you wish captain replied thornethrowing his door wide
open

    the captain motioned the sailor into the room entered himself and shut
the door

     dye see his here fellow mr thorne demanded the commander of
the naida

    thorne nodded

     well sir you may call it luck or call it providence whichever you
like sir but there stands the man youd give a good deal to see i reckon

      what do you mean    cried thorne starting up

     its the fellow i was telling you of-the one who boarded the brig at
aukland last winter hes the man who was brought to aukland by your
father  

    glorious  where did he come from   

    he was sent down by the shipping agent replied captain latimer
taking out a cigar  plain providence i call it sit down jessop an tell
mr thorne your story

    the sailor sat down awkwardly he was a wiry looking little man with
small gold rings in his ears and a network of tattooing on the back of his
hands his age might have been fifty  his nationality doubtful he had
sailed in ships of all countries and could understand quarter deck commands
and abuse in half a dozen languages

     let me hear your story said thorne encouragingly

    speak up jessop said the captain and the man began

    well sir i shipped on the coal laden anna pixley from sydney to
frisco-

    belay that interrupted latimer i give him the pints of your
shipwreck an that dont interest him lets hear about your getting on
the island and what followed

    jessop gave a hitch to his trousers and went on 

     i dont like to talk about it gentlemen-it werent a pleasant sperience
he said  the raft me an my mates built couldnt hold together nohow in
that gale we didnt have time to make a strong float why sir when we


a secret of the south pacific

left the old pixley she was blazing clean to her mastheads  the raft worked
apart a good deal that night and nex day patchit as we might it only just
kep together till dark we lost two men that afternoon and before the next
morning they were all gone but poor bob mccann an me

     we lashed ourselves to what was left of the raft an held on i didnt
expect ever to see land again  no more did he he didn t but somehow
my part of the wreck hung together an the current an gale carried me
ashore on this island i speak of there warut much to it but cliffs up
which a fly could scacely crawl an a bit of sandy beach these cliffs went
clear round the island and the beach warent moren a cables length wide
anywhere but in two or three places there was clumps o young palms an
cocoanut trees

    i managed to get something to eat and i found water too-sweet
clear water that was the greatest blessin id ever had then in this cove i
told capn latimer of i found the hnlk of a ship-the juan fernandez of
san francisco-

     the very one  cried thorne remembering mr undercliffs story

    the craft your father sailed on mr thorne  demanded latimer

     yes sir

     then youre on the right scent

     that warnt all said jessop waking up to the significance of the mat-
ter when he observed his listeners excitement  the boat i sailed in from
that island to aukland was the juan fernandez long boat  

      how do you know    cried thorne

     saw it  her bow the name had been painted over but not enough
to hide it entirely

     good  

     but tell us about the man who rescued you said latimer

     well sir i was there three weeks an built myself a shanty of drift an
stuff i declare to jou gentlemen that was the peculiarest place  ever
heard of there warnt another streak of land in sight so where that gent
gent could ha come from i dunno but there he was one morning boat
and all waiting at my shant for me to get up

     you can blieve i was surprised and glad-well glad dont begin to
express my feelins but he was the queerest codger ever i come across he
never talked didnt ask me arrything about myself nor wouldnt answer no
questions about himself nor how he got there he just told me hed take
me to a place where i could find a ship going home we was weeks on
the vage but the weather was good most of the time an he had stacks of
provisions

    when we got to aukland he sold some pearls he had-i wrent with
him to the broker fellows then he gi me a fi pun note an lit out they
told me on the wharves that he stayed only a day or two in aukland and
then left in his boat steering into the northeast again-the very way we
come  

     and thats all   asked thorne

     thats the whole yarn sir replied jessop rising
a secret of the south pacific



    you can go said latimer holding the door open

   jessop pulled his forelock and departed  but as he passed thorne the
young man pressed a bank note into his hand

    thank you sir said the sailor  your servant capn

   thorne paced the deck for a long time that night his brain busy with
plans for the search he was about to undertake at last as the city clocks
tolled midnight he was on the point of going below when there was the
rattle of carriage wheels on the street leading down to the dock the vehicle
stopped and thorne heard several voices in hilarious converse

   he crossed to the shoreward rail a group of men were staggering down
the wharf one of their number was being shaken by the hand and clapped
on the shoulder affectionately by his tipsy companions

    youre a good feller drefful sorry to ha-hie-have you go stam-
mered one youth and more demonstrative than the others he threw his arms
about the departing individuals neck

   thorne knew who it was it was carter monckton he turned away in
disgust as the fellow came stumbling aboard

    by by old fel chorused the gang and with a wild whoop they went
back to the waitin carriage

   thorne had leached the companionway and there hesitated suppose
captain latimer should see the fool come aboard in that state  or suppose
sydney should hear him  he had no love for carter monckton but he did
not want the new england prejudices of the captain and his daughter to be
aroused against the son of their employer and like enough monckton
wouldnt be able to find his stateroom without waking the whole ships com-
pany he stepped over to the intoxicated fellow and took him by the arm

    this is a pretty state for you to come aboard in he said sternly  ill
get you into your cabin but dont make a row theres a lady aboard

    youre a good feller responded monckton who was in a good natured
state of inebriation  this is the naida aint it 

   of course

   then im-hie-all right he declared cheerfully and allowed thorne
to lead him along

   his cabin was next to the one thorne occupied the door was unlocked
so the latter got him inside and plumped him into a chair without arousing
the steward

    why its thorne exclaimed the intoxicated one in surprise
 didnt know twas you-pon my word  youre a better-hie-better fel-
ler than i thought have a drink   and he pulled a flask from his pocket
and offered it to him

   thorne looked down upon him contemptuously

    youre a pretty fellow he said  youll be an addition to this ships
company i dont doubt  let me have that flask

   he seized the silver mounted bottle and opening the dead light threw it
into the water

     thats the best place for that he said

   monckton arose with drunken gravity


a secret of the south pacific

   youre-youre no zheutleman sir he stammered with dignity
 youve suited me once-twice must have satsfactiou v

   he lurched toward his companion but thorne stepped aside and went out
leaving monckton sprawling at full length on the stateroom floor

chapter vi-coming to blows

   thorne persistently avoided his fellow passenger from the first day at
sea the naida was towed out into the stream early in the morning and
before noon she passed sandy hook and spreading all her sails like a huge
winged sea bird was fairly started on her long voyage the crew and offi-
cers were hard at work and it was very nearly night before the litter occa-
sioned by getting under way was quite cleared up and the deck made tidy and
shipshape once more

    thorne saw little of sydney that first day but he made the acquaintance
of the first and third officers-mr sessions a red headed little man with a
thin piping voice and mr pepper a big bluff voiced jolly fellow with a
hand like a ham

   monckton kept to his cabin most of that day-probably sleeping off the
effects of his last nights carousal ashore when he did appear on deck to-
ward dusk thorne turned his back and walked away he was determined
to have no conversation with him after the disgusting scene of the previous
night but the stewart had placed their plates side by side at the table and
at supper thorne was obliged to introduce monckton to miss latimer and the
mates as the captain was on duty

   it was plain that sydney was not ill pleased with the son of the junior
partner pf the firm that owned the naida monckton exerted himself to en-
tertain her and thorne saw with a strange feeling of uneasiness that he
was making a favorable impression he could not explain to himself why he
should care he had no personal interest in miss latimer indeed he was
hardly sure that he quite approved of her monckton was a gentlemanly ap-
appearing fellow and he had  a way with him that would attract most
people but thorne could hardly take it upon himself to warn sydney or
her father of the notoriously bad charater of carter monckton they must
find it out for themselves he did determine however to give the fellow as
little opportunity to cultivate miss latimers acquaintance alone as possible
but here circumstances-or fate-interfered

    the second day a little blow came up followed by a heavy swell thorne
who was ordinarily a good sailor had to take to his berth he lay flat on
his back for four days and lived a simple and blameless life  toast and
beef tea when he got upon deck again he found monckton and sydney
latimer as chummy as though they had known each other for years monck-
ton hadnt been ill an hour and had the cheek to come around and commise-
rate thorne on his weak stomach

    i presume if my stomach was preserved in alcohol i shouldnt have
been affected by the motion of the brig either replied thorne cuttingly

   miss latimer heard him and he saw byr the look on her face that she
a secret of the south pacific



considered it to be a boorish remark and the worst of it was monckton
  took the trick   by appearing hurt and walking off without uttering a
reply sydney moved away too but thorne heard from it later through
the captain

    youre kinder rough on that monckton said he good naturedly
 but he dont seem haf a bad sort i hear he got into kinder wild compny
at college an hes talcin this vyge to help him brace up never kick a
man when hes down is my motto	

   thorne wondered what he would say if he had seen monckton when he
came aboard at new york but he bit his lip and made no reply to the
good captains pacific remarks but he had injured himself with sydney by
his thoughtless retort and argue with himself as he might it troubled him
but lie continued to avoid monckton and in so doing deprived himself of
her society also this was a trial for greatly as he disliked the idea of a
girl holding the position she did on the naida her strong character had not
failed to impress him she made herself respected by all on board and her
calm judgment and knowledge of seamanship was the open wonder of the
other mates

     most wonderful girl  ever see declared mr pepper  an i was born
on the cape where gals as wells boys can sail a boat fore they get out of
pinafores  

    and the little first mate agreed

    it was plain that captain latimer quite worshiped her and trusted in her
judgment in many things but thorne thought that among the men the
satisfaction was not so general they obeyed her well enough but they evi-
dently did not think it right in the captain to put a woman over them with-
out a doubt atwell fanned this flame of discontent

    as the days passed and the brig ran into warmer latitudes the situation
became still more strained thornes face more than once expressed his dis-
approval when he saw monckton and sydney walking the deck together or
talking in the cabin during her watch below sydney resented it and showed
her resentment by treating thorne more coolly while not abating her friend-
liness with monckton in the least

    between the crew and the captain there was ill feeling too and every day
it became more and more apparent as has before been hinted captain
joshua latimer was more than a little close the cabin table was very
well though plainly supplied and thorne but seldom resorted to his private
stores but the food supplied the seamen was of course another matter
the quality was all right-that is the  salt horse  was of good quality and
the cook made eatable bread  but the quantity was what the men grumbled
about captain latimer was so economical that he doled out the food ver
grudgingly to tonio for the focastle mess

    this was a small matter but in the mouth of a man like atwell it became
great and more than once thorne suspected that atwell and some of his
mates got liquor from some mysterious source captain latimer was a strictly
temperate man and all the liquor supposed to be aboard the naida was a little
for medicinal purposes locked up in the commanders cabin


a secret of the south pacific

   it was quite certain too that monckton had none in fact the third
mate mr pepper told him that the agreement when old monckton wrote
for his sons passage was that no liquors were to be allowed aboard evi-
dently the intention had been to make an effort to reform carter and thorne
was forced to admit that up to the present time the fellow had behaved himself
very respectably the only liquor he had managed to bring on board was that
in the pocket flask which thorne had unceremoniously thrown overboard the
night of his arrival and monckton hadnt forgiven him that either thorne
thought possibly the fellow was too drunk to remember the occurrence but
one evening he was disabused of that idea

   the trouble started with a very innocent discussion between sydney and
thorne at the supper table the argument waxed warm though in a spirit
of perfect friendliness until monckton put in a word sydney tacitly ad-
mitted him into the discussion by replying but thorne very foolishly showed
that he was nettled by the fellows uncalled for interference and dropped the
subject at once

   the cut was so direct that even moncktons egotism was pierced he
flushed and passed several sharp comments making thorne the butt of the
others laughter by turning his former arguments into ridicule thorne bit
his lip but made no reply until miss latimer had gone on deck then as
monckton still pursued his raillery he reached one long arm over the table
and knocked his persecutor out of his chair

   the cabin was in a tumult in an instant moncktons bantering was
changed to ungovernable rage he sprang up with an imprecation and
both mr sessions and mr pepper got up also  chairs were tipped over and
for an instant it looked as though monckton would spring over the table at
the throat of his antagonist

   thorne alone remained in his chair his eyes on moncktons face his own
features as pale as death outwardly he was as calm as the tropical sea at
that instant  inwardly he was full of a mad desire to seize the fellow and fol-
low up that single blow with a sound thrashing

    you miserable hound  cried monckton finding his breath

   his fingers crept behind him and sought his hip pocket he was quite
beside himself with rage

   calm yourself said thorne coldly  and take your hand away from
that thing inyour pocket assure as you try to draw it on me ill break everj
bone in your body  

   monckton looked into the others face and quailed his fingers returned
to their normal position

    you bully  he sputtered  you thief 

   then thorne stood up

    ill thank you not to apply that term to me again he said so quietly
that monckton would have been warned by it had he not been so utterly be-
side himself with rage

      i repeat ityou are a thief  the son of a thief   he hissed

   instantly thorne leaped fairly over the cabin table and seemingly with
the same motion landed his clenched fist on the point of moncktons chin
a secret of the south pacific



the fellow went down like a log and lay there without stirring and at that
very dramatic point captain latimer came hastily down the stairway

   whats this whats this gentlemen he demanded  a low row
in my cabin  what does it mean  what did you strike him for mr
thorne   

   thorne was silent pepper had raised monckton into a chair but neither
he nor sessions seemed willing to reply monckton himself was still too
dazed to explain

   what is it i demand an answer sir cried the old man with
dignity  this cabin is my home you are a passenger mr thorne but
you are also my guest you have attacked another of my guests such an
act is an insult to me  

    i beg your pardon captain latimer said thorne  i considered the
naida a public conveyance-not your home had i for a moment suspected
that you looked upon it as such i would have restrained myself great though
the provocation might have been

     i gave you no provocation in the first place snarled monckton  not
till you had tipped me out of my chair

    i heard you call him a thief sir interrupted the captain severely

  you can keep quiet  

     he is a thief exclaimed monckton wildly  and his father was before
him it was only the night i came aboard the naida that he snatched some-
thing from my hand and i havent seen it since--

   yes said thorne quickly  a flask of liquor its at the bottom of
the east river you came aboard too drunk to know your right hand
from your left

   stop commanded captain latimer sternly this discussion has
gone far enough youd better go and get something on that jaw of yours
before it gets stiff mr mouckton-and as for you sir turning to thorne
 ill thank you to keep quiet for a bit let us all cool down before we dis-
cuss this further you are altogether too quick with your fins sir

   thorne turned on his heel and went to his cabin he was consumed with
rage-mostly at his own hot headed stupidity for allowing himself to be
drawn into such a disgraceful scene

   when captain latimer heard the full particulars of the trouble from his
two officers he went to thorne and frankly admitted that he had judged him
too harshly

   but i cannot understand your attitude toward young monckton you
have scarcely treated him decently since he joined us

   if you knew him as well as i captain latimer you would not be so
surprised at my avoidance of him nor would you care to have your daughter
make the acquaintance of a man of such character

   hold on said the captain sternly dont you drag my daugh-
ters name into this affair i forbid it your interference is unpardonable
thorne sprang up in a rage

    very well he said our interview is quite at an end i believe
this is my private cabin sir
io

a secret of the south pacific

   he held the door open for the old man to pass out and for days
they scarcely spoke to each other miss latimer seemed to share her
fathers feelings and thorne found himself fairly companiorless aboard the
brig

chapter vii-mischief afoot

    in this state of affairs thorne began to take more or less notice of jessop
the sailor from whose account of his meeting with edgar thorne the young
man had gained such hope thorne had before been friendly with him and
often in the dog watch which is the one time during the day when sailors
are comparatively free had questioned him minutely about the strange island
on which he had been cast and concerning the stranger individual who had
rescued and carried him to new zealand jessop had agreed to accompany
thorne on his voyage of exploration providing captain latimer would release
him at aukland

    feeling himself cut off from the society of the cabin to a great extent at
least thorne talked a deal more with the sailor he bent all his own energies
of thought upon plans for his voyage and found that jessop because of his
long seafaring experience was no mean adviser between them before the
horn was weathered they made out a long list of articles to be purchased in
addition to the general provisioning of the craft thorne was to engage and
laid out with the aid of the charts their course from aukland to the vicinity
of the mysterious island as to the crew and the boat-they would depend
upon circumstances

     if its all the same to you mr thorne said jessop on one occasion
 i wish tom shields was a goin along tom was the cockney sailor
who had been aboard the naida when thorne joined her at rivermouth
 if capn latimer would let him go toohe would be worth a good deal
to you

  how

    hes been a good bit about this ere ocean he was cast away twice on
the islands an knows all about em though he never hear tell of this islan i
was on

    i dont think captain latimer would let me have two men said thorne

  does this shields want to go with me   

    he wouldnt kick none if he got a chance to leave the brig replied
jessop

  why not

     well he an i aint one o atwells crowd thats all and jessop turned
away

   thorne treasured these words in his memory he had noticed with
growing concern the disaffection among the sailors and that atwell was
at the bottom of it he did not doubt what he did not know was that the
officers of the brig viewed his own friendliness with jessop with suspicion
the gulf which separates the cabin and the focsle is well nigh as impassable
as that mentioned in holy writ as lying between the two conditions of mans

soul in the hereafter when there is any trouble aboard ship it is seldom
that any of the crew openly side wih the officers the captain and mates
are the sailors sworn enemies so jack tar believes-too often with good
reason and whether the men approve of all their leaders do or not they seldom
stand out against them the cook usually remains neutral on the naida
the cook tonio had sailed with captain latimer for twenty years and loved
sydney as though she had been his own child the sailors did not trust
tonio and thorne innocently enough was causing by his familiarity
with jessop doubts to arise in the minds of captain latimer and his officers
one or two little outbreaks had already occurred and affairs between those
before and those abaft the mainmast were very strained

   thorne continued to avoid the officers including sydney and his fellow
passenger he seldom appeared at the common table taking most of his meals
in his own cabin and paying tonio something extra for his trouble when
not shut into his private quarters he paced the deck alone or conversed with
the sailors when they were off duty

   thus far the naida had experienced a remarkably pleasant voyage but
now she ran into regular cape horn weather it was dangerous to hug the
coast in the gale which burst over them when off terra de fuego so they
steered for the southeast and ran some days out of their course before the
storm finally it passed and the brig was put on her route again but
that first gale seemed but a mild taste of what was in store for her three
days after she passed the cape another gale struck her and the naida stag-
gered on under the blow like a wearied courser the sea sprang a few
planks in her old hull this time too and from that time on the clank of the
pumps was heard for a part of every day

   there is nothing that will take the heart out of a sailor like the sound of
the pumps the leak did not gain on them but the old brig was badly
strained and nobody knew what the next blow would do to her the crew
became more reckless than ever and the officers had more difficulty in con-
trolling them

   monckton stayed below most of the time during the bad weather but
thorne whose muscles of steel and cool head made him of valuable assist-
ance turned to with the men and worked as hard as any of them and his
aid was appreciated for the brig was manned by as small a crew as the law
allowed-another result of captain latimers economy

   yet thorne had incased himself in a shell of dignified silence through
which neither captain nor officers could break much as they appreciated his
help miss latimer did try but the attempt ended disastrously finding
thorne leaning over the port rail one day after the force of the second tem-
pest had spent itself she broke the ice by saying pleasantly 

   you make a very good sailor for a green hand mr thorne you
seem to take to it very naturally  

    i believe i told you when i first came aboard that i thought there was
a streak of salt water in me somewhere he returned smiling it was the
first time she had put herself out to speak to him in two weeks and he was
determined to show her he felt no resentment


a secret of the south pacific

    yes father said you were as good as two men in some things by the
time you get to aukland and start on your real voyage you will know con-
siderable about seafaring matters

    yet i began by being woefully sick you know

   that is nothing father says that many men who make the best of
sailors are seasick at first why you are a much better sailor than mr
monckton although he was not ill at all

   the expression of thornes face changed instantly at the mention of
moncktons name

   yes he said coldly and the pause which followed was actually
painful

   sydney flushed warmly it angered her that the mere mention of carter
moncktons name should have been received in such a manner

    mr thorne she said hastily  i think you do mr monckton an injus-
tice in-in thinking of him as you do and acting so toward him

    indeed  responded thorne and for an instant his eyes fairly blazed
into hers

    i do she said still more nettled  i do not think it honorable in you
to judge him so harshly because of what may have been his former conduct
a great many young men sow wild oats-

   but thorne was too disgusted to listen quietly how could any woman
speak of a man like monckton so leniently  he forgot for the moment that
sydney latimer was entirely unfamiliar with moncktons true character
the fellow had been extremely careful to keep his better qualities uppermost

    excuse me miss latimer he said  as you consider me so lacking
in honor i will relieve you of my presence mr monckton is coming yonder
i see  he will doubtless be much pleasanter company

   he bowed formally and turned abruptly away he did not look back
and therefore failed to see that sydney instead of greeting monckton turned
also and hastened below leaving the other passenger looking after her in
great amazement

   thorne bitterly upbraided himself for his own display of childish pique
he admitted in the privacy of his own cabin that that term more nearly fitted
it than aught else he had never met a girl before in whom he had taken
interest enough to care nuhom she made her friends but for some reason it
was galling to him to have sydney latimer so familiar with a man of carter
moncktons stamp

    cant she see through him  he thought in disgust  is she blind 
i swear i thought she had more character

   and then he tried to make himself believe that he didnt care a sixpence
any way  but with slight success sydney did not attempt to  make up
with him again however and affairs went on about as ever on the brig
thorne was with jessop even more now he often helped him at his work or
talked with him while off duty

    im thinkin sir twould have been a great saving of time for you if the
brig had touched at valparaiso said the sailor one evening as they leaned
over the rail together just forward of the main hatch
a secret of the south pacific

i

    you could have got just what you wanted there in the line of a craft
for your exploring trip  

    but the naida would have been a long way off her course

    no moren shes like to be now muttered jessop

    maybe captain latimer was afraid he would lose some of his crew if he
put in there said thorne giving the sailor a sidelong glance

    it would lia been a good thing all round if he did lose some of em
growled jessop

     what do you mean by that    demanded thorner
   but the man only shook his head gloomily

    come jessop said thorne  do you scent trouble-serious trouble-
through this atwell 

    sh  belay that sir whispered the man see yonder 

   he motioned with his stumpy thumb in the direction of the forecastle
there just in the shadow were two men in close conversation thorne
moved so that he could see them better while yet not appearing to look
he recognized one as sam atwell

    whos with him   he asked

   jessop did not reply for then the two men separated atwell dodged into
the forecastle but the other came aft as he passed the cooks quarters the
light from the galley fire shone full on his face it was carter monckton

   after the passenger had disappeared into the cabin thorne turned quietly
to jessop

    how long has that been going on   he asked

   this haint the first time responded the sailor non-committally

      but what does it mean   

    rum replied jessop bluntly

   what cried thorne horrified does atwell supply monckton
with liquor   

   jessop nodded

   i suspected atwell had some although i didnt see how he could
have smuggled it aboard captain latimer watched him like a hawk while
we lay in new york

      he got it fast enough   said the sailor shortl

   but i wouldnt have believed that monckton would stoop to such a
method of getting the stuff

    well if a man wants a drink i reckon he dont care much how he gets
it returned the sailor carelessly  they tell me that joung chaps been a
high roller ashore  hes likely to be somethin wuss before he sees the last of
the naida

    i can hardly believe it said thorne paying little attention to jessops
last words i havent seen him intoxicated since the niglit he came
aboard

    oh lord sir   exclaimed jessop with a chuckle  hes a sharp one
i heard atwell a sayin he was drunk below in his berth most o the time
durin that last bit of a blow sam passed the drink through the cabin
light to him


a secret of the south pacific

    see here said thorne gravely  what is atwell up to what does he
think hell make out of mr monckton  

    jessop was silent his brown fingers drumming a light tattoo on the brigs
rail

    come went on thorne  whats brewing i am convinced that the
man means mischief what sort of mischief is he up to  

    i dont know nothin about it mr thorne responded jessop surlily
haint got sam atwells confidence men my mate tom shields keeps
to ourselves 

    but you must suspect something- began thorne

   an what we suspects we keeps to ourselves likewise interrupted
jessop he turned abruptly away and strode forward leaving thorne in a
maze of doubt and perplexity

chapter viii-carter monckton interferes

    the  clink-clank  clink-clank  of the brakes throbbed through the ship
until every one felt the sound grate upon his nerves thorne heard even
burly mr pepper growling to the first mate one day that the old man
should have put into valparaiso for repairs but although they were
nearly in the latitude of the chilian port they were a long way to the west-
ward of it to run back would have meant an enormous waste-in the cap-
tains opinion-of both time and food and had he wished to run back this
soon became impossible a third gale drove the brig into the northwest-a
gale which each hour increased in violence

    at first it was welcomed for the wind blew steadily and although it was
carrying the old naida to the north of her true course it would be an easy
matter to run south again when the blow ceased but as the days passed it
seemed to have no intention of ceasing with but a few square feet of canvas
spread the naida flew before the hurricane and although a few seas broke
over her the waves wrenched her sorely

   the crew became more surly even the cook was unmanageable the
mulatto was a superstitious creature and he declared he had seen a ghost in the
brigs hold when he was down overhauling the stores there was an entrance
through the bulkhead of the galley into the hold and tonio got to his pantry
in that way there was no other way to get into the lower part of the brig
but by the hatches and they were battened down but the cook swore he
had seen a man climbing about over the cargo and the captain had to detail
mr pepper to  break out  such stores as were needed

   as the gale continued thorne noticed that carter monckton kept below
most of the time as for himself he stayed on deck ready to lend a hand to
anything that might come up

   one day after a particularly heavy sea had boarded the brig and had
soaked him to the skin he went below for dry apparel the cabin was
empty but as he descended the stairs the door of moncktons stateroom was
filing open and its occupant wild eyed and but half dressed rushed out into
the main cabin
a secret of the south pacific



     what is it   he yelled  is she sinking  what shall i do  

   he grabbed thorne by the arm his eyes were bloodshot  his face pale
as death there was no need to ask what was the matter with the fellow
he had been drinking heavily  that was plain

   come behave yourself exclaimed thorne shaking his arm free
 go back to your bunk aud sober up-dye hear the brig isnt sinking
we only shipped a big wave thats all

   he pushed monckton into his room again and shut the door

    pah  he muttered as he entered his own cabin  and thats the
fellow whose society our captains daughter prefers to mine

   but the hurricane blew itself out at length and the hot sun shone from
an unflecked sky once more the captain was able to take his first observa-
tion for nearly a fortnight

   jessop was standing near thorne when its result was made known he
uttered an involuntary exclamation

     what is it   asked the young man

    why sir were mighty close to the spot where the anna pixley was

when she took her last observation that island-

   well what about the island demanded thorne eagerly as jessop
hesitated

     it ought to be pretty nigh due north o here-as i could figure it out
thorne rushed below and examined his chart the sailor was right the
long continued gale had blown the naida so far off her course that she was
now but a short distance from that portion of the south pacific where the
strange island on which jessop had been wrecked was situated a great de-
sire to reach the island-to reach it at once-seized upon thorne could he
wait to make the rest of the passage to aukland and then work back again
before sighting the island on which edgar thorne might be living  he felt
as though he could not

   he went in search of the captain the naida was already being put about
on a more southerly tack

captain latimer he began eagerly do you realize where we are 
h-m-m  what dye mean  ive just taken my observation responded
the captain with a twinkle in his eye  i reckon ive got it straight sir
 i mean do you know that we are in that part of the ocean in which the
anna pixley burned   

     great scott  no   exclaimed the captain  wheres the chart 
thorne had brought his with him he showed him the place he had
marked  the map as being about the position of the island on which jessop
had been cast

     jessop says it must be almost due north of here-and it cant be far
pursued thorne  cant you put the naida on the opposite tack for a day
or so we may come across it

   captain latimer looked excited he examined the chart closely

     it would take us a good bit off our course he muttered thoughtfully
an the lord knows this is a going to be a long enough run as it is i
dunno what undercliff  monckton will say


a secret of the south pacific

    ill be answerable for mr undercliff said thorne  i feel sure he
would say  do it   

    but theres a mighty big chance of our not hitting it in a week of sun-
days returned the captain  and then again he admitted  we might
run slap up against it first thing

   it cant make much matter urged thorne were so far off our
course already 

    lets see what sessions thinks about it said the captain he raised
his voice and shouted for the first mate

   mr sessions approached and the third officer also joined them

    see here said latimer  what dye think of this you know what
mr thorne has come out with us for  he figures that this very island he is
after isnt far to the norward of us at this blessed minute he wants we
should put the brig on a northerly course for a day or two and see if we can
strike the island what dye think sessions youre acquainted with
these latitudes

   the mate took thornes chart and eyed it critically

    i dont know he said slowly

    whats the prospect of another storm   went on latimer  thats
the principal thing i dunno as the old brigll stand many more such strains
before she sees a dry dock have you tried the well this morning mr
pepper   

     no sir

    do so then

     aye aje sir  

    i dont see as there is much objection to such a course captain lati-
mer said mr sessions slowly

    if mr sessions doesnt i do interrupted a new voice

   thorne wheeled about and glared into the face of carter monckton

    well sir what havejjw got to say about it  demanded captain lati-
mer in surprise

    i object to the naida being run an inch off her course replied monck-
ton calmly

     is that so cried the captain the blood surging to his face

    yes i dont blame you captain pursued monckton but this has
been an expensive voyage for undercliff  monckton and every day we are
detained adds to the expense i represent my father in the matter and i
forbid it

   nobody spoke for fully a minute

   mr sessions with an expression of intense disgust on his face turned
and walked aft to the wheel

    what do you mean by this interference demanded thorne his wrath
blazing forth  are you drunk again 

    hold on mr thorne  exclaimed latimer  let me attend to this

i pray i hope im captain on my own deck yet though i begin to doubt it
when you two fellows get to quarreling

   but monckton responded to thornes bitter question
a secret of the south pacific

i

     youll not take this vessel off her course on any wild goose chase mr
thorne if you want to explore the whole south pacific for mythical islands
youll not do it in a ship of undercliff  moncktons

    and how long since you were constituted the representative of the firm 
queried thorne

      i am the son of one of the partners  not a mere dependent-a pauper-
who has been a charitable charge  a rich man all his life  

     be still mr monckton interposed captain latimer

   no let him go on said thorne with suppressed fury there is
good reason why he-and his father-should not want me to find that island
and bring edgar thorne back to the world i believe that  

     nonsense  why should wecaxo what becomes of your father rejoined
monckton hastily  i only object to the naidas being used in such a fool-
ish search captain latimer has his orders-

     and he knows em interrupted the captain gruffly  without no young
whippersnapper tellin him  

    thorne seized monckton by the arm and held him against the rail

 do you think by this to stop me from finding my father he asked
 ill bring him back to america if he is above ground and if i cant find
him ill move heaven and earth to clear his name of the suspicion that once
rested on it and ill fasten the stain on the guilty one  tell your father that 
gentlemen  gentlemen  what do you mean    exclaimed latimer

 this is unseemly-it is disgraceful i-

    at that instant mr pepper approached the group on the quarter his
face was drawn and white his hands trembled

     heres awful news captain   he stammered  the brig leaks like a
sieve  theres seven feet o water in the well  

chapter ix-open rebellion

    had a bomb been exploded in the group those composing it could not
have scattered more quickly captain latimer turned like a flash and leaped
to the main deck thorne let go of monckton and followed with pepper to
the pump well

    the sailors who had gathered about the pump fell sullenly back as the
officers approached atwell was there and his mutterings reached the cap-
tains ear

    stop that chattering you rascal and get to work here he exclaimed
chalking the pole and dropping it into the well

    when he drew it up it was plain that the third mates declaration was
only too true the water stood above the seven foot mark

     catch hold here four of you   sang out captain latimer

   his commands were uttered in quick jerky sentences he became in
that instant an entirely different man from the easy going slow spoken
yankee skipper who had thus far occupied the quarter deck

   think we can pump the whole thundering ocean through her
growled atwell hanging back


a secret of the south pacific

   quick as a flash latimer caught him a swinging blow which knocked him
into the scuppers

   this is no time for your capers my man  he said  mr pepper
get a fire started under the engine thatll suck the bilge out of her in
short order meanwhile do you fellows keep these brakes going or ill
keelhaul every mothers son of you

   atwell picked himself up and his hand stole into the bosom of his woolen
shirt there was a lump there which assured the watchful thorne that the
fellow was armed but the sailor did not draw the weapon instead- he
slunk away to the forecastle

   jessop came aft to the pumps near which thorne stood

    that chaps got it in for the capn sir he muttered in thornes ear
 therell be bad times here yet i wish wed put in to valparaiso an id
get out of her-i do 

   if theres trouble can we depend upon you and shields asked the
passenger

   you can depend on tom an me to keep strictly nootral returned
jessop quickly we aint lookin for trouble with eight or ten drunken
fools-not we  an evry one armed to the teeth at that 

     drunken  what do you mean   asked thorne

    i mean mr thorne that every one of em save me an tom if i can
keep it- away from him will be fighting drunk before night atwells gone
for the stuff now

   great heavens whispered thorne in an agony of apprehension
 how can you speak so calmly about it where does he keep the stuff
jessop shook his head

    not in the focstle he said  thats all  know about it

   thorne quickly ran to the cabin where captain latimer had gone he
found him with sydney anxiously bending over a chart marking out the
course for the nearest inhabited land for reference if the leak really proved
serious the girl was perfectly calm and even in the midst of his own anx-
iety thorne felt a flash of admiration for her

   he repeated what jessop had told him mr sessions came out of his
stateroom while he was talking and monckton came from his the latter
passed the group without a word and went on deck but he had heard all
thorne had to say

    what had we better do father  asked sydney  i fear the liquor
more than i do the men  

    search the forecastle and find it said mr sessions   ive suspected
they had the stuff more than once well throw it overboard

    right ye are   declared the captain  well destroy it i thought i
had kept atwell from bringing it aboard this voyage

   thorne had stepped to the other side of the room where he could see up
the companionway monckton was listening at the head of the stairs pie
disappeared the instant he saw himself observed

    if you want to do that exclaimed thorne quickly turning to the offi-
cers  go after that fellow and bring him back
a secret of the south pacific



   who

    monckton he has gone to warn atwell of your purpose replied the
passenger

   impossible mr thorne cried captain latimer while sydney
turned her back upon him

   thorne was furious

    this is no time for mincing matters he said harshly  that fellow
has been supplied all through the voyage with drink by atwell i tell you
he has gone to warn him of your plans now  

    either you are a fool or  am one   cried the captain tartly

   thank you responded the younger man we have held different
opinions  that point right along and by the looks of things now i believe
you will be proven the fool but enough of this i tell you he has gone to
speak with atwell i call on you to go with me and prove or disprove my
statement   

   he led the way to the deck captain latimer and the mate followed
him

   as they made their appearance one of the sailors uttered a shrill whistle
the next instant monckton came out of the forecastle captain latimers
eyes blazed as he strode forward

   what are you doing here he demanded pushing thorne aside and
looking at monckton searchingly  go aft sir and keep away from the
sailors quarters

   then he descended into the forecastle thorne and sessions close upon
his heels the place was deserted save for sam atwell who reclined in a
berth

    get up out o here you lazy lout roared latimer  is this a time
for a man to be lying abed you go up too mr sessions and send tonio
here to me

   atwell got up slowly and moved hesitatingly toward the entrance

   stir your stumps    said the exasperated little mate

   atwell was almost twice his size but sessions had enough pluck for half a
dozen men and more muscle than thorne would have imagined from his ap-
pearance he seized the sailor by the collar and slack of his trousers and
actually pitched him forward on his hands and knees

    get up on deck there   he exclaimed and followed his command with
a sound kick which added very much to the celerity with which the fellow
obeyed

   grim as the situation was thorne laughed

   ordinarily i dont approve of an officer striking a man aboard ship
remarked captain latimer with a peculiar smile  but if ever a chap needed
a first class licking that sam atwell does

   tonio came down to them in a minute

   yank every living thing out o these bunks cook said latimer
an sarch every mans kit if theres liquor here ill have it

    jessop says its not kept in the forecastle remarked thorne mildly

    yes thats because he doesnt want it found likely


a secret of the south pacific

   thorne saw that there was no use trying to break down quarter deck
prejudice so he stood by in silence and watched tonios fruitless search

    its no use massa latimer declared the cook  dere aint no
whisky hyar ise sarched eberyting

   captain latimer led the retreat to the deck in gloomy silence as they
came out of the forecastle his eyes rested on a scene amidships which brought
an exclamation of dismay to his lips back to back against the mainmast
stood the mates sessions and pepper the former with a drawn revolver the
latter holding a pump brake aloft in his brawny hands the sailors were
grouped about the pump and atwell was talking loudly

   tom shields the englishman was at the wheel and jessop stood beside
him leaning on the rail his back to the scene as though it had not the slight-
est interest for him but while captain latimer and the cook stared at this
thornes gaze was attracted by something entirely different rolling up
from the south was a sinister looking mass of cloud its tipper edge of a
strange copper hue it was bearing directly for the brig and driving the sea
in a hissing white wave before it

chapter x-the towering cliff

     mutiny captain latimer    roared mr pepper seeing his superior
with the cook and thorne appear at the forecastle door  the scoundrels
refuse to work the pumps  

   weve jerked these old pump brakes long enough cried atwell
 well do it no longer

     an right ye are mate    growled one of his backers   let the old
tub sink

    well take to the boats an let her go down an be hanged to her  
chimed in a third

   the men were in earnest and glowered defiantly at their officers

    fools   shouted the captain beside himself with wrath  if there zs
a leak the brig will sink while youre monkeying this way

    mebbe we are fools returned atwell but we aint goin to be
starved an kep at those pump brakes all the time  

   dont you see im gettin the engine fired up you fellows de-
manded pepper striving to speak pacifically  well soon couple her onto
the pumps

    to blazes with your engine   was atwells comment  weve struck
work men my mates an that settles it

   captain latimer started aft

   hold on there  called out atwell stay forward weve got ye
separate an we mean to keep ye so get back into the focstle all three of
ou

   he drew a big revolver from his breast and covered the captain and his
two companions at the signal every man among the mutinous crew
brought out some sort of a weapon there were three or four pistols beside
atwells
a secret of the south pacific



    im out of it   groaned latimer  my revolver is in my cabin

    so is mine said thorne  wed better get under cover

   tonio had already dodged down the forecastle steps again

   letem have the deck capn shouted mr sessions  well hold
the cabin  

   he and pepper made a dash for the forward companionway and dived
below at the same moment thorne saw miss latimer at the galley door
monckton was with her

   theres the gal yelled atwell catching sight of the brigs second
mate drive her into the cabin we want the galley

   but as he spoke the galley door was slammed to and fastened

   shes got my revolver exclaimed captain latimer in delight
 theyll not get into that galley in a hurry well starve em till theyll
be glad to come to terms  

   he and thorne followed tonio into the forecastle thorne stopped to
fasten the door the slide in the deck was already closed and tonio bolted
it

    theyll take off a hatch and get to the stores suggested the passen-
ger in response to the captains last remark

   they wont if sydney keeps her wits about her an i reckon she
will replied the captain with pride  the galley opens into the hold she
can keep any of those scamps from getting down by the hatches the galley
can be reached from the cabin too the mates can relieve her theyll be
all right and if we had some sort of a shooting iron wed be all right too 
thorne thought of the strange cloud he had seen rolling up from the
south and wondered what would happen when that struck the brig tonio
climbed upon the mess chest to light the swinging lamp  but captain lati-
mer bade him let it alone

     its dark in here if we light that thing those wretches can come along
pry aside that shutter an pick us off if theyre so minded

   just then there was a fusillade of shots on deck the captain groaned
aloud he did not fear for himself  but he trembled for his daughters
safety

   suddenly thorne heard a faint rap on the after bulkhead of the fore-
castle he stepped softly across the room and listened the noise was
repeated something creaked in the partition and to his vast surprise a
narrow door swung slowly open

   what the mischiefs that shouted captain latimer while tonio
uttered a howl of terror

   somebody stood at the door with a lantern

   come this way whispered the newcomer hoarsely you havent a
moment to lose they are attacking the galley sir

   it was carter monckton 

   how did you get here what sort of deviltry is this gasped the
captain

   he snatched the lantern from moncktons grasp and examined the secret
door


a secret of the south pacific

   a neat job of joiners work indeed he exclaimed hung on
leather hinges nobodyd notice the crack in this dark corner what do
you know about this cook   

   i swar to goodness massa latimer i nebber knowed nottiu erbout
it declared tonio

   this is some of atwells work said the captain  but how did you
know about it  

   he turned upon monckton with blazing eyes and seized him roughly by
the shoulder

   thorne although intensely interested in what was going on beside him
was also aware that something of serious import was taking place on deck
the firing had ceased there were shouts of command and the tread of
hurrying feet

   them debbles are lowerin de boats an leabinus cap n latimer  
cried tonio rushing to the door

   as he spoke the brig seemed to strike some obstruction and she quivered
from bow to stern

     shes struck a reef   exclaimed the captain his face paling

    no no  shouted thorne as tonio flung open the door  its the
storm i saw it coming up

   the wind was shrieking like a pack of fiends through the writhing spars
and rigging and the sea all about the brig was whipped to foam it was im-
possible to see half a cables length beyond the rail

    a typhoon   roared captain latimer as he sprang past the cook to
the deck

   atwell was yelling orders like a madman such sails as had been spread
when the tempest struck had been torn from their bolts in a flash but the
ex mate was doing what he could to right the laboring brig she lay over
on her side till the sea ran over her rail at the wheel stood tom shields
and jessop hanging to the spokes for dear life

   thorne slammed to the forecastle door and followed the captain and
tonio across the staggering deck the sailors who a few minutes before
were carryiiig things with such a high hand now clung to the shrouds with
fear stricken faces latimer brushed the impotent atwell aside he seized
a battered trumpet from beneath the quarter rail and shouted his orders
through it

   never did men spring more willingly to obey him tonio and thorne
laid hold of the ropes with the others it was a stupendous battle but at
last still staggering unsteadily under the force of the wind the old naida
swung around and began to forge ahead before the gale but she wallowed
low in the heavy seas

   thorne tried the well as near as he could judge the water had gained
nearly two feet he ran and told the captain

    knock on the cabin door and tell the mates whats happened he said

 then for gods sake mr thorne take a look at my little girl see whats
happened to her  

   thorne hurried to the cabin and knocked on the door
a secret of the south pacific



     keep away from here you villains   he heard mr sessions say  im
 going to shoot

    dont do it   cried thorne quickly the captains got control of
 the deck again come out

    sessions and pepper at once appeared both fully armed tonio was
 building another fire under the boiler of the engine a wave which had
 boarded the brig having put the first out

    you villains keep forward of the mast there captain latimer com-
 manded addressing the cowed crew dont one of you come aft unless
 youre told jessop you and shields remain at the wheel

    thorne dashed below and after arming himself in his stateroom went
 forward to the galley he found sydney on guard with a big  bull dog 
 revolver and a loaded cane she was pale but calm

     is father hurt   were her first words

     not at all thorne assured her  he has control of the deck again
 he feared something had happened to you

     no no she said hastily  i am all right but i am worried for mr
 monckton he went into the hold saying that he thought he could reach
 you in the forecastle by climbing over the cargo have you seen him   
 he is safe replied thorne shortly you had better go to your
 cabin now i think miss latimer it is simply an armistice between the
 crew and the officers trouble may break out again at any moment  

     you forget that  am an officer also she said coldly

    she threw open the galley door and stepped out upon the deck thorne
 followed her the worst of the tempest seemed to have passed but the wind
 still blew strongly from the south aloft the rigging of the brig was a mass
 of broken and twisted cables half the lighter spars had been blown away
 and the top of the foremast was broken short off

    the naida labored fearfully in the waves which were beginning to run
 very high it needed little sea lore to assure thorne that the craft was in a
 very bad way indeed the sailors all but jessop and his chum tom shields
 had disappeared

    where is mr monckton father  asked sydney the instant she
 reached his side

    i dont know returned the captain  he was in the forecastle the
 last i saw of him has he come out mr thorne  

     hes still with his friends responded thorne pointedly

   what do you mean demanded sydney wrathfully has he been
left to the mercy of those men  

     ill go forward and see whats the matter with him-volunteered mr

  pepper

    thorne and the captain looked at each other but said nothing

    ere this tonio had got up steam in the engine and now with mr ses-
 sions assistance coupled  the pumps immediately a full stream of
 muddy water began to spit into the scuppers and run out of the hawse holes

    mr pepper made his way forward and peered in at the forecastle sky-
 light from which the slide had been drawn back again the lamp burned


a secret of the south pacific

 dimly above the mess chest and the sailors were gathered about it drinking
 atwell had brought out a plentiful supply of liquor from his secret hiding
 place the treacherous scoundrel and mockton were conversing earnestly
 together in one corner the passenger appeared in no danger from the
 mutineers

   the amazed pepper was about to go aft again when something looming
up in the gloom ahead caught his eye he looked again shielding his eyes
from the flying spray with his hand the outlines of some vast object
slowly developed it was an enormous cliff towering high above the naidas
tallest spar 

   he dashed back to the group near the quarter

    land  land dead ahead  

   the cry paralyzed his hearers lven captain latimer was helpless with
the horror of it he drew sydney to him and they clung together  the
break of the quarter while the great brig tore  her fateful course now
above the howling gale was borne to their ears the roar of the breakers
the outlines of the towering cliff stretched away on either hand there was
no break in the wall

   thorne clinging to the wire cable which guarded the ladder to the
quarter felt a numbness at his heart this was the end then that awful
sea would dash them in pieces against the rock he saw the two mates
shaking hands solemnly tonio was on his knees beside the hissing engine
praying with all the fervor of his emotional negro nature and the sailors-
those half drunken creatures in the forecastle-they would go into eternity
unprepared-unwarned 

    theyll drown like rats in a trap   was his thought

   he staggered forward striving to reach the forecastle ere the brig struck
but he was too late with a grinding crash the naida was hurled forward
upon the reef a great wave broke over the stern and swept the deck from
end to end

    the boats-its our only hope   thorne heard captain latimer shout
 get ready the cutter mr sessions i put sydney in your charge

   he dashed into the cabin a great wave followed him and flooded the
place in a moment the brig remained upright on the reef having become
wedged in her position but every wave came in over her stern and her
breaking up was a matter of but a few hours -perhaps a few minutes the
forecastle door had become jammed and thorne heard the imprisoned men
beating on it he seized an iron pin from the mast and pried it open the
crazed sailors burst out and started aft with wild shrieks and curses

   mr sessions stood at the cutter with a drawn revolver

   keep away he shouted warningly take the long boat ill
shoot the first man who comes aft

   thorne saw the third mate stagger out of the galley laden with provisions
tonio was unlashing a water cask amidships mr latimer was already
crouching in the bottom of the cutter

   he struggled to the cabin and plunged down the stairs captain lat-
imer passed him with the logbook and cashbox in his hands he shouted
a secret of the south pacific



something to thorne as he went up but the passenger kept on to his own
quarters if they were to be cast away upon a desert island the ship biscuit
and salt meat pepper had produced would not last long sydney could not
subsist on such food it was for her welfare he thought

   he seized a valise and tumbled a lot of his canned provisions into it
then he rushed to her cabin and tore open the door everything was in
confusion but he found her workbox he threw that into the valise also
and followed it with several small articles from the drawer of her dressing
case then he started for the deck

   as he mounted the stairs a great wave met him and swept him back into
the flooded cabin but he clung to the valise and got upon his feet again
it was pitch dark in the place it was almost as dark outside as he
reached the deck once more not a soul was in sight

   he staggered out upon the slippery planks and shouted hoarsely no
voice replied but by his side there suddenly appeared the form of a man
thorne recoiled and threw up his arm to shield his head from the blow he
saw was about to fall but the weapon descended and thorne fell to the
wrave swept deck and lay prone stunned and motionless 

chapter xi-cast away

   night had now shut down upon the wind beaten sea occasionally
splashes of rain churned the wtaves to foam or a vivid flash of lightning lit
up the awful scene while the thunder muttered overhead the tropical
typhoon had passed almost as quickly as it had risen  but it had left in its wake
a tempest of wind and rain beneath which the stoutest bark might stagger
the naida caught between the huge jaws of the reef reeled and shook be-
neath every blow the sea dealt her

   the masts had quickly wrenched themselves free their falling had
driven the two boats with their human freight from the brigs side and
when they were pushed off and rowed desperately for the unknown coast
they left the unconscious form of howard thorne lying upon the deck
every wave as it rolled solemnly up behind broke high above the quarter
and poured its tons upon tons of water inboard the roaring turbulent
stream confined for the moment between the yet unbroken bulwarks swept
everything movable forward it rolled the inanimate body of thorne over
and over into the scuppers but it could not break his hold upon the valise
he clung to that with a death grip

   the rough treatment however aroused him at last the blow dealt by
his unknown assailant had glanced from his arm to his head the arm
hung all but helpless by his side  but it had saved his head he struggled
into a sitting posture between two waves the roar of the breakers under
the brigs bow deafened him  the confusion of the elements was all about 
yet with returning consciousness came the activity of mind that belongs to
the physically brave man

   the wreck would not hold together long under the terrific onslaught of
the waves if he would save himself he must work quickly he clung to


a secret of the south pacific

the bulwarks while another sea passed and then ran across the deck to a
heavy grating with difficulty he loosed it from its lashings and dragged it
from under the debris heaped upon it

   he first fastened his precious valise securely to this poor raft then he
obtained a heavy axe from the cooks galley and an oar from the chest amid-
ships his injured arm pained him cruelly with every movement  but he
set his teeth seized the axe and attacked the bulwarks livery time a sea
dropped over the stern he was nearly carried off his feet he worked like a
tiger when the deck was clear

   at length he accomplished his purpose a wave surging across the
deck carried away a great piece of the splintered rail a breach was made
into which he dragged his raft with a rapid turn of the line he bound him-
self to the grating and awaited the onslaught of the next wave

   it came tumbling over the stern in a great turbid flood and rushed
seething and foaming forward the grating was caught up like a chip upon
its bosom and with a roar and crash he was in the midst of the turmoil of
waters over the reef the sea boiled like a caldron beneath the brigs bows
but thorne was carried safely beyond the rocks driven onward by the
momentum of the wave the raft neared the towering cliffs thorne raised
himself upon his knees wrenched the oar free and tried to paddle with it 
but the implement was torn from his weakened grasp and he could only fall
upon his face and cling to the tossing raft

   had the boats bearing his companions in distress reached the land  he
saw no light upon the shore he could distinguish a narrow line of shingle on
which the billows broke with sullen roar  but only when the fitful lightning
illuminated the scene could he see objects clearly

   he was being driven into an inlet or cove the shore lay upon his left-
the frowning cliffs seemed towering all around him he struggled madly to
beach the grating he even slid off into the sea and strove to touch bottom
but the water was too deep

   the current had grasped his frail support as though with a giant hand
and was hurling it upon the cliffs he fought despairingly to push the
grating to laud but it was impossible

   then he let go his hold and struck out for the shore alone once he
touched bottom but a receding wave snatched him away again the sea
played with him as a cat might with her prey he was tossed like a bit of
flotsam from wave to wtave

   suddenly as he was again swept shoreward he saw a wind driven figure
standing at the waters edge he shouted and threw up his hand there
was an answering cry and as he came nearer the figure rushed in and
caught him by the arm the wave broke and ran far up the beach leaving
them sprawling in the boiling surf thorne struggled to his feet he
seized his companion by the hand a vivid flash of lightning lit up the
scene it was sydney latimer 

    quick   she gasped  quick before we are swept back again  

   but even as she spoke another billow broke around them they went
down before it once more they struggled up still clinging to each others
a secret of the south pacific



hand then the fearful undertow caught them in its embrace and they
were dragged out and away- overwhelmed - smothered - drowned in the
boiling surf 

   thornes heart throbbed convulsively his one thought was that she
had sacrificed her life for him he seized her around the body and fought
his way to the surface they were far out from the shore and not even his
raft was in reach now

   she has killed herself for me   he cried the words aloud and struck
out like a mad man for the shore

    dont-i feel a current let it carry us she murmured

   she knew more about the sea than he he obeyed still bearing her up
with his uninjured arm the foam streaked waters swept them on into the
cut but thorne noticed that the waves no longer broke around them the
pounding of the surf was all behind

   suddenly an eddy swung them toward the cliff on the right he struck
with cruel force against a rock  but he seized it and hung on grimly

    saved   he cried

   bearing the almost lifeless form of the girl upon his shoulder he dragged
himself out of the seas reach at last-miraculous as it seemed-he stood
upon the land

    put me down i can walk said sydney faintly

   he did so as another flash of the fitful lightning revealed their surround-
ings the beach was narrow here and huge masses of fallen boulders lay at
the foot of the cliff among those rocks must be some shelter - some rude
cavity which might shield them from the gusts of rain which now and then
swept in from the sea thorne looked at the girl pityingly her wet gar-
ments clung close to her figure and the sea had torn some of them almost
from her his own clothing was in shreds he had lost his hat and his shoes
he had kicked off before leaving the wreck sydneys hair had become
loosened and hung down upon her shoulders drenched and heavy

   we must not stand here said thorne taking her hand again

 where are the others   

    father and the mates are somewhere near the place where i first saw
you thejr were looking for the long boat

      then the cutter got safely ashore   

    yes tonio and two of the sailors-jessop and shields-came with us
they feared the long boat had been wrecked and went to search along the
shore  

    well we cannot cross this inlet again in the dark we must find some
shelter for the night

     but father will think something has happened to me he will believe
that i am drowned

    hell find youre not in the morning and joy never kills they say
responded thorne gaining courage now that he felt firm ground beneath his
feet once more  you risked your life to try to save me miss latimer and
ill make it my business to return you safely to your father first let us
find some place out of the wind you are shaking with the cold


a secret of the south pacific

   he led her along the shore they had not gone ten yards when she
stopped with a little cry

     whats that  see it just below us there  

    her eyes were sharper than his

     its part of the wreck he replied  the whole shore will be strewn
with it before morning  	

    ah  but there is something bound to it too she trembled with
more than the cold  is it a body  what became of mr monckton   

    thorne made no reply he ran down to the waters edge

     glorious   he shouted  its my raft and heres the valise

    he pulled out his knife cut it free and came staggering back to her side
with the drenched bag

     why do you burden yourself with that she asked

     its more precious than gold to us now he replied

      what do you mean   

     you will see once we find our refuge he said trying to speak lightly

    they had not far to go before they came upon just such a place as thorne
had hoped to find he had noticed the porous formation of the cliff and
expected there were cavities of some size in it an opening before which
the sea in some great gale had thrown up a barrier of sand and driftwood
yawned hospitably thorne hurried his companion toward it

    suppose there is something in there sydney suggested timidly

     then we will kill and eat it declared the young man laughing but
to reassure her he plunged ahead and entered the cavity alone

    she heard him shout to her from within

   come on he cried it is capital the floor seems as dry as a
bone and the roof overhangs the mouth of the cave and shelters it from the
sea  

    she followed him hesitatingly

     wait-stay just where you are till i light a match he said

     a match after having been in the sea  demanded sydney

     a match can be carried in a water tight safe my dear oung lady it
is quite evident that you were never cast away before

    in a moment a pleasant little flame sprang up in one corner thorne ran
for more wood there was a great quantity just at the mouth of the cave-
the debris from former wrecks soon a roaring fire lit up the whole place and
its grateful warmth imparted new life to their chilled bodies

     isnt it glorious  he cried heaping on the fuel  still we are in a
semi trophical latitude and when the sun shines it must be hot enough
here  

     but jrou are prodigal with the fuel she said

     there is plenty-cords of it he returned and went out for more to
prove his assertion

    soon he came staggering back under the weight of a great plank which
he threw down at one side

     this is too big to burn and i cant break it up he remarked  but it
will make us a good seat
a secret of the south pacific



    see-there is something on it said sydney

    its a plank from some ships hull-why thats a name  

    the paint was almost worn off but some of the letters were still traceable

                     jua f r
                     san f

   thorne uttered a stifled exclamation

   what is it mr thorne cried sydney startled by the look on his
face

    it is-it must be   he murmured

     ivhai is it  what do you mean  

    it is a part of the wreck of the juan fernandez of san francisco my
father sailed in that vessel from america jessop saw the wrreck on the
shore of the island where he was cast we are on that island now 

chapter xii-into the tunnels mouth

   then the island is inhabited exclaimed sydney after an instants
silence  i am so glad

     it may be inhabited returned thorne seriously jessop said not
yet he could not explain the appearance of the man who rescued him other-
wise there was no other spot of land visible from this island he declared
it is wonderful that we should fall upon it

   it is coincidental but not wonderful we knew it was somewhere
near us and the typhoon drove us in the right direction  that is all we
should not have suspected its proximity had we sailed by in the night

   thorne paced back and forth before the fire he was excited his face
was flushed his hands trembled

    this must be the place he repeated  if there were two islands in
these waters some navigator would have found them ere this and if this
is the spot my father is here  miss latimer you cannot realize what that
means to me  

   no i cannot she said sympathetically but i shall be glad for
your sake if he is here

    he must be   exclaimed the young man almost wildly

    dont disturb yourself so mr thorne she said  see  you must be
wearied i am almost exhausted myself and faint too

   ah forgive me  he cried this discovery has made me forget 
he brought the water soaked valise to the fire sydney had spread her
tattered skirts before the blaze and was now comparatively dry she watched
him curiously as he opened the bag

    im afraid i did not get the most important things after all he said
deprecatiugly the water had already flooded your cabin when i got
there  

    my cabin 

    yes he responded with a smile  i hope you will pardon the lib-
erty i ransacked your quarters for what i thought you might most need-
the small articles of course i couldnt bring much in this bag


a secret of the south pacific

   she looked at him curiously but said nothing

    first of all here is your workbox he continued  just spread the
things out here on the plank until they dry see  here is a looking glass in
the cover of the box-and it didnt break i knew that even a lady in a
desert land would want a looking glass and here are a lot of little things
there are hairpins among them-a whole box i know youll thank me for
them and a comb when your hair is dry you can do it up again but
here are the principal things he took out the various tins of meats soup
and fruit and arranged them along the board what will you have for
supper miss latimer  take your choice now that i am sure we are on
the same island that jessop was cast away upon i feel relieved on the score
of food supply for he tells me there are fruit and vegetables here

   then he looked up at her and found that she was crying

    why what is it   he exclaimed  i have been rattling on here like
a silly pated noodle and of course you are worried half to death about your
father and your own position im a brute  

    that is not it at all she declared vehemently

    what is it then 

     have you done all this for me  and i believed-how could you be so
thoughtful mr thorne

    nonsense   he exclaimed driving his knife blade into the cover of a
tin of soup  any man would have done the same

     even my father was not so thoughtful of my welfare   she said gravely

 why did you do it  

   he looked up with the knife still poised over the can their eyes met
the blood flew to sydneys face and thorne dropped his gaze but she did
not pursue her inquiry further and there fell a little silence between them

   thorne opened the can and set it down to heat when it was ready he
produced a little folding cup from his pocket from which she drank her
share the soup seemed to revive her  but the strain of both mind and body
which thorne had experienced began to tell on him again sydney noticed
the evident pain it caused him to use his left arm

    you are hurt mr thorne she said  how did it happen 

   he hesitated before replying he believed monckton had been his as-
sailant  yet it would only hurt her feelings if he told her so evidently
captain latimer had not spoken to her of his own recently formed suspicions
in regard to carter moncktons complicity in atwells plot

   it was done just as i came up from the cabin with the valise he
said  something struck me on the arm-and on my head too but for-
tunately the arm saved the head i was only knocked senseless for a little
while that is why i did not get to the cutter  

   and we thought you and mr monckton were in the long boat she
exclaimed just before we pushed off father asked atwell if the passen-
gers were with him and he said they were

   thorne remained silent

    let me see your arm she said  it isnt broken is it  

       i guess not  
a secret of the south pacific

i

   he removed his coat and pushed up the shirt sleeve beneath the
injured member was black from shoulder to elbow

   oh she cried it must pain you cruelly-and you never saida
word

   she seized the empty soup tin and ran out of the cave in a moment she
returned with a quantity of sea water and set it over the fire to boil thorne
leaned against the wall of the cave with his eyes closed she got her scissors
from the drenched work box and ripped off the sleeve of his shirt then
when the water was hot she used her own handkerchief to bathe his arm and
finally bound it up tightly in the shirt sleeve

    you must not try to use it for a long time she said  i wish i had
some liniment to put on it  

    thats one of the things i forgot to put in the valise he rejoined with
a smile

   but he disobeyed her injunction for he roused himself sufficiently to go
outside and gather a quantity of drift wood and pile it up near at hand that
he might feed the fire during the night without being obliged to move far
he begged her to take some rest for it was then past midnight at first she
refused but at length tired nature asserted itself and she began to nod
they sat side by side upon the plank and soon her head dropped upon his
shoulder he put his good arm about her waist and eased her into a more
comfortable position and she slept on like a child

   he did not sleep himself his injured arm prevented that but he kept
the fire burning brightly and by its light watched the color come and go in
the face lying  his breast in its frame of tangled hair toward dawn the
booming of the surf grew less harsh the storm was subsiding and the
troubled seas beat upon the rocks with a rhythmic sound like the lower notes
of a great organ through the opening of the cave he could see the light in
the sky grow stronger

   the fire died down to a bed of glowing coals the fresh morning air
swept into the cave and sydney awoke

   thornes face bending over her was the first thing her eyes rested upon
perhaps she was not quite awake for she smiled up at him and did not seek
to move her head from his arm for a moment her eyes closed drowsily
and then she suddenly started up with a full realization of her position
the rich color mounted into her face in an instant  but her eyes expressed
nothing but gratitude to him

    why mr thorne i have slept   she said

   all night miss latimer he replied huskily see-the morning is
breaking  

    and your poor arm-how is it   she asked as he assisted her to rise

   well it is still with me he returned trying to smile

   they walked to the mouth of the cave there was already light enough
upon the sea for them to distinguishobjects quite clearly a long way out
from the shore the waves broke in foam over the reef on which the naida
had been cast but the brig had disappeared her wreckage strewed the
beach and rolled in the surf as far as they could see in either direction


a secret of the south pacific

   their eyes involuntarily sought each others face after the awful expe
rience of the night they could never be the same to each oher if thorne
had disapproved of sydney before he had forgotten it and if she had be-
lieved him narrow minded and dishonorable she had seen her error thorne
caught his breath with a little gasp and turned away he could not say
what was in his heart now it would be taking an unfair advantage of her
and would place her in a position hard indeed to bear he would wait

   sydney was eager to set out at once to find her father and the others but
thorne would not allow her to stir away from the cave until she had eaten
heartily of the remaining cau of soup

     we will hide the rest of these provisions here he said

    but why not take them with us  they will be a great addition to the
supplies we brought in the cutter  

    we will see how things are first he returned slowly

   they might find atwell and the other mutinous sailors in control at the
castaways camp and he knew that his scanty store of preserved food would
be quickly disposed of by the reckless fellows with no thought for her needs

   the sun had risen by the time they set out the strange land on which
they had been cast was revealed as far as they could see on either hand
the grayish cliffs rose unbroken to a height of three or four hundred feet
between the cliffs and the sea was a slightly sloping margin of shingle vary-
ing from a few yards to thirty or forty rods in width the base of the cliff
was strewn with broken boulders which had fallen from the summit in some
upheaval of nature

   thorne examined the formation of the rock by daylight with interest

    why it is coral   he said  these great cliffs are all the same

    but the coral insect only works below the sea level objected sydney

    very true  but the fact remains that this was once a vast coral reef
built perhaps millions of years ago and now upheaved by some submarine
eruption jessop told me these unscalable cliffs surround the center of the
island in an unbroken chain it may have been one of those wonders of
coral formation-an atoll when the floor of the ocean on which it rested
was upheaved this reef became a precipice

   they left the cave and walked back toward the inlet into which the cur-
rent had swept them the night before thorne was alert for bits of valuable
wreckage and often ran down and rescued a cask or chest from the surf
the tide was almost at its full and it was possible to drag these articles
above high water mark

    the inlet was fully two cables length in breadth at the sea but it rapidly
narrowed and was less than a quarter of a mile in length the cliff skirted it
quite closely they saw that much of the debris from the wreck was being car-
ried toward the head of the inlet by the current which set in from the sea

   their progress was slow but at length they drew near the end of the
now narrow strait the current still looked strong and instead of there
being a footway around the head of the inlet the water lapped against the
foot of the cliff itself in the center was a low opening and in this mysteri-
ous tunnel the water disappeared
a secret of the south pacific



    weve got to wade across after all said thorne in vexation  but
its not very wide thats one satisfaction

      nor very deep   

     it doesnt look so from here but ill go across first and try it

   indeed youll not declared sydney i am going with you mr
thorne 

   so he said no more but prepared to breast the flood the water looked
black and cold  but it was not deep near shore so they waded boldly in
sydney hardly came up to his shoulder and he was waist deep before thorne
began to feel the force of the current against his limbs

     it-it is deep she said with a gasp

    never mind stick close to me he returned reassuringly  i can
keep my footing in a good deal deeper water than this

   he drew her closer to him and encircled her waist with his arm thus
bearing her above the flood he pressed on the rocks were slippery be-
neath his feet  the treacherous undertow tugged at his limbs  but he moved
on

   they had almost reached the center of the stream when a little cry from
sydney startled him he turned his gaze upon the bank before them a
man stood there staring at them with blazing eyes and with pale passion
convulsed face

   it is mr monckton-he is alive   exclaimed sydney

   but her cry which had drawn thornes gaze momentarily from the cur-
rent was fateful his next step was unsteady the rock slipped and in a
breath they were floundering in the water thorne struggled desperately to
regain his foothold and quickly got his head above the surface again syd-
ney was choking with the salt water but otherwise uninjured

   to his horror however he could not recover his balance on the slippery
rocks somehow he had stepped beyond his depth and the current was drag-
ging him and his precious burden toward the yawning mouth of the tunnel

   he turned his agonized face imploringly to the shore

    help  quick if you would save us   he gasped

   monckton heard him a sort of shudder went through his frame but he
did not move

    for gods sake   shrieked thorne feeling his strength deserting him
and the current tightening its hold  if you are a man save her   

   then monckton moved he staggered down to the margin of the cur-
rent but thorne and his burden had already swept by the spot

    never mind me-save her   was his despairing cry

   monckton ran along the rocky edge of the torrent sydney stretched
out her arms to him and then caught by some fitful eddy she was snatched
away from the shore they both whirled around in the center of the current
for an instant and then shot downward into the tunnel thorne caught at
the ragged rocks past which they were swept his hand was torn his arm
wrenched

   then the current bore them in toward the side of the tunnel he seized
a point of rock and drew his body half out upon it but the water as though


a secret of the south pacific

fearful of losing all its prey put forth added effort and sydney was torn from
his weakened grasp he struggled out upon the rock and strove to pierce
the blackness with his eyes uttering shout after shout of despair but only
the mournful echo of his own voice came back to him through the awful
gloom

chapter xiii-foes in adversity

   in a hollow between two heaps of sheltering rock a little fire of driftwood
was burning these rocks and the towering gray cliff sheltered the place on
three sides before the seaward side two boats were drawn up on the sand-
the cutter and long boat of the naida

   there were two groups of men near the fire the larger consisted of
atwell and nine of the sailors at the other side of the blaze an old gray
haired man sat upon the ground his elbows on his knees his face resting in
his hands it was captain latimer and with him was mr sessions mr
pepper and the mulatto cook tonio

   i said there were two groups there were three for jessop and tom
shields occupied a position between the other two they were still   neutral  
and claimed fellowship with both-or neither the entire party had just
breakfasted from the stores that had been brought in the cutter the sailors
were too terror stricken to think of food when they left the brig

    see here sir pepper was saying with his hand on the captains shoul-
der  she cant have been drowned shes just got lost along the shore here
tonio and ill go up the coast an see if shes beyond tbat inlet

    its no use pepper responded the old man sorrowfully  ive been
tramping these sands an callin on her all night shed ha heard me if she
had been above board  

    mebbe shes found mr thorne an theyre together somewhere

   but captain latimer shook his head

   poor thorne he said  he never got away from the brig that
villain atwell told me he was in the long boat an i believed him i might
ha known hed get square with the poor lad if he once got the chance i
saw thorne in the cabin as i was cornin out and i dont believe he ever got
on deck again

    well  wont believe either he or miss sydneys gone below till i find
their bodies on the shore yonder declared pepper  wheres monckton  

   hes been out searching for them too most all night replied the
captain

   a lot he cares about finding thorne muttered sessions in the third
mates ear  i guess hes a good deal cut up about the girl though

    come on tonio lets we see if we can cross that inlet suggested
pepper

    youd better wait a bit sir said jessop looking up

      hows that   

    you cant cross that inlet while the tides runnin like a millrace the
only time when its safe to do it is when shes just on the turn
a secret of the south pacific



   youre sure this is the island you was wrecked on before   demanded
sessions

     no doubt of it sir

      well we didnt have to hunt far to find it  remarked the mate   youd
better hear to jessop pepper  

   at that moment another man approached along the sand it was monck-
ton his face pallid his hands shaking as though with the palsy

    whats the good word asked pepper

    monckton shook his head crossed to the opposite side of the fire and sat
down silently atwell who had been looking at him curiously got up and
offered him his flask the other clutched it and drank eagerly

     d ye see that said sessions in a low tone  those rascals have got
liquor as long as it lasts well have trouble with em

     then the sooner they get rid of it the better growled pepper

     i thank the lord there was none of the stuff in the brigs cargo went
on sessions  so they wont be able to broach a cask here on the shore and
get howling drunk as ive seen a crew do under similar circumstances

   we ought to get to work on some of this stuff thats floating in
though whispered pepper we may be thankful for it we must do
something to rouse the old mans interest in things or hell go quite off his
chump

    just then jessop and shields rose and moved away from the fire

    where are you going men  demanded sessions

   were after some green stuff-vegetables sir replied jessop i
know where some grows not moren a mile or two from here the tide 
be at the full in a bit an  we can cross the inlet well keep our eyes
peeled for the second mate if so be shes about

   then tonio and ill go to the westard said pepper she may
have passed us in the dark

   captain latimer groaned but did not show his interest in conversation
otherwise

    while theyre gone men lets get some of these casks and things
ashore proposed sessions cheerily addressing the remaining sailors  we
might as well look the matter fairly in the face the first thing is to save
the stuff how to get away from the place will come later

   the men looked at atwell and said nothing he turned on the mate a
face crimsoned by his excessive potations

    whats the matter with you   he demanded in his ugly way  dye
think were aboard ship again  men my mates dont take no orders from
the like of you on shore here  

    sessions temper blazed out at once

     you drunken fool   he exclaimed  cant you see whats best for all
of us  

    if you want to drag them casks ashore you can well live on vege-
tables an fruit and be glad of the chance jessop says theres plenty of such
here  

    and do you expect to stay here forever  demanded the mate


a secret of the south pacific

      till we get ready to leave  

    and how will you get to any inhabited island  

    in the long boat if jessop an another fellow could make the trip to
aukland in the same sort of a craft i reckon we can get to the marquesas
that aint so far

    but this whole party couldnt sail there in the long boat gasped
sessions

    did anybody say they could  demanded atwell with a cruel laugh
 theres room enough for us you fellows can do as you durn please

    you cowardly villain   cried sessions

   he took a step toward the fellow as though intending to strike him  but
at that instant jessop and shields reappeared from the direction of the inlet
and between them they bore a figure the sight of which brought a cry of
amazement from all perhaps sam atwell himself betrayed the most emo-
tion he shrank back with a cry of fear his face pale his jaw hanging
monckton arose slowly to his feet his bloodshot eyes fixed upon the face he
had never expected to see again

   it was thorne his clothing was torn to shreds he was without coat
or hat or shoes his face was like death and he reeled between the two
sailors like a drunken man but the instant he saw monckton he wrenched
himself free and staggered toward him

    you fiend  you devil   he cried the words rasping from his parched
throat  her blood is upon your head   

   he stretched out his hand to seize the terror stricken monckton and fell
senseless at his feet

   its mr thorne   gasped pepper

    what does it mean  where did you find him men   asked sessions
dropping upon his knees beside the senseless man

    he was just crawling out of that tunnel yonder where the sea makes
in replied jessop

    out of the tunnel   replied the mate

   aye aye sir id never thought mortal man would ha got out of it
once the current got a grip on him said the sailor

    but how came he there what does it all mean  

    theres somebody here who knows about it interposed pepper point-
ing to the pallid monckton

    mr monckton   cried the mate  what do you know about it sir  

   monckton wet his parched lips with his tongue and tried to speak but
the words would not come

    come sir commanded sessions looking at him sternly tell us what
you know about this mr thorne intimated that you were connected with
the mystery

   i-i dont know what he means said monckton in a husky voice

    is he dead   asked pepper turning to the mate

    no no  his heart beats but its a case of absolute exhaustion

   atwell exclaimed pepper let me have that flask youre being so
free with
a secret of the south pacific



   the sailor not yet recovered from his terror at the appearance of thorne
did as he was bid the third mate wet the lips of the insensible man with
the stuff and forced a little between his teeth then he coolly placed the
flask in his own pocket

    ill take charge of this he said  youll be a sight better off with-
out it atwell

thorne began to show signs of returning consciousness he stirred and
groaned feebly after a moment his eyes opened and he stared wildly about
 save her-for gods sake save her  never mind me he muttered
captain latimer who had sat silent through it all suddenly pressed
forward

   	 have you seen sydney  do you know anything about her   he
asked thorne gazed at him with dawning intelligence

    speak man   begged the anxious father  what has become of her 

    	 dead  dead    groaned thorne

    dead 

    aye dead   repeatedthorne  and by that villains hand  

   he raised his trembling finger and pointed to the fear stricken monckton
the latter fell back a step pepper thought he was trying to escape and
seized him by the shoulder

   hold on ray hearty   he exclaimed youd better stay and hear
this out

    its a damnable lie   cried monckton finding his voice  the mans
beside himself

    it is gods truth gasped thorne

    how did it happen  demanded sessions

    we were crossing the inlet-

      who were   

    miss latimer and i

      but how came she with you   

    last night-when i wras driven ashore-she saw me and tried to help
me to land the undertow seized us both and carried us into the inlet we
made a landing on the other side

   thorne spoke with difficulty but his words were understood by all

    this morning we started to cross the inlet to join you we were about
half way over when she saw him standing on the shore

   again thorne raised his arm and pointed at monckton

    i looked when she cried out and missed my footing we were both
dragged under by the current i shouted to him to help us and he stood still
on the bank and watched us fighting for our lives   

   thorne was panting for breath his ejes blazed he struggled up upon
his elbow

    as god is my witness ill kill him   he cried shaking his clenched
hand at the cowering man   once i get my strength back this island will
not be large enough to hold both him and me i swear it  

    tell us the rest sir said latimer hoarsely

    theres naught else to tell groaned thorne sinking back upon ses-


a secret of the south pacific

sions arm  the tide sets in toward that tunnel like a millrace he could
have saved us both had he tried he could have saved her any way but
he let us go by him and when he did move it was too late we were swept
into the tunnel i caught at a rock to stay us  but she was snatched away
from me and-thats all

   he suddenly dropped his face upon his arm amid a tempest of hard dry
sobs his emotion shook his whole body the mates turned their heads
away and the sailors were dumb but not so captain latimer

   he rose to his full height his eyes fixed upon monckton his face was
gray and his hands worked convulsively

    you murderer   he hissed  you dont deny this-your guilt is only
too plainly written on your face  

    monckton strove to speak but could not

     thorne has spoken the truth-you have killed her   his voice rose to a
shriek   she was all i had-my daughter   a little fleck of foam appeared
on his lip he stretched out his hands clutching the air convulsively a
fathers curse upon you  he shrieked and plunged forward a step toward
the miserable monckton  pray-pray you craven -for by the living god
im going to kill you  

   monckton was paralyzed-fear stricken he did not move as the crazed
old man reached him those awful tallou-like fingers closed upon his
throat they swayed together an instant and then sharply breaking the
awed hush which had fallen on the group came the crack of a pistol lati-
mer reeled and went down the blood flowing from his breast and monckton
fell across his inert body

chapter xiv-on the edge op eternity

   sessions sprang forward and pulled the almost senseless monckton off
the captains body but pepper drew his revolver and cocked it

    hold there sang out atwell from the other side of the fire ive
got the drop on you pepper

    the treacherous sailors voice was harsh and discordant but there was no
tremble to it now he had recovered his self possession and murder looked
out of his bloodshot eyes

     i had an old score to settle with latimer but i dont care what becomes
of you an the mate just drop your guns-both of you-and get back to
tonio yonder

   there was nothing for the two officers to do but obey it would have
been suicidal to show fight for atwell was backed by all the sailors but
jessop and shields and four of them had pistols they laid down their
weapons and fell back to where the cowering mulatto knelt upon the sand
at atwells command one of the sailors gathered up the pistols even remov-
ing the one strapped about the captains waist

    come along with us mr monckton said atwell well see that
youre not harmed were your friends

    monckton still dazed and silent crossed over to the mutineers
a secret of the south pacific

s

    an where do you go demanded atwell scowling at jessop and his
chum

   the two neutral sailors stepped forward and helped thorne to his feet

    seein as the naidas a wreck an things are generally changed said
jessop slowly  tom and me have signed articles with mr thorne here

   amid the silence of both parties they led him up the beach and were
quickly out of sight

   atwell gave a command in a low voice to his followers they prepared at
once to launch the long boat they took the water cask and provisions out
of the cutter and placed them in their craft then seizing an axe atwell
chopped a great hole in the cutters bottom

   there my hearties he said with an evil smile  i guess youll stay
here for one while well bid you good by-for the present

   he motioned monckton into the long boat which his men had already run
down into the surf and followed himself the next moment they pushed off
and the little party of officers and the cook were deserted on the shore

   sessions made another examination of the wounded captain

   he isnt dead yet he assured his companions the bullet took an
upward course and lies under the skin on top of the shoulder lend me
your knife pepper and ill cut it out

   tonio went for water and sessions probed and cleansed the wound with
his finger

   it hasnt touched the lung he said the old mans hard hit all
round but i reckon hell come out of it

    yes but how will we come out of it  queried pepper gloomily

    we shant starve nor freeze returned the first officer  what we
must do is to join forces with thorne and his party

   but they did nothing toward this that day they found a more sheltered
place among the boulders and removed the captain to it the compass and
instruments which were in the locker of the small boat were also taken to
their new camp pepper and the cook rescued a number of valuable articles
from the wreck including casks of bread and meat and a small chest of car-
penters tools

   they saw jessop and shields occupied in the same work on the other side
of the inlet but atwell and his party had disappeared with their boat
around the western point of the island

   the next morning however tom shields made his appearance at the
officers camp	

   well what is it demanded sessions who hardly knew whether to
look upon the sailor as a friend or an enemy

    mr thorne sends to know ow the capn is sir replied tom with a
pull at his forelock

   hes not badly hurt said sessions  an is doing as well as can be
expected  

    well sir went on the sailor  mr thorne was sayin as ow you was
welcome to bring im up to our place an come yourselves weve found a
nice light dry cave an made it comfortable


a secret of the south pacific

     so mr thorne says that does he  asked sessions curiously  and
what do you and jessop say  

     why sir replied the englishman awkwardly as we looks at hit we
aint bound no longer by our harticles mr thorne es ahired of us both
an wot e says goes

     oh thats it is it  then i reckon well accept the offer eh pepper  
  thats my mind responded the third mate  thornes got as much
 to fear from atwell and his crew as we have wed best join forces say i
 they laid captain eatimer upon a piece of sail cloth that had been in
 the cutter and carried him to the cave where thorne and his two companions
 had established themselves it was right beside the tunnel at the head of the
 inlet and the entrance could be easily guarded

    thorne was yet too stiff andlame to do any work himself  but under his
supervision the two sailors had performed wonders the rope he had used to
lash himself to the raft on the night of the wreck and which he had had the
forethought to bring ashore when he found his valise was rigged across the
treacherous inlet with this life line it was an easy matter to cross

    the two sailors had brought across the inlet a great quantity of the
wreckage thorne had saved the morning before and the cave was partially
filled with bales casks and boxes part of the naidas cargo had been sew-
ing machines and farming tools the first named were of no use to them of
course  but some of the latter had been cast up by the sea and thorne had
carefully saved them casks of meat and bread from the brigs stores were
piled in the cave too  and jessop had found time to gather some cocoanuts
from a grove up the coast and cut off the tops of several cabbage palms
they were well supplied with food

    if we only had arms and ammunition sighed pepper after he and
tonio had brought up the articles they had saved from the wreck if we
only had them wed be in first rate circumstances-for castaways if i had
a good marlin repeater-or a winchester--id agree to settle with atwell
and his whole gang if they attack us

    as it is wre havent a blessed thing to defend ourselves with said
sessions gloomily

     not quite interposed thorne he brought out from the cave his re-
volver newly cleaned and oiled every chamber was loaded ive got a
valise hidden up the coast yonder he added  and among other things in
it are two or three boxes of cartridges ill go after them before long

    but it was several days before he felt well enough to undertake the jaunt
meanwhile an off shore gale had blown almost every vestige of the wreck
away from the island they could rescue no more of the brigs cargo but
they had already got together a great pile of broken spars and plank and
cordage on the shore beside the supplies in the cave

    nothing had been seen or heard of atwell and his friends and they hoped
the long boat had left the island and been blown so far away by the storm
that the mutineers would not land again thorne talked with jessop about
making a journey of exploration around the island and of trying if possible
to scale the cliff
a secret of the south pacific



    it cant be done sir the sailor declared  i tried that when i was
here before a goat couldnt get up them rocks

    but i believe there is something behind the cliffs thorne said  i
dont know whether its a basin of water connected with the ocean by this
inlet or whether its land theres something there and then from the
top of the cliff wed have a better chance of seeing land if theres any near 
or ships if they sailed by  

   however he had to admit that so far as could be seen on this side of the
island there was no possible path to the summit of the cliff

   they had occupied the cave near the inlet a week before thorne felt
strong enough to go for the valise he had hidden where sydney and he had
stayed the night of the wreck he went alone found the bag and carried
it back to the inlet as he started to cross he saw that the tide had just
turned and was now making strongly into the tunnel at low water as now
the entrance to the mysterious passage was high enough for a good sized
boat to get through had the cutter been whole he would have been
tempted to explore the place

   stepping out upon the further bank he noticed for the first time that
the plateau in front of the cave was deserted neither the officers of the
naida the cook nor the two sailors were in sight captain latimer had
not moved from his bed since being brought to it and he was never left
alone but as thorne hastened up the bank of the inlet he heard loud voices
and a sudden fusillade of pistol shots from the direction of the beach
startled by the sounds he sprang upon a boulder and strove to gain a view of
the shore all he could see was a crowd of men struggling nearly a quarter
of a mile away and who were friends and who enemies he could not tell

   look out for yourself thorne he heard pepper shout these
fiends have got the best of us  

   there was a hoarse cry from atwell and thorne saw the mutineer and
several of his gang running up the incline toward him

    look out for the capn   sessions commanded

   thorne fired a shot at the mutineers checking their advance and darted
back to the entrance of the cavern the opening was so narrow that but
one of the attacking party could approach at a time with his revolver he
was practically master of the situation

   as he entered he glanced in the direction of the captains bed it was
empty nor was the wounded man anywhere in the cave  while trying to
understand this strange disappearance he heard a step outside he ran to
the mouth of the cavern atwell was coming stealthily up the path
thorne cocked his revolver instantly but the mutineer saw him

   hold on sir he shouted holding up his hand i aint armed
im here for a talk

    well talk quick

   well sir me an my mates have been livin on tother side of the
island an we didnt have no chance to save any of the brigs stores we
want our share of them stores in the cave and the compass an sextant that
was in the locker of the cutter  
	a secret of the south pacific

   what for

    why were minded to provision our boat well and find our way to
the marquesas im a good navigator

      and leave us to our fate   

     that isnt the way to look at it responded atwell pacifically  the
whole crowd of us jcouldnt go in that long boat and the cutter is too small
even if it wasnt smashed there isnt any use expecting a ship to sail by
this island its too far out o the line of trade but when we get to the
marquesas well send a boat back for you

    do you suppose wed trust to your promise to send us help demanded
thorne

     i dont see but what youll have to replied atwell surlily

    i guess ill keep the instruments and stores said thorne  youll
not leave this island unless we all go  

    you think so do you  cried atwell in anger ive got the rest of
your crowd-all but old latimer-an ill shoot every one of them  

   if you touch one of them youll suffer for it replied thorne i
was counted something of a pistol shot in boston ive got plenty of am-
munition and ill pick you off one by one if you harm those men

    maledictions on you  roared atwell  i ought to have finished you
when i had the chance i thought i did before i left the brig

    thorne started

    so it was you who assaulted me eh  he asked and i have been
laying it to my friend monckton  

   monckton exclaimed atwell in disgust  he hasnt got enough
sand to kill a mosquito dont you forget that i am the chap who tried to do
you and the next time ill be successful-you an the capll both

    now ive heard enough said thorne sharply  you get back out of
range or your gang of cut throats will be without a leader  

   see here-you talk to latimer about it an see what he says said
atwell trying to swallow his chagrin

     i cant

   you cant

   no hes not here

     youre lying i believe   declared atwell

   youre welcome to your belief hes disappeared im here alone
im a desperate man-i dont care much whether i live or die you fellows
wont get in here while i can keep you out now hustle along

   atwell slunk slowly out of sight thorne was tempted to put a bullet
through him as he went he knew that the mutineer would not have hesi-
tated at such an act himself  but thorne was handicapped lay preconceived
ideas of honor that night he lay at the entrance of the cave his weapon
cocked and ready to his hand he was determined that no one should enter
the place excepting over his dead body he dared not sleep-at least not in
the night how long he could hold out against his besiegers he did not
know the condition of his friends in atwells hands worried him too but
most of all he feared for captain latimers safety
a secret of the south pacific



   in the morning he discovered that the mutineers had encamped within
sight of the mouth of the cave but his friends were not with them sur-
prised at this he thoughtlessly stepped outside the better to see the camp
instantly a man appeared on either hand and covered him with a pistol he
fired at one-without effect-and the other sprang forward and knocked his
revolver from his hand his capture was then an easy matter although he
fought with all his strength

    i really thought youd give us more of a tussle said atwell jeeringly
when the struggle was over and the young man lay panting and bound upon
the rocky plateau

   thorne was silent the siege had ended very tamely indeed

    i meant to get you though before long atwell went on  there-
fore i sent your friends to the other side of the island last evening it might
hurt their feelings to view a little incident which i propose shall take place
before we leave this blooming island

   his men rolled out such stores as he directed the long boat was
brought into the inlet and moored near by the instruments captain lati-
mers cash box and the provisions were put aboard thornes pockets were
searched and his purse taken there was not much money in it but in a
belt around his waist was a draft for five thousand dollars

    i believe i can make this useful said the villain and he explained its
value to his companions  but its only payable at aukland he added
 i reckon wed better try for that after we get to the marquesas

   when the boat was made ready for departure the mutineers had an earnest
discussion finally atwell carried his point whatever it was and came over
to thorne

    theres just two things i want to do before bidding good by to this
island he said cutting the prisoners ankle lashings  one is that i want
to see that old buzzard latimer but im afraid ill have to go without that
pleasure still i winged him and he may not get over it the other thing
is to put you up here for a target  the mans eyes blazed wickedly and his
teeth gleamed beneath his heavy beard like a wolfs  sam atwell never
forgets an injury i aint forgot the time you knocked me down back there
in rivermouth all for that girl-blast her eyes  im glad shes gone down
yonder and he pointed to the tunnel below them and im going to send
you after her letting her drown was the only decent thing that white liv-
ered monckton done i aint forgot that blow i say he continued ad-
vancing his wicked face and thrusting it into thornes own  i can feel it
now-an i shall feel it till i wipe it out by wiping you out  

   he said something to his men two of them stepped forward and drag-
ged thorne to his feet he scarcely realized what they were doing he
was led to the edge of the bank turned with his back to the water and a
bandage was tied over his eyes he then heard them move away and the
click of revolvers followed

    if youve got anything to say speak up said atwell harshly

    untie my hands said thorne

    whats that for think you can getaway  well do it for him con


a secret of the south pacific

   thorne felt the yarn which held his wrists part he shook the cords
from him and tore the bandage from his eyes

   he looked on sky and sea-on the gray shingle and the towering bluffs
the tide had just turned and in the inlet behind him the water was rushing
back into the tunnel it would soon sweep his bullet riddled body into the
darkness

   he faced his murderers dully some of the faces revealed hesitation-
some indifference but one there was that showed murder in every line
some bullets might fly wild when the word came to fire but atwell would
reach its mark unerringly

   thorne moistened his lips and spoke  i am ready he said

    but at the very moment his lips formed the words there was the splash of
oars behind him in the inlet-an exclamation in a strange tongue-a hastily
uttered order thorne did not turn he scarcely heard the interruption
he gained his knowledge of it from the sudden change in the faces before
him

      drop those weapons   a voice shouted from the inlet

   then thorne looked around a large boat manned by brawny bare
armed men dressed in white had just come out of the tunnel the men
were brown-the chocolate brown peculiar to the south pacific islander
some of them brandished long oars  but fully half a dozen had rifles

   in the bow stood the owner of the voice that had uttered the order-a
tall commanding man-a white man-with flowing gray hair and beard
and beside him was a woman thorne looked on in the same dazed fashion
as the man and his armed associates leaped ashore

    almost a murder eh said the leader sternly then lie repeated an
order to his men and they disarmed the mutineers

    and who are you sir   he asked approaching thorne

   the woman had disembarked too and was by his side thornes gaze
went beyond his interrogator and rested on her face and it was the face of
sydney latimer

    this is he she said to her companion then she stepped forward and
took thornes hand dont you know me mr thorne-howard she
asked looking up at him with tear blinded eyes  this is your father-
edgar thorne i have told him about you

   the reprieved man reeled and would have fallen had the other not caught
him in his arms

chapter xv-a ceiff encircled paradise

   suddenly thorne awoke and opened his eyes he was lying in a grass
hammock in the shade of a thatched veranda a pleasant undulating
country with smooth green meadows checked off with little garden patches
was stretched out before him in each garden plot was a low hut with a
conical thatched roof he did not know where he was he was in that
blissful state between wtaking and sleeping where a man cares neither where
he is nor what has happened  when wonders cease to amaze and mysteries
to perplex
a secret of the south pacific



    a slight graceful figure in a flowing white garment sat by his side one
pretty hand rested on the hammock and swayed it back and forth  the other
upheld the face which was turned from him it did not seem strange that
sydney latimer should be alive and beside him in the midst of these unfa-
miliar scenes he put out his fingers surprised to find even such a slight
effort wearying and laid them upon the hand on the hammock

    sydney sprang to her feet and bent above him her dark eyes shining like
stars he put his other hand upon her shoulder and slight though his
strength was drew her nearer their lips met then she stood upright
shook the hair back from her face and said 

    do you know me howard 

    that was a ridiculous question for a girl to ask a man just after she had
kissed him  thorne told her so afterward  but then he was content to lie
there and listen to what she had to say

    you dont know where you are do you  she went on you have
been sick a week-out of your senses too you poor boy most of the time
at first you were going over and over in your mind that awful experience we
had together the night of the wreck and our battle with the tide when we
were swept into the tunnel oh you told a lot i had never suspected before  

    she shook her finger at him roguishly

      luckily there was nobody but my father and your father to hear it  

      my father-your father    repeated thorne

     yes  dont talk and i will tell you this is the interior of the island
would you have guessed it  your father says it was an atoll before it was
uplieaved the cliffs surround it on all sides only in here they are only
about fifty feel high and very easily scaled i have been up there and looked
over the whole island this inner basin contains only five or six square
miles but there are nearly a thousand people living here they almost wor-
ship your father

   isnt it wonderful he was wrecked here twenty years ago his
companions died these natives who have nothing to do with any of the
inhabitants of the other pacific islands found him they have been here
for centuries  that is i mean their ancestors were the plain is drained
through the crevasses in the coral cliff and when they have occasion to enter
or leave this plain they go in canoes through the tunnel at low water well
they welcomed your father to their villages and he has been here all the
time excepting the few months he was absent on his trip with jessop to
aukland he returned from that determined never to leave again

     but you--  began thorne

   wait i will tell you i was carried right through the tunnel which
is about fifty yards long and out into the light again on this side there is a
deep cut or gully that has been carved out by the water running down to the
sea level for so many ages under your fathers direction that ravine was
enlarged and the natives have kept their canoes there and the old long boat
of the juan fernandez and a larger boat they have recently built i was
cast ashore and they found me that was the first they had known of the
wreck of the naida


a secret of the south pacific

     well it was a long time before i could tell your father about our mis-
fortune then he was not willing to go outside in broad daylight he did not
want all those sailors in here when we finally discovered how matters
stood and that father was shot mr thorne went out and brought him in
you were all away from the cave at the time i saw the fight between the
mates and atwell from the top of the cliff and saw you driven into the cave
but father told us an armed man could hold the cave a week so mr thorne
did not go back fearing that in the dark you might mistake him for an
enemy i went with him the next morning and we arrived just in time
to save you from atwell

      and what has become tf the scoundrel and his men   

   your father disarmed them and took the long boat away from them
then he carried them to another part of the island-outside of the cliffs of
course-and built them a hut gave them seeds and the gardening tools you
saved from the wreck and a chance to earn their livelihood father and i
have told him all about your coming from america to find him and he has
agreed to go back with us-for a year when he returns he will take steps
to send atwell and the others back to their homes he is getting ready the
new vessel-it is really a nice little schooner-to take us to valparaiso the
mates and jessop and shields will man it

      and-and monckton   

    he is going with us she said gravely  he is repentant having had
a fearful experience with that company of cut throats im sorry to say that
my father is still so bitter against him that he wants him left behind with
atwell  but i begged mr thorne and he will take him to valparaiso you
dont mind do you 

     not now   replied thorne with energy clasping her hand again

	    

    less than a month later at the end of the short rainy season the roomy
schooner built by edgar thorne and his native helpers and rigged by the
mates of the naida and jessop and shields set sail from the island which for
twenty years had been thornes home and it would always be his home
he had little interest beyond the confines of its towering coral cliffs

   i go only to please you my son he said standing by howards side
and gazing regretfully at the lone isle  and to assure undercliff of my for-
giveness my heart is here where the harsh world cannot reach it

    having scarcely experienced a day of unpleasant weather the little vessel
arrived at valparaiso monckton left them sailing at once in a tramp
steamer for san francisco thence to take rail for boston captain latimers
party went home by way of the horn when they reached boston they
found that carter monckton had arrived before them and from something he
told his father the elder monckton had hurriedly sold his interest in the ship-
ping firm and both had left the city there was little doubt even in mr
undercliffs mind as to the manner in which the money for he robbery of
which edgar thorne was unjustly accused had first disappeared from the
companys safe and then reappeared again

    but despite the fact that his name was unstained before all men and that
that may apple



friends welcomed him on every hand edgar thorne was not contented his
heart as he had said was in his little coral kingdom and before a year had
passed lie sailed for valparaiso and two sorrowing young people saw him
off on the steamer

   but then it was only for a little while thorne will take his degree this
j une and in the fall he and sydney will visit his father in the pacific island-
on their wedding journey

the well nigh tragic consequences of a deviation from the direct course home after an attendance
at church-an utterly unwelcome side issue to a love affair and the remarkable
solution to the mystery of a night

 a eew months after i began reading law back in the thirties with old
judge mcdowell in spencer indiana he sent me out one saturday to
collect for a client- uncle billy  criss-the sum of  due on purchase
of a farm from a man named jonas harding who lived about fourteen miles
from the town i got the money gave harding his receipt and the deeds
took dinner with him and started back to spencer on the way i thought
it would be a good idea to make a detour of three or four miles and call upon
a family named north-or to be more exact upon one member of that family
miss mary it was early in the afternoon lovely spring weather and my
opportunities for seeing mary were none too frequent so the idea was not one
admitting of debate

   the norths gave me a hearty welcome and declared i must remain with
them until monday of course i affected to demur for appearances sake
but that was just what i wanted and there was no reason why i should not
consent except perhaps that i ought to turn the  over to judge mc-
dowell at the earliest practicable moment i spoke of that having already
made the collection my excuse for calling but had to admit that monday
morning would be as soon as any use could be made of the money so i
decided to remain

   supper was followed by an hour or two of hickory nuts cider and general
talk then the family gradually dropped off to bed one by one until mary
and i were left together before the kitchen fire although it was early june
the nights were chilly enough to make a fire agreeable besides a log fire
on a great wide hearth imparts a cheery home-like feeling and renders other
illumination unnecessary so long as you are not reading of all great aids
to human happiness in the courting line an old fashioned fire in the month
of june when it doesnt need to be kept up bright is in my estimation one
of the most potent

   mary and i sat up a good while and i found courage to tell her all about
my prospects and hopes and how inextricably she was mixed up with both
and-wrell the long and short of it is that when i kissed her good night she


that may apple

was engaged to be my wife as soon as i had been admitted to t he bar and won
my first case in court

   sunday morning mary and i went to church together most of the con-
gregation came on horseback some from seven or eight miles away and after
church when we mounted mary proposed that we should visit her uncle
john arney dine there and ride home in the cool of the evening i had no
objections to offer of course i understood that i was to be offered for
family inspection but the ordeal was one every young man intending to
marry had to face

   marys cousins hattie and deborah arney overtook and joined us on
the road-jine large healthy girls with frank honest eyes and clear com-
plexions outspoken in speech and hearty in laughter more like my mary
than any other girls i ever saw the old folks proved to be splendid time
mellowed models of the girls mr arney especially pleased me he was such
a big lion headed specimen of the strong brave straightforw ard self reliant
pioneer

   shortly before we sat down to dinner a young man came in and was
introduced to me as jacob arney the son i did not like his looks he
seemed to have a surly manner and a lowering suspicious countenance
when we were introduced he simply nodded without a word and turned
away for which i mentally set him down as a sulky brute but i was unjust
as i soon learned for the poor fellow was deaf and dumb despite my feel-
ing that his affliction entitled him to pitying sympathy i could not banish a
sense of repulsion that he awakened in me and felt that he returned my
instinctive aversion all through dinner if i glanced in his direction i
found his eyes fixed loweringly upon me or upon mary as if he resented her
having brought me there

   while we were at table a violent storm burst forth the roars of thunder
were almost continuous and the fierce glare of the lightning showed masses
of water rather than rain drops driven almost horizontally by the furious gale
that tore up forest trees and threatened to unroof the house and barn that
elemental riot lasted two hours until night had fallen a night dark as a crow

   you cant get back to the north place tonight mr arney told us
 it would be madness to attempt fording the creek and the road crosses it
twice where it wouldnt have reached your horses knees this morning it
is now a raging torrent ten feet deep so youve got to stay here-whether
you like it or not he added speaking directly at me with a mischievous
little smile he guessed rightly that i had expected to sit up with mary
that night but we had to resign ourselves to the inevitable

   all the evening jacob sat watching mary and me particularly me until
you have been steadily eyed for two hours by a silent motionless man whose
antagonism shines in his eyes and who as you know is in a world of silence
where nothing distracts his attention from watching you where he cannot
be influenced by anything you say and is pretty certain to put the wrong
construction upon whatever you do-not until then will you know how con-
foundedly uncomfortable and nervous such a thing can make you

   bedtime came and jacob was detailed to show me to the guest chamber
that may apple



on the ground floor back of the sitting room there he placed on the
bureau the candle he carried and turning tome with his eyes fairly blazing
tapped sharply with the forefinger of his right hand on my breast i dont
know why i should have thought that he meant to ask if i carried there the
considerable sum of money in my possession for i dont know that he was
even aware of my having it but that was my understanding of his panto-
mime and i nodded affirmatively before i considered what i was doing he
had guessed the right place for every tap he gave there was squarely upon
the sheepskin wallet in which i had carefully stowed uncle billys  he
scrutinized my countenance keenly a few seconds then nodded turned upon
his heel and left me alone

   i do not think it at all strange that his queer conduct made me uneasy
his good guess at the hiding place of my treasure seemed to have an uglj-
significance  i didnt like his looks any way  and for the first time in my
life i believe the possibility of being robbed occurred to me i said to my-
self that such a thing in that house would be impossible but something
whispered to me that jacob meant no good when he so audaciously tapped
my wallet

   locks on inferior doors in farm houses were hardly ever seen then in
that part of the country and in fact were generally lacking from outside doors
we were yet so uncivilized that thieves were scarce among us my room
door had only a simple thumb latch to hold it and i could fasten it in no other
way than by jamming a splinter from a wall log into the little cast iron guard
over the latch of course that did not secure it but might prevent it being
forced without such noise as would awaken me the lower sash of the
window was held down by a big nail loosely thrust into a gimlet hole in the
casing and seemed secure enough

   my bed had two mattresses an upper one of thin corn shucks and a
lower of straw-with a big slit on top near the upper end for convenience
in changing the straw when it was mashed down before undressing i lifted
the end of the upper one opened the loose ticking of the lower and poked
my wallet in among the straw then i got into bed but lay awake a long
time i had a great big scare upon me about that money utterly without
reasonable foundation but none the weaker therefor if id had a pipe i
would have dressed and sat up by the window all night smoking and think-
ing about mary with the wallet in my pocket but i had no pipe at
length sleep insensibly stole upon me and when i opened my eyes again the
sun was shining into my window

   i sprang quickly out of bed washed and had nearly completed dressing
before once thinking of the wallet so completely had my fright of the night
before passed a way and when it did recur to my remembrance i smiled at
my foolish fears nevertheless i went at once to get it that it might not
be forgotten in the straw

   to my unspeakable horror and consternation it was gone  and in its
stead i found-a big ripe may apple 

   the loss overwhelmed me small as the sum seems nowadays it was
large then and i knew i could not make it good judge mcdowell would

      e
o

certainly hold me to a rigid accountability as uncle billy criss would hold
him and i wasnt very sure at that point in my legal studies whether i was
more likely to go to prison for embezzlement or breach of trust

   hardly knowing what i did i went on dressing and soon made another
discovery my watch and chain my most cherished possessions at that time
had also disappeared i began looking about sharply for clues to the thief
with a strong presentiment of where they would lead to if i found any
jacob arney was in my minds eye from the moment i found the may apple
instead of the wallet 

   it was easy to see how the robber had got in the big nail displaced
from the sash lay upon the floor and i noted that it could easily have been
drawn from its place by the blade of a table knife slipped up on the outside
between the two sashes i raised the lower one and looked out deep grass
grew right up to the wall so steps out there would be inaudible and would
leave  tracks but that some one had been there the night before was
proved by the broken branch of a rose bush close by the window the door
had not been tampered with

    i had no appetite for breakfast and looked so ill that mrs arney-a good
motherly old lady-wanted to give me a big dose of quinine at once what
to do i could not determine if i proclaimed my loss and declared my sus-
picions there would no doubt be a stormy scene and i could not know how
mary might take my suspecting her cousin of a robbery sooner than break
off our engagement i would have submitted quietly to the loss of all i pos-
sessed then and a great deal of what i hoped to have if i had seen jacob

i think i would have tackled him and at least tried to make him understand
he must give back my money and watch but i was told he had  gone to the
mill   and that in the humor i was in seemed a suspicious circumstance

   i was a dull companion for mary on our ride to her home that morning
though i did my best to rally from my depression more than once when
she joked me about my low spirits i was tempted to tell her everything but
restrained myself

	    

   how i was to meet judge mcdowell was the immediate trouble that occu-
pied my mind when i bade farewell to mary he would have to know of my
misfortune and the sooner he could be informed the better but the nearer i
got to town the more anxious i became in contemplation of the possible con-
sequences if he with his characteristic energy insisted upon pushing matters
for restitution of the money and possibly punishment of the thief it would

i felt put an impassable gulf between mary and me forever if he sent her
cousin to prison

   in those days when the struggle for existence in this western country
was ruder and fiercer if not sharper than it now is people stood by each
other family ties were stronger and personal friendships more sacred than
they have since become lifes lesson to men then was  stand together
which to my thinking has been badly replaced by the modern one each
for himself and the fittest only survives better a savage clan than a horde
of ishmaelites
that may apple

i

    i decided that i would lie to the judge  that i would simply tell him i
had lost the money without knowing where and would get my father to
make it good for me but i never could lie well easy as the accomplishment
seems to many who are not even attorneys the judge was in court-for
the defense in a murder trial-and i got no chance to speak with him until
after a late adjournment in the evening then i told him the story i had
planned that the wallet must have worked out of my pistol pocket while i
was in the saddle and dropped on the road he heard me through without
interruption and then said blandly  now bob tell me the truth about it
well that  broke me all up as the boys say now i realized that like
george washington i couldnt tell a lie even though i wanted to and for
the first time it flashed upon me that he might think i had appropriated the
money for my own benefit so i told him the whole story just as it was
about mary and everything he thought it all over for several minutes and
then said with unusual deliberation of speech 

      i am averse to a positive finding upon merely circumstantial evidence 
but so far as i can at present see the only person to whom suspicion points is
jacob arney mind  i do not say that i think he stole the money but
simply that the circumstantial evidence is unfavorable to him but-why the
mischief should he have put a may apple in place of the wallet   

    it hadnt struck me very forcibly before but really it was an extraordinary
thing that he should have done so possibly he fancied there was something
humorous in the substitution  but he did not look like a fellow addicted to
humor finally the judge said

    luckily the term ended today and i have a little leisure so ill ride
over there with you tomorrow and see if we cannot straighten this out
but judge i said feeling anxious again about mary even if we
find he is guilty i must beg of you not to prosecute him it will be enough
if we get the money back in fact i would rather call upon my father to
make it good for me than send to jail a poor fellow so deeply afflicted as jacob
is and whose mind for aught i know to the contrary may be no better than
his ears or his tongue

    and who is marys cousin added the shrewd old judge with a grin
well i will not prosecute him my boy i have no such intention-pro-
vided we obtain the money

   the next forenoon we rode out to arneys i felt that i could get
along better in the disagreeable business before us now that mary would
not be present and congratulated myself upon having the judge along to
do most of the talking but fancy my feelings if you can when upon turn-
ing from the highway into arneys lane i recognized marys brown mare
hitched at the gate and knew the girl would be inside the house she had
ridden over from home that morning on some womans business between her
and her cousin hattie and when i looked up from the mare to the house
there she stood on the porch with both the arney girls

   i introduced judge mcdowell who greeted the ladies with the graceful
old time courtliness that became him so well then mr arney and jacob
came together from the barn and with them too i made him acquainted


that may apple

   a sort of awkward pause ensued then the judge stepped into the breach
 mr griscom and myself he said  are out this morning on a rather
unpleasant errand we are trying to look up some money he collected 
saturday but did not succeed in carrying to spencer

    oh robert   exclaimed mary with impulsive sympathy  did you
lose all that mopey   

   i said simply yes and she turned to the arney girls with oh
isnt that awful  

   you knew then about his having it the jndge asked her very
suavely but from force of habit fixing her with his cross examination eye

   oh yes she replied innocently  i was talking with hattie about
what a lot of money it was to be carrying around

   ah then miss hattie also knew cf it remarked the judge very
sweetly with a deferential little bow toward that young lady

    why we all talked about it responded hattie  and it was all we
could do to prevent debby demanding a sight of it because she never saw so
much at once and wanted to

    well so i did  and so i do yet declared the younger sister at which
there was a general laugh	

    mr griscom demanded the judge turning to me  could you have
gratified the young ladys wish for a sight of that money when you came
here on sunday afternoon   

     yes sir i replied

     could you have done so on monday morning  

      no sir  i could not  

   a sudden stillness as of death fell upon the group for a moment all
stood as if paralyzed then mr arney involuntarily taking a step forward
inquired in a grave and anxious tone 

    what does this mean do you think you have lost anything in my

house  

    much as it grieves me to say it mr arney i do i replied

   he staggered backward as if i had dealt him a stunning blow his face
purpled and he clutched at his throat as if choking jacob seeing his fathers
great agitation and being utterly unable to comprehend anything of what was
going on pushed himself forward making frantic pantomimic gestures of
appealing question and those horrible inarticulate sounds that burst from
dumb lips in moments of intense excitement evidently he was asking in a
way his family understood what was the trouble but neither of those who
could have satisfied his curiosity had any time to do so just then  and his father
gripping his shoulder with an unconscious exercise of strength that made the
poor fellow wince literally flung him back out of the way

    this things got to be looked into cried the old mad hoarsely  if
theres a thief in my house i want to know it

   mr griscom-and the judge again addressed me-will you be so

   so directed amid a silence as deep as if animation had suddenly been sus-
pended in those about me i told all the facts i have already related care-
fully avoiding however any mention of my suspicions as to the thief

    my god  exclaimed mr arney some burglar must have clomb
into the window in the night   

   for a moment no one spoke then the judge treating me as a witness
on the stand resumed his examination asking when you went to your
room that night who accompanied you   

    jacob arney

    tell me what he did when he and you were alone together in that
room   

   he placed himself before me and fixing his eyes upon mine tapped
several times with his right forefinger on the wallet which was in the left
inside pocket of my vest  

    tapped on the vest on the outside over the wtallet you mean do you
not  persisted the judge

   i knew his cunning way of compelling attention to a salient point by that
sort of pretended anxiety for extreme precision of statement and saw in mr
arneys face that it had not failed of effect but he had not driven it in far
enough to suit him even yet

     as if to assure himself that it was there   he went on

    i will not go so far as to say that was his object i simply state the
fact

    then he was the last person so far as you are aware who could have
been cognizant of the money being in your possession   

   yes sir

    how long was it after he left the room that you placed the wallet in
the under mattress before going to bed   

    i do not know exactly probably seven or eight minutes

    long enough for a person to have left your room gone out of the front
door and passed around the house to where a view of your movements
through the window could be obtained 

    amply

    did you put the wallet in the middle of the mattress or near the upper
end 

    the latter

     where it could have been reached by a hand cautiously slipped between
the mattresses without waking you 

    so it seems

     you are sure about the nail being in the window casing when you went
to bed and on the floor when you got up  also about the freshly broken
branch of the rose bush 

   yes sir

   with calm politeness judge mcdowell turned to mr arney and asked

  what do you deduce sir from the facts presented   

    my god judge answered the father in a voice like a sob it all
seems to point to my boy jake but id answer with my life for him hes

mightily afflicted but an honester truer hearted boy dont live on this earth
than jack why hed wrong nobody

   as he spoke he looked with anguish and affection upon his unhappy son
and the eyes of every one present followed the direction of his impassioned
gaze the young man seemed almost maddened by this concentration of
attention upon him the reason for which he could not divine and springing
forward with his countenance distorted by emotion he seized the lapels of his
fathers coat and shook him as if he would force an explanation even by
violence then hattie came down from the porch and told him the move-
ments of her fingers hands and arms and her changes of facial expression
were rapid as lightning and executed with a vehemence that was startling i
cannot describe the strange horribly  creepy  feeling it gave me to see
her perfectly silent herself and in dead silence all about abandoning herself
to that tornado of passionate pantomime and to behold how in swift response
intense amazement flashed and then hot indignation blazed in his set white
face

   when she stopped he emitted one of his blood curdling beast-like
smothered howls and at one bound placed himself before me his glaring eyes
not a foot from mine his hands tremulously beating his breast and the in-
articulate sounds from his lips making my heart ache with pity for the
agonized efforts of his frenzied will to control his useless organs of speech
the poor fellow acted as if crazy and i believe very nearly was so but i under-
stood him he was demanding if i suspected him of having stolen the money
it was too solemn a moment for anything but the simplest truth whatever its
consequences i nodded affirmatively

   mechanically he moved backward a pace or two and stood motionless as
a statue his face dead white like that of a corpse i comprehended the agony
of that dumb soul and in the same instant an intuitive sense of his abso-
lute innocence flashed upon me as far beyond argument or doubt as if it had
been a revelation direct from heaven it seemed to me as if i would gladly
have given years of my life if i had not nodded  and as if not all the money
in the world was worth the infliction of such agony upon a human soul
but the mischief was done i could only await the consequences hoping
that when he became more calm i might make some atonement suddenly
he wheeled and darted into the house

   i glanced up at mary her face was a reflex of jacobs white and
agonized  and the same expression was in the countenances of his father
and sisters his mother thank god was not present only the judge
looked quite calm and unconcerned either he had so often seen mens
hearts in their faces that he had grown hardened to the pain of others or
experience had taught him that faces and even souls as well as lips can
lie and so had made him cynical i caught a sparkle of triumph in his
eyes when jacob ran into the house just a flash and no more but suffi-
cient to show he supposed the young man had gone to get the wallet and
give it up

   when jacob came out again which was very quickly he carried in his
hands two rifles he put the weapons in his fathers hands pantomimed
that may apple



with great vehemence for a minute or two and then went away to the end of
the porch where he stood still with his arms folded and his back toward us
looking over the meadow

   mr arney turned to me and said   my boy says he knows nothing of
your wallet did not even know you had one  that you entirely misunder-
stood his meaning when he touched your breast that the world isnt big
enough for him and the man who calls him a thief  and that you will have
to shoot it out with him and i reckon hes right

    with that as calmly as he ever did anything in his life he made a sign
or two to his daughter debby on the porch without hesitation she brought
out to him and placed in his hands silently a powder flask bullet pouch and
cap box then she and her sister returned to the porch where they stood a
little way from mary

    the rifles were muzzle loaders as all our guns were in those days and the
old fellow after snapping a cap on each to be sure it was empty took a
couple of greased muslin patches from the patch box in the stock of one and
proceeded to load bothwith the greatest possible care and evenness of prepara-
tion

   judge mcdowell looked perplexed and troubled he drew me aside and
whispered  i fear we have made a terrible mistake involving very serious
consequences but there is nothing to do now but go ahead on the chivalric
line he has elected it is rather old fashioned now however i dont sup-
pose he knows or cares that it ceased to be legal as long ago as  but
its simple has respectable precedents and perhaps does substantial justice as
often as any court fire first if you can but be sure of your aim that chap
has a killing eye  

   pretty comfort that  i knew the judge was only talking because he was
too nervous to keep quiet should i shoot first and try to be sure of my
aim  i would just as soon he shot me as that i shot him for mary would
be no more lost to me in one case than in the other and firmly believing
him innocent as i now did i had no moral right to kill him merely to save
my own life i resolved that i would not attempt to do so yet i could not
refuse to face him if i did i would be thought a coward and mary just as
much lost to me as if i were dead or had killed him in that communty a
sheep thief was more re pected than a coward so the situation held nothing
else for me logically than that i should stand up and be shot and i made
up my mind to meet my inevitable fate like a man

   i looked around for mary with a half formed idea of saying good by to
her but she had gone away to the farther end of the porch where she stood
alone her face turned from us and her arms wound around one of the pillars
to keep herself up that she was either weeping or praying or perhaps both
i did not doubt and hesitated about approaching her

   mr arney at this juncture came to me with the two rifles lying to-
 gether on his left arm and said

    ive loaded them even fair and square ones as good as the other
take your choice   mechanically i took the one nearest me and he went on 
 youre a stranger on our ground and maybe jake may have some advan-


that may apple

tage of you in practice  so to sort of even things up ill let you name your
distance and put your back to the sun  

     i would prefer to leave all the details to you mr arney i replied

     very well well make it fifteen paces can you wheel and fire 

    i said i could but it was only true in the same degree that any man who
is not paralyzed can turn himself around and shoot off a gun as for the
lightning-like half revolution sudden statuesque rigidity and instantaneous
accuracy of aim contemplated in the code phrase wheel and fire i had
never tried it then and have since convinced mself that i could not firing
in that fashion hit a large barn at ten paces distance except perhaps by
accident

     ill give the word the old man continued  so as you can hear it and
swing my arm with each count so that the glint of the motion will catch his
eye he cant hear you know when i raise my hat on  fire   the
shadow will fall before him so he will know its time to wheel does that all
seem fair and square to you sir 

     i said it did

    talk about your  roman fathers  i make bold to affirm there never
was one of them a grander sight for gods and men than that noble old fellow
who so calmly and justly with such considerate courtesy of honesty went
steadily ahead arranging the details to stake the life of his only son as he
deemed honor demanded while his heart was breaking and i was to shoot
first and make sure of my aim  not if i knew myself

    we went around to the back of the house and over a little way to a new
clearing just we four men as we started i heard on the porch a sort of
rustling and a soft thump that made me look around quickly mary was no
longer standing by the pillar but at its foot was a confused heap of girl and
garments on the floor and the sisters were running to my poor sweethearts
aid i had to go on to be killed

   mr arney when we reached the ground he chose plsced his son and
gave him his rifle then he stepped off the fifteen paces toward the sun for
my position-and i may remark that the distance suddenly seemed very
short-and placed me

    just as he was about leaving me to take his post midway between us and
to one side i glanced down at the ground to see that my footing was clear
for i intended wheeling to look my death in the face in that instant my
glance was arrested by the great wilted leaves of a large may apple 
 mandrake  plant protruding in a reversed position from a hole near the
ground in a low rotten stump close beside which i had been stationed
without thinking why but obeying an involuntary impulse i exclaimed
 hold on   and mr arney came back to my side

   i have never been able to explain it to my own satisfaction but am
willing to take my oath to it that all the while we were going through that
painful scene before the porch the scent of may apples was strong in my
nostrils running through every other impression on my senses as music is
distinctly heard through speech i could not have been mistaken in it for
the peculiar sharp perfume is very familiar and pleasing to me and the
contentment



odor had floated around me all the way as if some power sought to force
my dull memory to recognition of the real clue to the mystery yet there
was no may apple any way near enough for its scent to have reached me and i
did not wear the coat in which i had carried the one i found in the mattress

   when mr arney returned to me i gave him the rifle which he took-
mechanically and stood watching me in evident surprise as i stooped down
and drew the wilted leaves and limp stalk of the plant out of the stump
something clung to its root and was drawn out with it-the chain attached
to my watch with a cry of exultation i could not repress i thrust my hand
deep in the cavity and brought out the lost wallet 

   i was the only one who had any idea of how it got there of course i
could not know positively but i believe that i myself had hidden it in that
place when a bo i had been a somnambulist but the doctors told my
mother i would outgrow the habit and i supposed i had done so but my
nervous excitement that sunday evening doubtless provoked a return of it

i had climbed out of the window found a hiding place for my valuables
and gone to bed again all in a dream of which i had no remembrance upon
awaking the saving of the may apple was probably the product of a
lingering impression of fondness in waking consciousness for that wild fruit

   jacob and the judge seeing my excited action joined us just as i drew
out the wallet the young man refused to take the shot at me which i
offered to stand to give him satisfaction for the wrong i had done him and
we have been warm friends ever since

   not until long after mary and i were married did he tell me why he
tapped my breast that night he had been in love with her all his life but
his affliction prevented his thinking of making her his wife tortured as he
was by jealous pain at seeing me her accepted lover his deepest concern was
for her and he meant to ask me seriously man to man if in my heart i loved
her truly accustomed as he was to the quick understanding of his panto-
mime by all his family it did not occur to him that i could not catch his
meaning so when i nodded he went his way resignedly

the gold deluge

astounding consequences arising from the discovery of a chemist-terror of the governments
to whom unlimited gold meant destruction-the extraordinary lengths
to which erik poulsen was driven to maintain
his independence

chapter i-near the goal

n a warm still august night erik poulsen sat in his laboratory bent

over a glass receptacle containing a milky mixture in which the positive
and negative wires leading from a galvanic battery were immersed the
window was open now and then a miller flew into the room butted against
the chimney of the petroleum lamp and finally fell into the flame outside
an owl screeched now and then in the old lime tree and a mouse squeaked be-
hind the worm eaten wall of the room

   erik was oblivious of all that passed around him and was not aware that
it was past two oclock  nor did he care with a frowning countenance and
deeply wrinkled eyebrows he stared in nervous impatience at the glass re-
ceptacle before him finally he reached over and drew the one pole wire
from the mixture a small plate of platinum apparently covered with a thin
sheet of wax was attached thereto this covering erik examined critically
scratched it slightly with his finger nail and then held the plate over an
alcohol flame after having poured a few drops of a fluid over it but when
the entire surface became covered with small air bubbles he became angry and
threw the thing aside then filtered the milky concoction and began to evapo-
rate the substance thus obtained

   in the stove on the other side of the room he had a bright fire burning
over which several crucibles were suspended he examined their contents
anxiously added a little brown powder to one of them thereby causing a
white steamy vapor to arise then reexamined the solution and shook his
head he now fastened a small delicate graphite crucible inside of a ring of
platinum filled half of it with pieces of a light yellow metal imbedded in
which were a number of pale red crystals he then hung this over the fire
he seized the bellows handle and vigorously fanned the flames until they
crackled loudly

   a fierce white heat surrounded the crucible so that the platina ring itself
turned red the metal in the crucible melted and lay a shining glistening
surface in the fire he now introduced the two pole wires into the crucible
most carefully taking the greatest care that he did hot touch bottom one
quarter of an hour he stood so  the metal rods became hotter and hotter and
finally he could hold them no longer even with the wooden hardies then
he withdrew the wires and lifted the crucible from the fire
the gold deluge



    he did not wait until the wires had cooled but immediately placed one of
them under a powerful microscope and examined the surface minutely he
could discover no trace of any foreign substance thereon and laying it aside
busied himself with the contents of the crucible which had in the mean time
cooled off somewhat very carefully he poured out all its contents placed it
in an alembic rilled with water in which the crystals which had been imbedded
in the yellow metal and now had turned into a glass-like substance quickly
dissolved he refiltered the entire matter and again evaporated it until he
had the pure metal before him

    he now stepped to the delicate analytical scale laid the metal on it and
weighed it

    again five milligrams short he muttered and placed his hand to his
brow then that was not an accident but why i cannot compre-
hend it

   mentally absorbed he approached the window dropped into a chair and
stared at the night shrouded sky

    and yet it means something he mumbled to himself  it is a cer-
tain indication because if the gold were not destroyed in some manner or
other by the process it would be entirely inexplicable there are five milli-
grams less each time and if thereby amorphous gold is created it cannot be
demonstrated-at least with the instruments at my command could i only
work with larger quantities  i have only a small amount-fifty grains-but
it shall succeed-must succeed even if i exhaust my brain entirely  no one
ever before came as near a solution of the question as i did-that i feel cer-
tain of oh it is bewildering excruciating to see all those sparks flimmer and
not be able to unite them into an entirety and thus solve the matter that
there is a solution there is no doubt the forms are absorbed and dissolve and
amalgamate in one another but-how  what law governs it  oh could i
discover that  if only the morrow brought success  small wonder that a
mans brain turns at the thought such a discovery  i know of no other
which would compare with it blast the gold  this is first and last only
a question of che corelativeness between power strength and original matter
whereby the visible so called basic element is produced which again is sub-
divided into hundreds of other forms according to-yes according to-what 
theres the mystery  i must procure a spectroscope but where am i to get
the three hundred kronen  i must follow the matter as far as it goes and
having found the means for everything thus far i surely will make this also
possible  

   his soliloquy ended he again busied himself with his apparatus threw
a shovel of ccal into the fire and with the bellows produced a bright flame

    i want to see any way whether it is not possible to catch a trace of
amorphous gold with a platinous sponge  i feel convinced it is present only
a trial will tell  

   he recommenced his experiments while the day dawned and all the noise
that the cocks around the factory could possibly make a-crowing resounded
in his ears with a din the lamplight expired without his noticing it as
daylight was now sufficient for his work undaunted lie worked away with


the gold deluge

the materials which obstinately retained their secrets and only now and then
as though to annoy him showed him a slight a very slight trace of what he
was looking for only to let him grope around again in the dark like a blind
man he became excited grasped at this and that in the hope that accident
might be his ally and show him the right road but no  only the same well
known phenomena well known elements the formula of which he could rattle
off at his fingers ends

    not a sign not a trace of those five milligrams of gold which disappeared
so mysteriously where had they vanished to  that was the momentous
question

chapter ii-at last

   again the summers end drew near the autumn storms came and soon all
the beautiful tints of the trees gave way to a bleak gray of the naked limbs
the nights lengthened and were cold and the first snow of the new season had
begun to fall in november eriks wife sat at the window sewing  without
the weather was dreary and uncomfortable the sooty factory smoke covered
everything in view the roads were a mass of soft mire and the blue sky had
been hidden some time how long was this to last with erik she asked her-
self  things could not go on much longer as they had erik had hardly
slept during the last two nights in the morning his wife laid her hand on
his forehead and found it hot and clammy she tried with all a womans
diplomacy to prevail upon him to change his course but in vain matters had
gone too far she grieved severely over the thought that she herself had
perhaps been partly the cause of his becoming imbued with the one idea by
telling him one day that the passing laborers believed he was making gold
they were right after all

    her anger against him had vanished and she felt that his strange behavior
was not the result of any intention on his part to neglect her  worriment and
sorrow alone prevailed and caused her the deepest grief  she had seen that
for matters to continue as they were then could end but in ruin

    her attention was arrested by the approaching steps of some one running
she raised her eyes and grew pale with fright her husband was hurrying
toward her he wore no hat and his hair was flying in the wind like a
flash of lightning it came over her that he had lost his reason  she rose but
was rooted to the spot-she stood as though transfixed her husband rushed
through the door wildly with his face glowing like fire from an all consuming
fever while the veins on his forehead stood out swollen to the thickness of
whipcords

    there   with this one word he threw a small package wrapped in
paper on her sewing table the heavy concussion caused it to open and a
fine brown powder was scattered all over the top of the table while erik
grasped his wife in his arms and pressed her to him so tightly that she nearly
lost her breath he let her go then sank down before her on his knees
buried his face in the folds of her dress and hysterically sobbed forth the one
word    gold   
the gold deluge



   with a great effort she preserved her outward calm demeanor and leading
him to a sofa prevailed upon him to lie down she had mastered her first
fright and now attributed his condition to a feverish attack brought on by
the mental strain in connection with his excitable temperament she knew
that the first requirement was rest and quiet

   she placed a chair near where her husband lay and sat down beside him
his pulse throbbed feverishly his cheeks burned with the internal fire and
he was very restless did he really believe that he had made the almost
impossible discovery  it certainly was impossible notwithstanding what he
had said it could not be and he had not been the first who had suffered by
bitter experience how often had the alchemists of old imagined that they
had discovered the true solution  i fonly erik had profited by their experi-
ence before it was too late  how hopeless it was to pursue the unattainable 
she resolved to show him nothing but loving kindness and to give him her
most devoted care thus endeavoring to soften the bitterness of disappoint-
ment by all the means in her power when he again became conscious and
realized what had happened

   eriks eyes were closed and his lips unconsciously muttered over the great
discovery that gave his brain no rest to quiet him she apparently entered
upon all that he said very readily and gently smoothed his burning forehead

   oh that i was so fortunate as to be the one  he whispered and
taking her hand continued i cannot comprehend it all children in
schools over the entire world will learn my name-the name of the
danish chemist who made the wonderful discovery in many countries
they will find it difficult to pronounce-but no matter-they will know
who it was darling we will begin our travels at once-we both longed so
to see the world but with it all we have been so happy in our small rooms
with their low ceilings and narrow limits and we will often wander back here
in thought and to the woods and the moor and beautiful summer evenings
when we were on the heights and watched the glorious sunsets  and to the
laboratory in which i made the great discovery perhaps we will return to
this place again to see it once more then you will witness the director
receiving us with a floor sweeping bow and the workmen will surround us to
stare is not that grand   

   yes dear husband she answered softly but you are so fatigued
you must rest please try to sleep  it will do you so much good

   yes i will try but it is so hard to sleep when the thoughts surge
wildly through my brain-all chemists of the middle ages tried to reach this
goal but they were on the wrong path  it could never have been done as
they tried to do it the discoveries and researches of many centuries must
of necessity precede the discovery a pillow  thanks it does me good to
rest my head-so-oh to think that i was the fortunate discoverer  i can-
not forget it-i -i -my darling wife  

   thus he lay and spoke for a long time but gradually came the reaction
after the intense mental strain his voice grew weaker his respiration slower
and more regular and at last he sank into a deep heavy slumber not disturbed
by the slightest movement


the gold deluge

   evening came the young wife lit the lamp and resumed her needle-
work dead silence reigned in the room and while her thoughts were busy
with other matters she attempted to work it was impossible  her fingers
were uncertain and she rested quietly staring fixedly before her

   her husbands mental condition was not quite comprehensible and the
most disagreeable impressions haunted her how would he awaken 
stronger and fully restored or-the thought made her shudder what
would happen when he discovered his error when he realized it had all been
a nightmare-a chimera  but how was it possible at all he had made such
a mistake could it be possible that he the thoroughly competent chemist
had been so led by his imagination 

   suddenly the thought of the powder he had thrown on the sewing table
recurred to her she rose and crept on tiptoe to the table

   how very heavy that small quantity of powder was  brown-all brown
gold it could not be it was very soft when passed through the fingers and
clung to them like dust then she remembered erik telling her that gold
in a reduced state-so called amorphous gold-was brown and could be tested
with boiling nitric acid if this did not affect it then it was the precious
metal she had not been married to a chemist without learning a few things
from him during the hour of instruction he formerly devoted to her in his
laboratory

   quickly she procured a test tube and a small quantity of nitric acid
added a little of the powder to it and held it over the lamp very soon the
acid began to boil violently and when she withdrew the tube from the flame
the bubbles vanished and there appeared no reddish brown evaporation of the
nitric acid  the brown powder remained at the bottom of the glass tube
entirely unchanged or affected in any way

   for a moment she reeled at the thought that seized her brain but she
steeled herself against it she could not rely upon her faulty cest coal for
instance would not be affected by nitric acid either but yet-if it should be
true any way 

    well well just see my little wife making an analysis   a voice said
behind her

   she turned around with a frightened countenance-there stood her hus-
band a smile on his lips eying her with proud intelligent glances every
trace of weariness had been removed by the restful sleep he had enjoyed and
he was as healthy and strong as ever

    oh erik exclaimed his wife deeply moved and throwing herself im-
petuously in his arms is it really true 

    did you not believe what i told you  yes my love it is all true

   she laid her head on his breast with a half suppressed cry and gave way
to a violent fit of weeping-a real good cry that was as the dew falling upon
the budding blossoms on a beautiful night in springtime

    yes dear wife he repeated taking her by the hand and leading her to
the sofa  it is true you examined the powder yourself and tested it with
the nitric acid besides that i applied all possible tests and employed every
reagent known and also converted it into gold salts determined the specific
the gold deluge



gravity as well as the atomic weight no dearest love i am as clear headed
as ever i was  i know you thought i was ill and spoke irrationally it is a
fact that everything turned round me when i realized that my experiments
were ended and positively knew that everything was as i had surmised and
wished i have made the greatest discovery of the century and all my
dreams of fortune have been transmuted into fact  

   then it is really true  eriks wife took a long breath  you cannot
imagine how apprehensive of evil results i was  how could i believe such
a thing to be possible  it was too overwhelming but now i am happy and
contented i have you again erik and all the dark shadows have vanished
i will no longer have to go walking over the mountains alone to watch the
sunset dear husband you said we were to travel  yes let us do so-i will
follow you wherever you go although i would be just as happy to remain
here-here where we were so very happy but that would be unreasonable
-i will be proud and glad that i have such a celebrated man for my hus-
band and we shall always be happy shall we not  

chapter iii-the discovery announced

   early in december erik and his wife reached the city of copenhagen
after he had resigned his position as chemist at the factory in roenninghof
they had agreed to impart no information of the great discovery to any
members of the family or their friends but to make the facts public suddenly
and surprise all alike

   their common sense told them that first of all they must derive some
practical benefit themselves from the discovery they could not deny that
when the facts were made public gold would lose its value as a means of pay-
ment and that the discoverer as well as every one else would be the loser
thereby

   his gold was accepted and paper given to him in exchange at the
banks and for this erik purchased real estate  that at least was something
which was not artificial and which in spite of any financial revolution would
within certain limits retain its value the earth meant bread and bread
meant life

   the chemist erik poulsen consequently became a landed proprietor in
euenen owner of houses in copenhagen and of property in foreign countries
he appointed a manager to look after all this as well as the factory in roen-
ninghof which he upon a sudden impulse had purchased by securing all the
shares the manager was instructed not to mention the name of the owner
at least for the present when erik had thus made certain that he would not
as he expressed it get into trouble on account of a little chloride of platinum
he considered that the time for making public announcement of his discovery
had come

   one day he sauntered down to his old professors residence-director
dickmann of the polytechnicum and editor of the danish chemical times
that was the man he wanted  he had a reputation in scientific circles he
had one grave fault however-a predilection for clubs and a good glass of


the gold deluge

beer in answer to his knock an irritated voice at last called out   come in  
professor dickmann reclined on a lounge puffing at a cigar the daily paper
lay on the table and next to that was a half empty bottle of beer below
the lounge could be seen another  battery  of about ten full bottles of the
same beverage when the professor heard footsteps he simply turned his
head

     oh its you poulsen  be so good as to take a chair he said

    professor began erik without any further circumlocution but with
the respectful tone of old times although he knew it would be only a question
of saying one word to attain the popularity of ten such professors  i have
made a great discovery

   the answer erik had hoped for came not  the professor simply grunted
quietly and paid not the slightest attention to his visitors words

     i have discovered howto convert base metals into gold erik continued
laying stress on each word

   a second grunt but now sounding rather contemptuous came from the
professor who grasped his beer glass and emptied it he replaced the glass
slowly on the table wiped his mouth with the back of his hand murmured
 you dont say so took up his daily paper and began to read

      professor it is neither a joke nor an absurdity i have really made that
discovery exclaimed erik becoming excited

   oh by the way poulsen replied the professor without glancing at
erik  would not a glass of soda do you good  there is some in the corner
there  help yourself

    erik pretended not to have heard he drew a small phial from his pocket
and noisily placed it on the table before the professor  do you see that 
he asked

    the professor quietly took the bottle examined it and shook its contents

 hm yes he remarked carelessly  i see very well that it is amorphous
gold  but you do not mean to tell me that you shook that out of an old
apron  

     no but from nitrate of bismuth

   nothing else listen poulsen i want to tell you something you
may be a very bright fellow but if you are under the impression that i have
taken any more than is good for me this morning then you are decidedly
barking up the wrong tree go and see my colleague rasmussen  hell
swallow the tale whole

    the professor having thus plainly indicated his utter unbelief in his callers
statement lazily turned his back eriks face flushed  he was nonplussed
and discomfited for a moment and finally decided that it was superfluous to
venture any additional information  adieu professor he said smiling
to himself now   we will perhaps speak of the matter some other time  then
perhaps you will be less incredulous

    the devil  answered the professor  we want optical and palpable
evidence in such matters  

    when erik reached the street he was irresolute as to his next step his
first thought was to call on professor rasmussen but would it be to any pur-
the gold deluge



pose  he had been angry at professor dickmann for a few moments but he
soon forgot the unpleasantness all the world knew what he was prominent
though he had once been among scientists no to waste a thought on that
matter was ridiculous erik determined to visit the dania bank then to de-
scribe his discovery in a pamphlet publish it and mail copies to every scientific
society in the world  that was the proper course-the only sensible one

   with energetic steps and erect bearing erik proceeded on his walk the
street was bathed in clear beautiful sunlight he felt exalted-felt himself
on a higher plane than his surroundings and his spirit of pride once thor-
oughly aroused he walked so briskly that he soon found difficulty in breath-
ing he felt that he was in the foremost rank among the leading men of the
world

   accidentally his glances were arrested by a hebrew strutting along clad in
an extremely rich fur coat and this hebrew eyed erik with an aggravatingly
superior mien could that individul only realize who the man was whom he
passed so contemptuously  erik smiled to himself when he thought of the
panic he had it in his power to create on the stock exchange did he desire it
-why it would be like striking between an army of ants with a stick-they
would be scattered like chaff

   he arrived at the bank presented his card and requested to see the privy
councilor espensen after a moments delay erik was in his presence
he was a small pedantic gentleman with a well kept gray goatee and wear-
ing a stiff high old fashioned white collar and stock he greeted erik
politely and desired to know his wishes

   certain rumors regarding erik had become current in financial circles
the public wished to ascertain from what source his wealth had come but
the surmises somehow would not agree some said that he had won large
sums in the foreign lotteries others claimed that he had inherited money from
an uncle who had died in south america a millionaire but others again
asserted that erik had been gold hunting in california and experienced won-
derful luck how else could he have obtained the massive gold bars which
he supplied to the banks 

   on the other hand it was a positive fact that he had been chemist at a
factory in roeuningshof  had he assumed this position only to discover for
himself how the business paid before purchasing the companys stock  in
spite of all the secrecy maintained the fact that erik owned the factory had
leaked out these things would not harmonize when put together and peo-
ple knew not what to think undoubtedly however he was a very wealthy
man to whom the greatest attention was due no matter whence his wealth
came

   for this reason privy councilor espensen was the perfection of politeness

    i have delivered erik began large quantities of gold bullion to the
bank in bars-

    yes yes very true the privy councilor replied

      i made this gold myself  

    made it   gasped the privy councilor  do you mean to say that the
gold you sold us was spurious he fairly screamed

      f


the gold deluge

     not at all erik replied calmly   the gold is genuine

   the privy councilors countenance assumed its benign expression again
certainly you will pardon my misunderstanding you even though for
a second the gold is critically tested before being accepted by the bank
and your gold was particularly fine

   yes it was simply chemically pure for the reason that i made it by a
chemical process

    oh now i comprehend the councilor rejoined you mean to say that
you obtained it from a kind of gold ore or gold salts-as i believe it is called
in chemistry and you found this salt in the earth as only a chemist can 
this is very interesting may i ask whether this was in california  

    pardon me councilor you misunderstand me entirely i am not a gold
digger but a chemist only and the gold i delivered to you is made from
nitrate of bismuth by a rather simple process in other words i have dis-
covered a means of converting a base substance into pure gold  

    the privy councilor raised his eyebrows in astonishment and stared fixedly
at erik but as the latter remained perfectly calm and did not move a muscle
the councilors eyes wandered away irresolution as to what to say pic-
tured itself in his looks and an extremely painful pause ensued  my dear
sir the councilor went on at length attempting to assume a very severe
look  are you serious  positively serious   

   yes erik answered i am and i will offer to give you the evidence
if you wish it lock me in the laboratory or any other place and provided i
have the necessary apparatus at my disposal i will convert as much bismuth as
you wish into gold

    hm mumbled the councilor  is it agreeable for you to proceed with
me to engelsteds laboratory immediately good

   while they proceeded to the place designated erik attempted to open a
conversation but was unsuccessful the councilor replied politely but
evasively and reservedly while he at times surveyed erik sharply with side-
long glances arrived at the laboratory erik was conducted to a small
room and upon his request the privy councilor and the chief chemist engel-
sted searched him to assure themselves that he had no other gold in his
possession except the small phial mentioned watchers were posted at the
doors and windows the privy councilor was in a quandary as to what to
think and engelsted laughed softly to himself tapping his head with his index
finger in a suggestive manner

   the necessary instruments and chemicals among them a large glass jar
containing chemically pure nitrate of bismuth a small glass containing cobalt
carbonate together with other substances and instruments were placed in the
room  also the positive and negative wires from a galvanic battery of twenty
elements were conducted into the room the door was locked and the gold
maker left to himself

    late in the afternoon eriks work was completed and he called the others
the privy councilor who had meantime taken a walk into town was some-
what feverish and excited and the head of the laboratory appeared to be
supercilious and sarcastic
the gold deluge



   erik pointed to a large glass bowl the bottom of which contained a brown
powder several inches high out of which here and there a few shiny grains
glimmered all of it was covered by a fluid clear as water erik was busying
himself removing this fluid with a dipper

   engelsted was surprised for a moment and compelled to admit that some-
thing strange had occurred and still dubious said that he wished to convince
himself as to what kind of stuff it really was for this purpose he
placed a small quantity of the powder on a glass plate with a spatula and
then left the room the privy councilor carefully dusted off a chair with
his handkerchief examined it carefully and seated himself while erik gradu-
ally evaporated the powder

   after fifteen minutes the chief chemist returned his face a fiery red
color and threw the glass plate he still held in his hand on the table with such
violence that it shivered into many pieces he first stared at erik and then
at the privy councilor who attempted to look bored

    it is true  the chemist finally ejaculated the words were forced out
unwillingly  true  but how can it be so he turned to erik and with
violent emotions playing on his countenance he asked  atomic vibration 
is it not so  

   yes erik replied and both scientists exchanged glances of profound
understanding

   i congratulate you mr poulsen  exclaimed the chemist at last and
grasped erik by the hand

    my god  gasped the councilor  then it is really true  mr engel-
sted do you assure me on your solemn word of honor that all this is fact 
what a terrible misfortune 

   both the scientists glanced at him in surprise as he continued in feverish
excitement not one word to any living soul do you hear you must
swear it to me gentlemen positively swear it-at least until i consult with
higher authorities it is necessary-absolutely so i depend upon you mr
poulsen you will hear from me before the day is over

   unutterably confused he grasped his hat and suddenly disappeared but
immediately thereafter poked his head into the door  do you understand  
he repeated  silence is absolutely-positively-peremptorily required 

   and he vanished without waiting for an answer

chapter iv-the government alarmed

   after erik had left the laboratory he half regretted his haste in so sur-
prising the people at the bank what good would it do him  he had fol-
lowed only the impulse of the moment and soon the rumor would be current
all over town without finding any believers what did the councilor mean
by his strict injunctions  was erik not to speak of his discovery so as not
to stampede the stock exchange  that he surely could not as a scientist
take into consideration the exchange was as much a matter of indifference
to him as the world at large no he decided that he had dallied long enough 
he would now begin to work earnestly
	the gold deluge

   that same evening by the continuous use of the dictionary and grammar
he managed to write a short description of his discovery in french beginning
with the first tests next morning he received an order to appear that fore-
noon at the office of the minister of the interior-hjelm-asborg-hjelmstjerne
the letter was penned by the hand of the minister himself and was couched
in the most polite terms it stated that for good and sufficient reasons-con-
fidential of course-there was a desire on the part of persons in higher
authority to see mr poulsen

    erik could find no reason for declining the desired conference  in fact he
felt flattered that any attention at all was paid to him on his way he
handed his manuscript to a printer and ordered the pamphlet to be ready by
the following day

   his excellency a fine looking well built man about fifty years of age
arose and met erik when he entered the office the minister had a face
showing a strong character and his eyes a piercing penetrating look

    good day mr poulsen he began in a friendly tone and offered erik
his hand in a hearty shake   i am pleased to have the opportunity to speak
to you as certainly it cannot be denied that you have made a most wonderful
and startling discovery-important to the highest degree at first i was in-
credulous but after a test at the university laboratory of your gold of course
in strict privacy i must believe that it is a fact please be seated and let
us chat over the matter have a cigar    his excellency was a man of
the world

   they began a conversation about chemistry in general and all that should
be done for this important science and finally his excellency expressed his
great pride that it was a dane who had made this greatest discovery of many
ages but he would take the liberty to ask mr poulsen whether he had
carefully planned how he was to make the matter public and what results
such publicity would have 

    erik replied that he had simply given a written description of his discovery
to the printer and expected to send copies the next day to various scientific
societies every chemist by following the directions could then make his
own experiments and convince himself that it is the easiest thing in the world
to change gold into silver platinum or vice versa above all the old theory
of basic elements had been utterly destroyed

     but my dear sir  exclaimed his excellency quickly do you not see the
tendency of all this  i can easily understand that for a scientist like you
the greatest value is the scientific one alone but you surely must agree with
me that the matter is of immense practical importance i hesitate not in say-
ing that no other discovery ever made will have such a gigantic influence
upon existing conditions over the entire world and therefore the announce-
ment must not be made until the world has been prepared for it and that
very gradually mr poulsen we must positively come to some sort of
understanding suppose you went to the market place and there publicly
announced your discovery at first you would be disbelieved  people
would say you were insane now let us assume that you would throw
the gold among the masses to convince them what would happen
the gold deluge



every one would pounce upon the precious metal-people would tear each
other to pieces in their attempts to fill their pockets the lucky ones
would get away with as much as they possibly could carry but when the
individual came to consider the value of what he had he would find
that it had  more value than if he had burdened himself with so much
copper and-the same experience would come to every one else gold and
in fact all precious metals-you said it would be an easy matter to make silver
or platinum-would lose their values the moment your discovery is made
known in a few hours the telegraph would carry the news all over the
world  all stock exchanges all banks yes and all stores and business estab-
lishments must be closed while commerce would cease entirely people
working for salaries would no longer receive any  the richest people in the
world except those holding large tracts of real estate which would also lose
most of its value will become poor and worst of all a famine will break out
the baker can sell nothing and no one has money to pay him  the few
holders of food supplies will corner theni and then-what  it can safely be
stated the entire world will be compelled to return to the primitive system of
barter  there is no other alternative and before this could again be done do
you know what will happen  the masses will rise in a gigantic revolution 
the goldsmiths and bankers will storm the bakeries  the people in towns
and cities spread over every part of the open country to plunder the farms
and satisfy their hunger everything representing order government society
and family life would be destroyed and the few only of the criminal classes
would remain waging war upon each other do you understand now mr
poulsen the dire misfortune you can bring upon the world the axis upon
which the world revolves is of gold  take it away and the entire globe
will collapse i can well imagine that you never looked at the matter in this
light

   his excellency mopped his brow and erik much embarrassed nervously
twirled his cigar between his fingers and placed his hand to his head yes
it was all true but he could not think clearly just then-some sort of memory
of a miserable solution of chloride of platinum which he had made in the
factory went through his mind again how far into the past that was  he
felt a kind of indignation at the gold which had humiliated him so and
which he had finally mastered what if he should carry out his intentions
in spite of all the minister said 

   he must have expressed some such sentiment audibly because the voice
of the minister fell harshly on his ear are you bereft of your senses
man  if you attempt to proceed in this manner the government must take
its measures for protection against you there can be no question of permit-
ting you to give the secret of your discovery to the world at large and a
threat lay concealed in the words

   erik rose he felt that he was the superior holding mighty power in
his hand it is a question whether science can take such things as you
claim into consideration he replied

    science be hanged  how can you speak now of science  his excel-
lency began to grow violent your discovery would bring misfortune to
	the gold deluge

                                                                                                

science also tell me what benefit there would be to science if you suddenly
told all you know  there would no longer be any universities nor learned
men  nothing but uncouth vicious masses fighting spilling blood and sacri-
ficing human life for the very necessities of existence

    then you would have me keep my discovery secret until my lifes
end  

   well yes if you have it so  what would you gain by hasty action  hon-
ors say you  there would be neither honors nor celebrity if civilization were
destroyed you would become a pauper yourself if you were to announce
your discovery from the house tops while now you may have all that your
heart may wish for and apart from this i can give you my word govern-
ments will not permit you to set the world afire and cause a general revolu-
tion it is silly to speak of freedom and popular rights dire need will
overthrow all laws and-the welfare of the people comes before everything
else  let us understand each other his excellency continued as erik still
remained silent  the governments will not deny your worth but on the con-
trary will reward you most liberally a man like you will make many more
great discoveries a decoration at the present moment would cause a sensa-
tion but in a year so you have means enough to do something which would
justify the bestowing of an order now we are agreed  his excellency
offered his hand give me your solemn promise years many years in
fact must pass before the world will be prepared for your discovery the
various governments can only gradually prepare for some other substitute for
gold many notes must be exchanged between the government representa-
tives and countless conferences held between the states of course most
secretly the matter cannot must not be made public before the end of at
least fifty years until then you promise-swear secrecy again his hand
was outstretched but erik did not take it

      i cannot bind myself   he said rather shortly  what you ask is to me
life  and i must in any case request time to consider matters my discovery
is my property alone and i can do therewith as i please

    his excellency rose to his full height

   you are mistaken mr poulsen he said coldly you cannot do
therewith as you please if you will not submit in a friendly manner
then-that is your affair  his excellency coldly bowed erik out of the
room

chapter v-police interference and escape

   arrived at home erik told his wife all that had happened when she
heard what the minister had foretold of the consequences ensuing upon a
public announcement of the discovery she became thoughtful  do you
not think that he has exaggerated matters very much    she asked is it
possible that the governments can coin no more money in future havent
we copper money at present   

    yes as subsidiary coin which is changed to gold by the national banks
upon demand-nothing more the foundation of the currency of any country
the gold deluge



and of finance in general is either gold or silver copper and paper money
are intended principally for internal commerce and can only be issued in
proportion to the amount of precious metal stored in the bank and treasury
vaults otherwise the different countries could mint such money in unlim-
ited quantities and then in a short time it would have no more value than
so many pebbles no i fear there is a great deal of truth in what the min-
ister says  

    then the governments must find some other alternative and there must
be one it certainly cannot be demanded that you shall forever keep silent
in regard to your grand discovery the majority of people in this world are
poor-they would certainly not become much unhappier if there were no more
money in circulation it is a different matter with the wealthy and refined
classes but have they ever shown any regard for the weaker and more
unfortunate ones  do you believe it would be harmful to the world if there
were no more aristocratic indolent idlers  when i think how often in our
own home during my childhood means of subsistence were almost unknown
how often my father cursed money and the great merchants who crushed the
smaller ones und er their heels simply because they themselves had the money
to sink into their enterprises then i surely cannot believe that you would do
any wrong by making known your discovery and if it were tomorrow if
it were once done then people would become accustomed thereto do you not
think so  

   erik sat silently thinking his head resting on his hands

    i do not know he answered  i do not know what to think i can-
not think clearly however be the consequences what they may i cannot
keep silent-not all my lifetime what care i for their orders and decora-
tions  they mean only this-bribery ihave a good claim to a name
among the leading men of the world such a discovery is made but once in
a lifetime

   a knock on the door interrupted their conversation the servant brought
a packet containing eriks manuscript in the accompanying letter the
printer expressed his regret that on account of unforeseen circumstances he
was not in a position to take charge of the printing as requested erik and
his wife knew well what these  circumstances  were and they were not
surprised when -ialf an hour later there was another knock on the door
and a police officer requested erik to present himself that same day at police
headquarters

   silently they ate their dinner  a depressing unpleasant weight seemed to
bear both down immediately after dinner erik threw on his overcoat and
proceeded to police headquarters he wanted to get the matter over at once
meantime his wife went to her parents in munstergasse where her husband
was to call for her

   the chief of police went right to the heart of the matter he explained
that he had received most positive orders from the minister he desired to
act as leniently as possible towards mr poulsen and not to hinder him in
the freedom of his movements as long as he did not exceed the limits pre-
scribed but-and he could not lay stress enough on the word-at the
 

the gold deluge

slightest attempt in any direction which might lead to serious results for the
government no hesitation would be felt in adopting the most severe measures
and he-the chief of police-could therefore only advise mr poulsen to be
careful it would be painful for the officers in power to be compelled to
adopt such severe measures but they must have regard for the well being of
the state that was all that the chief of police had to say to mr poulsen for
the present

    erik rose

    i cannot understand what measures you have in mind he said  so
long as i commit no infraction of the law  

      on this point i do not wish to speak further   replied the chief politefy
but firmly  i can only assure you that the means adopted will surely attain
the end i bid you good afternoon

   eriks wife at once divined what it was the chief of police had requested
    well my dear husband   she inquired as she greeted him

    tomorrow we leave for foreign parts

   she nodded approval and pressed the hand she held

    but good heavens mrs eindberg interjected  what do you propose
to do my children  you come suddenly to the city after giving up your
good position down there and refuse all explanation you have the means
to live in the best hotel and now you are going traveling the gossips say
that you have bought the naesby estate and three houses in amalia street
but that cannot be so  how did you get all the money   

     my dear people erik replied  all this is in connection with certain
things which for the present must remain a mystery i can only say to you
that by a great scientific discovery i have become wealthy yes very wealthy
that must suffice for now we will leave here to remain away for an in-
definite time  years may pass before we return but meantime you shall want
for nothing i give you now a packet in which you will find papers valued

at over a million kronen-

    good heavens -a million- mrs eindberg interrupted and sank on

a chair while eindberg senior the little hard working merchant who always
had trouble in meeting his quarterly rent bill trembled all over and rose his
teeth chattering

     is it true   he whispered hoarsely

   convince yourself erik answered  but listen to what isay you
must not deposit the money in a bank and draw interest but invest it in good
real estate and that in some distant place the property of the stejrbyliolm
family on the island sejr can be purchased for a few hundred thousand kronen
-it is of course on a somewhat secluded island but that matters not buy
this estate and live there summer will soon be here and you will not regret
it i will confide something to you  do you remember the financial panio
during the time of frederick vi when the value of paper money sank down
to zero  a similar crisis will recur in one of the next few years but of much
larger magnitude in fact it will affect the entire world and gold coin itself
will sink to almost nothing i entrust this to you as a secret-do you under-
stand  therefore my counsel is  buy real estate  
the gold deluge



   lindberg listened with bowed head as though his life depended on his
impressing each word on his mind he asked no other questions but was as
though petrified mrs lindberg was the first to recover

    real estate owners we are to be then   she joyfully exclaimed as she
stepped up to erik and laid both her hands on his head kissing him  you
are a good man and i always said so and to herself she added quietly  a
million  no  i cannot believe it  he has certainly discovered a new steam
engine one running without coal a sort of perpetual motion machine-the
kind my blessed father thought so much over and now he will go to the
united states to take out a patent on it

	     

   when the young couple were alone that evening erik grasped his wifes
hand

    my darling he said we may now be obliged to face stormy times
who knows what our fate will be in foreign lands we must be prepared
for everything please do not be angry dear one if i give you the choice
between accompanying me and remaining with jtour parents which might
perhaps be safest while i travel with my discovery to an uncertain fate alone 
 where you go there i go she replied clasping her arms around his
neck  do you believe that i could part from you  positively not now
we shared happy days and we will share the unhappy  my place is by my
husbands side



   on the morning early they boarded the express train for berlin while
seated in the coupd waiting for the train to leave erik had the unpleasant
sensation of being closely watched it appeared to him as though a pair of
eyes were constantly upon him but when he peered out into the mass of
people crowding the station platform he could discover nothing

   at the last moment a german commercial traveler with his sample case
entered the coupe they were in and seated himself in a corner where he
began reading a book which he produced from his pocket it struck erik
as strange that such a traveler could sport the means for first class accom-
modation at last the train moved at the stations the telegraph instru-
ments ticked loudly and busily and the telegraph poles appeared rapidly to
shcot by the travelers-faster and faster up in the air curled around the
glass caps the dozens of wires were stretched all leading out into that world
the head of which like the gigantic idol in the dream of the king of babylon
was of solid gold

   these wires were carrying a secret message to the governments of all
nations there goes the man-the man who is determined to combat the mightiest
potentate in the world

chapter vi-a crown refused

   the poulsens wished to remain in berlin for a few days but ther were
almost certain from the very moment they arrived that they were under
close surveillance not one moment did they feel themselves alone


the gold deluge

whether it was really so is open to question but it seemed to them as
though the very servants in the hotel measured them with suspecting glances
perhaps they also knew of the presence of the police as they were polite
though reserved and when brik had placed his signature upon the hotel
register the proprietor closely scanned the same apparently doubting its
genuineness

   the next day he appeared at the door of eriks room knocked and
with a deep bow announced that a servant of the imperial chancellor had
arrived with a letter awaiting a reply

    erik hastily perused the lines 

    i beg you for an interview today at  pm

    erik wrote 

     i shall be there at the appointed time

erik poulsen

    the imperial chancellor received erik in his private cabinet

   good morning mr poulsen i am exceedingly glad to become ac-
quainted with you be seated and let us immediately proceed to business

i wish to speak of your brilliant discovery there can of course be no
thought of making the matter public the danish government acted rather
childishly in the affair but so much the better that gives me the oppor-
tunity to make you an offer in the name of the german nation  sell us your
discovery  

    erik looked startled

     naturally i do not think of offering you money-say for instance five
hundred millions  but what do you think of the title of privy councilor and
the highest prussian order

    erik shrugged his shoulders privy councilor 

   or count anything went on the chancellor drumming impatiently
with his fingers on the table

   erik felt his pride asserting itself within him he knew now what his
value and importance was what mattered that it was the powerful empires
chancellor with whom he spoke was he not his equal in power

    these were the thoughts in his mind as he replied  i do not sell myself
for a miserable title or for an equally miserable cross

    great heavens  exclaimed the minister angrily and he hammered on
the table with his fist  you are very presumptuous  notwithstanding the
discovery must be ours germany will make you the governing potentate
over bulgaria

    erik started violently

     or king 

    eriks eyes seemed suddenly to lose sight everything around him turned
black king  a rain of fiery sparks seemed to fly by his dazzled eyes and
the blood sang in his ears king  and his wife  queen  he felt as
though he must hold fast to something the room whirled around him  it
seemed to have turned bottom upwards  the ceiling seemed to be the floor
the floor the ceiling  and yet  was his discovery worth no more than a king-
dom  would he not contaminate himself if he entered into such a bargain
the gold deluge



   a chair noisily shoved recalled him to his surroundings and he saw that
the chancellor had arisen

    no you must not answer now-tomorrow or the day after when you
wish go home now speak to your wife  we will meet again

   so saying the chancellor bowed and left the room

   erik went his way in a complete daze he the son of a mechanic had had
a crown offered to him  it was not a dream  he was actually walking the
streets of berlin and had just left one of the great men of europe who had
shaken hands with him in the friendliest manner and offered him a throne

   if he stretched out his hand to take the scepter however it meant eternal
silence in regard to his discovery which would become the property of an-
other germany would buy cannon therewith and conquer the whole world
and when the whole world was made tributary to germany how could in-
significant bulgaria continue to exist  what was to prevent germany from
taking back what it had just presented to him 

   erik roused himself and straightened up he looked about him and saw
the multitudes in carriages on horseback and foot streaming past him ah
now he saw it all clearly these masses would gape at him open mouthed if
he the citizen were to be placed on a throne such a thing had occurred
before but how quickly would it all be forgotten when the citizen was
back in their ranks again  who would know of him a hundred years hence 
a few historians might perhaps tell the story on account of its peculiarity-
how a german statesman for a whim made a low class citizen a king over an
unimportant strip of land and later when the joke had gone far enough
struck the crown from his head  that would be all

   it took but little foresight to see to whom the arrangement would be most
advantageous but the chancellor was not to triumph if history was to
contain his-erik poulsens-name after a thousand years he preferred to
be chronicled as the man who had despised the offer of a crown

   suddenly erik felt some one tugging at his arm his wife had started to
meet him being too nervous to wait for his return she saw at once that
something extraordinary had occurred

    what did the chancellor wish   she asked falling into step with him

   erik tried hard to appear calm and collected

    he offered the throne of bulgaria to me for my discovery he replied
with an assumed indifference his wife gave one spasmodic tug at his arm
and stood still as though transfixed she looked at him steadily

    and what did you say  she asked breathlessly

    nothing as yet i wished to consider matters and talk them over with
you perhaps he calculates that you as a woman will be vain enough to
induce me to give an affirmative reply  but dont you think there is only one
answer to make  

   you mean-no  

     certainly 

   she looked straight before her preoccupied while he explained his reasons
for declining the offer to refuse a crown was equal to taking one and the
kingdom of bulgaria would certainly be a short lived joy that could not


the gold deluge

compare with the name and fame the future had in store for him because
whether he would or not-could he keep silent forever  whatever offer the
future might bring he would have only one answer there was a ring in his
words which also enthused his wife and caused her to look up to him admir-
ingly a new overwhelming feeling of the responsibilities and the duties
incumbent upon the wife of a great man awakened within her

   the one whom she had chosen as master of her heart had been selected
by fate for something still higher  to be the most powerful man in the world
because it had made him the master of the greatest power governing the
world-gold an emperors crown was made of simple gold on the day
when he had penetrated the secret of that substance he himself became king
and now her heart bowed before him and she paid homage to him-her king

    erik read her thoughts in her eyes and on reaching the hotel sat down at
the writing table to reply to the chancellor he made no attempt at stating
any reason for his negative answer and his letter contained nothing else than
a plain short  no

   that same evening erik and his wife prepared to leave the city their
destination was an uncertainty to themselves as yet there certainly was no
good reason for staying one moment longer in berlin where every step they
made was watched

   they had no cause to regret their prompt decision  they had hardly
arisen the following morning when a police officer in high standing apparently
knocked at their door and notified them that their presence in the city had
been found objectionable and that they had been expelled from prussia 
they were told to leave berlin within twelve hours

     berlin has also become very objectionable to me   replied erik bowing
stiffly to the officer and straightway departed for paris

   he now regretted that he had not at once proceeded there if he had a
fair chance anywhere to publicly announce his discovery it would be in a free
republic

   he and his wife were much pleased with the gay city the peculiarly
exhilarating air and the artistic traits of the populace noticeable every-
where even in the smallest details-all this captured him completely

    his intention was to visit ducis the renowned chemist and editor of the
journal chimiqtie to explain his discovery to him and to beg him to publish
the facts in his journal ducis was an apostle of science to the very finger tips
and if the world were to collapse over his head he would be true to his voca-
tion if the news were once safe within the columns of that journal which
reached chemists the world over then the gentlemen of the several euro-
pean governments would nilly willy have to make the best of the dilemma

   erik no longer felt himself to be under surveillance and the next day
after his arrival he was on his way to find ducis he expected to be re-
ceived with open arms and have all done that human power conld do to re-
move the silly impediments placed in his way by others

   here was the place  here resided the renowned man to whom erik had
looked up for so many years now he was to meet his equal 

   he reached for the bell when he was interrupted by a gentleman with
he who laughed last



bared head who stepped up to him and said  pardon me sir  do you wish
to see professor ducis  

     yes erik replied in astonishment

    and is your name poulsen 

    erik answered affirmative again

     then i am obliged to ask you to follow me to the chief of police

he who laughed last

a diamond cut diamond affair growing out of a meeting at grizzly bear inn-an instance
of many hands in the same game and the complications that are the issue thereof

a cold drizzling rain was falling when we four matt dodd ford oak-
-lman walter olcott and myself drew rein in front of the grizzly
bear inn the only lodging place at blue canyon in western montana we
were all civil engineers in the employ of the p o  q railway which was
making vigorous efforts to establish connections with the northern pacific
before the snow should fly oakman had been with the company from the
begintiing and the necessity arising for more help he was good enough to re-
member his old classmates when my two companions and myself left the
train at rawlins bluff oakman was waiting there with four led horses and
we made the fifteen mile ride to blue canyon together

   guests were not numerous at the grizzly bear  there was only one be-
sides ourselves he was felix tucker a young fellow prospecting through
that region with an ultimate purpose known only to himself it took but
little time however to discover that tucker was a braggart of the first
water the yarns he told that evening around the roaring wood fire were
marvels of invention

   he was in the middle of one of these recitals when the door opened to
admit a veritable hayseed he was a man in middle life with a smooth
ruddy face sandy hair coarse clothing and his trousers tucked in the tops
of his cowhide boots his face wore an expression of most verdant inno-
cence and he looked at us in a timid way finally fixing his eyes on mr
cuttle he asked

     be you the landlord  

     i am sir  what can i do for you  

      kin you put me up for the night   

     i reckon  wheres your horse  

    haint got none hoofed it all the way from rattlesnake gorge

    phew  thats a good twenty miles  important business 

     well sorter  ive come down to find out about the new railroad

    youve come to the right spot these four gentlemen-indicating us-
 are all connected with the road

   the newcomer glanced at each of us in turn then doffing his hat made


he who laughed last

an awkward bow he sat down on the edge of the nearest chair as if afraid
he was taking too much liberty a few minutes sufficed to put him at his
ease however when he explained his business

     you see i heard tell he began  that the new road is going to cut
purty close to rattlesnake gorge where i own a piece of land do you
reckon it  make it worth more than it is now   

   oakman assured him it undoubtedly would the delight of mr perkins
at hearing this was childish in its exuberance

   felix tucker was irrepressible the opportunity to make an impression
could not be missed

     yes he said as-if resuming an interrupted yarn  it was last summer
as i was riding through wolf gulch looking for a place to put up for the
night that cinch wadders and one of his gang leaped out from behind a
rock shouting  hands up   they had the drop on me and i lost no time
reaching for the stars but all the same i taught em a trick like a flash i
snatched my revolver from my belt and let fly with two chambers i think
cinch jumped three feet in the air while his companion with a howl of pain

made off at headlong speed with cinch at his heels-

    did you kill em both gasped the amazed mr perkins with open
mouth and protruding eyes

    im afraid i didnt cause ive heard that cinch and his gang are still
in these parts

   mr perkins sighed  what a pity  

   the conversation continued until a late hour then we four sought our
beds and dreamed of cinch wadders and his gang

   at the end of the week felix tucker had become such a bore that we
decided to teach him a lesson one morning i overheard him tell mr cut-
tle that he was going back that day into the mountains or a prospecting
tour and did not expect to return until late at night he intended to go
on foot because a great part of the way was too rough for a horse to travel

i proposed to my friends that we should hold him up and put him in such a
ridiculous plight that he would be glad to cease his intolerable bragging
my suggestion was eagerly accepted and the simple plan of procedure ar-
ranged

   several times during the day oakman complained of an attack of rheu-
matism and towards evening he seemed so much worse that we advised him
not to go with us oakman showed keen disappointment but reluctantly
consented to stay behind

    as we three were about to start olcott said in an undertone

     poor ford looks so bad i believe ill keep him company

    do so i replied  matt and i can manage tucker

   not quite an hour later felix tucker was striding along the old black-
foot trail on his return to the grizzly bear

    hands up   suddenly sounded from the depths of the woods on his
right he stopped instantly and his hands were promptly elevated

     gentlemen he said in a faltering voice as he saw two dim figures ap-
proaching  take all i have but please dont kill me  
he who laughed last



    go through him bill while i keep him covered commanded matt in
a disguised voice

    all right cinch i replied

   tucker shuddered and nearly dropped when he heard the name of the
terrible desperado i did not have to tell him twice after appropriating a fat
wallet and his watch to make himself scarce he dashed off on a dead run
straight for the grizzly bear

   we could scarcely wait until he was beyond hearing before we burst out
laughing

     did you ever see anything like it  i asked when i could control my
voice  he had his revolver all the time in his hip pocket and yet he was
as meek as a lamb  

    when we return his things to him added matt  and let him know

the particulars of-

    hands up 

   the thunderclap sounded at my very elbow and in the dusk we saw three
men covering us with leveled winchesters

   youre done up this time cinch just march along and step
lively too 

    assure you there is some mistake here   i hastened to say   this
is only a joke--

    a sorry joke it will be for you  hand over your plunder and not a
word  you hear me 

   i tremblingly passed over the watch and matt did the same with the
purse the tables were turned with a vengeance  our captors were in
deadly earnest we were evidently mistaken for cinch wadders and one of
his men and even though we could prove otherwise we could not deny that
we had held up and robbed an innocent person while the sheriff as he
undoubtedly was did the talking his deputies remained silent in the back-
ground

   mute dejected and despairing we tramped down the trail in front of our
guards when were about half way to the grizzly bear the sheriff called
out in a sharp voice

    halt 

   we obeyed not daring to look around

   ill be gone only a minute he continued  i left the handcuffs at the
grizzly bear keep em covered till i get back

   the sheriff strode past us and quickly vanished in the gloom about
five minutes later i heard a laugh  there was no mistaking from whence it
came i would have known it among a thousand it was ford oakmans 

   matt and i instantly turned our heads oakman and olcott came for-
ward their weapons lowered they were fairly convulsed with mirth

    not a word said i  youve played it well for a sick man ford its
on us  lets adjourn to the grizzly bear

    any way said matt  weve got it on tucker

      but who was the sheriff   i asked

    why perkins the hayseed


the fox hunter

    well he is a born actor

    it cost us five dollars and several rehearsals to get him up to the right
key but he was worth it replied oakman whats become of him
though   he continued   what was he up to when he spoke about the
handcuffs 

    i reckon he is waiting for us at the inn lets join him suggested
olcott

   we hurried to the grizzly bear and when we entered the bar room
felix tucker was in the midst of a flamboyant account of his experience with
a half dozen outlaws one look at our slouch hats and turned up coat col-
lars told him the truth a ghastly smile lit up his face and he said weakly
well now i suspected you hildreth all the time

   then oakman related with much gusto the trick played on us in turn

   which reminds me interrupted olcott where in the dickens is
perkins

   an odd expression came over the face of landlord ctittle as he asked for
further particulars when he had heard the whole story he said  gentle-
men the right name of that verdant countryman you call mr perkins is
cinch wadders  i suspected him the other night when he first came here 
he saw it and warned me not to give him away  and as he promised me he
would do no harm to you i did not feel bad about keeping his secret i
reckon its good by purse and watch 

   when we had recovered from our amazement i turned to tucker

   since you have lost your property through our doings we can do 
less than make it good to you

   then it was tuckers turn to add the last straw

    my friends i am not quite the fool i may look i knew i was likely to
run against cinch wadders in these parts at any time so i prepared myself
by carrying a brass watch and a purse padded with papers of no value

   all of which suggests the question whether after all it was not tucker

the river of darkness

a record of some marvelous experiences in the dark continent-why a water journey beneath
the earths surface was undertaken at frightful risks-a voyage on a raft along
an unknown course and without the possibility of retreat

    guy chutney an officer in the british army on his way back to service in india is asked
to stop off at aden and take important despatches to sir arthur ashby governor of zaila on the
african coast kn route the steamer touches at berbera where the great annual fair is being
held here chutney rescues from death makar makalo by shooting a leopard whose slumbers
the arab had unwittingly disturbed and a few minutes later he meets an old friend melton
forbes foreign correspondent of an english newspaper suspecting that there is treachery
in the wind forbes sends his native servant momba through the town to investigate who soon
after returns pursued by a mob of somali warriors it appears that manuel torres a portuguese
fellow passenger of guys on the aden steamer and whom he suspects of reading his des-
patches has brought rifles to makar makalo who is instituting rebellion against the english on
behalf of rao khan emir of harar

    melton with hip servant accompanies guy to zaila and at the residency they find sir arthur
drinking champagne with colonel carrington their report carries consternation to the breast
of the governor who thinks of seeking safety on board the steamer but it is too late  the
arabs are already swarming about the place the englishmen are all made prisoners and doomed
by makar makalo to be sent as slaves to the somalis of the galla country

he party were taken to a rear apartment of the residency and placed

under strong guard during the remainder of that night no one slept
of course nor did they hold much conversation for all instinctively avoided
a subject which could only add to their wretchedness

   slavery among the somalis was a fate worse than death it was a living
death indeed for hope of escape there was none far better if makar had
orderes them to be shot at daybreak

   guy spoke hopefully to melton of the situation counting somewhat on
the claim he had on makar but melton seemed to think that the arab had
ignored the affair and would not interfere with guys fate

   all too soon gray dawn came stealing into the residency revealing the
haggard faces of the captives and with it came a summons from makar to
prepare for the journey food was brought and partaken of with some
relish for under even the most distressing circumstances men seem able to
eat closely watched they were led into the open air and halted for a
brief space in the court

the sun was not up yet and the blue waters of the gulf stretched afar

the rtver of darkness

until lost in the pale xnist in the harbor lay the two steamers but the
british flag no longer floated over their decks

   finally they were led through a curious rabble of arabs and somalis to
the outskirts of the town where the caravan was in process of formation it
was no ordinary caravan there were no bales of goods lying about no
camels laden down with burdens but surrounded by many of the population
drawn hither by curiosity were about fifty camels with simple trappings and
a group of somalis and arabs all heavily armed the arabs with rifles the
natives with long spears

   simultaneously with the arrival of the captives makar made his appear-
ance with an armed escort and proceeded to hold a close conversation with
the two arabs who seemed to be the leaders of the caravan he spoke
earnestly for quite a while making many gestures and pointing from time to
time at the prisoners then he turned away and instantly all was excite-
ment

   the arabs and somalis quickly pulled themselves upon their camels and
with the aid of the guards the englishmen were mounted in theame way
each man being hoisted up beside an arab or a somali

   no resistance was made the hindoo soldiers were in a state of deep
dejection and poor sir arthur seemed hardly to realize his position

   the caravan was now ready to start at the last minute makar makalo
passed carelessly by guy and whispered keep good heart makar no
forget then he vanished in the crowd and with a loud cheer to speed
them on their way the line of camels filed at a slow trot over the sandy plain
in a southwesterly direction

   guy turned his head for a last look at zaila and the harbor now begin-
ning to glimmer in the first rays of the sun and then a stretch of sand hills
hid the town from view

   little did he realize that which he must pass through before he saw the
coast again

   from the ruined fortifications of the town an unseen observer watched
the departure of the caravan it was manuel torres the crafty portu-
guese was well pleased to see the hated englishmen speeding away to their
doom

   he was a cunning knave and had laid his plans well perhaps he feared
the stability of the new government if the english came into possession of
zaila again he could invent some clever tale to disprove his connection with
the arab revolt and who could bear witness against him  none indeed
for the lips of those who alone knew his guilt would be hopelessly sealed
africa never gives up her slaves

   to the wretched captives that days journey over the scorching desert
was a fearful experience nothing is more painful to the novice than riding
camel back and when at last a halt was made at sunset every man was ach-
ing from head to foot

   the heat too had been fearful though the arabs had provided them
with big sun helmets before starting no intercourse was permitted the
captives were kept rigorously apart but little sleep was allowed the
the rtver of darkness



caravan started again before dawn and as before traveled rapidly and
steadily until sundown

   at the end of the second day they had become in a measure accustomed
to the motion of the camels and no longer suffered as much yet in all this
time no words had been exchanged each man was kept apart the arab
with whom guy rode could speak some english and from him he learned
that the chief object of the caravan was to carry to rao khan the news of
the capture of zaila further information the arab refused to give

   the caravan comprised a dozen arabs and thirty or forty somalis of the
galla country it was to these crafty savages that the captives belonged
the somalis had assisted makar in the revolt and these slaves were their
reward their chief who accompanied the caravan was none other than
guys vindictive enemy oko sam

   eate in the afternoon of the fifth day the caravan came to a sudden halt
in the distance were visible green hills and rolling plains covered with verd-
ure the desert seemed to have ended it was evident that something of
importance was about to happen

   all dismounted and while the arabs and somalis entered into an excited
conversation the captives were for the first time allowed to converse

   their hopeless situation was too well understood for discussion strange
to say sir arthur was the only one who had not abandoned hope

   the government will save us he repeated gloomily they will
send an army into the interior

   no one ventured to dispute this assertion they talked in low tones of
their probable destination and regarded with some uneasiness the conference
going on among the arabs which had now assumed a more excitable phase

    they are quarreling over something said guy  why do you sup-
pose they have stopped here   

    i dont know replied melton  unless they intend to separate the
arabs going on to harar the somalis to their own country which lies to the
south of harar  

   meltons theory was very plausible but before any one could reply
the conference terminated suddenly and the arabs drawing apart came
quickly up to the captives and laying hold of sir arthur and the colonel led
them over to the somalis

   this was repeated with momba captain waller and the hindoo sol-
diers but to their surprise guy and melton were ordered to remain where
they were

   foremost among the somalis stood oko sam his leopard skin dangling
about his loins and a fiendish expression on his face

   he advanced a step or two talking fiercely and pointing with his spear
to guy and melton the arab leader strode out toward him and cried in
a loud voice  makar has ordered it the two white men must go to harar

   scarce had the words left his lips when the somali chief poised his spear
and hurled it forward with such force and accuracy of aim that it passed
through the arabs body and the point came out at the back with a cry
he dropped on the sand


the river of darkness

   a second of terrible suspense followed and then snatching another spear
from one of his followers the maddened somali leaped furiously at guy who
unfortunately was standing directly in his path

chapter viii-the separation

   but help was at hand before oko sam could reach his victim an arab
directly behind guy fired and the fellow stumbled blindly on the sand

   a shout of rage burst from the somalis and hastily pushing their cap-
tives to the rear they advanced in a very ugly manner shaking their long

spears

   leaving the dead arab and the wounded somali where they had fallen
the arabs moved back a short distance taking guy and melton with them
and shouted to the somalis to remain where they were

   the arabs were reluctant to fire and would have avoided further blood-
shed but the enraged savages continued to press forward and finally let fly
a shower of spears that wounded one of the arabs and unfortunately killed
a camel the arabs at once retaliated with a rifle volley and to such good
effect that three or four of the somalis were killed

   this brought them to their senses their spears could not compete with
the firearms of the arabs they moved back to their animals and with a
few farewell shouts of vengeance rode away to the south while the arabs
hastily bestrode their camels and taking the two englishmen with them
calmly resumed their journey to the southwest

   for a time the two caravans moving on the sides of an acute angle as it
were remained close together  but gradually diverging the sharp outlines
of the somalis began to fade into the twilight and at last as guy and mel-
ton strained their tear dimmed eyes into the distance the shadows obliterated
the last traces of their captive friends to momba melton hsd been deeply
attached and their separation was a hard blow

   and now a terrible feeling of desolation came over them and they were
half inclined to wish that they too had been led away to share the fate of
sir arthur and the colonel

   though it was now fast growing dark the arabs evinced no intention of
stopping with long sweeping strides the unwearied camels swept over the
sandy plain and their riders from time to time spurred them to greater speed

   melton was back in the rear but guy rode in front with the arab who
had assumed the leadership since the death of his companion

   guy ventured to address him and was surprised to find him grown some-
what communicative he explained to guy in broken english that by
makars orders he and melton were to be delivered up to rao khan instead
of being sent into slavery among the somalis harar he said was a days
journey away and by traveling all night they would arrive at sunrise his
account of rao khan the emir was by no means reassuring but guy did
not allow this to trouble him much makars last words were still ringing in
his ears and he felt certain that their deliverance from the somalis was the
first step toward the fulfilment of makars promise
the river of darkness



   the little caravan moved on in silence the arabs were probably uneasy
they may have feared an attack from the somalis or some other foe for they
kept a close watch and held their rifles in constant readiness but presently
the moon came up in the east casting a pale glamour over the desert and
tracing on the sand in weird fantastic designs the shadows of the camels and
their riders

   as the night wore on the arabs relaxed their caution and dropping
their rifles to their sides began to refresh themselves with crackers brought
along from zaila together with dates and figs which they washed down with
water

   the arab with whom melton was mounted now rode up beside the leader
and to their great joy guy and melton were permitted to converse
though they had had no rest or sleep since the previous night excitement
had driven away all fatigue and they looked forward with deep interest to
their arrival at harar

   to guys surprise melton did not believe that he had been singled out
to accompany guy

   no no chutney he said depend upon it makar has some other
object in view i believe now that he will effect your escape in some way
but dont be surprised to find yourself sent back to zaila alone makars
clemency will be extended to no one but yourself

   nonsense returned guy i tell you he means to save you too
however we shall not be parted melton i assure you of that i will ac-
cept no deliverance that does not include you too

   forbes made no reply and for a time they rode on in silence absorbed
in conversation they had failed to observe that the aspect of the country had
begun to change they were now ascending a slight ridge and from its
crest could be seen the vague outline of mountains on both the right and the
left while all around them in place of the dreary sand were low bushes and
vegetation the camels thorn and tamarisk shrub of the desert had dis-
appeared once some huge animal glided across their path and one of the
arabs half raised his rifle but lowered it again

   with feelings which they would have found it hard to express guy and
melton saw the dawn come creeping over the sky and just as it became fully
light they rode over the crest of a hill and perceived in the distance a mass
of walls and turrets stamped against the pale gray sky

   a pleasant breeze blew from the mountains which rose steep and rocky on
all sides while the valleys were richly wooded and a silver thread curving
to and fro marked the presence of a hillside stream

   the little caravan now descended into a narrow gorge and traveled rapidly
along the course of a brawling torrent for nearly an hour then crossing
the stream they rounded a sharp spur of rocks and the dreaded city of harar
was before them

   thirty years before the intrepid burton had penetrated to that hotbed of
fanaticism and had by a miracle come back alive from that day to this
none had dared to emulate him

well might the two young englishmen shrink from meeting that detestable


the river of darkness

despot rao khan who ruled his people by the sword and hated all chris-
tians with hatred that fanaticism alone can breed

   the caravan ascended the hill and across the brow of the ridge stretched
the massive irregular wall of the town the great brazen gates were closed
and in the oval turrets that rose sentinel-like above the wall appeared no
sign of life or motion

   then with startling suddenness came a trumpet blast and the quick sharp
roll of drums  and from the town burst a tumult and volume of sound and
then over the walls and peering curiously from the turrets appeared a
swarm of dark repulsive faces

   the tumult deepened and changed to one vast murmur as the caravan
moved in dignified state up to the very gates of the ancient city of harar

chapter ix-a close shave

   a brief pause then the gates swung on creaking hinges and the cara-
van filed in between the dingy walls that had reared themselves from the
summit of that hill for centuries

   for an instant a hush of curiosity fell on the multitude within as the cara-
van appeared but as the arab leader suddenly flung to the breeze the eng-
lish flag that had once floated from the fortifications of zaila a great shout
arose so that the very air seemed to tremble and the people pressed tumult-
uously on the caravan from all sides

   zaila has fallen  zaila has fallen  they cried and wild with joy
they flung their arms in the air while those in the rear sought the housetops
the better to see the new arrivals

   in the first excitement guy and melton had escaped notice but now they
were suddenly spied and the sight of the two hated englishmen roused the
passions to the highest pitch of ferocity the foreigners presence in the
town was a sacrilege an insult and with threats and angry cries the mob
surged round the group at last so great was the crush the camels were
forced to halt

    kill the infidels  kill the dogs of unbelievers   howled the multitude
and waxing more furious with every shout they drew daggers and knives
and raised their spears

   the arabs had quietly closed round guy and melton forming with their
camels a protective circle and this alone saved the englishmen from death
but every instant the situation was becoming more critical the mob grew
bolder and even tried to force the group apart in spite of the protestations
of the arabs who had begun to point their rifles threateningly hundreds
of savage faces glared unutterable hatred at the two strangers hundreds of
wretches were thirsting for their blood and finally roused to uncontrollable
fury the crowd swept impetuously against the caravan from all sides

   the frightened camels pranced and reared and the cordon of defense
suddenly broken a dozen savages rushed on guy and melton a long spear
pierced forbes under the arm and down he went beneath the camels

   a burly wretch dashed at guy with a dagger but the arab brought
the river of darkness



down the butt of his rifle on the fellows head just in time and he dropped
like a log

   the man behind hurled his spear but his aim was poor and instead of
striking guy it entered the poor camels neck and the beast plunging
madly forward hurled guy and the arab to the ground

   this alone saved their lives as guy staggered to his feet cries of quite
a different nature burst from the mob and in fright and panic they began to
scatter in all directions the rattle of musketry broke out some distance
ahead and the arabs joining in eagerly began to empty their rifles into the
fleeing mass

   the englishmen were saved a compact body of men in linen tunics
and leopard skin caps came sweeping forward they were armed with rifles
and as they ran they kept shooting into the struggling crowd which was
shrieking and groaning with agony

   in five minutes the place was deserted and the stony ground was literally
covered with bodies it was a terrible example of rao khans despotic rule

   melton was lifted up and to guys deep sorrow it was seen that he had
received an ugly thrust along the side not of a serious nature but ragged
and painful

   two of the emirs troopers for such they proved to be carried him for
he was unable to walk or ride

   guy and the arab mounted a fresh camel first putting the wounded
animal out of his misery and then preceded by the emirs guard the caravan
resumed its march up the street

   the first sight of harar was novel and interesting before them was a
long avenue fully a mile in length at the extreme end of which could be
dimly seen the northern wall of the town this avenue was like a barren
mountain road strewn with rubbish and heaps of rocks and the dwellings
which rose on all sides to the height of two stories were many of them con-
structed of sandstone and granite cemented with a reddish clay they were
impressively gloomy and dingy

   the terrible scene just enacted had terrorized the people many arabs
came flocking across the streets and exchanged greetings with the newcomers
but very few somalis or gallas were to be seen the sight of the emirs
guard seemed to have stricken the town like a palsy the shops and booths
were closed and deserted the curtains of the houses were closely drawn 
here and there at the doors lay goods that had been dropped in the sudden
panic and at one place a man lay dead across the threshold still clutching in
his stiffened fingers a bunch of brightly colored rugs

   but now the scene became animated and lively people flocked out from
their houses among them many women whom guy regarded curiously for
they seemed to be of quite a different type from the men and passably good
looking they made no demonstration however but very quietly followed
the caravan

   the center of the town was now close at hand and a short distance
ahead on the left hand side rose a more imposing abode than those around
it it was built of granite and above the flat roof rose a square tower with


the river of darkness

circular windows it boasted a spacious courtyard inclosed by a low stone
parapet and within this space were a dozen armed guards clad in leopard
skin caps and bearing brightly polished rifles

   it was the palace of the kmir and as the caravan drew up to the gates
the escort sounded a blast of trumpets and almost immediately the doors
were opened and a grave and dignified arab came slowly out

   he spoke a few words to the leader of the caravan who dismounted at
once and bidding guy follow him entered the courtyard close behind him
came melton borne by the soldiers

   passing between the guards they entered a narrow vestibule hung with
rich curtains and in a moment more were ushered into the dreaded presence
of rao khan

   the emir was seated on a low dais at the further side of a spacious
apartment the first glance struck terror to guys heart rao khan was a
short thickset man with a round smooth face his eyes were sunken
deeply under the forehead and the expression of his face was a strange
blending of brutality avarice and treachery he was simply clad in white
linen with a great sword at his side and on his head was a leopard skin cap
so constructed that the tail of the leopard hung down his back

   before him squatted four solemn faced arabs the floor was spread with
rugs and the skins of various animals and on the heavily curtained walls
hung a dazzling array of every description bronze and copper shields and
strips of oddly woven tapestry at sight of the english flag which the arab
now produced the emirs eyes sparkled his face lit up with fiendish joy and
he began to talk wildly in a strange tongue

   the arab replied giving him no doubt an account of the insurrection
for the names berbera zaila and makar makalo were frequently mentioned

   guy from his position at meltons side who had been placed on a soft
lion skin watched the strange scene with wonder he was more worried at
present about melton than anything else the spear wound had not yet
been dressed and the poor fellow was in too much pain even to talk

   at last the arab turned round and pointing to the englishmen spoke in
a low tone to the emir who half rose from his seat and looked sharply at
the captives

   guy met his gaze calmly and steadily in a moment the suspense would
be over and their fate would be decided one way or the other

chapter x-the slave prison

   the emirs reply was brief and apparently forcible he clapped his
hands and half a dozen soldiers appeared instantly he addressed them
with a word or two but before they could execute his orders guy hastened
forward and said to the arab  i pray you have my friends wound dressed
he is suffering much pain

the arab addressed the emir pointing to the wounded nan and then
turning to guy he said  it is well rao khan will see to the inglis man
guy would have sought more information but the soldiers now came for-
the river of darkness



ward and picking melton up motioned guy to follow them they passed
out of the apartment by a rear door and traversing a long hall entered a
big courtyard

   on the right and left were high stone walls and directly opposite was a
low gloomy sandstone structure with one narrow door opening on the court

   here were standing more armed guards who obsequiously opened the
door for the approaching captives

   as they passed through the gloomy portal guys heart sank his eyes
at first could see nothing but darkness and he blindly followed his conductors
until they came to a stop a heavy door was closed and bolted behind him
and then all was silent

   in a few seconds he was able to see his surroundings he was in a square
dungeon lighted by a narrow aperture high up in the wall the floor was
of stone strewn with straw melton sat up and leaned against the wall

    where are we chutney   he asked

    i dont know answered guy  in some sort of a prison i suppose
why-hello melton here are iron rings sunk in the floor all along the side

    that settles it then rejoined melton this is rao khans slave
prison i dont suppose there are many inmates now while the fair is
going on  

   approaching footsteps put an end to the conversation and in a moment
the door opened to admit a tall arab followed by a native with bandages
and a basin of water

   the arab quietly loosened meltons shirt and coat and washing the
wound wrapped bandages round his body spread with some soft ointment
he did the work speedily and dexterously and then departed as silently as
he had come he had barely gone however when a soldier entered with a
tray containing dates figs and a peculiar kind of cakes which he placed
before the prisoners they ate with relish and then overcome by weariness
they lay down on the straw and fell asleep

   it was some hours later when guy woke night had come for no light
shone through the aperture he lay for some time listening to meltons
deep breathing and thinking of their terrible situation

   he was not without hope of deliverance for he placed a great deal of
faith ii makai s promise  yet even then the chances were against them
perhaps at this very moment zaila had been retaken and makar was killed or
a prisoner if this should happen they were lost guy shuddered to think
of rao khans vengeance under such circumstances

   presently he became aware of vague noises somewhere in the distance
he fancied he heard shots fired and a loud tumult of voices

   he thought it might be imagination but suddenly the sounds increased
and once or twice footsteps hurried past the dungeon the noise now woke
melton and together they listened convinced that it was a presentiment of
coming evil the strange sounds rose and fell at times nearly dying away
and then bursting out with renewed violence

    i cant understand it at all said guy  it cant be a rejoicing over
the capture of zaila for they are plainly cries of anger  


the river of darkness

   well know pretty soon what it means returned melton  it con-
cerns us you may be sure

   in his excitement he rose and began to pace the floor his wound was
giving him no pain he said adding that he really felt pretty well again

   at last the shouts seemed to come a little nearer and before long the
fierce angry cries were heard close at hand

    they are surrounding the prison said guy huskily

   he was right a howling mob was on all sides of them now and it was
quite clear that they were beginning to attack the walls of the courtyard for
suddenly half a dozen shots were fired as though the guards were resisting
the invaders

    it was a period of terrible suspense the shouts increased the firing grew
heavier powder smoke drifted into the prison and just when they expected
to see their dungeon door torn open by a mad swarm of fanatics the uproar
suddenly ceased

    a full minute of silence followed and then on the night air rose a howl
of triumph so savage so vindictive that guy and melton shivered from head
to foot for some reason the attack had been suddenly abandoned what
that reason was they could only surmise

   the silence continued the invaders had dispersed sleep was impos-
sible and they passed the time in conversation until a streak of light flicker-
ing through the opening showed that morning had come

   food and drink were brought in the prisoners ate sparingly the
shadow of a great calamity was overhanging

    i am just as sure said melton  that something will shortly happen
as i am that you and i are in rao khans slave prison at harar

   listen answered guy

   footsteps approached the door creaked and opened and a man entered
with a cry of wonder guy and melton sprang to their feet the newcomer
was bronzed and burnt he had light hair a mustache and a soft blond
beard but he wore trousers and a tunic of white linen

   the surprise was mutual the stranger scanned them closely from head
to foot

    who are you  cried guy hoarsely  can it be possible that you are
an englishman-an englishman in harar

   the man paused a moment and then said quietly i am a greek
my name is canaris mataplan at present i am interpreter to rao khan
the emir

    but your english cried melton  it is perfect

     i was a cafe keeper at cairo for seven years replied the greek  i
learned english there

   an embarrassing pause now occurred it was certain that the greek was
the bearer of tidings from the emir no one dared speak at last the greek
said quietly  you are truly unfortunate tell me how you came here i
know that zaila has fallen into the possession of rao khans emissaries i
know nothing else

    guy briefly told the tale and canaris listened silently
the river of darkness



    fools  he said  the english will be in zaila again in a month

    and you  rejoined guy  what brought you to harar

    i left cairo for calcutta said canaris the steamer was lost off
cape guardafui  ten of us reached shore in a boat  the somalis slaughtered
all but myself i was sold to the arabs and came ultimately to harar i was
useful to rao khan in many ways and my life was spared i have been here
two years two long years i shall never see greece again he added
gloomily  i am a slave to the emir for life

    is escape then impossible  asked guy

     absolutely between here and the coast is the desert starvation or
death by wild beasts awaits a fugitive there to the south are the blood-
thirsty gallas no no  one can never escape from harar

   the tramp of the guard was heard in the corridor and a sudden change
passed over the greeks face

    i have come from rao khan he said in a low voice  he sends me
with a message

   he paused

    go on said guy  we are listening he was breathing heavily
two hours after you arrived here yesterday morning resumed cana-
ris  rao khan despatched the arabs to zaila again in company with two
hundred of his best soldiers who will assist in holding the town they had
scarcely gone when an insurrection broke out the people were angered at
the slaughter done by the emirs troops when they rescued you from the
crowd it is a law of ancient standing in harar that every christian stranger
who enters her gates must die englishmen are most detested of all the
populace became maddened and furious  from all quarters of the town they
came clamoring demanding your lives when rao khan called out his re-
maining troops they refused to fire the people they said were right a
very few remained faithful to the emir the mob surrounded the palace and
the prison  they tried to scale the walls  the guards in the court fired on
them then rao khan appeared and spoke to the angry crowd he begged
them to wait he told them that you belonged not to him but that makar ma-
kalo had sent you here for safe keeping that you were the slaves of makar
makalo the people only howled in derision they became more angry and
infuriated and refused to listen any longer  the englishmen must die  
they cried rao khan was fearful in his anger but he was powerless he
feared the destruction of the palace the loss of his own life   here canaris
paused and looked with infinite pity at the englishmen

   guy tried to speak but the words stuck in his throat melton laid his
hand  the greeks arm  go on go on he whispered hoarsely  we
are men not cowards eet us know the worst

chapter xi-canaris unfolds a tale

    well said canaris  i will tell you rao khan has promised your
lives to the people it was his only hope and now his word once given he
will not dare to break it


the river of darkness

   meltou covered his face with his hands and guy staggered backward

      when   he cried huskily   today   

    no said canaris  not today the emir bids me tell you that you
will have four days yet to live on the fifth day you will die by the execu-
tioner in the square of the town

   they shuddered as these dreadful words fell from the greeks lips

      is there no hope then at all   said melton   let us know the worst
at once and be done with it  

   canaris made no reply for a moment his eyes were fixed on the floor
and he seemed to be thinking deeply when he looked up the expression of
his face was changed a strange light shone in his eye a mixture of tri-
umph and fear

   i can tell you nothing now he said hastily tonight you shall
have an answer but tell me how is your wound 

     better replied melton  i scarcely feel it at all

    good said canaris  now do just as i tell you lie down on the
straw  pretend that you are much worse  moan loudly from time to time
and when i come tonight i shall have something to impart to you  

   with this strange admonition canaris hastily left the dungeon and the
guard rebolted the door

    is the fellow crazy   said melton  what can he mean to do  
crazy rejoined guy no i have a strange faith in that man
melton do just as he tells you and see what turns up tonight

   with much grumbling melton assumed the part of a very sick man he
rather overdid the thing in fact for twice the guard opened the door and
looked in about noon food was brought and from that time no one came
near them

   the minutes dragged along like hours they fried to forget the awful
fate that stared them in the face but in spite of the greeks encouraging
words the future looked very black

   at last the feeble light in their dungeon began to fade away and soon
they were in darkness

    the fellow will never come back said melton bitterly  its all up
with us chutney so dont try to raise any more false hopes 

   but guy refused to give up and his faith was rewarded quick footsteps
approached the dungeon the bolts rattled and canaris entered with a rude
lamp and a leather case which he placed carefully on the floor

   then he pulled a paper from his pocket and waved it gleefully

    see he cried  a permit from rao khan admitting me to the prison
at all times i told him that your wound was very bad that the arab doctor
had failed to help you and that i knew enough of english surgery to cure
you if he would allow it rao khan reluctantly consented and here i am
he listened intently for a moment glanced round the dungeon and then
went on in a low excited tone 

    get close together i have something important to tell you

   they squatted down in a group on the straw and with a strange exult-
ant sparkle in his eyes canaris began 
the river of darkness



     when i came to harar two years ago this very cell held a white slave
like yourselves an englishman he was an old man with long white hair
and beard and had been so long in slavery that he had forgotten his own
name and could scarcely speak the english tongue

     my duties then were to carry food and drink to the slaves and before
long i was on intimate terms with the old englishman he was very ill and
the arab doctors made him no better perhaps it was old age that was the
trouble but at all events he died two months after i came at different
times he had told me the story of his life and that is what i am going to tell
you now

      he had been thirty years in slavery how and where he had been cap-
tured he could no longer remember his mind was a blank on that point
but one thing he told me that is important for twenty years he had lived
among the gallas in a village fifty miles to the south of harar and it was a
few years after he had been brought there that he nearly succeeded in mak-
ing his escape

     he had often heard from the natives of an underground river that was
said to exist and which emptied either into the river juba or into the sea
the tales concerning the river were many and strange but the chief of the
gallas assured him that at one time a tribe of natives had lived in the mouth
of a huge cavern which gave access to the river

    i have heard something of that myself interrupted melton an
arab at zanzibar told me but i never had any faith in the story

   that river exists said canaris solemnly the englishman
found it

     what   cried guy and melton in one breath  he found the under-
ground river   

     yes he discovered it resumed canaris  he found it one day while
hunting a concealed cavern he ventured down and came to a great sandy
beach past which flowed swiftly a broad stream on the beach lay half a
dozen strong canoes with paddles all this he saw by the light that streamed
in from narrow crevices overhead he went back to the village and began
to lay aside provisions for the journey for he intended making his escape by
the river in a week all was ready he had concealed near the cavern sup-
plies for a long voyage the very day fixed for his escape he was sold to a
galla chief who lived twenty miles distant in the years that followed he
made many attempts to escape but on every occasion was captured and
brought back at last he was given as tribute to the emir by this galla
chief and here in this dungeon on the spot you are sitting on now he
 breathed his last  

    canaris paused and helped himself to a glass of water

   a strange story indeed said guy but what has it got to do
with us  

     i will tell you responded canaris with a slight tremor in his voice
 it may have nothing to do with any of us and it may be of the greatest
importance to us all

 did the old man tell you where to find the cavern    asked guy


the river of darkness

   no answered canaris but before he died he gave me this and
pulling a folded bit of linen from his pocket he handed it to guy

    can you read that   he asked in strange excitement  i have never
been able to make anything out of it

   guy pulled it carefully open and gazed with interest on the faded char-
acters that had apparently been written in blood

    yes he said after a pause  i can read it it is french

    go on said canaris  tell me quickly what it is

    it translates as follows rejoined guy 

    half way between elephant peak and the lyions head the south side of the stone
kraal the rock with the cross

   canaris sprang to his feet and staggered back against the wall of the
dungeon

    it was providence that brought you here he cried  it is wonderful
wonderful  

    what do you mean   said guy  how can this aid us 

   it is the secret of the cave replied canaris  the stone kraal is a
curious formation of rocks that lie between the two mountains that bear those
names close by is the village of the chief of all the gallas  

     but how under the sun can this discovery benefit us   repeated guy
half angrily   can you open our prison for us canaris   

   the greek threw a cautious glance toward the door and then whispered
in a voice that trembled with emotion  nothing is impossible  hope for the
best but stay he added in sudden fear i must have money or all is
lost alas  you have none i am sure

   for answer guy hastily rose and loosening his clothes unhooked a small
buckskin belt he tore open the end and dropped a stream of golden sov-
ereigns into his hand

   here is money he cried the arabs overlooked this when they
searched me

   the greeks eyes glittered

      give me twenty   he said    that will be plenty  

   he stowed the coins away in his clothes and picked up the lamp

    i must leave you now he said  i will return in the morning

   he would have added more but steps were heard in the corridor the
dungeon door clanged behind him and guy and melton were left in darkness
half stupefied by the strange story they had just heard and by the hope of
escape which the greek so confidently held out to them

chapter xii-a daring move

   when daylight came the captives could scarcely believe that the events
of the preceding night had not been all a dream there wras the document
however to prove their reality and guy was deeply studying its faded char-
acters when the greek arrived

   his face was radiant with happiness an expression which quickly gave
way to deep sadness as a big somali entered with a platter of food the
the rtver of darkness



latter had barely closed the door when canaris held up a warning finger and
motioned the englishmen to draw near

    it is well he said softly  i will tell you what i have done near
the palace lives a jewish merchant whom i know well to him i went last
night and by the aid of your gold made a good bargain on the western
side of the city close by the wall is a deserted guard house that was once
used before the watch towers were built here the jew promised to take for
me the goods i purchased namely a supply of dates figs and crackers three
revolvers three rifles with boxes of shells three sabers two ancient bronze
lamps with flasks of palm oil a box of english candles and four long ropes
with iron hooks on the end

    he will betray you to the emir said guy in alarm

     oh no returned canaris  no danger of that i know a little secret
concerning my jewish friend that would put his head above the town walls
in an hours time the things are even now hidden in the deserted house
you may rely on that

  but how are we going to get out of this infernal dungeon    asked
guy  and how can we pass through the streets to the edge of the town 
for answer the greek opened the leather case that he had brought with
him and took out three revolvers three boxes of shells a coil of rope and a
sharp knife

    these are my surgical instruments he said  i will put them under
the straw and he suited the action to the word

   affairs outside have changed somewhat he continued the people
are sullen and restless they mistrust the emir and fear they will be cheated
of the pleasure they are looking forward to

   guy turned pale  then we are lost he cried

   no you are saved said canaris  that very fact works for your
salvation the emir is alarmed  he fears for himself not for you his
troops are few since he despatched the caravan to zaila and at night for
better security he takes the guards from the prison courtyard and stations
them before the palace this leaves three guards to contend with  one
watches in the corridor one stands before the prison door and the third
guards the gateway that opens from the prison yard on to a dark avenue of
the town if all goes well you will be free men at midnight i must hurry
away now listen well to my instructions and do just as i tell you

   you and he turned to melton must pretend all day that your
wound is bad refuse to eat and lie on the straw all the time it will be
better if i do not return today i fear that even now rao khan grows sus-
picious the arab doctor is angered because i have assumed his duties at
midnight if you listen sharply you will hear the guard relieved by a new
man soon after that knock on the door and when the guard looks in show
him the wounded man who will then feign to be very bad i sleep in a rear
apartment of the palace the guard will send for me and i will come
otherwise my visiting you at that time of night would be looked upon with
suspicion the rest i will tell you then dont despair all will be well 
till midnight farewell  


the river of darkness

   canaris glided from the dungeon and the prisoners were alone they
passed the long hours of that day in a strange mixture of hope and fear the
difficulties to be overcome seemed insurmountable they must escape from
the prison pass through the very midst of their bloodthirsty enemies scale
the wall and then-where were they  hundreds of miles from the coast
surrounded by barbarous and savage people and their only hope that myste-
rious underground river which in itself was a thing to be feared

   but on the other hand speedy death awaited them in the dungeon of rao
khan the chances were truly worth taking

   they followed instructions closely when the guard brought them food at
noon and in the evening melton tossed on the floor as though in pain the
thrice welcome darkness came at last and the light faded out of their dun-
geon once a horrible thought entered guys mind what was to prevent
the greek from making his escape alone and abandoning the englishmen to
their fate  it was but momentary however and then he dismissed the sus-
picion with a feeling of shame he had already learned to trust the greek
implicitly

   crouched by their dungeon door they listened by the hour and at last
their patience was rewarded voices were heard steps approached and died
away and then all was silent

   the time for action had come

   melton threw himself on the straw and moaned guy rapped sharply on
the door and waited in suspense almost instantly it opened and the
guard a tall nubian pushed his lamp into the doorway and followed it up
with his head and shoulders

    canaris canaris   said guy earnestly pointing to melton who
uttered at that moment a most unearthly groan

   the guard drew back and shut the door his soft tread echoed down the
corridor and all was still

   the suspense of the next five minutes guy will never forget as long as
he lives it seemed to his excited imagination as though an hour had passed
by when suddenly sounds were heard in the corridor and in an instant more
canaris stood before them his leather case at his side a lamp in his hand
he closed the door opened the case and drew out two wide linen tunics and
two long jackets such as the emirs troops wore

    put these on he whispered  you can wear your helmets  there are
many of them in harar

   as he spoke he drew an arab burnous over his head shading entirely
his light hair and mustache he next pulled the revolvers and shells from
under the straw distributed them around and with the knife cut the rope in
a dozen parts by this time guy and melton had donned their disguises
and were ready for action

   up to this point guy had supposed that canaris had bribed the guards
and paved the way out of prison

   you are sure the guards will let us pass   he said

   canaris looked at him in wonder and then a smile rippled over his face

   you thought i had bribed the guards he said ten thousand
the river of darkness	

pounds could not tempt them they would only lose their heads in the
morning it matters little he added  they will lose them anyhow
but our time has come  be ready now to assist

   he motioned guy and melton behind the door and then pulling it partly
open uttered a few words in a strange tongue

   instantly the powerful frame of the big nubian entered and as he stood
for one second on the dungeon floor sudden mistrust in his ugly features
canaris leaped at his throat and bore him heavily to the ground

    quick he cried and in an instant guy and melton had seized the
struggling mans arms and feet

   still pressing the fellows windpipe with one muscular hand canaris
thrust a gag into the gaping mouth and in two minutes their captive was
lying bound and helpless on the straw

      what did you tell him    asked guy

    i said our lamp was going out canaris replied  and now for the
man at the prison door i must get him inside for the post is in plain view
of the guard at the gate  

   a solution of this puzzling problem was closer at hand than any one imag-
ined the creaking of a door was heard followed by approaching footsteps

   here he comes now said canaris in an excited whisper he has
grown suspicious and has determined to investigate quick

   canaris darted to the other side of the doorway and then ensued another
period of chilling suspense	

   the tread came nearer and at last another stalwart nubian blocked the
doorway with his massive bulk his look of wonder was comical as he saw
his comrade gagged and bound on the dungeon floor but before the half ar-
ticulated exclamation could escape his lips canaris had him by the throat
and down they came the fellow uttered one cry and then as his head
struck the edge of the door in falling his struggles lessened and with no
trouble at all he was gagged and bound

   canaris tore the ammunition from their belts handed guy and melton
their rifles and then blowing out the lamp he pushed them into the corridor
and bolted the door

    two heads will be off in the morning he remarked grimly one
more victory and we are out of prison

   he blew out the light that stood in the corridor and led the way through
the darkness till he reached the door he pulled it open a crack revealing
the moonlit courtyard and took a long careful survey

   there is the man we want he whispered pointing across the court
and putting his eyes to the crevice guy saw against the massive prison wall
a dark shadow leaning grimly on a rifle

chapter xiii-the flight through the town

   it was a critical situation for the three fugitives crouching behind the
heavy prison door that grim sentry over yonder by the gate must be
noiselessly and effectually overpowered and that at once any moment

     h


the river of darkness

guards might come from the palace and then-oh it was horrible  the pub-
lic square the executioners gleaming knife the roar of the populace

   guys brain whirled at this appalling panorama and he clutched the
door for support

    cant we rush on him  asked melton

   canaris laughed grimly

    before we could take three steps from the door he said  the fellow
would see us and alarm the palace if i go alone the chances are that be-
fore you can reach me he would succeed in making an outcry our only
hope lies in getting away from the town before our escape is discovered  

    but what are you going to do canaris   asked guy excitedly  we
are losing precious time  

    keep cool replied the greek  i will fix him in five minutes stay
where you are and dont make a sound when i wave my hand then come  

   he removed his burnous and stuffed it under his tunic then he calmly
opened the door and walked straight across the court toward the guard who
looked up carelessly at his approach with their eyes glued against the
cracks of the door guy and melton waited in terrible suspense

   a short conversation ensued canaris turned and pointed toward the
prison the guard replied with many gestures and finally in his eagerness
placed his rifle against the wall what followed was so swift and dexterous
that it passed like a dream

   the greeks right hand shot from his bosom clasping some glittering ob-
ject it struck the astonished guard on the forehead with a sharp click that
echoed across the court yard and without a sound he dropped on his knees
and then rolled over on the stone pavement

   canaris waved his hand and then the two captives dashed breathlessly
across the courtyard

    is he dead    asked guy in a horrified whisper

    only stunned replied canaris  i struck him with the butt of my
revolver quick now  bind and gag him while i find the key and open the
gate

   guy hastily fastened the fellows feet and arms and stuffed a roll of linen
in his mouth

   melton stood looking on his wound was beginning to give him some
pain again

   with a low exclamation of triumph canaris pulled from the nubians
waist a narrow belt on which hung a ponderous iron key all rose to their
feet guy dropped the unconscious guard under the shadow of the wall
the supreme moment had come the great courtyard white in the light of
the moon was empty the heavy doors leading to the palace were shut
behind the high prison walls all seemed quiet the city was asleep

   the first stage of the journey was accomplished in safety the terrible
passage through the town was before them now with a hand that trembled
ever so slightly canaris inserted the key in the lock it turned with a harsh
rattle and at a touch of the hand the brazen gate swung outward

   the greek made a hasty survey and then stepped noiselessly outside
the river of darkness



they were in a narrow side street which ran past the emirs palace the
side toward the prison was in deep shadow on the other side was a long
stone building with two or three narrow grated windows

    that is an arab storehouse opposite said canaris  we are safe for
the present now follow me closely walk boldly and fearlessly and keep
a few feet apart

    he started off at a rapid gait his white burnous tossing on his shoulders
and with fast beating hearts guy and melton came close behind in five
minutes they turned into another narrow passage running at right angles
and continuing along this for forty or fifty yards made still another turn

   the two streets they had just traversed had been lined for the most part
with big warehouses and slave markets it was in fact the business part of
the town alive with people during the day deserted at night but now a
crisis was at hand canaris halted his little party in the shadow of a build-
ing and pointed straight up the street

    yonder lies the main avenue he said  we must cross it to reach
our destination keep yourselves well under control dont show any fear
and if any people are about dont look at them if they address you make
no reply

   guy marveled at the greeks coolness under such terrible circumstances
every moment was a torture to him as long as they remained in the midst of
these bloodthirsty fiends

   in five minutes they reached the main street from the slight ridge on
which they stood they could see stretching afar on either hand the moonlit
roadway spectered with the dark shadows of the houses they had been
traveling on three sides of a square fifty yards down the street the tower
of the emirs palace was visible outlined faintly against the pale gray sky

   as they stepped from the shadows upon the open roadway an arab
stalked from a doorway opposite and without troubling himself to come
nearer addressed canaris in a strange tongue

   guys heart seemed to leap into his throat as he nervously handled the
revolver that stuck in his belt

   canaris coolly replied in a low voice the arab evinced no intention of
coming any nearer and in an instant more the fugitives had plunged into the
gloom of another cross street

   on all sides now were rude abodes some of sandstone others of clay and
at some places even tents were to be seen laughter and loud talking came
from open windows two or three fierce looking somali warriors stalked
past in dignified silence and an arab sheik wrapped closely in his garment
looked at them curiously as he hurried by

   melton now walked with difficulty his wound had broken out afresh
and was bleeding the weight of the rifle was too much for him and he
was compelled to abandon it in the road

    a little farther now said canaris encouragingly  and we shall be
safe  

   melton tried to walk faster leaning on guys arm but at last with a
moan of pain he sank to the ground
oo

the river of darkness

    go on leave me  save yourselves   he whispered feebly as they bent
over him and tried to lift him to his feet

    one more effort my dear melton implored guy in an agony  only
one more effort and we shall be safe  we can carry you if you cant walk  

    no he gasped go go at once you can escape i would only
keep you back and cause your capture  better one than three

   guy threw an appealing glance at canaris the greeks features were
immovable he calmly waited the result of guys pleading

    my brave fellow said chutney in a husky voice kneeling down and
clasping meltons hand  i refuse to accept your sacrifice i shall remain
here with you and we will meet our fate together canaris save yourself
while there is yet time i will not desert my friend

   the greek paused irresolutely the convulsive workings of his face
showed the struggle going on in his mind suddenly melton rose on one
elbow and cried excitedly 

    go go i tell you

   guy shook his head  no he said decidedly  i will remain

   you are throwing your lives away said melton bitterly here
help me up i will make another effort

   in an instant guy and canaris had gladly pulled lim to his feet and off
they went again as rapidly as possible all was quiet around them a deep
silence broken only by the occasional low of a cow had enwrapped the town
so far their escape had remained undiscovered

   ah here we are said canaris joyfully turning down a dark dirty
passage so narrow that the three could barely walk abreast in three
minutes we shall reach the wall  

   three minutes is not a long time but it is long enough for many things
to happen they had traversed half the length of the street when guy
moved by one of those sudden unexplainable impulses turned his head

   ten yards behind crawling with soft and stealthy tread was a grim half
naked somali how long he had been following in their track it was
impossible to tell but there he was a stern nemesis the moonlight shining
on spear and shield and glowing on the dark villainous features

   guy and canaris wheeled round and stood with drawn revolvers the
somali clutched his spear and drew up his shield the silence remained un-
broken

   one single cry and a mad horde would rush forth like bees from a hive
the somali made one step backward then another and then opening his
mouth he gave a yell that was caught up in horrible echoes till the street
fairly rang

    malediction  cried canaris in uncontrollable fury  thats your last
shout and taking quick aim he pulled his revolver on the shouting somali

   a stunning report a hollow groan and down came the savage all in a
heap while the heavy shield bounded with a clatter over the stones

how the robbery of the rival banks became a matter of strange coincidences-far reaching
and totally unexpected results of an act of gallantry-the battles on bunfcel
island and the frustrating of carefully laid plans

    mr singeriay and mr barkpool are the two wealthiest citizens of montoban the former
is proprietor of the montoban mill and president of the montoban bank  the latter owns the
onongo mill and presides over the onongo bank they have long- been enemies and their
quarrel is shared by their sons dolph singerlay and phin barkpool but both the latter are beset
by the same desire  to have a steamer of his own on the lake andy lamb is the son of mr
barkpools engineer and he rescues diana singerlay from the persecutions of tom sawder a
young hoodlum phin quarrels with him in consequence and the father is dismissed from the
barkpool employ only to be hired hy mr singerlay meantime dolph despairing of obtaining
his fathers consent to the purchase of a steamer takes his fathers keys and at midnight makes
his way to the montaban bank just as he reaches the strong box in the vault he is seized
from behind and thrown to the floor by the light of his lantern he discovers two persons
standing over him one of whom points a revolver at his head

chapter xiv-the onongo magnate overwhelmed

xhat is the matter with dolph tonight father  asked andy lamb
        as soon as they reached the street

    im sure i dont know  but it looks as though he had been cutting up
some caper i could see that he had been lying to his father who caught
him in the lies  but i have no idea what he was trying to cover up replied
mr lamb  he is a bad boy and i wouldnt have a son like him if mr
singerlay would give me all his property

    you noticed dolph when we met him in the hall didnt you  he had
just come into the house and his clothes were all covered with yellow mud
 i saw him and i thought then that he had been up to some mischief
but he explained how he happened to be in such a plight  

    yes  but his story about the boat was all made up  and that was where
he caught him in the lie said andy  i have an idea that he knows who
blew up the upper dam

    what do you mean andy  demanded the engineer stopping short in
his astonishment

    if dolph did not do it himself he knows something about it replied
andy

    dont mention such an idea my son  you will get yourself into trouble
if you open your mouth as freely as that added the father cautiously

    i say it only to you

 this story began in the april issue of the argosy the two back numbers will be
mailed to any address on receipt of  cents


the bunkel mystery

    but some one might have heard you said the engineer looking about
him for they were still in one of the streets of the town and several persons
were in sight

    i wont say it again  but that is what came to my mind when i saw
that dolph was lying to his father

   i cannot believe he did it for to tell the truth i dont think he has
brains enough to do such a job

   dolph has brains enough he was smart enough in school but he
wouldnt apply himself  and that is the reason he made such a poor show

      where did he get the powder   

   some men have been blastiug rocks for mr barkpool just above the
dam and they had several kegs of powder which they kept in an old spring
house built of brick just beyond the mill

    no one but myself and mr barkpool knew about the opening under the
dam so far as i know  

    i dont know that dolph did it and i only mentioned what came into
my head while i was in the house

     dont mention it again andy if it is so let his father find it out for
himself said the machinist

    dolph had a row with his father when i was in the lot and i heard a
part of it he wanted the money to buy a steamer to put on the lake  and
that was an idea of mine in connection with the coal question

     let them settle their own troubles said the engineer as they reached
the house where mrs hamb had called and was waiting for them

   but they found that she had been tired of waiting and had gone home
with a neighbor who was going that way it was hardly more than a quar-
ter of a mile to the cottage and the subject of dolphs agency in blowing up
the dam was not renewed for andy took occasion to inform his father in re-
gard to his plan for the transportation of coal freight and passengers from
the north end of the lake

      i should say that the plan is a very good one and i may mention it to
mr singerlay if we get along well together coal is wanted now for
neither mill has taken its stock for the summer  but there is no steamer on
the lake so that nothing can be done about it at present said mr lamb as
they arrived at the cottage iam not in condition to do anything about it
and dont know how we could get a steamer into this lake if i were let the
matter rest till the rich men take hold of it

   as soon as the machinist opened the back door of the cottage his wife
confronted him she seemed to be excited about something and shook her
head as she raised her hand as if to impose silence upon her husband and
son

   mr barkpool is in the front room and he has been waiting half an
hour for you said mrs lamb in a whisper as though she feared some ter-
rible consequences must attend the visit of the onongo magnate

   i am not afraid of him sarah said the engineer you need not
whisper  talk out loud and say just what you think

     dont keep him waiting any longer for he acts as though he was sitting
the bunkel mystery



on a bunch of nettles and i am sure he means some harm to you after what
has happened do be careful what you say to him morgan

    i will try to do so  but you had better go in and tell him to be careful
what he says to me added the engineer with a smile i wont keep him
waiting any longer

      do be careful    exclaimed the wife earnestly

    i will sarah you may come with me andy as you heard all that
was said at his house 

   mr lamb entered the front room followed by his son he was prepared
for a storm though he could not imagine what his late employer wanted of
him

    good evening mr barkpool said he as he went into the apartment
good evening mr lamb returned the magnate with as much
suavity as though they had not had high words a few hours before i
have been waiting for you some time  

   your call is very unexpected if i had known you were coming i
should have been at home added the machinist as blandly as his visitor

   we had a little fracas this evening but i dont want to say a word
about that or bring up anything we talked about then said mr barkpool
rising from his chair as though his seat burned him and walking towards
his late employee   i have been paying you eighty dollars a mouth for the
year round which is very good wages for steady work

   very fair wages and i found no fault with my pay added the
machinist

     i discharged you  but i wish now to hire you again and to pay you
seventy five dollars a month for the year round continued the mill owner
in one of his insinuating tones

    i am very much obliged to you mr barkpool  but when i go to work
again it will be at one hundred dollars a month for the year round added
mr lamb with a cheerful smile as he glanced at his son

     one hundred dollars a month    exclaimed the magnate   that is too
much

    then if i had any influence with you mr barkpool i should advise
you not to pay it answered the engineer

    but i am in a tight place  i need an engineer at once-to light in fact
for siugerlay must know that my mill is at work at the usual time in the
morning replied the magnate i hope you will not take advantage of
the circumstances

      i assure you i will not take advantage at all of you for i only said that
when i went to work again it would be at one hundred dollars a month
very well fix your own price i will give you a hundred dollars a
month said barkpool with a sort of desperate energy

   unfortunately i am not in condition to accept your offer at present
added the engineer

   what do you mean lamb didnt you say you asked a hundred
dollars a month  demanded mr barkpool beginning to dance around the
room in his excitement


the bunkel mystery

    no sir  i only said i should go to work at that figure i cannot ac-
cept your offer because i am engaged at the price named with free house
rent said mr iramb in the gentlest terms possible

     you are engaged  what do you mean by that  do you mean that
you wont work forme asked the magnate beginning to boil over with
wrath

      i only mean that i am engaged for a year  

      engaged to whom   

    mr singerlay

   	 singerlay  that is downright treason    foamed the onongo man
   treason i think you discharged me mr barkpool

    you might have waited till tomorrow before you engaged yourself

    but mr singerlay wanted me tonight

   the onongo magnate was overwhelmed and he rushed from the cottage
as though a demon were pursuing him

chapter xv-the treason of doeph singereay

   mr barkpooe seemed to be completely upset when he went out of the
cottage into the darkness of the evening there were many people in the
road who had walked as far as the upper dam to see the effects of the explo-
sion and the scene had been illuminated by fires on the shore the magnate
avoided them for he was raging like a pent up volcano

   it was not a question of work to be done in the mills-of making goods to
fill waiting orders-or anything of that kind which rejoiced one magnate and
enraged the other  it was only the success of one and the failure of the other
in annoying his rival each desired to vex the other by having his mill in
operation in spite of the disaster

   mr barkpool realized that he had lost the battle and lost it by his own
folly he had been willing to humiliate himself by  backing down  to the
machinist but even that had been a failure the people who passed fiim in
the road saw that he was in an unhappy frame of mind dark as it was for
all his movements proclaimed the fact

   he walked so rapidly that he soon reached his mansion phin was in the
office and his father talked to him about his affairs  but they were on no
better terms with each other than the father and son in the other great man-
sion like dolph phin was a spoiled child  and it couli hardly be other-
wise after the weak indulgence of the foolish fathers

   if one of them had a boat the other must have one

   from row boats they had gone to sail boats phin had been the first to
be supplied with this luxury and then came the dragon larger and better
fitted up in many respects then phin appeared in town riding on a pony
three days later dolph was mounted on the finest steed that money would
buy

   then diana was seen on the lake in a sail boat which outstripped all the
others in elegance for it had been brought from new york and the builder
had not been limited in the matter of expense this last boat made phin
the bunkel mystery



uneasy then some one hinted that dolph was to have a steamer for though
this enterprising young gentleman did not expose his plan to meet the coal
question he had declared that he meant to have a steamer  the lake

   people said he would have one if he wanted such a craft for he always
had his own way in such matters of course phin wanted a steamer and he
wanted to have it before dolph obtained one but on one subject at least
the two millionaires agreed mr barkpool refused to grant the request of
his son as mr singerlay had done about the same time

   phin rebelled as dolph had done he had been impudent to his
father he thought his rich parent was very unreasonable and declared
that he would have a steamer the battle with the son had followed that
with the engineer his father had stood by him in the quarrel with andy
and pliin thought it was a favorable time to push his request

   dolph singerlay as i have said lay on the floor of the montoban bank
with a man holding him by the throat though he was far from comfortable
in this position it is necessary to leave him there a while longer in order to
explain some of his earlier movements

   the hopeful son had found his father unwilling to listen to his scheme to
run a steamer on the lake and dolph assured him that mr barkpool would
be more accommodating this was touching the magnate in his most tender
spot but he regarded it as an idle threat for surely his son could not seri-
ously think of such abominable treason

   very likely dolph did use the idea as an idle threat he hated the other
mill owner as thoroughly as his father did for he had been brought up to do
so he rushed out of the house desperately angry because his father denied
his request he forgot all about the row boats the sail boats the ponies
and other gifts and condemned his parent for this one failure to gratify his
wishes

   the threat which he had used in the house came to his mind before he
reached the street as he thought of it he was confident that the rival house
would be willing to hear him spurred on by this sudden impulse without
considering that he was plotting treason which his father could never forgive
he hastened to the onongo mill

   dolph happened to meet mr barkpool going from the factory to his house
the magnate stopped and looked at him for he had never seen one of the
singerlay family in that part of the town before dolph had covered his
face with smiles for he had a point to carry

   the magnate could not help feeling indignant at what he regarded as the
impudence of the young man in putting on a smiling face in his presence

    good evening mr singerlay he said somewhat scornfully intending
to thorn the visitor a little for his presumption in coming upon his territory

  you do not often do us the honor of coming to this neighborhood  

     no sir  but i have a little business with you replied dolph who was
not lacking in impudence

    business with me   exclaimed the great man

    but i have  i told my father that i should apply to you if he refused
to grant my request continued the scion of the house of singerlay


the eunkel mystery

   and what was your request   asked the head of the other house open-
ing his eyes very wide

     let me explain what led me to make it it costs a great deal of money
to bring coal here for the use of the mills in the dry time

    that is as true as preaching  and it costs just as much to bring in our
material and carry out our goods we should have had a railroad before
this time if your father had been fair and reasonable replied mr barkpool
with a frown

    my father say the same thing in regard to you but i dont want to
talk about that matter replied dolpli pleased to find that the rival had
listened to him so far   i want to show you how you can bring in coal and
stock and send out goods as well as transport passengers both ways at less
cost than by rail  

    you want to show me   exclaimed the magnate laughing heartily at
the assumption of the boy in proposing to show him anything  but go on 
i am willing to be shown

    i knew you would be  and of course my father would kill me if he
knew that i was giving you these points

    well mr singerlay i am willing to believe that you are a bigger man
than your father  but if you are in danger i dont ask you to sacrifice your
valuable life for me chuckled the magnate

    my father refused to hear me and refused to grant my request  and
now that i give you the points it is on account of his folly his blunder his
weakness continued dolph not a little inflated by the consciousness of his
own importance

    thats quite true  your father will be the victim of his own weakness
as he has been many times before replied the mill owner greatly amused
at the manner in which the young man rode his high horse   but let me
have the points you are talking about if you please for my supper must be
about ready

      all your coal and stock has to be carted five miles from the railroad 
and father says it costs about as much to cart it as to convey it from the mines
to the station continued dolph very earnestly

    your father is about right for once

      there is another railroad at the north end of the lake which is not used
at all by the people of montoban i propose to buy a steamer- and several
barges or canal boats dolph proceeded

    then you are after a steamer  and so is phineas interposed the mag-
nate impatiently  i refused to buy one fof him and i dont think i shall
buy one for you

      but this is business and not play  

    well now i will think of it and let you know what i decide replied
mr barkpool

    let me give you the details of the plan i have in mind   suggested
dolph insinuatingly

    i dont want to hear any more about it i should have to load the coal
from the boat and cart it up here  and i might as well haul it from the sta-
the bunkel mystery



tion said the mill owner disgusted with the plan and leaving the advocate
of the new method of transportation

   dolph was as mad as he was when his father refused his request

chapter xvi-the vault of the onongo bank

   dolph went home angry from the sole of his foot to the crown of his
head-angry with both of the magnates though one of them was his father
he had a brilliant business idea and neither of them would listen to him
of the two he was the more angry with mr barkpool for he had humiliated
himself in going to his fathers enemy

   he was inclined to punish both of the great men and he decided to begin
with the onongo magnate an old scheme which he had fostered into being
iii the fall came to his mind again he went on board of the dragon to
think it over he ate his supper on the remnants of a lunch he had carried
with him the day before

   there was rather more water than usual coming down the river this sum-
mer and there might be no drought though the stream had failed the mills
nearly every year before there might be no dry time this season  and the
onongo could draw upon the reservoir it was necessary to create a demand
for coal and neither of the mills had taken in its usual supply

   dolph left the dragon when he had finished his meal he crossed the
river on the bridge and walked to the upper dam as soon as it was dark
he recrossed the river on a foot bridge a short distance above and crept
cautiously to the brick spring house he pried off the hasp by which the
padlock secured the door

   with a great deal of hard work for a fellow who was not used to it he
conveyed several kegs of the blasting powder to the dam he had studied
up his plot before and found the crevice in which the powder was to be
placed and he laid his mine with no little skill

   he had taken a supply of match paper and when he had lighted it he
made a hasty retreat of course it was only by a miracle that he did not
blow himself up when he had completed his preparations he started by
the road for home taking care that no one should see him before he
reached the bridge the explosion took place

   he was startled when he heard the thunder of his own work but he could
not see what executioli the powder had caused in a moment more he heard
the roar of the rushing waters and then he knew that the mine had success-
fully accomplished the mischievous result the river roared with a sound
like thunder and seemed to be tearing everything away before it

   he stopped on the bank of the stream a short distance above the bridge
and concealed himself in the bushes where he could see the uproar which he
had caused he had hardly taken this position before another crash saluted
his ears

   the lower dam had been carried away this was more than he had bar-
gained for or plotted to accomplish he had punished both of the magnates
at the same time for refusing to listen to his magnificent steamboat scheme
s

the bunkel mystery

dolph was a philosopher in a wicked way and he could only say that it had
served them right

   both mills would now be in want of coal  and he thought that one of
them would soon see the advantage of his plan but dolph was unreason-
ably impatient and he did not want to wait till the mill owners realized the
need of his means of transportation

   he was impatient for another reason the steamer he wished to purchase
might be sold to some other person and to make sure of it he must buy it
the very next day the outlet of lake montoban was the bondego river
into which flowed a stream from another pond named modogo lake the
steamer had plied on this lake but she did not pay

   she was offered for sale at half her cost or less no purchaser appeared
and the owner had visited montoban to effect a sale people laughed at him
for it was not supposed that the craft could be brought over the bondego
rapids though the owner insisted that it would be an easy matter

   dolph had examined the rapids for himself and was of the owners
opinion though he talked just the other way to prevent any other person
from investing in the lily as the boat was called there was no interest in
boating in montoban and no one cared to see a steam craft on the lake

   as soon as the crowd had gathered on the bridge dolph mingled with it
and finally got home without being observed he did not even notice that
the dragon and the diana had been swept from their moorings by the sudden
accession of water to the lake

   he was not pleased to meet andy and his father in the hall but he tried
to cover up his tracks in his room when he had changed his clothes he
sat down to think over the situation he was no nearer to getting the lily
than he had been before he blew up the dam but in the evening when his
father handed him the bank keys the means of raising the money for the
purchase of the steamer was suggested to him and he wondered he had not
thought of   borrowing  the necessary amount from the bank before

   unfortunately the owner of the lily had talked to phin barkpool about
the boat he had applied to several persons including mr singerlay with-
out success  and he wanted to interest the sons of the two rich men he
had not only interested them but he had infatuated them both

   mr barkpool said no more to his son about the steamer and he did not
tell him of the visit of dolph for it would only make the boy more crazy to
obtain the coveted craft phin did not say so but he vas not sorry the dam
had been blown up  not that he expected to derive any advantage from the
disaster but he thought his father deserved to be chastened for refusing his
reasonable request

   among those who called to see the onongo magnate after the catastrophe
was mr pullerton the cashier of the onongo bank he was not required to
bring the keys to the house of the president but his presence suggested to
phin a way to get the large sum of money he wanted he knew all about
this bank as dolph knew about the other it was easy enough to get into
the building and into the banking room the trouble would be to get into
the vault
the bunkel mystery



    by the way mr barkpool this disaster reminds me that another might
occur and i have brought the set of duplicate keys of the vault with me
said mr pullerton when the explosion had been discussed

    i dont understand you replied the magnate  what other disaster
might occur   

   if my house should be burned some night and the ordinary keys
should be rendered useless it would be better to have the duplicates in some
other place for they might be lost we should have to send a hundred
miles to get any one to open the vault replied the cashier

    you are right mr pullerton though i hope your house will not be
burned down added the magnate as he took the keys

   phin wondered if he had not by some special inspiration brought the
keys to him for use that night he had listened with intense eagerness to
the conversation and when he saw his father take the keys he considered
the question of the purchase of the steamer settled he watched his father
till he saw him put them in a drawer

   mr barkpool was busy thinking of something else and he gave very
little attention to the keys or to the call of the cashier the dam was gone
and though he had an engine and coal enough to run it for a few days he
had no engineer  he had just discharged him

   he was sure that some enemy had blown up the dam in the interests of sin-
gerlay and though it was some consolation to know the other dam had also been
destroyed the only thing that would satisfy him was to have his mill running
the next morning as usual such a triumph was worth some humiliation
and he started at once for the cottage of morgan lamb

   as soon as he was at home after his failure to engage the engineer he
was in a state of great excitement and he drank more whisky than was good
for him in his efforts to quiet his nerves the liquor made him sleepy and
he went to bed he dropped into a deep slumber at once phin who had
retired dressed himself and obtained the keys for his father had not thought
of them again he went to the bank opened it and lighted a lamp

    with the keys in his possession he had no difficulty in opening the vault
and taking the lamp inside he closed the door he had hardly begun his
search for the bank bills before he was startled by a noise in the banking
room but he concluded that it had been made by a rat or by the wind
rattling the windows and he resumed his search

   he found the drawer which contained the bills and he had begun to take
some of them out when the door was thrown open and a man sprang upon
him he tried to scream but his assailant stuffed a handkerchief into his
mouth in another minute he saw the barrels of a revolver confronting
him and then a man tied his hands behind him and fastened him to the
bottom of a post in the room

chapter xvii-dolph makes a liberal proposition

   dolph singerlay thought he was in a tight place when he found himself
on the floor in the bank with one man holding him by the throat and an-
io

the bunkel mystery

other pointing a pistol at his head he could not even say that he would
submit or beg his assailants not to kill him he did not feel much like buy-
ing a steamer just then and the lily was likely to remain for the present on
the waters of lake modogo

   it was plain enough to dolph as soon as he was in condition to have any-
thing plain to him that the montoban bank was in the possession of a couple
of bank robbers they were not amateurs like himself for they did their
business thoroughly as they went along

   it goes without saying that dolph was sorry he had undertaken the job
for he had already made a failure of it  and he would have been content to
do without any steamer if he could only get out of the scrape

   he could see now that he had shaken the bush while others were to
gather the fruit in other words he had been kind enough to save the rob-
bers the trouble of blowing up the lock of the vault for he had brought the
keys and opened it for them of course they were very much obliged to
him though they did not take the trouble to say so

   but they did not kill him as he thought at first they intended to do
the sight of the revolver within a foot of his head had thoroughly subdued
him and he did not appear at all like the young fellow who had been so
overbearing and saucy to his father the two robbers after they had tied
his hands behind him took no further notice of him but returned to the
vault in the contents of which they had more interest than in him

   as soon as they were at a convenient distance from him dolph began to
feel better one of the robbers had a dark lantern attached to his belt which
he closed as soon as the prisoner was secured and the room was as black as
a load of charcoal the prisoner raised his head when he felt like himself
and looked around him

   he had been left on the floor and there was nothing to prevent him from
getting up if he could do so with his arms tied behind him he could see
nothing but a faint light in the vault for the operators had partly closed the
doors dolph rolled his body a little way and then thought he could get
up  at any rate he decided to make the attempt it was not an easy thing
to rise from the floor when bound as he was as any one may know by
trying it

   it required a struggle and he made some noise by hitting the leg of a
table one of the robbers came out of the vault with dolphs lantern in his
hand when he saw that the prisoner had changed his position and was
trying to get up he gave him a kick which hurt

    dont you move agin  if you do ill break every bone in your car-
cass   said the robber

    what are you about tom   demanded the man remaining in the vault
in a loud and earnest whisper

   hes tryin to git away poddy replied the one who had kicked
dolph

   douse that glim and dont speak a word said the man it now
appeared that the other was only a boy of good growth

   poddy as the one in the room called his companion gave no further at-
the bunkel mystery

ir

tention to the prisoner or to his associate he had found the drawer which
contained the money and he was very busy in transferring the bills to a
leather bag he had brought with him this task was completed in a few
minutes and then he searched the vault for anything he had overlooked

    he found nothing he wanted outside of the drawer  but the large pack-
ages of bills labeled with big figures which he found in the tills seemed to
satisfy him there were plenty of papers perhaps bonds but he would not
bother with them for they were liable to lead to the detection of the robbers

    he closed the bag hastily and then left the vault he closed and locked
the double doors of the strong room and put the keys in his pocket then
he went to the rear room and closed the window by which he had entered
and put everything in the condition in which he had found it

   when poddy spoke to his companion and called him tom dolph
had a glimmer of light  and the second time the latter spoke he had no
difficulty in recognizing the voice of the chief of the hoodlums the one
who had kicked him was tom sawder without a doubt

    poddy was in a hurry and taking dolph by the collar of his coat he
assisted him to rise then he led him to the door carefully closing the gate
that was at the end of the counter at the door he halted and opened his
dark lantern so that the prisoner could see the revolver which he pointed at
his head

     i want you to understand that i will put a bullet through your head if
you attempt to get away said he in a loud whisper  we wont hurt you
if you keep still and do as you are told  and when we are done with you we
will let ou go that is all  but we will make short work with you if you
give us any trouble

     i wont give you any trouble replied dolph

    you had better not added poddy impressively

    i should like to make a trade with you continued dolph who had
by this time recovered his self possession and even his wickedness if he had
lost the latter for the moment

    say quick  what do you mean   demanded poddy evidently in-
terested in spite of his hurry

   i was going to borrow three thousand dollars of the bank for some-
thing my fathers owns most of the stock so that it was the same as bor-
rowing it of him only he would not lend me the money   dolph proceeded
to explain

    short stories    exclaimed the robber

    you have got all the money from the bank now if you will lend me
three thousand dollars of it i will take the keys back to my fathers room
and nobody will know that you have been here till the cashier misses the
cash in the morning added dolph who thought in himself that this would
be a brilliant stroke of business if the principal burglar would agree to it

    i wont trust you replied poddy after a little hesitation which
showed that he was favorably impressed by the proposition

    then i will keep the keys in my room and my father will think i robbed
the bank and they will not look for you argued dolph


the bunkel mystery

   poddy was silent for a moment  and possibly he would have consented
to adopt the plan if he had not had other business on his hands

    i wont trust you   he exclaimed at last  in this business we dont
trust any one  

   the robber had made up his mind and he did not allow dolph to argue
the point any further for he took him by the collar and led him down the
stairs repeating his warning as he did so

   dolph was disappointed for when he had recovered his self possession
and with it his evil intentions he began to hope he might yet become the
owner of the lily poddy meant business and it was useless to attempt any
resistance the man held him by the collar for he did not wish to fire the
revolver in the deserted street lest the report should people it with awakened
citizens

   tom sawder held his tongue and appeared to be nothing but a super-
numerary in the operations of the night for if he attempted to speak he was
promptly silenced by his companion dolph noted the route taken by his
conductor but he was afraid to open his mouth even to utter a whisper he
divined the destination of the robbers and wras confirmed in his belief when
they halted at the onongo bank

   like the montoban the bank was in the second story with the entrance
at the side of a store poddy placed his prisoner at the side of this door and
took a lot of brass keys from his pocket when he took hold of the knob
in order to insert the key which he had probably fitted beforehand he found
that the door was not locked

    take hold of that cub tom  he may run away while we are busy
said poddy  this door is not locked  what does it mean  

   but the principal did not wait for the question to be answered he opened
the door and tom led dolph into the lower entry they tied him to the
stair rail and went up poddy took off his shoes and led the way

   as he entered the room he was surprised to see a light

chapter xviii-a remarkable duplicate operation

   dolph was glad to be left alone though his arms were tied behind him
and he was fastened to the stair rail he had made a liberal proposition to
the chief burglar  but his coming to the onongo bank explained why he
had declined it poddy was no small operator and he was not satisfied with
the funds of one institution he did business by wholesale

   dolph was rather pleased than otherwise at the impartiality of the robbers
in serving both banks alike if they crippled one magnate they extended
the same treatment to the other but he did not give much attention to this
viewr of the situation for he was moved by more personal and selfish con-
siderations he was a prisoner and he wanted to get out of the scrape

   if he could not get the three thousand dollars he wanted he did not care
to have his father deprived of the use of his large deposit just as he had to
build a new dam he wished to get away just then more than he wished
anything else in this world
the bunkel mystery

i

   he strained the cords that bound his arms to their utmost tension but he
could not break them he pulled and twisted till the stair rail creaked and
snapped but nothing gave way if he could only get loose he might save
the money of the bank and put a feather in his cap by the operation

   while he was jerking and squirming within his bonds the two robbers
went up stairs and discovered the light if they had been astonished to see a
glimmer in the vault of the other bank they were doubly surprised to see
the same thing again in the onongo poddy seemed to be alarmed though
it had been a robber like himself before he could not believe in meeting with
the same adventure a second time in the same night

   he could not have found such an event in any other place in the coun-
try-for two such magnates diligently laboring to spoil their only sons could
be realized only in moutoban a boy might cry for the moon but there
could not be two of them to rob a bank for a steamboat

   poddy was so astonished that he halted at the door for some time before
he could decide to advance it could not be an amateur robber who was in-
vestigating the vault of the bank this time he set it down as an impossi-
bility it must be the cashier or some other officer who was counting his
cash or making up his accounts

   whether poddys time was worth anything or not he decided not to waste
any of it if it was the cashier who was in the vault so much the worse for
him and he had better have gone to bed at his usual hour the robber had
not used days and weeks in preparing for this job to give it up without an
effort even if it cost the cashier a broken head or even his life

   the chief operator looked into the vault and then called tom who sur-
veyed the interior ofthe strong box for a moment

   it is phin barkpool   said tom sawder as soon as he had seen
enough of the young mans face to satisfy him in regard to his identity

   toms fists were clinched and his teeth were set together for he con-
nected phin with his rebellious passenger in the milly as he did not hear
what had passed between them before andy lamb went to the assistance of
di singerla

   poddy did not wait to hear any more he entered the vault and laid
violent hands on phin and secured him as he had the other magnates son
then he entered the vault again and transferred all the money he could find
to his bag he looked with contempt upon bonds and other securities so
that his work was soon finished

   he closed the bag which had probably never contained so much money
before for the montoban had yielded a very rich harvest

   you may take this cub tom and i will attend to the other said
poddy as he joined his companion after locking the vault the keys of which
he found at the inner door

   tom removed the cord which bound phin to the bottom of the post and
assisted him to his feet he handled him very roughly for the bitterness of
the afternoon quarrel was still rankling in his breast he jerked and kicked
him when there was not the least need of doing so for the prisoner was quite
submissive and was not thinking of buying a steamboat just then

      
i

the bunkel mystery

     none of that tom   interposed his more gentlemanl associate as lie
saw him kick his victim  if you kick him again i will give you some of
the same sauce

     i owe him a thrashing and im gon to give it to him muttered the
hoodlum

    what for asked poddy who did not seem to be in so much of a
hurry as he had been for doubtless he felt that the work of the night was
substantially finished

    he was with andy lamb when-

     shut up tom  you are a mule  and you have no inore sense than a
one legged donkey   interposed poddy  phin was not willing to let andy
help the girl for i heard all that passed between them andy jumped on
board of the girls boat in spite of him

     thats so added phin deeming it wise to keep on good terms with
his persecutors  andys father was discharged from his place because he
took his sons part against me

    i didnt know that replied tom appeased by what he had heard
 but when i ketch andy lamb ill bet there will be music

     drop that now tom   said poddy  lead him down the stairs and
see that the other cub is all right  

    tom obeyed the order while his superior locked the door of the room
dolph had labored in vain to break his bonds he had removed not a little
of the cuticle from his arms and wrenched his back in his struggles  but he
had accomplished nothing when he saw tom sawder coining down the
stairs with phin barkpool he did not know what to make of it

   disappointment gave way to wonder and overwhelming astonishment in
the mind of the first prisoner when he saw the second the situation was
beyond his comprehension phin was coming down the stairs from the
banking room and he must have been captured there how came he in the
bank at this hour of the night 

   poddy gave him no time to consider the matter for he untied him at
once putting all the cords back into his side pocket the entry was lighted
by his dark lantern which he had opened when he came out of the apart-
ment above then he stopped and began to feel about his clothes and look
on the floor as he had done when he left the upper story

   what you lost poddy asked tom and he waited for the other to
leave the building

    lam only looking to see that i have not lost anything replied poddy
as he continued his examination   in this business i am careful not to
leave anything behind for detectives and constables to work upon  and i want
you to do the same

   tom looked at his ragged habiliments but he could hardly have told
whether or hot he had lost a rag or a button poddy took dolph by the
collar after he had warned him of the peril of attempting to escape and
marchedhim into the street while tom followed with phin in a couple of
minutes they came to the mouth of rockrib creek for the onongo bank was
on this side of the town
the bunkel mystery

i

   near the place where the milly was moored they came to a row boat
which neither dolpli nor phin had ever seen before the prisoners were seated
in it and tom took his place at the oars  but as soon as the boat was a
couple of rods from the shore poddy told him to cease rowing then he
untied the cords which confined dolph and directed tom to do the same
with phin

    i dont mean to hurt you youngsters and i want you to be as comfort-
able as possible now that we are out of danger said poddy

   i am much obliged to you  but i thought you were going to let me
go home as soon as you had finished the job replied dolph who was will-
ing to admit that the chief robber was a very gentlemanly rascal

    not yet my lad  it would not be prudent for us to let you go now
we might get bagged and it would break your heart to see us sent up for
twenty years

   tom took the oars again at poddys order

chapter xix-on the way to bunked island

   tom sawder took the oars but he was not inclined to use them it
was about one oclock in the morning when they left the last bank and the
hoodlum gaped fearfully when the excitement of the capture and robbery
had subsided he had been on his feet all the day before working hard
most of the time and he was tired

    i dont want to row all the way back to bunkel said he in a whining
tone  i aint used to bein up all night and im jest about tuckered out

     i will row a part of the way as soon as we get a little farther from the
town replied poddy

    why dont you take my sailboat there is a good wind suggested
phin barkpool

    that would be an easy way to do it  but the boat at the island might
serve us a bad turn if any one found it there said poddy

    you will not want me after we get to the island and i will sail her
back phin proposed

    pull away tom added the chief  we dont want to stop here all
night 

    cant we take the sail boat  asked the hoodlum

    no we cant  and if you dont use those oars i will throw you
overboard   

    i will take the boat back so that it wont do you any harm persisted
phin

    i will help him added dolpli

   you are very kind and willing to make yourselves useful but if i
accepted your offer i should expect a visit from the policemen of montoban
before daylight in the morning replied poddy the big haul he had made
at the two banks evidently made him more good natured than his asso-
ciate

    but i will agree not to say a word protested phin
	the bunkel mystery

     so will i added dolpli

     i will not trust you answered poddy decidedly

     i shall go directly home and go to bed i will put the keys back in the
drawer where i found them and i will promise on my word and honor not
to open my mouth pleaded phin

    i will put the keys of our bank on the table at the head of my
fathers bed where he keeps them nights and swear not to lisp a syllable
added dolph

     i wont do it repeated poddy

    but we shall be missed in the morning and my father will turn the
world upside down before breakfast time and he will find you if you are any-
where on the habitable globe  argued dolph as earnestly as a lawyer making
a special plea

   thats just what my father will do added phin  he will have a
dozen detectiveshere from new york city and they will be sure to find

you

     i see that you are trying to scare me my dear young friends replied
poddy jocosely  but i dont feel faint yet you dont stipulate for the
three thousand dollars you wanted when you made the offer to the bank mr
singerlay 

     but i should like it all the same said dolph  you have done a big
job tonight and i think you might lend me the money without missing it

    mr barkpool would want another three thousand chuckled the
robber  six thousand dollars would make a big hole in my hard earnings
and i dont think i could afford to make such a sacrifice

     it would postpone the search for you till nine oclock or later and
that would enable you to get out of the way of the policemen reasoned
dolph

     but we dont want to get away my little joker

    you dont want to get away 

     not at present

     what are you going to do then  asked the puzzled prisoner

    	 i should certainly be caught if i showed myself at any time within the
next three days said poddy with a laugh

     you have got to get rid of me some time  and it will be just as danger-
ous three days from now as it will at the present time continued dolph
who was not willing to give up his point

     i see that you are a lawyer mr singerlay  but if it is all the same to
you i will manage this case myself i dont want to damage your self
esteem but i am forced to say that i have no confidence in your good inten-
tions 

    i cant row any more poddy  im used up an i aint no bettern a
bullfrog in a kittle of biling water said tom sawder breaking in upon the
argument  these fellers aint doin nothin whats the reason they cant
do some of the hard work   

    well they dont come in for a share of the swag and i suppose they
wont feel much like assisting us in the work suggested poddy in his jocose
the bunkel mystery

i

way  i have to give you a thousand dollars of the money tom  and you
must earn your share  

    a thousand dollars   exclaimed tom dropping the oars and springing
to his feet at the risk of upsetting the light boat in which they were making
the trip to the island dont you mean to give me moren a thousand
dollars ben podgate  

   shut up tom  replied the chief in a tone that was almost savage
it was clear that there were claws beneath the velvety paws he had been
using

   the hoodlum had used a name which had not been heard before by
the prisoners  and this appeared to have roused the anger of the profes-
sional robber who was managing the affair for tom stammered out that he
forgot the assistant was sorry that he had used the name  but his regret
did not appease his wrath at the mention of the share he was to receive of the
plunder

    dont you mean to give me moren a thousand   repeated tom but
this time without using any name

    thats more than you have earned answered poddy in a surly tone

    i wont stand it   protested tom  if thats all im to have i dont
do nothin more

    if you dont pick up the oars you will not get anything added poddjt
sternly

    i wont do nothin more till i know how much im gon to have of the
swag ive been workin like a dog for a week gettin things ready  and
now you are gon to put me off with a thousand dollars i wont stand it 

   if you dont take the oars you will sleep the rest of the night on
the bottom of the lake  and you will have time enough then to rest your-
self added poddy as he took a revolver from his pocket and pointed it at
his rebel associate

   do you mean to shoot me demanded tom as he picked up the
oars

    i would shoot you as quick as i would a mad dog if you dont mind
now pull away and dont open your ugty mouth again

   tom sawder could not stand up against this kind of discipline and he re-
newed his labors at the oars the chief was not in a pleasant frame of mind
though he had easily carried his point the prisoners were not inclined to
say anything under these circumstances  poddy was apparently as ready to
shoot a man as he was to rob a bank silence prevailed for a short time and
then the leader appeared to have recovered his good natured mood

    i suppose you are tired tom  and perhaps these young gentlemen
would like a little exercise as i am sure they are skilful oarsmen said he
when the hoodlums powers seemed to be failing him

    i am willing to row for one  but i should like a share of the swag as
you call it added dolph

    so am i on the same terms said pi

   both of them still had a vision of a steamboat floating in their imagina-
tions


a weird interval

     without terms or conditions i should be glad to have you take the
oars  otherwise i will do the rowing myself answered poddy as pleasantly
as ever

     very well i will take the stroke oar and leave the terms to your good
will replied dolph as he took his place

   phin followed his example with the same remark it -was the first time
the sons of the magnates had ever been in the same boat  but they pulled
well together

    i have another offer to make continued dolph without suspending
his work  i am sure you will accept this one mr poddy

    poddy was willing to hear it

                                                                    oliver optic

to be continued

a weird interval

the strange derangement of identity that caused dr cadwalader deep anxiety-only a boyish
memory in a mans mind-the chance incident that applied the needed remedy

r cadwalader had been an exile from his native land for eight
years one might imagine from the joy which possessed him now
that the eucania was bearing him home again with almost the speed of an
express train that this exile had been spent in that dismal spot with which
the word invariably associates itself-siberia but far from this being the
case his term of banishment had been passed in no more dreary a retreat
than paris where he had built up for himself a splendid practice in the
american colony now he had snatched a two months vacation during the
early spring to come back to the united states to be married

   oh no he would not have to hunt up a wife after his arrival edna
deering had promised to be his bride eight years before when he an impa-
tient youth of twenty had asked the blushing girl of sixteen if she would
be content to wait for him

     dear will she had whispered back  i will be content to wait all my
life for you

   and cadwalader loved to think of her as she looked then he carried
her photograph away with him and during all these years of separation had
asked for no other

    eet us think of each other he wrote  as we were when we parted
not as time may have changed us and made us seem strange each to the
other

   and so edna in her turn gazed each night the last thing before retiring
on the portrait of the handsome beardless youth from whom she was sepa-
rated by three thousand miles of sea

   and now will was coming home to surprise her he had written that
he would come by the paris in april the month that had been set for the
wedding thinking that it might be possible for him to get away in march
he had said nothing of it fearing to disappoint her after all  but when mat-

ters finally turned out so that he could leave he packed up in one night took
the fastest steamer afloat and was now nearly at his journeys end

    what delicious fun he kept telling himself  to walk in on them-
send up some other name and then see if she knows me  

   he mingled little with the few passengers on board his happy anticipa-
tions were the best of company he decided he sometimes chatted on deck
with miss orton from buffalo who sat next him at table one morning he
was explaining to her how to mark her chart of the ships speed and he
caught her looking at him with a curious expression as he announced with a
little triumphant ring in his tones that there remained less than five hundred
miles for them to cover

    you are very anxious to get across mr cadwalader she said lifting
her eyes suddenly to look at him

   he blushed in spite of himself and miss orton laughed

   cadwalader wondered if she had guessed his secret

   but it didnt matter he told himself he should probably never see her
again

   long afterward he wondered if things would have turned out differently
if he had not seen her again

   there was of course nobody to meet him at the pier he had been an
orphan for many years and the uncle with whom he lived up to the time of
his departure for europe had since died so when he reached new york
there was nothing to detain him there for the deerings had long since moved
to peekskill and leaving his trunks in temporary storage cadwalader
started for peekskill within three hours after the lucania had landed him at
her pier

   the train was due at peekskill at eight fifteen he had snatched a little
supper before leaving he would arrive at the house just about the time
one might be expected to make an ordinary evening call what name should
he send in he asked himself anderson he decided would do that was
his middle name the same as his cousin now in chicago who had called on
edna sometimes in the old days

   and edna would be twenty four now  he could not realize it he
found it impossible to make himself think of her in any other light than the
fairy-like creature in the earliest spring time of beautiful womanhood but
that he would love her more fondly if that were possible in the new environ-
ment than in the old he had no manner of doubt he was hungering now
for a sight of her face more fiercely it seemed to him than at any time since
he had gone away eight years before the train appeared to go very slowly
for an express ah now it had come to a stop 

   cadwalader rose from his comfortable position in the revolving chair and
strolled to the rear door the brakeman was just leaving the platform with
his red lantern to signal that the train was blocked

    whats the matter cadwalader asked him

   but the man hurried off pretending not to hear he was well drilled in
his duty toward the company cadwalader noticed that there was a curve just
behind them he stood watching the swaying light as the flagman carried

it away from him until it had disappeared around the bend then a half
sign of relief escaped him

    it would be too hard to go down in sight of port he told himself with
a sort of smile at the idea of such somber thoughts suggesting themselves
then he turned and walked toward the other end of the car two or three
gentlemen were standing by the further door

    the tarrytown accommodation has broken down ahead of us one of
them explained

   cadwalader chafed at the delay if it made them over half an hour late
he was afraid he would not be able to get to the deerings that night it
would scarcely do he reflected to present himself after nine oclock

   he went out on the platform and thence to the ground he crossed over
the down track and stood for a moment by the edge of the hudson

   the waves raised by the gusty west wind beat noisily against the stone
embankment and now and then the spray dashed up into his face he had
not yet quite got his  sea legs off and decided that it would be safer as
well as more comfortable in the car he had brought a novel with him 
now that there was no motion he could read without discomfort to his eyes

   he returned to his seat and as he settled himself back with his head
resting on the plush he thought with a sense of security that he was glad he
had seen that brakeman go back with his lantern

   he opened his book and began to read the story which he had picked
up hap hazard on the news stand in the waiting room at the grand central
seemed singularly appropriate it opened with the return of the lover after
a years absence he rings the bell at the home of the betrothed inquires
for her and the servant looks blank

     she has- 

   cadwalader never read any further than that a crash sounded in his
ears and then he was conscious of no other sensation until he heard a canary
bird singing

   he held his eyes closed for an instant longer to take in to the fullest
extent the exquisite melody then the song suddenly ceased and the young
man looked about him

   all was strange he was in bed but where he knew not and what
was stranger still this ignorance seemed to cause him no concern he lay
there blissfully enjoying the comfort of the couch and watching with the
interest of a child the flickering sunshine as it came through the bowed
shutters and disported itself in fantastic shapes on the wall paper

   he heard the murmur of voices in another room they were very soft
sweet voices he wondered if it could be his mother and cousin kate talk-
ing he remembered now what had happened to him to give him this sort
of stunned sensation in the back of his head the great bob sled he and his
chum harry clark had built had run into alonzo petermans farm
wagon and he will must have been pretty badly hurt but this house
didnt seem like home perhaps though the doctors had thought it danger-
ous to have him moved far and he had been carried into a neighbors

   he had just arrived at this conclusion when the murmur of voices in the
a weird interval



other room ceased and some one came into the apartment where he lay he
kept his eyes fastened on her as she approached the bed he thought she
was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen and yet she was a
stranger to him he wrinkled his brow in a frown trying to place her

   she noticed the movement and hurried forward with the question   are
you in pain  

   he shook his head and looked up into her face with a smile on his own

   you are looking much better today she said wont you let me
feel your pulse   

   he drew his left hand out from under the bed clothes a thrill went
through him when she took his wrist between her dainty fingers

   yes very encouraging she responded

   she relaxed the clasp and in his weak state his hand dropped chancing
to brush close by his face in doing so he felt something strange he
lifted his hand again and passed it across his upper lip covered by his blond
mustache

   a look of perplexity of horror almost came into his eyes he gave a
sort of groan dropped his hand and great beads of perspiration came out on
his forehead his poor brain twisted all askew by the blow on the head he had
received in the collision was at sea again he thought he had placed him-
self right in putting himself back in boyhood he could remember nothing
beyond that point had he lost his own identity entirely and was he not
will cadwalader at all

   he made mighty effort of mind to comprehend the mystery but it was
too deep for him he raised himself in the bed for an instant gave a look
around the room then an agonized pleading one into the face of her who
stood by his side and fell back on the pillow again in a swoon

   he was conscious that tender hands administered to him that the soft
sweet voice he had already heard spoke of him as   poor fellow  i wish that
we might help him and then he slept to wake again with a light burning
in the room and a young man sitting by the bedside and looking fixedly
at him

   good exclaimed the latter as cadwalader opened his eyes you
look bright and cheerful how do you feel   

    where am i   was the others only response to this he knitted his
brow thoughtfully and gazed fixedly at his questioner

   in my house dr raymonds in tarrytown

    tarrytown repeated cadwalader the look of perplexity deepening on
his face

    yes dont you remember the railroad accident you were hurt very
badly for days you were quite unconscious i had you brought straight
here  the hospital was full and-besides i was much interested in your case
i am a physician you know you remember now do you not 

    a railroad accident  repeated the other  ah perhaps you thought
it was the cars that did it we ran into alonzos wagon near the track and
harry  tell me was he hurt as badly as i was 

   then before the other could answer he went on the wild look coming


a weird interval

into his eyes   but you said that this was tarrytown and-and there is
this -he drew his finger swiftly across his mustache then put up his other
hand to feel the weeks growth of beard upon his chin- i cant under-
stand it merciful heaven i know not who i am  

    there be calm my dear boy it will all come back to jou in time
i will turn down the light now and go out that you may get some sleep

    but cadwalader did not sleep for hours after that he seemed like one who
while yet having a body endowed with breath and all the functions for living
was yet without a soul-that inner consciousness that tells a man who he is
and gives him a place in the community for now even the memory of his
own name had gone from him

    again and again he tried to recall the railroad accident of which he had
been told  but the only recollection he had of the cars was when he and
harry clark had gone to the adirondacks one summer and camped out if
he could only see harry perhaps all would come straight again but
tarrytown 

   that place was miles from home down by new york a city in which he
had never been oh it was all a horrible mystery a nightmare  perhaps
if he waited as the other had said the mist would clear away

   it was towards morning when he finally fell asleep  and when he woke
again it was to hear once more that bird singing and see the golden shafts of
the sun stealing into the room

    you will have some breakfast now i am sure

    cadwalader turned his head at the sound of the voice whose sweetness he
had already remarked she was arranging a tempting repast on a little table
by the bedside

     arthur says you may eat civilized food now she went on with a little
laugh  and give up gruels and all that

    who is arthur   asked cadwalader as he took the napkin she handed
him

    why my cousin the doctor was the answer  you feel a great deal
better today dont you  

   yes i think i do now that ive decided to wait patiently as your
cousin advised till memory comes back to me you cant tell me anything
about harry clark can you  

   the pretty head was shaken while a brief look of anxiety came into the
hazel eyes

     here is some honey made by arthurs own bees i am sure you will
like it 

    i believe you are afraid of me cadwalader began a moment or two
later but really i cant blame you he added if a man doesnt
know his own name other people have a right to be a little shy of him by
the way is there a hand mirror about here  perhaps if i took a look at it
myself it might help me you wont think me conceited will you 

     oh very she laughed and went off to get the glass

   cadwalader looked long and earnestly at his own reflection the sensa-
tion was the strangest he had ever experienced-that of locking at his own
a weird interval



countenance and finding it as the face of one whom he had never seen be-
fore

   tell me something about myself he saidas he handed the mirror
back  dont you know who i am 

   not yet replied the girl with her ready smile somebody had
robbed you while you lay helpless there in the wreck arthur does not even
know what station your ticket called for the conductor was killed you
know

   no i dont know cadwalader  rejoined softly tell me about it
wont you please  were any of the passengers killed too   

    yes eight or nine of them the brakeman got talking and let the
train he was to signal go by oh it was a dreadful thing 

    but it was very good in-in your cousin to bring me here-to his home
what made him do it just think what obligations he puts me under to
him and how am i ever to pay him back  i seem as helpless as an infant
 oh you mustnt worry about that broke in the other noting that the
patients forehead was beginning to wrinkle  the accident happened right
at the foot of our garden here it was thought unsafe to carry you far and
arthur already has his reward in your speedy recovery no no you mustnt
try to think so hard who you are it will all come back to you very soon
now  

    hasnt anybody inquired after me asked cadwalader  i ought to
send a telegram to my mother will you write one for me  

    yes indeed responded the fair nurse and she seated herself at the

escritoire in the corner  what shall i say mrs-

she held the pencil poised and looked over toward the bed questioniugly
 i cant remember her name nor the town i only recall harry clark
and alonzo peterman   cadwalader spoke very soberly then noting his
seriousness reflected in the face of his companion he added more cheerfully
 but i will pin my faith to your cousins opinion and wait

   and in spite of all these days of waiting were very pleasant ones dr
raymond was a charming fellow he would not permit his patient to worry
for one instant about his strange position in the household

    you have already repaid me to the full he would say  why there
are hundreds of physicians in the country who would give thousands of
dollars to have the opportunity i enjoy of studying at first hand a case as
peculiar as yours  

   with this assurance to make his mind easy cadwalader gave himself up
entirely to the task of getting well as speedily as possible dr raymond
provided him with clothing as soon as he was able to get up and though he
was still very weak-for his entire body had been subjected to a severe strain
-he could walk about the house from room to room and after a day or two
came down stairs to his meals

   the doctors wife he learned now had been called away by the serious
illness of her mother who lived at syracuse her cousin was keeping house
for him-cousin the doctor called her and cadwalader found himself
more and more dependent upon her when she was out in the morning to


a weird interval

market he was restless until she came back and when one morning he
entered the breakfast room and found her place vacant he inquired of the
doctor with great concern if his cousin was ill

   no she has gone home up the river was the reply

    and isnt she coming back  went on cadwalader anxiously

    yes but not just now my wife returns tonight and the doctors face
beamed

   cadwalader said but little during the remainder of the meal he was
thinking of how much he would miss  cousin

   it was a charming day-the first really warm one of the opening spring
when dr raymond started off to make his morning calls cadwalader went
out- into the garden and strolled reflectively up and down the garden paths
his eyes had a serious look in them and the lines across his forehead showed
dissatisfaction with something or somebody

    what a life this is to lead he was saying to himself  who am i and
where do i belong  perhaps i have a wife and children somewhere- 

   as this thought occurred to him he was conscious of a sharp twinge he
recollected her who had ministered to him so sweetly during the past week
could he feel drawn so closely to another as he was now to her  but he
might not be married the chances were all against it it seemed to him
he was now more eager than ever to regain full control of his mind the
very fact that he was beginning to feel the strangeness the ignominy of his
position so keenly gave him hope

   a robin alighting on a branch just over his head began to sing raptur-
ously cadwalader halted and attempted to recall where he had heard just
such bird song before but his memory would carry him no further back
than the canary at the raymonds whose notes were the first sounds that
seemed ever to have fallen on his ear

    its no use he muttered wearily as he moved on again and his limbs
which had appeared to be stronger when he first came out now gave signs of
weakness

   there was a bench at the lower end of the garden he tottered to this
and flung himself upon it just then a whistle sounded close at hand the
railroad as has been said ran past the foot of the raymond garden a train
from new york had just come in there was some delay on the track ahead
it slowed up and came to a standstill with one of the parlor cars just the other
side of the hedge

   cadwalader raised his head and looked languidly at first at the passengers
gazing from the windows all at once the languor left him  a strange in-
explicable expression flashed into his face he rose to his feet and began to
move toward the hedge his eyes fixed on a face at one of the car windows

   now she saw and recognized him it was miss orton she was bowing
and smiling trying to raise the heavy sash

   with a rush everything came back to cadwalader as if growing out of
her face the heavy saltish air of the sea seemed to be in his nostrils the
trembling of the mighty ship under his feet he remembered all now he
had come back to america from paris his name was-
a weird interval



     oh dr cadwalader   a gentleman had raised the window for miss
orton and she had called out the young doctors name just as he thought it
was possible he would recollect it himself

   he raised his hat and was about to speak wrhen the train moved on and
the next second was out of sight cadwalader stood there in the same posi-
tion looking after it it seemed to him as if he had just been born again
after death every fact connected with his last conscious moment as will
cadwalader came up distinctly in his mind

   and kdna 

   but with the thought of her the look of happiness left his face the
image that kept coming up in his brain when he pictured his betrothed was
always that of her whom he had first looked upon when returning conscious-
ness came to him he wished that he might see her now so that he could
tell her who he was and that-

   but no  he must never see her again  he wras afraid he could not
even bring himself to talk about her with edna

   he went back into the house and waited impatiently for dr ray-
monds return but at noon a message came from him stating that he had
been called out into the country and would not be home for dinner

   cadwalader determined not to wait for him he felt now that every hour
he remained in this house estranged him further from edna he wrote a
note to the doctor explaining how memory had returned to him and
announcing that he had gone to peekskill but would be back in a day or
two to return the clothes and so forth then he went off to the station and
telegraphed to new york for his trunks he thought of sending a message
to edna but recollecting that she could not have expected him yet decided
that he would surprise her but when he tried to imagine what form
of expression this surprise would take on her face it was always the face of
mrs raymonds cousin he saw

   and during the entire ride to peekskill this same face kept itself steadily
before his mental vision in vain he argued with himself on the absurdity
of being in love with a woman whose name he did not know by the time
he reached his destination he was utterly miserable-desperate almost

   mechanically he inquired of the station master how to reach the deering
residence then he went out and made his way into the town

   he had not far to go he saw mrs deering looking at him from an
upper window as he lifted the latch and entered the gateway he thought
it was strange that she did not throw up her hands wdth an exclamation of
surprise and hurry down to meet him then it came over him that of course
she did not recognize him with his mustache

    and edna he thought then  will her love inform her who it is

   again came the vision of that other face between must he always be
tortured like this

   but now the servant had opened the door and he asked if miss deering
was in no she was not

    mrs deering then cadwalader went on

   he was ushered into the parlor and sent up his name as he took his


bachelordom

seat by the window he looked out and saw dr raymonds cousin coming in
at the gate she saw him too and a strange look came into her face as she
hurried forward she opened the door and came into the parlor

    you are a friend of miss deerings then he said

   she had put out her hand and he had taken it with an eagerness he hoped
she did not notice

   at that instant mrs deering entered the room

    will my dear boy   she cried placing her arms about his neck

   there was a stifled cry and  dr raymonds cousin  clutched cadawal-
aders coat just in time to save herself from falling

    edna  he gasped as he caught her in his arms

          vt	vjv

	t	-t-	

    can you ever forgive me dear for falling in love with you believing
you to be somebody else

   cadwalader put the question an hour later after the major part of the ex-
planations had been gone over with

    can you do the same with me will was the softly whispered reply
 have you not guessed yet the reason i left arthurs so suddenly

   and in the ecstasy of that moment cadwalader felt that he was the hap-
piest man on earth

                         a dog a glass-

                           tis thus we pass

                       not worth the time to cage her

                         to   take   the town

a month in the moon

the marvelous experiences that grew out of the lunar company limited-how the catch-
penny scheme of three adventurers was transformed into an extraordinary
contribution to the world of science-scenes and incidents
of a sojourn on the earths satellite

synopsis of chapters previously published

    messrs gryphins vogel and wagner three adventurers in melbourne australia start
the lunar company for the conquest and exploration of the mineral riches of the moon

  but how are we to get to the moon   is the question asked by large numbers of stockholders
and at a public meeting wagner talks learnedly of a tubular tunnel but has his theory utterly
demolished by norbert mauny a young frenchman who declares that in order to complete such
a piece of work within the stipulated time of five years it must rise at the rate of  miles a
year 

    the assemblage is panic stricken and the stockholders demand their money back when
mauny calls for order and announces that he has a plan to propose-that of attracting the
moon to the earth by erecting a series of powerful magnets the idea is received with
enthusiasm and mauny is voted manager of the company the bayouda desert in the soudan
is selected as the site for the erection of the magnets the expedition sets out at suakim
mauny meets the french consul m kersain and his daughter gertrude who decide to ac-
company him on a visit to the mogaddem of rhadameh a local ruler whose favor must be
obtained before the transportation of the material across the desert can be made

    ibis mogaddem is a weird sort of personage and possesses a hideously ugly dwarf after
promising to pay certain large sums as tribute norbert secures the cooperation he desires and
soon after the return to the seaport the expedition sets out for the bayouda desert here the
observatories reflectors etc are erected on the peak of tehbali and work proceeds with grati-
fying success till messrs gryphins vogel and wagner are detected in a conspiracy to turn the
workmen against norbert they are imprisoned and a guard placed over them and then
norbert hearing that trouble threatens khartoum where m kersain has been transferred
determines to go thither and see if he cannot induce him and his daughter to take refuge at the
peak

    the consul refuses to leave his post but it is finally arranged that gertrude accompanied by
dr briet her uncle and fatima her maid set out with norbert for tehbali on the road they meet
a woman fig seller and shortly after eating some of her fruit a deep sleep falls on all members
of the party on awaking gertrude discovers that she is in a strange but beautiful apartment
with only fatima who sleeps near her but presently the hideous dwarf of the mogaddem of
rhadameh presents himself and offers his hand in marriage failing in this he resolves to
march with the forces he possesses on the peak taking the prisoners with him and there de-
stroy before their very eyes the work on which mauny has built such high hopes but it turns
out that the men employed by the young astronomer and those in the service of the dwarf come
from the same country and they refuse to fight against one another kaddour is taken captive
and placed in charge of virgil maunys right hand man discovered in an attempt to win
away the allegiance of the negro guard he is condemned to be shot but swallows poison just
before the execution is to take place soon afterward the mahdis forces surround the peak and
call upon mauny to surrender which he stoutly refuses to do

    meantime the magnets are working splendidly and at length norbert sets in operation the
forces that in six days are to bring the moon down to the earth the satellite responds readily
and by the sixth day is so close and appears so immense that not only are the mahdis forces
utterly panic stricken but norberts party themselves are terrified

this story began in the february issue of the argosy the four back numbers will be
mailed to any address on receipt of  cents


a month in the moon

    sir bucephalus coghill one of the chief members of the company ventures to hint to the
young- astronomer that he thinks it would be safer for all hands if the experiment be stopped-
which mauny says can be done by simply touching two knobs-when the baronets valet tyrrel
smith in an agony of apprehension rushes to the tablet where the knobs controlling all the
motors are situated raises one and lowers another a fearful crash ensues and all are thrown
into insensibility

    when they come to again the astounding discovery is made that the whole mountain of
tehbali with the observatory and all that it contains has been transferred to the moon as
soon as he realizes what has happened norbert hastens to close and hermetically seal all the
windows in order that no air may escape as the moon being without atmosphere man cannot
breathe there however he provides respirators with which he and the baronet are enabled to
start out on an exploring trip they find that they cannot make any audible sounds and are
obliged to communicate with each other by means of note books

    a far more important discovery however is that of an opening into the crater of an extinct
volcano which has become filled with air from the earth in order to preserve as much of this
as possible for future use norbert hastens back to the observatory for help and tools leaving
sir bucephalus to gather together as many stones tjs he can for the barricade in the meantime
the whole party accompany the young astronomer on his return but the baronet has disappeared
and cannot be found

    on the return to the observatory the body of the dwarf is discovered exposed to view bv the
recent catastrophe and perceiving signs of life in it dr briet sets to work and soon has kaddour
restored to life he having forced himself into a state of catalepsy he is kindly treated by all
and sensibly melts under these influences

chapter xxxii-the history of kaddour

jittle by little the dwarf expanded in this atmosphere of benevolence

     but no one could draw a word from him except briet who rallied him
about his feats of magic

   then kaddour smiling faintly would condescend to answer in the same
strain as if speaking to another soothsayer on these occasions he often
evinced a marvelous amount of general knowledge they were all much
struck by this fact

    the fellow said briet  is a perfect mine of knowledge-a veritable
cyclopedia physics and chemistry physiology mathematics natural his-
tory medicines living languages military art-nothing comes amiss to him
and he seems to have gone to the bottom of everything i am always
wondering where he got it all and i long to ask him  but something or other
stops me

    that is only natural said gertrude   you only feel that after saving
the life of the poor wretch it would not become you to ask for his history in
return as it were

    thats it  but he added laughing it is not that only  i have a
vague presentiment that i might be regaled with a yarn did i venture to
ask 

   perhaps the doctor was right on this point anyhow notwithstanding
the change that had come over the dwarf there seemed to be a load upon
his mind preventing him from being at his ease

   a fortunate circumstance soon furnished the clue however talking
before kaddour at table about some iniquitous proceeding of wagner gry-
phius and vogel norbert said with more frankness and moderation 

     what a blesssing it is in the midst of our misfortunes not to have
those scoundrels with tis  
a month in the moon



         at these words kaddours eyes flamed he hesitated an instant then
      turning to norbert he said  will you allow me to ask you a question sir 
      it was the lirst time he had ever so spoken they all looked up

          most willingly answered norbert  pray ask

         if it is not indiscreet on my part pursued kaddour  i would know
      whether the parties you have just mentioned are your friends  

           what persons  wagner gryphins and vogel   

           especially the two last named said kaddour

           certainly not  they are by no means my friends

          but i thought stammered kaddour who seemed strangely upset- i
 thought they were your partners

          to a certain extent they were my partners indeed but they are above
      all things my sworn enemies who have omitted nothing that lay in their
      power to ruin my enterprise

        is it possible cried kaddour rising from his seat ah he
     continued  i understand it all now it was they who sent an arab to
     denounce your project to the mogaddem  what a fool i was not to see it
     before but added the dwarf suddenly stopping short and turning two
     flaming eyes on norbert- but do you not know all about these men whom
     you permitted to follow you to the soudan   

          i know nothing about them said norbert  they are chance associ-
      ates whom circumstances threw in my way i neither know nor care whence
      they came

          but it shall be my care to tell you who they are   cried kaddour
      whose emotion almost choked him  it matters very much to me for
      herein lies my sole excuse for the evil things i have done you and for the
      evil i would have done  this has been the only bar to my deep gratitude
      for all your goodness but how could i guess the truth   

          you know gryphins and vogel   asked the doctor

         do i know them  cried kaddour excitedly do i know the two
     villains who stole from me my share of earthly happiness and almost des-
     troyed my very form  do i know the butchers who for fifteen years tor-
     tured me in the most dreadful manner and made me the laughing stock of
     the world yes indeed i know them only too well  i hate them to such
     a point that i would give anything in the world to have them here were it
     only for one minute to pay them off for all they made me suffer  

         there was such a tone of rage in these words that it was impossible to
      listen to them without shuddering yet none of his hearers thought of
      remonstrating his grotesque exterior notwithstanding kaddour inspired
      more respect than compassion the common herd had seen in him a super-
      natural being on account of his pretended powers and more enlightened
      witnesses could not but acknowledge a superior intelligence in him even
      while they condemned his charlatanism

         for a moment kaddour was silent with emotion then he resumed 

           i do not suppose that it would interest you to hear the history of my
      life you would only pity me for my fearful wrongs and pity is as abhor-
      rent to me as contempt

                 j


a month in the moon

    they hastened to assure him of their deep sympathy with his sufferings 
and the doctor especially had the happy idea of laying stress upon his own
scientific curiosity this had the desired effect on kaddour who thus pro-
ceeded 

    you will be somewhat surprised to learn that i belong to the same nation
as yourselves-the french not that i have any decided proofs to give but
i have a vague recollection of having been called charles when i was quite
little i have never known my family name for parents country home
however humble that may have been were all stolen from me at once at
the outset of my miserable life i have a conviction however that i must
have been born in france from various little incidents and words caught up
here and there and long pondered in secret and from the fact that the
french language came naturally to me

      i must have been two or three years old when they carried me off one
day a traveling circus settled down near us i had been taken to see one of
the performances and from that time my head was filled with the images of
clowns jockeys horses and performing dogs led by curiosity i crept on
hands and knees under the canvas covering of the tent one day in order to
see my paradise again i had been there but a few minutes gazing at the
acrobats as they packed up their belongings in readiness to depart when sud-
denly a great hand was clapped on my mouth i was caught up carried off
and thrown into a dark corner after a good cry i must have fallen
asleep when i awoke i was in one of the moving caravans i had so admired

      it may perhaps surprise you that i should have such a vivid recollection
of some things while others are so vague i give them to you for what
they are worth for i am not at all certain as to my age at that time only i
look back to these first impressions as to the only bright spot in life all
the cruel tortures have never been able to efface the memory of our sunny
little garden of my mothers kisses and of my fathers cheery laugh

     gryphins and vogel were the proprietors and directors of the traveling
circus they had a wretched dwarf with them as chief attraction he fell
ill fearing lest he might die the scoundrels conceived the diabolical notion
of manufacturing a dwarf i was condemned never to grow they in-
cased me in a steel corslet that entirely stopped the development of my
body  my limbs were tightly bound in linen bands as the chinese women
bind their feet

      the plan was a success as you may see but it was not effected with-
out a prodigious outlay of time and many brutal blows and bitter tears
what did these tigers care  at the end of a few years i was exhibited in
public under the title of general midgy ex commander in chief of the myr-
midons of the sultan of batavia

     i will pass over the insults and sufferings that were my daily lot yet
never can i forget them  they are too deeply engraved on my memory to
be effaced i was exhibited all over the world and i learned to hate hu-
manity in every language the scoundrels who had deformed my body
took much money while i far from sharing in the profits was kept in
captivity
a month in the moon

i

     at length the public curiosity began to wane the profits fell one
day i learned that i had been sold to the khedive of egypt who gave me to
his children just as he would have given them a pony or a clockwork car-
riage from that time forward i never saw the infamous authors of my
misery until one day on the peak of tehbali i met them face to face in this
very hall long years had gone by but i need not tell you that my hatred
had but grown more intense day by day

    living in the palace as if i had been some curious animal i had yet
the opportunity of acquiring knowledge the khedive who was an intel-
ligent man himself spared nothing for the education of his children they
had the best masters in europe i was present at the lessons and listened
attentively while they yawned

      in this way i learned history the natural and physical sciences mathe-
matics and languages i was careful not to let it be perceived that i trea-
sured up the store of learning lest i might be banished from the study
room it was delightful to feel that the khedive himself was providing me
with the weapons wherewith one day i vowed to wipe out this humiliating
bondage

    my heart grew with my knowledge i would be revenged not only on
the direct authors of my misery but on all who were in any way connected
with them i loathed the whole human race i had dreams of crushing them
under my feet one day when science and strength that comes with knowl-
edge should far outweigh and overshadow the accident of my deformed
body 

    just when i had learned everything that my masters had to teach me
arabi pasha planned his revolt i was one of the first to find it out and to
help him  or rather i may say that he was a puppet in my hands but we
were betrayed and arabi was exiled to ceylon whither i accompanied
him

    then i enlarged my sphere of action the revolt had taught me mili-
tary tactics some fakirs near point de galle initiated me into secrets that
would be all powerful over eastern imaginations then it was that i de-
termined to make mussulman fanaticism-which was even then rampant
throughout the upper nile-the lever and instrument of my futtfre power
i escaped from ceylon and came to suakim where i commenced my new
career by ingratiating myself with the mogaddem of rhadameh and for my
own ends doing all in my power to increase his influence

     the mahdi was now daily growing in prestige i turned my eyes to him
feeling sure that he would be easily dazzled by my occult powers and would
be a mere tool in my hands it was then that i had occasion to come to teh-
bali and there found gryphins and vogel this chance meeting changed
the course of my plans i still intended to conquer the soudan and egypt
and by their means the whole mussulman world in order to let it loose upon
europe  but first of all i wished to be revenged on my tormentors by strik-
ing down at once what was conceived to be their enterprise

    that is why i dogged your footsteps and had you watched that i might
seize the first favorable opportunity you know the rest-how i became


a month in the moon

your prisoner by a complete turning of the tables and escaped death only by
feigning it i do not regret my failure nor the downfall of my schemes i
have learned through misfortune what i did not know before i do not even
regret being a castaway on the moon since i am with you i am only sorry
that the real authors of my misery and crimes are not here also in order that
i might settle up my account with them

    perhaps you may find them again some day on earth   said norbert
laughing in order to make a diversion from the melancholy mood the sad
recital had evoked   we have no reason to conclude that the catastrophe was
fatal to those gentlemen the controlling commissioners  and you do not
suppose that we intend to remain here

    yes let us talk about going said the doctor divining norberts inten-
tion  do you seriously think it will be possible  

   i havent the least doubt about it replied the young astrouomer
 since we have had the good luck to carry off with us all that is necessary
we have only to put our solar heat condensers into working order again
some of them having been injured by the shock and to touch up the electric
machinery  

    then why not do it at once   cried gertrude excitedly

    be sure i shall not prolong our sojourn a day longer than can be helped
it will take fifteen days to put the machines in working order meanwhile
the night will be upon us and the solar heat condensers cannot work until
the sun comes back i have made very close calculations on the point we
have just enough air to last that time on one condition however  that it may
not be wasted and especially we must be very particular not to have any
fire of any kind whatever  i say this for the benefit of certain smokers who
burn up at least twenty cubic yards of air for the pleasure of blowing a little
smoke out of their nostrils   added norbert looking at smith and virgil

   the two culprits hung their heads and promised reform they had
probably not known that a pipe could cost so much

   smith hid his confusion by bustling about his business at the dining table
and slunk off tohe kitchen with a pile of plates under his arm

   immediately afterwards a tremendous crash of broken crockery was
heard and the unlucky man reappeared pale and trembling almost fainting

     a thief   he stammered  a thief who escaped out of the window
when he saw me  

chapter xxxiii- a battle

   norbert virgil the doctor and kaddour hurried to the storeroom

   no one was there and the window was closed but that might have been
owing to the draft that blew from within whenever it was open

    what was your thief like  asked the somewhat incredulous doctor

    i only saw his back replied smith  and the back looked as if its
owner wore a respirator  but it was like an ordinary mans back

    very likely   muttered the doctor  an ordinary man in the moon
you are dreaming smith  have you been at that bottle of port  
a month in the moon



    oh sir  said the valet  i have not had a drop this morning-i
mean since we rose  for in this wretched country one never knows whether
it be morning or evening  

     you are quite sure you saw some one escape through the window   
asked norbert

    i am ready to make an affidavit of the fact   said smith majestically

     we will spare you that trouble but we must sift this matter to the
bottom two of you come with me while the others keep guard over the
observatory	

   the doctor and smith were left in the hall of motors having provided
themselves with firearms and donned their respirators the three went out by
the window

   this window gave access to the turning to the right that branched off the
circular passage and it looked on to the building that had done duty as the
lodging of the controlling commissioners and the prison of kaddour this
building had no direct communication with the interior of the observatory
and hence it had been overlooked lately norbert remembered that it must
contain a small supply of air  and as such a commodity was in no wise to be
despised he went straight to the door

   just as he touched it a shot was fired through a circular opening it burnt
his hair without doing him further injury the ball lodged in the wall and
knocked several splinters off it

    the enemy is there   said norbert to his companions as he stood up
close against the wall signing them to do the same

   the precaution was not useless two more shots succeeded the first

   virgil would not wait any longer  he threw himself on the door and tried
to burst it open but it was locked and perhaps barricaded on the inside it
was impossible tp break it in

    there is only one thing to be done he said in a low voice  let us
slip behind the outer wall and getting on the top fire at the windows

   the advice was too good not to be followed in less than three minutes
the three had climbed up the outer wall by the slope thfey lay down on
their faces on the dry grass and opened a well sustained fire from their
breech loaders the windows and woodwork were shivered to pieces  but
no one replied

    they are wtatching for us to uncover that they may take aim at us  
said the experienced virgil  but we know a trick worth two of that my
fine fellows  you shall uncover first  

   seeing that no appreciable effect was produced norbert ordered them to
fire on the door it flew into pieces at the third shot

    to the breach   shouted norbert sliding down the slope virgil and
kaddour with him

   there was no one  the besieged had vanished doubtless they must
have taken refuge in the adjoining room norbert fired therefore at the
second door

    if they are ordinary men they must capitulate for want of air said the
young astronomer


a month in the moon

   this opinion was corroborated by the instant appearance of a white hand-
kerchief suspended by a bayonet through the second breach even on the
moon a white handkerchief is the signal for a truce

    stop firing virgil and host your handkerchief

   virgil obeyed

   the door then opened and on its threshold stood the last person in the
world whom they expected to see-sir bucephalus coghill 

   thin pale and tottering he was but the shadow of himself but it was
he without a doubt	

    it was you then who greeted us with a volley  asked norbert in-
tensely surprised

   the baronet sadly bowed his head without a word another voice an-
swered for him and this voice was strangely like that of costerus wagner

    we ask to treat  it said without the owner of the voice appearing
he was probably sheltering himself behind the baronet

      who are you  

    you know us well replied the voice we are costerus wagner
peter gryphins and ignaz vogel

   the dwarf suddenly gave vent to a cry of joy

    how happens it that you are there and why did you fire upon us
asked norbert lost in amazement

    it does not much matter replied the voice  it will all be explained
but time presses and we shall soon be without air

      surrender in that case  

    not without conditions

    what conditions do you expect 

     our lives air and provisions

    you shall have your lives replied norbert  but air and rations are
another point they are too precious here to be wasted  three rascals  

     then our prisoner shall suffer for it savagely replied the voice

    what prisoner 

   sir bucephalus coghill

    is that true  asked norbert of the baronet

   his unhappy friend nodded his head it needed nothing more to de-
cide norbert

    listen he said  to the only conditions i will grant you shall have
your lives air and rations  but you shall remain prisoners in the quarters
assigned to you and you must work for the common welfare under my
directions  

   agreed said three eager voices which were unmistakably those of
wagner gryphins and vogel

   well then throw down your arms and stand forward you have my
word

   at that moment something cold touched his hand and looking round
he saw kaddour on his knees kissing it

    oh monsieur mauny give them to me  said he beseechingly

    what do you want me to give you 
a month in the moon



    give me these wretches that i may punish them as they deserve 

    i should be most happy to hand them over to you answered norbert
 but i have passed my word to them and i cannot withdraw it

chapter xxxiv-the prisoners

   the three commissioners presented a most miserable aspect they were
emaciated haggard and dirty

   they were as abject now as hitherto they had been arrogant the fire-
arms in their possession proved to be those that had been missed from the
observatory the first day the castaways had sallied forth to reconnoiter

   norbert would not speak to them himself but commissioned virgil to see
to their wants and carried off the poor baronet to the drawing room he was
soon restored by a few puffs of pure oxygen he then related his adventures
and explained the presence on the moon of the three scoundrels

    when you left me at the opening of the crater he said addressing
himself to norbert  i soon got tired of picking up stones and thought how
the work would be done in five minutes when help came the sight of the
apennines on the right was very tempting i longed to climb them and
have something to tell when i return to london if i ever do return

    i yielded to the strong temptation and in about an hours time i had
climbed the nearest peak erected a little commemorative obelisk at the top
and descended the dried up bed of the torrent into the plain i was then
quietly returning up tehbali when suddenly three shadows bounded from
behind a big rock threw me down and seized my box of oxygen

    by good fortune there was just a little breathable air in the gorge at
the bottom of the deep vallej i dont know where the air came from but
there it was and it kept me alive as until then it had kept the three rogues
alive it appears that the glass foundry which was their prison at the bot-
tom of the peak was carried off with us and fell into this gorge where in-
deed i saw the broken pieces of glass  

    so did we said norbert  when we were searching for you

    you saw them too did you well wagner who is more knave than
fool understood the position at once aided thereto by the fact that he could
not breathe outside the valley the villains had no provisions they saw
the observatory in the distance and knew that we were there but they could
not traverse the intervening space owing to their want of oxygen

   in this juncture they suddenly perceived me climbing up the apen-
nines and conceived the idea of awaiting my return to pounce at once upon
me and my box of oxygen equipped with my respirator wagner started
off directly to reconnoiter and finding the observatory deserted he took the
opportunity of visiting the store room and threw out of the window every
eatable he could lay his hands on besides three respirators which you have
not perhaps missed

     i beg your pardon i noticed their absence at once but ventured to sup-
pose that you must have taken them in order to prolong your escapade
said norbert


a month in the moon

    see how one is calumniated  in short wagner returned and led us
around tehbali on the opposite side of the zigzag road and brought us to the
commissioners old quarters you must bear in mind that all this time my
arms were tied to the rifle it was impossible for me to call out since there
is no sound in this confounded land we reached the place where you found
us and have been here ever since-i with my feet and wrists bound and
threatened with death if i tried to escape i think they intended to attack
you in your sleep and get possession of the observatory but they had not
sufficient firearms  that was why costerus made that attempt on the store-
room during your breakfast he was discovered in time luckily for us
all

   as the baronet ended his recital his voice suddenly fell and his eyes
opened wide with an expression of utter stupefication he had just caught
sight of kaddour whom he had not noticed before his amazement at be-
holding him in life whom he had seen in death was only equaled by the sur-
prise with which he noted the familiar terms on which the dwarf evidently
was with the inhabitants of the hall of motors

   they explained matters to him however and he ended by trusting to the
evidence of his senses that kaddour really had risen again

   virgil meanwhile was concerning himself with settling the prisoners as
quickly as possible he had cleverly repaired the broken windows and the
smashed door and had made a hole in the wall for the purpose of communi-
cating with the circular gallery of the observatory where the aerating well
was this secured a fair amount of breathable air to the three commis-
sioners and a cistern full of water was assigned to them as well as daily
rations of food

   norbert gave them his written instructions as to the amount of labor he
required from them it consisted of repairing and polishing a certain number
of conical mirrors that had been injured by the catastrophe and rendered unfit
for use norbert was rather disturbed in his calculations by this sudden
increase in the number of inhabitants for it meant a larger consumption of
air and provisions

     i had calculated he said with a sigh  on a sufficient supply of air for
eight persons during twenty two days i can only count upon enough for
sixteen days since there will be eleven pairs of lungs to fill we shall be
obliged before the end to make large quantities of oxygen

    all the more reason to get rid of these rogues  cried kaddour he
had been as restless as an angry tiger ever since his tormentors had appeared
on the scene   give them to me monsieur mauny  give them to me for
two or three hours and i undertake to suppress them in due form you will
be able to keep your air for those who have a right to it  

   but norbert took the trouble to explain to kaddour that such sentiments
were both cruel and revolting

     revolting  cried the dwarf writhing as if under a hot iron  i should
like to see what you would say if you had been kept in a metallic mold for
fifteen years and transformed into a monster 

    true answered norbert trying to appease the little creature  but
a month in the moon



you must remember kaddour that your wrongs are not ours and that we
cannot feel quite as you do about these wretches 

   the dwarf acknowledged the justice of this remark and promised to
restrain himself  but this was only a change of tactics on his part and
he asked that at least he might be allowed to take charge of the prisoners

     you dont know them he said  they will play you some trick yet
they are scoundrels in every sense of the word and must not be lost sight of
for an instant  

     virgil will look after them replied norbert  you would be a bad
jailer kaddour if you want to prove your friendship to me as you say and
as i believe never mention them again

chapter xxxv-a fragment from gertrudes journal

      we have now spent six times twenty four hours on the moon i could just
as well believe it to have been six months if m mauny said so one does
not know what to expect about anything in this strange world  a day of a
hundred and forty four hours with no apparent reason why it should come
to an end even then gives a new meaning to the word interminable 

     oh night what would we not give to greet thee again as of old  how
little do our endless siestas here resemble the regular sleep that we enjoyed
on the earth  but i suppose we must expect some drawbacks in such a glo-
rious enterprise as this 

     i shall go on with my journal i began it for my dear father and it is
the only thing now that seems to bring me a little nearer to him poor
father  what i wonder is he doing  why is he not with us instead of being
shut up in khartoum  he must find it almost as hot as this and perhaps
matters are worse there  poor father  when shall we meet again  i will
at least write down my selenic experiences day by day for him to read if we
ever have the happiness of being together again

      my uncle calls this life here a selenic existence  the word only means
lunar  but it sounds better anyhow this existence is both monotonous
and strange i am obliged to bite my finger at times to make sure that i am
not in a dream every morning when i wake after some hours of sleep in
the artificial night of my room it takes five minutes and fatimas solemn
assertion to convince me that i am really on the moon but alas  i am
obliged to acknowledge it at last and then i dont know whether to laugh
or cry

    it is like being on board a large vessel except that one cannot go and
take a turn on the bridge for the few steps we are able to take on the esplan-
ade thanks to those miserable boxes of oxygen are not worth mentioning
the first time i went out i thought it rather amusing to breathe in jerks
just as one drinks and to get over the ground by leaps like a grasshopper
but in the long run it is tiring a breath of sea air would be much nicer
especially if i had dear papas arm 

    mr mauny is the only one among us who enjoys being out he went
off again this morning-or rather i should say after breakfast-on a new


a month in the moon

expedition he has gone to visit the other hemisphere of the moon the one
that the earth has never seen and will never see

   it is somewhat curious that the moon should always turn one side only
to us and never the other it seems absurd when one first hears it yet
after all it is only natural since she accompanies us in our annual journey
round the sun she is like a child walking round a merry-go-round and
keeping her face always turned to the man who grinds the central organ  the
riders of the wooden horses lose sight of the child from time to time but
whenever they do meet her it is always face to face m mauny gave me this
explanation

     well to return to him he has undertaken to visit that side of the
moon that no man has seen yet not even with a telescope we should not
have minded being of the party but he would not let us go he said first
that it was too far being nine hundred miles off and that it would take him
at least forty eight hours to go and return then he said that the cold there
would be terrible on account of the lunar night now prevailing  and lastly
that he was obliged to take an extra allowance of oxygen which it would be
difficult to manage if we were to go too

     he went alone with kaddour and a perfect museum of telescopes re-
torts and all sorts of instruments i can hear you saying  what  take such
a journey in forty eight hours across a country devoid of railroads or even
roads impossible   he is of a contrary opinion he says he has made
his calculations and that it will take him eighteen hours to go at the rate
of fifty miles an hour eighteen hours to return allowing twelve to rest and
take observations or notes a journey on the moon remember is made with
seven league boots

    all the same i wish he were back what would become of us if any-
thing happened to him  dont think i speak selfishly dear papa  you know
whom i am thinking of when i say  what will become of us the baronet
certainly would not be able to get us out of this and take us home poor sir
bucephalus  he is beginning to get over his captivity somewhat but he was
in a sad condition at first

     i was saying it was like being in a big steamer our life is as regular
every twelve hours we sleep on awaking which we call morning the doc-
tor goes his professional rounds  sees that the aeration is good and the ven-
tilators doing their work he even extends his care to the three miscreants
in the prison  you know how every human being is in his eyes equal  on
his return we breakfast  then i give fatima her lesson or learn my own
i am so glad to have the dear child with me and i love her more and more
every day you will find that my pupil does me credit she is wonderfully
docile and succeeds in everything she undertakes

      for instance she is the best of all of us at the deaf and dumb language
taught us by my uncle fatima is at the head of the class after m mauny
already they converse by signs with kaddour who sets up for being quite
an adept yesterday he held forth on the subject of what he terms the
general grammar of gestures he is certainly making fun of us but he him-
self is the most ridiculous object on the moon  -he will have it that it is the
a month in the moon



greatest mistake to bring up the deaf mute to express a particular vocabulary
by signs  he says there is a universal language of gestures which is the
same in every land and is perhaps the primitive language of humanity 
and that this is the language that should be taught not only to deaf
mutes but to children in general in order that they may thus possess a
universal idiom

    virgil is invaluable he is at present overseer of works he is super-
intending the repairing of the solar heat condensers on which the prisoners
are engaged my uncle and m mauny keep the electrical apparatus to
themselves i suspect that m norbert has kept to himself alone the secret
of the terminals for fear of some accident happening such as that fatal
escapade of smiths fatima and i spend three hours every day in making
stuff bands which are to play their part i am told in our homeward
journey

    no one here is idle except the model valet  and perhaps that is because
they do not want him to lose the habit but smith can make very nice pre-
served turtle soup

      sir bucephalus will have it that he is here against his will  that he took
no measures to get here and never believed indeed that the expedition would
succeed he says m mauny must get him out of it

     m mauny is the only one who is thoroughly satisfied he says that
the moon is the paradise of astronomers and the finest observatory in space 
that he would willingly pass two or three years here and is so sorry that the
lack of air necessitates our speedy departure he can hardly tear himself
from his telescopes even in the daytime i dont know what it will be when
night comes-the long night so favorable to astronomical research  he will
have some valuable notes of this lunar excursion i imagine

chapter xxxvi-the journal continued

    four hours later-i have been interrupted in my daily chat with you
dear papa by uncle who came to invite me to go out with him and sir
bucephalus you know how ever since we came here uncle has had a crav-
ing to find some vegetable substance even if only a little moss or a blade of
grass he says it would be the greatest prize in his collection of herbs and
would make him famous

      he has already fixed upon a name for this precious vegetable  it is to
be called brieta maxima or parvula according to its size unless indeed it
has to be simply brieta selenensis but sad to say we have not as yet found
a single plant uncle is not discouraged however and we are now going
out to hunt again he declares also that the air of the moon for want of a
more exact expression does me a great deal of good and i ought to take
exercise every day even in this climate where fatigue is unknown

    we started therefore in the best of humors we descended the dried
up torrent from the apennines which were so nearly fatal to sir bucephalus
he pointed out to us the spot where the three conspirators awaited him to
steal his oxygen respirator and i can assure you his tragic attitudes whilst


a month in the moon

describing the affair did good duty for speech by the by we found no air
left in the torrent which proves the truth of m maunys theory  the air
that was there for a few hours was only a quantity of terrestrial air

      leaving to our right the summit already explored by the baronet and
m mauny we continued our way down the long ellow valley till we came
to another gorge much deeper toward the south there we found a coal
vein level with the ground the baronet stood and looked at it for some
little time thinking doubtless what a treasure it would be if close to london
but uncle and i did not take much interest in it so we pursued our way
getting over the ground be it remembered by leaps of ten or twelve yards
at a time and doing fifteen leagues an hour at least

   suddenly uncle stopped short he stooped over knelt down tore a
magnifying glass out of his pocket and set himself to a steady examination of
a sort of little green moss scarcely visible  the back of a blue pebble he got
up at last in a state of lively emotion and beckoned me to come and look well
dear papa we had made a discovery  the brieta parvula lay before us
oh it was very parvula indeed a miserable scrap of moss hardly per-
ceptible that i should have passed by a hundred times or have taken for a
bit of the lava round about

    uncle was quite delighted and it was a pleasure to see him so overjoyed
he shook hands with me and we congratulated each other by signs

     after a quarter of an hour spent thus i began to think the brieta had
had enough attention and as uncle did not seem disposed to move and
looked indeed as if he would like to take root beside his pebble i made him a
sign that i was going to the foot of the mountain and would come back for
him

      some secret instinct of coming glory must have impelled me surely  for
i had not taken two steps beyond a little spur of the apennines that marked
a gloomy valley when an unexpected sight met my eyes  i stood before an
immense excavation that had evidently been dug out of the rock by human
or rather superhuman hands

     there was no doubt about it what i saw before me was no freak of
nature but most certainly the work of creatures as powerful as they must
have been intelligent  a gigantic staircase of admirable proportions led by
gently sloping wide steps to a vestibule supported by pillars worthy of the
cyclops they were four or five times loftier and larger than those of the
colonnade of st peters at rome and they were chiseled out of a single
block of malachite and upheld the whole front of the mountain itself

     the vestibule led into a court that appeared seven or eight times larger
than that of the coliseum  it was roofed over and lighted here and there by
small oval windows the whole was grand lofty and elegant beyond de-
scription we saw nothing like it in egypt dear papa nor on the upper
nile nor even at nineveh gigantic monsters cut out of granite guarded
the entrance to the court the walls were decorated with frescoes and highly
colored paintings

   i tore myself away at last and hastened to communicate to the others
the discovery of these marvels i found uncle still poring over the brieta
the hero

i

parvula and tlie baronet with him with much difficulty i prevailed on
them to follow me when they saw the building their astonishment and
delight knew no bounds uncle tore a page out of his note book and wrote 

     my dear gertrude you are the first to discover a selenic monument
and thus to place beyond the shadow of a doubt the fact that the moon has
been inhabited it is a more important discovery than any archaeology has
made in our days

     i did not understand very well at first why the discovery was thus im-
portant but wdien i had thought about it whilst sir bucephalus and uncle
examined the mural decorations i saw that such a monument must have been
the work not only of intelligent beings but also of beings who had arrived
at a high degree of civilization

    for just as you said speaking of the pyramids the very cutting and
lifting of such gigantic stones is evidence that the workmen must have had a
profound knowledge of mathematics and the allied sciences so now a doubt-
ful matter is cleared up for us all the dead moon was inhabited and the
inhabitants must have been experienced architects and engineers what a
privilege dear papa to have been the instrument of such a grand discovery 

    on our return to the observatory uncle lost his high spirits when he
came to examine his brieta parvula under the microscope it turned out to be
identical with a terrestrial plant whose name i forget but which is most
common in polar regions and this is moreover only a stunted specimen of
the kind poor uncle is dreadfully disappointed

   it was in vain that i tried to console him by telling him that at all
events it was the sole vegetable left upon the moon he answered that
nothing but an absolutely new species would be accepted in the way of proof
by terrestrial botanists that they would look with suspicion on the origin of
the brieta and say that we had brought it here with our mountain uncle
believes his colleagues capable of anything in order to decry original work

                  ah me  full many a white breast sighed
                  for the favor in his hand-

for the love of heart so true so tried

                  for life-you understand

                 he looked a hero-he was more

                   a martyr too perchance

                    for he went to the oldest girl on the floor
                    and led her out to dance

the adventure that befell an american tourist who sought an escape from beaten paths-a
rescue from the horrors of starvation succeeded by a peril which causes keen suspense
ana which is thought to be safely conquered when it again
confronts the victim with a tragic fate

yy hen walter safford was abroad he despised the hackneyed haunts of
tourists and had a holy horror of excursions planned by baedeker
he regarded the conscientious sightseeing practised by most americans as
proof of a prosaic if not a vulgar mind it was his habit to follow the bent
of his own fancy and happen on the usual things by chance if at all it was
this idiosyncrasy that led him into a very foolish trip to the catacombs in
rome these subterranean passages extend for miles following no regular
plan but branching and intersecting at random they all look exactly
alike and even the occasional chapels where the early christians held their
services and buried their dead secure from pagan persecution have little to
distinguish them one from another no trackless forest orjabled labyrinth
could be more confusing than this network of dark damp indistinguishable
burrowings

   well knowing the character of the catacombs and the number of unfor-
tunates who have gone astray and starved to death there the paternal
italian government has sealed up all the entrances to the underground
city but one and that one is strictly guarded at stated times an official
guide conducts parties through this entrance no one is allowed to enter
except so attended even then the guide take his parties over a very
short and stereotyped route mistakes on his part being made impossible by
having every passageway roped across except the one he is to follow

   now that was the sort of thing walter safford specially abhorred so he
resolved unless chance favored him to let these underground attractions
alone but chance did favor him an old peasant with whom he was chat-
ting in the campagna told him how a washout and cave-iti on his farm the
night before had opened up the catacombs a small gratuity easily indticed
him to point out the place safford was enchanted here was an entrance
all his own to an absolutely unexplored region he laid in a stock
of matches and candles put a compass in his pocket and by means of
a rope swung himself down he started on his explorations in the highest
spirits

    all i have to do is to keep in one line say straight north and when i
turn around i will go straight south which must infallibly bring me back

   of course the passages did not run exactly that way so he took the one
that led nearest north at each branching he walked for an hour stopping a
few minutes to examine a crude bit of frescoing on a chapel wall and a sar-
a conspiracy of the catacombs



cophagus containing some bones that crumbled to dust at his touch
then he turned around and proceeded to retrace his steps when he had
walked an hour and a half without arriving at the starting point he knew
that somehow he had gone astray then he turned back to find the place
from which he bad branched off the little chapel with its frescoes and sar-
cophagus was the only point on the route he could identify he had passed
through it on his return trip if he could get back there then and begin
afresh he would probably get on the right track

   this however was just what he did not succeed in doing when his
watch told him that he had wandered for eight hours without coming across
either the entrance or the chapel he sat down to consider should he con-
tinue to hunt for his lost starting place or should he strike out boldly for the
government entrance which he knew to be about three miles northwest of
the washout he decided in favor of the latter as being the larger mark
since if he could find any part of the rope enclosed passage he would
be safe

   he trudged doggedly toward the northwest till he knew by the time that
had elapsed he must have walked at least ten miles then he sank down in
complete exhaustion and put out his candle for economys sake his supply
was nearly out he will remember to his dying day the horrors of the time
that followed he slept a few hours from utter weariness and awoke chilled
to the bone by the damp stone on which he was lying the heavy subter-
ranean air almost suffocated him the darkness was full of mysterious
horrors strange sounds which might proceed from the scurrying feet of a
rat or the flap of a bats wings disturbed the awful stillness when he put
his hand down it came in contact with crawling slimy things he lit his
candle and breathed freer anything is bearable with light

    if i only had enough caudles to last till i die   he thought   but
they will be gone in a few hours and it will take me several days to starve
at best perhaps a week- and he shuddered

   he stumbled on aimlessly till the light was gone the last flicker of the
last candle showed him that it was near noon of the second day he had
some matches left but kept them for an emergency he had picked out as
dry a place as possible and sat down to await the end every once in a while
he would get up in desperation and walk blindly till he was tired groping his
way along the damp wall at last about the middle of the second night
his hand struck something different-a bit of carving the eager hand fell
on-a sarcophagus  the top is off crumbling bones were inside strug-
gling between hope and fear safford struck a match thank god  it was
his chapel  the entrance wras not a quarter of a mile away as near due
south as might be

   the excess of his joy combined with his physical weakness he had been
two days and two nights without food was too much for him he sank
down and wept like a child when he had somewhat recovered himself he
set to work manufacturing a torch out of the more combustible parts of his
clothing the first one lasted some minutes during which he felt confident
he had found the place at which he had first gone astray another similar


a conspiracy of the catacombs

torch guided him on bis way till he came to a standstill ebout the time he
thought he must be almost at the entrance before a mound of earth there
was no getting around it it filled the passageway completely from side to
side from roof to roof for a moment he thought he had somehow lost him-
self again then the truth dawned on him this was his entrance  it
had been discovered and filled in by the authorities 

   the despair that followed was all the worse for the delusive hope that had
visited him the temptation was strong to cut a vein with his penknife and
end it all by bleeding to death this he managed to resist and even
made some feeble efforts to dig his way out to the surface but there were
twenty or thirty feet of well packed earth between him and the upper world
he had no implement but his hands and a penknife and his strength was
almost spent the time passed he knew not how sometimes he was merci-
fully unconscious sometimes the tortures of hunger and thirst became
poignant enough to arouse him for a short time from his lethargy

   it was on the third day-it might have been the thirteenth so far as he
knew at the time-that he suddenly became conscious of human voices he
thought it merely another hallucination-he had had many-and kept quiet
a voice said in italian

    here at last we are safe from spies and eavesdroppers 

    thanks be to the saints yes  said another  we may now arrange
the details of the tyrants death

   by this time safford had raised himself on his elbow with new found
strength and alertness these weie no airy phantasms they were live
mens voices but the character of the few words he had heard made him
hesitate to call out what followed made him glad he had held his peace
they were planning nothing less than the assassination of the king it
was evident that lots had been drawn at some previous time and that the
designated assassin was now receiving his final instructions from a sort of
executive committee and especially from a man with a well modulated voice
whom they called  excellencj  the date of the crime was set for nine
days thence when it was known that king humbert would attend high mass
at st peters the assassin was to meet him as he came out of the church
and present a petition and take advantage of the kings eyes being on the
paper to deal a sudden knife thrust at his heart the assassin chosen was
evidently a sicilian and his knife thrust was regarded as sure it would be
death for him also but his remarks showed that he was prepared for what he
called the crown of martyrdom

   for an hour safford lay and listened then he heard the conspirators
rise to go in an agony of horror at being left alone to die he uttered an
inarticulate cry

     listen  what was that  

     it was some spirit of the dead  cried one

    or the devil himself suggested another

    no such luck came the deep voice of the man who was called  excel-
lency  its a man and we must find and silence him if we dont want to
be betrayed
a conspiracy of the catacombs



   safford heard them coming towards him and fairly shook with fear for
he had not the slightest doubt that they would murder him suddenly an
idea occurred to him it was only a chance one in a thousand but he
grasped at it eagerly he would pretend not to understand italian

   the footsteps began to grow more distant they were going the wrong
way summoning all his strength salford cried in english 

    help  help  i am lost dont abandon me good people for the love
of heaven  

   the men halted

    whats that gibberish one asked

    its english said the leader  apparently some fool of a foreigner
has lost his way perhaps after all he did not hear us and did not un-
derstand

    well run no risks growled he to whom the assassins lot had fallen

   thats right chimed in another  best take no chances you cant
trust these foreign demons it may be a spy

    then why should he call us when we were going away from him  said
the leader grufly  stick to what you understand and leave this to me

   the men grumbled but obeyed a moment later they came upon saf-
ford and flashed their lanterns on his eyes the haggard lines of the face
hollow eyes sunken cheeks and hue of death convinced them that he was
there against his will not an intentional spy-but had he understood 

   what are you doing here sir said the leader of the conspirators
addressing safford in fairly correct english

   safford told his story in the fewest possible words for he had little breath
to spare what he had he spent in begging for food and water one of the
men had a biscuit in his pocket and another had a flask of whisky the
wolfish way in which poor safford fell on these refreshments moved the little
band of assassins to expressions of wonder and pity

    dont you understand a single word of italian said the leader sud-
denly in that language

   safford checked the no that was almost out and substituted  did
you speak to me  after that he was on his guard and though several more
attempts were made to trap him into showing some understanding of the
language he succeeded in not betraying himself

   well said the leader turning to his comrades what say you i
feel sure this man is harmless shall we rescue him  his life saved will
atone for that ctlier life we feel called on to sacrifice unnecessary bloodshed
is no part of our purpose  

    it shall be as you decide excellency nevertheless it seems unwise to
me to risk the success of our enterprise ever so little for the sake of this
foreigner who is three quarters dead already

   it was hard indeed for safford to keep his face perfectly expressionless
while his fate was being discussed quite a hot dispute arose over him but
the leader gave the final word in his favor

    give me your attention one moment i pray sir his excellency said

turning again to safford   we belong to a club of philosophers-a debating

 m


a conspiracy of the catacombs

club i think you call it-of somewhat advanced views for this country in
your so happy land of the free we should meet and discuss in the open and
all would praise us here we must hide underground for fear of the police
i am sure we have your sympathy now you tell me you do not understand
italian there is nothing strange in that most of your countrymen have
the same lack but because of our position you will see that we must observe
great caution you will therefore be watched our society is large you
need have no uneasiness if you are what you represent yourself it will be
quickly shown but if for instance we should learn that you do speak
italian then we should know that you have deceived us and must be a spy
sent by the police and it might fare ill with you our people have hot
heads 

   safford did not flinch but accepted the conditions with apparent cheer-
fulness

   he was too weak to walk so two of the conspirators carried him between
them

   they proceeded thus for a long distance-miles it seemed to safford-find-
ing their way by marks on the wall so slight as to be hardly noticeable at
last they reached a staircase with a trap door at the top which being opened
admitted them to the cellar of a house they gave safford food and water
and treated him with considerable kindness when he seemed to be suf-
ficiently revived a cab wras sent for and he was helped into it

    good luck my friend said his excellency with a courteous bow  it
goes without saying that you are not to mention your meeting with us per-
haps since people would wonder how you escaped you had better not refer
to your trip to the catacombs at all i dont think our watchers will bother
you you will hardly be aware of them the are everywhere it might
be the friend you meet in the street the boy who waits on you at the table
or the old woman who sells you a nosegay we have wide ramifications
delighted to have served you  the driver awaits his directions  

     if you would add to your other kindnesses by telling him to drive me
tono  via torino i should be deeply obliged 

   his excellency gave the desired directions and safford breathed freer as
the cab drove off

   not that his difficulties were over by any means he had not dared give
his true address for he had lodgings with a worthy widow who spoke no
word but italian and whom he had known for years his knowledge of italian
would be straightway betrayed if he went there even if he felt sure enough
of his landlady to take her into his confidence there were the servants the
other lodgers the children next door the chestnut vender at the corner
they all knew him and all would hail him as an old friend in italian

   he had therefore given the address of an english pension where he was
not personally known and where he devoutly trusted he would find a vacant
room of course if the conspirators spies chose to inquire they would find
out that was not his previous residence but this seemed to him the lesser
risk

   the prim english spinster who presided over the establishment looked
a conspiracy of the catacombs



somewhat askance at the seedy individual without baggage who wanted a
room immediately but as salford fortunately had enough money in his pocket
to pay a weeks board in advance he was allowed to stay

   the next two days he spent for the most part in bed going out only after
dark to make a few purchases absolutely necessary to his comfort lest he
should run across one of his numerous roman acquaintances meantime
fearing that his landlady would become alarmed at his absence and raise such
a hue and cry as to reach the ears of the conspirators safford wrote her that
he had been unexpectedly called out of town and asked her to pack his be-
longings and express them to him in florence it was his intention to fol-
low them himself as soon as he was able to stand the journey

   as his physical strength came back to him he became more and more
disturbed by the secret to which he had fallen heir and revolved various plans
for saving the king without sacrificing himself he did not dare hold any
direct communication with the italian authorities for knowing he was watched
he felt confident he would be murdered or kidnapped before he had a chance
to tell his story he finally decided to go to the american consul and lay
the case before him

   from there he intended driving direct to the station taking the train for
florence and shaking the dust of the eternal city from his feet

   the consul who did not know him personally did not seem very much
impressed by the story he consented however to send for a notary to
take down saffords deposition and promised to place it without delay in the
hands of the authorities

   glancing at his watch as he went out he saw he had barely time to catch
the florentine train

    drive to the station as fast as you can he cried to the driver jumping
into the carriage

   he was not fairly seated before he became aware that something was
wrong this was not his carriage neither was it like any carriage
he had ever seen it had no windows  he tried the doors and was scarcely
surprised to find them locked he shouted at the top of his voice for assist-
ance but siuce he could hear none of the noises of the street it was not
likely his cries would reach the outside world he thumped and pounded in
all directions but nothing gave way there was no escape he was securely
trapped

   they were moving rapidly this much they could tell by the jolts
safford had no doubt that he was traveling to his death the drive seemed
eternal it really lasted a couple of hours-no short time to one in saffords
frame of mind

   when the carriage stopped and the door was opened a pistol was placed
at his head he was blindfolded and led by the hand it was already night
so he had seen nothing in the interval before his eyes were bandaged but
the extreme freshness and coolness of the air convinced him that he was not
only in the country but on a hill top he was led into a house evidently
a spacious one from the size of the rooms traversed and finally down a
flight of stone steps some one gave him a little push the men who led
s

a conspiracy of the catacombs

him ran back up the stairs the door at the top slammed to and a bolt grated
harshly

   safford pulled the bandage from his eyes he was in absolute darkness
he moved about very cautiously until he came to the wall-a damp stone wall
he followed it around and found himself in a room about ten feet square and
six feet high paved ceiled and walled with stone with no window and no
door save the one at the top of the stairs it was a dungeon but where 
why  he took some comfort in the fact that he had not jret been killed for
if he was doomed to die he saw no reason for delay

   the long hours of the night dragged with sickening slowness there was
nothing to mark the day when it came for no ray of light entered the dun-
geon till the door was opened for a moment and a tray of not unappetizing
food set inside not long afterwards the door was again unbolted and the
tray removed then the chief conspirator entered

   i am truly grieved to have caused you so much inconvenience iny
friend he said suavely  but you will admit your actions have been some-
what suspicious

    i admit nothing of the sort said safford who had thought over be-
forehand what he would say in just such circumstances

    why did you visit the american consul

    to get my mail my letters are addressed in his care 

     hm  that is not impossible but wrhy did jou go to a house that was
not your previous abode when you left us the other day 

   this was what safford most feared but he was prepared for this also

   i had no previous abode i got into rome in the early morning i
came for the express purpose of exploring the catacombs i intended to de-
vote the day to that and go in the evening to the english pension

    where is your baggage  

    in florence i was just on my way to the train to reurn there when
i was carried off by your people   it was a luxury to be able to tell the
truth

   his excellency mused for a moment safford seeing his advantage went
on boldl

   	 it appears to me that this has been a very high handed proceeding and
that the explanation is due not from me to you but from you to me

   it maybe so assented the other will you kindly show me the
letters you received at the consuls they must be with you

    i was disappointed there was no mail for me

    it took jou some time to find that out an hours call to inquire for
mail and learn there is none  

    sir said safford rather testily  since you must needs pry into all my
private affairs i will tell you that i found to my surprise that the consul was
a college classmate of my fathers he asked me to sit down and we spent
so long talking over home friends that i feared i had lost my train 

    yes i know about that and the notary  

    what notary  

   the notary at the consuls
a conspiracy of the catacombs



    i know nothingabout him

    he was sent foi and went in while you were there

   safford shrugged his shoulders

     i tell you i know nothing of it but stay  the consul did excuse
himself and leave the room for a few minutes on a matter of business it
might have been that i do not know

    well said his excellency slowly  you are very plausible my young
friend and i confess i have taken a fancy to you but in justice to others i
do not dare set you free just yet the evidence is strong against you in
the course of a week it will be proved whether or no you are a traitor if it
all turns out as i hope you shall be treated like a prince and sent on
your way to florence with the profoundest apologies if not-well that
understands itself your servant sir and his excellency bowed himself
out

   saffords prospects were hardly cheerful a week hence the date of the
assassination would be passed if the king did not go to mass or observed
any unusual precautions or if any arrests were made saffords doom was
sealed in view of the document in the consuls hands some of these things
were sure to happen he tried to be a philosopher and reflect that he was no
worse off than if he had died in the catacombs but there was no great com-
fort in the thought

   the next morning his breakfast was brought by a young girl-a girl with
fine black eyes and cheeks in which the red blood showed through the olive
skin safford noticed all this as she stood in the doorway and thought too
he detected some compassion lurking in the depths of those eyes he found
himself hoping that she would come again she did come and after looking
over her shoulder to see if she were observed came down two or three steps
and closed the door behind her

     do you not speak italian a little signor  

   ah it was a trap  safford was on his guard in an instant

    you need not fear me i am your friend ah if you could speak it
only so little  i would help you gladly but i cannot speak your english

   safford was sadly perplexed here perhaps was a chance of escape
but it might also be a ruse to make him commit himself he hesitated

   ah i am so sorry the girl went on in her mellifluous italian  so
sorry you do not understand me and i so wanted to help you

   a wave of trust came over him he opened his lips to speak but she had
gone

   safford waited in vain for her return his meals were as before brought
by a rough looking man who made no attempt to speak with him a couple
of days passed counted only by meals then the door opened and as it let
in no light safford concluded it must be night the door was closed very
gently indeed a match was struck and safford saw the dark eyed girl again
she lit a lantern which she carried and set it on one of the lower steps then
she drew forth a book and held it towards safford it was an italian-eng-
lish dictionary slowly and painfully the girl hunted out word after word
that she needed showing each english word to safford as she found it he
	a conspiracy of the catacombs

                             

let her go on wishing to get as much information as p sible before trusting
her entirely this was her communication 

   bad men wish kill you my uncle not wish they have much discon-
tent he go way tomorrow they plan kill you then

    this was only too likely he had felt all along that only the unaccount-
able compassion or compunction of his excellency-who was apparently the
girls uncle-stood between him and the vengeance of the fierce and brutal
natures associated with him safford cast aside all reserve and addressed his
benefactress in italian at first she seemed offended at his previous lack of
confidence but he soon explained that and everything else to her satisfac-
tion

     so you have warned them and the king is safe  praised be the
saints  i too so longed to do that but i did not dare besides i did not
know exactly they had not told me the time or place ah how i hate
their plotting  since my aunt died my uncle has done nothing but plot i
think he is crazy it is only charity to think so but these low ignorant
men who are with him they are brutes that is all he has forced me to
join the society and take the oaths i have not dared to break them till now
for i knew they would kill me but listen we are wasting time i might
tell my uncle and save your life tomorrow but since you have really done
what they accuse you of they will find it out in a few days and my uncle
himself will condemn you to death you must escape i will help you it
shall be right away are you willing to trust me and to try it  

   for answer safford bowed low and lifted the girls shapely hand to
his lips the little hand trembled very much and its owner drew it hastily
away

   she extinguished the light and opened the door they picked their way
noiselessly through the house a medieval structure half castle half chateau
several men lay in the hallway sleeping heavily outside the door a great
dog sprang out at them but was checked immediately by the sound of the
girls voice safford glanced back at the towers and battlements of the
structure he had just left

     who is your uncle   he said curiously

   the marchese palavini

   safford started it was a name well known and respected and belonged
to one of the last men in rome to be suspected of plotting against the kings
life

      and you 

    i am annunciata palavini

   you are well named he murmured gratefully for you have an-
nounced glad tidings of life and hope to me this night

     not so fast she answered nervously  we are not safe yet

   they had a long walk before them to rome twelve miles annunciata
said and they must make haste to get there in time for the florentine train

    why should i leave in the train  safford asked her  why not go to
police headquarters and claim protection  

     can you ask   said the girl  if we did that we should have to tell
the red rose

i

the whole story and denounce my uncle you have already made sure his
plot will come to naught would you willingly procure his death who has
twice saved your life  if i had known you were so bloodthirsty i should
never have helped you to escape

    nay signorina i do not desire your uncles death you are entirely
right and i will go wherever you bid me

   the sun was well up before they reached rome safford could see that
his companion was very much fatigued for italian girls are no walkers but
she was too plucky to own it

   several times she hurried him into a shop or around a corner to get away
from some member of the secret society who might recognize him

   they spent most of their spare time in churches as being safer than the
street giving them a chance to kneel in a corner and cover their faces with
their hands

   better not stop at florence annunciata remarked there is no
safety in italy

    i expect thats so safford answered ill go straight through to
nice

   when at last they reached the station annunciata handed him her purse
    i dont want this safford said trying to return it  i have money
    but i would rather you didnt pay for my ticket the girl said shyly

    you dont mean to say you are coming with me

   the tears sprang to her eyes and her lips quivered

    i thought that went without saying she murmured  it is death to

me to remain nevertheless if you wish to-

    heaven forbid  safford cried then he grew very red and stammered
sadly  but dont you see my dear girl you cant go along with me unless
you are willing to marry me 

    i suppose that is true she answered demurely

   and that is how walter safford came to bring home an italian wife

                                              edith elmer wood

the red rose

                       the rose like a meek white nun
                       kneeled neath the vaulted sky
                       and swung her fragrant censer
                       over the daisies nigh

                        stealing upon her devotions
                        the sun like a cupid came

                        and kissed the wan white sister
                        until she blushed for shame

 the mutiny on the flying cloud

thrilling experiences among the islands of the western pacific-the hostage chosen by the
pirates to coerce the first mate-what befell when the malays attacked
the stockade on refuge island

synopsis op chapters previously published

    the clipper ship plying- cloud captain blake commanding is en route between new york
and australia with seven passengers dr henderson his wife his child lucy and his wifes
sister sibyl stanley also mr grant a civil engineer with his wife and sever year old son percy
after crossing the line the chief mate bryce is lost overboard and ned wilson scarcely twenty
is advanced to the post while robert manners who is no older is made second officer mean-
time josh williams one of the able seamen foments discontent among the crew and one night
captain blake and manners are seized bound and placed in captivity while williams in-
forms ned wilson that the price of the safety of the women and children among the
passengers is his promise to faithfully navigate the ship to the best of his ability for the muti-
neers

    williams proposes to put the passengers ashore on one island and the two ships officers on
another but several days elapse before land that seems suitable is sighted finally one about
six miles long is selected and the passengers are sent off in two boats at the last moment sibyl
stanley is detained from accompanying her friends williams arguing that she must be held to
insure neds trustworthiness captain blake and manners are landed on another island and
soon afterwards the flying cloud is put in at a third one having a safe harbor between tall cliffs
screening her from all observation ned while off on an exploring trip with sibyl finds a cave
containing thousands of dollars worth of gold a discovery which they determine to keep from
the knowledge of the mutineers meantime after mr grant has chanced upon the wreck of a
vessel the mermaid the party on refuge island build a raft on which to transport the wreck
piecemeal to the shore to be utilized in various ways on one of these journeys they fall in
with a canoe containing captain blake and rob manners and there is great rejoicing over the
reunion captain blake warns them that there are savages in the neighborhood and they pro-
ceed to build a house or fort out of a quarry they are fortunate enough to nd on the island
they plan also to build a cutter in which to escape and after the laying of the keel captain
blake goes fishing on the raft is overtaken by a hurricane and is given up for lost by his friends
they proceed with the building of their boat which is almost completed when grant and percy
are captured by a party of malays who suddenly make their appearance on the island after
those in the fort have fired upon them they send a pictured message declaring that they would
give up their prisoners only on condition that the others march out of the stockade and throw
down their arms otherwise grant and his little son will be burned alive

    the alternative is a dreadful one and the three men who have two women and a child to
protect know not what to do until suddenly dr henderson conceives a desperate plan

chapter xxxiii-the forlorn hope

jr henderson had decided upon a plan of attack looking at his
watch he found it was two oclock-just four hours to sunrise there
was not much time to spare for when the sun next rose grant and his child
must be once more safe within the walls of the fort or-well that must
not be thought of

this story began in the january issue of the argosy the five back numbers will be
mailed to any address on receipt of  cents
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   so taking one more keen glance around to make quite sure that all was
safe henderson went softly down the staircase leading to the courtyard and
quietly directed manners and nicholls to rejoin him at once upon the parapet
this done he entered his own room

   a lamp turned low was burning upon the table and by its light he
was just able to see that little lucille was sleeping calmly where he had
laid her  but his wife was absent and he needed not to be told where she
was

   he stood for a moment looking with unspeakable fondness upon the
sleeping child and then bending over her he pressed one kiss upon her
forehead as he did so she smiled in her sleep her rosebud lips quivered a
moment and then he heard her whisper  dear percy  

   it was enough  had he felt the least lingering hesitation about the
carrying out of his plan that unconscious appeal made by his sleeping child
would have effectually banished it and dashing away the tears that rose
to his eyes the doctor quietly withdrew

   there was a light burning in mrs grants room  and as he passed the
door on tiptoe and stealthily as though he had been engaged upon some un-
lawful errand he caught the low murmur of his wifes voice and a stifled
sob that was another appeal not to be resisted  and without venturing to
disturb the two mourning watchers-though he never before yearned so
hungrily for a parting word with his wife or a sight of her face-he passed
noiselessly on and so regained the parapet where manners and nicholls
already awaited him

   to them he fully unfolded his plan minutely explaining not only his own
but also their part in it  after which he gave them his final instructions and
then taking both of grants magazine rifles in his hand and thrusting a brace
of revolvers into his belt-having previously loaded each weapon carefully with
his own hands-he quietly lowered the outer ladder cautioning his com-
panions to draw it up again after him and stepped briskly but noiselessly out
through the dew laden grass in the direction of the shipyard

chapter xxxiv-doomed to die

   the story told by little lucille relative to the first appearance of the
malays was so graphic and accurate up to the point of grants capture that
little or no addition is needed to complete it

   the shell gatherers had been most successful in their quest and return-
ing to grant island laden with their delicate and beautiful spoils were about
half way across the stream-which it will be remembered was of consider-
able width at the point where they would have to cross-when the malay
proa suddenly hove in sight round a bend of the channel

   there was only one possible explanation of the reason why grant had not
seeii her in amole time to avoid capture and that was that whilst he had been
busy with the children on the eastern beach the proa must have been ap-
proaching from the westward which would cause her to be hidden from view
by the intervening high land


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   by what means however her crew had discovered the entrance to the
harbor must remain a mystery  probably it was the result of pure accident
for as has already been mentioned it was so artfully concealed that even
grant himself when voyaging to and fro in the raft curing the earlier
part of his sojourn upon the island had upon more than one occasion been
puzzled to find it

   be this as it may the moment of the proas arrival in the river was
a most unfortunate one for the occupants of the punt who were seen and
chased by the malajs the instant that their vessel rounded the point

   grant at once saw that escape for himself as well as for the children was
impossible  he was as near grant island as he was to the main and in which-
ever direction he headed he must inevitably be overtaken before he could
make good his retreat and with his usual promptitude he at once decided
to continue his course for the islet hoping to be able to make a sufficiently
long stand against the enemy to permit of the children gaining the safe refuge
of the fort

   he was hailed as soon as seen  but of course the only notice he took of
this was to urge the clumsy heavy punt with redoubled speed through the
water finding him so contumacious the malays then fired upon him several
times and succeeded in slightly wounding him in the head

   as the proa advanced further up the stream and drew closer and closer
still in under the lee of the high land the wind grew light and shy with her
and then perhaps fearing that after all their prey might escape them the
crew hastily launched a boat and gave chase in her

   but for that unlucky wound in the head it is possible that grant might
have succeeded in his plucky effort but though the bullet inflicted but little
actual damage the blow stunned and dazed him so that for a minute or two
he scarcely knew where he was or what he was doing trifling as was the
amount of time thus lost it was sufficient to ruin what little chance he
originally had  for when the punt at length grounded with a shock on the
sandy beach of the creek the malays were scarcely a dozen yards astern of
her and grant had only just time to lift the joungsters out on the sand to
give the hasty injunction run away home children as fast as ever you
can and to seize an oar in self defense when the enemy-nine of them-
were upon him

   of course armed as he was with no better weapon than a clumsy oar he
had no chance whatever against such overwhelming odds and though he
managed to fell three of his antagonists the fight had not lasted two min-
utes before his arms were pinioned from behind his feet tripped from under
him and himself made a prisoner he was quickly rolled over on his face
and his arms securely lashed behind him when this being satisfactorily
accomplished his captors raised him to his feet and conducting him to a
tree firmly bound him to its trunk

   the idea then seemed to occur to the malays that possibly the children
might not yet be beyond the reach of capture for two of them set off at a
run in pursuit along the path leading to the fort

   grant guessed only too surely at the object of this sudden and hurried
the mutiny on the flying cloud



departure and his heart sank with dismal apprehension as he thought of the
distance those little feet would have to traverse ere the refuge of the fort
would be won of their liability to become fagged and to lag upon the way
and of the fleetness of foot displayed by their cruel pursuers when starting
upon their relentless errand and when from the prolonged absence of the
pursuers apprehension was beginning to yield to a hope that the children were
safe he was plunged into the bitterest distress by the reappearance of one of
the miscreants roughly and cruelly dragging along by the arm his only son
percy the poor child crying bitterly with terror and the ruffianly usage to
wh  - he was being subjected

      on seeing his father the little fellow managed by a sudden and unex-
pectyeffort to break away from his captor and running up to grant em-
bi psim crying 
ime tw father make that cruel man leave me alone  he has been whipping
me a s- twisting my arm and hurting it so much that i can scarcely use
it mb dont let him touch me again father as he saw the malay approach-
ingarm with a scowl of hideous malignity upon his ugly features

   ch my darling boy i cannot help you groaned grant  would to god
that i could  hut you see they have bound me to this tree so that i cannot
move listen percy dear  we can do nothing at present but submit to
these men who have us in their power so you must just let them do what
they will with you my precious one  go with the man very quietly and then
perhaps he will not ill treat you any more  

    must i father asked the little fellow tearfully and looking at his
father in vague surprise at so seemingly heartless a command

     yes dear boy yes it is for your own good that i tell you to do this
answered grant brokenly for he keenly felt the unspoken reproach which he
saw in the childs eyes as the little fellow forlornly turned away and with a
piteous sob quietly surrendered himself to the brute who now again with
ruffianly violence seized upon his helpless victim

     oh dont  you hurt me so the poor little fellow suddenly screamed
out and the fathers heart swelled almost to bursting with impotent fury as
he saw the cruel clutch with which the wretch was digging his long thin
sinewy fingers into the tender flesh of the boys shoulder as he forced him to
an adjoining tree to which he forthwith proceeded to lash him drawing the
cord so tightly round the slender wrists that the little fellow fairly screamed
with the intolerable pain

     curse you   yelled grant now fairly stung to madness and foaming at
the mouth with fury   curse you fiend that you are   and as he hurled
forth words of rage and defiance he tugged and strained with such super-
human strength upon his bonds that the stout rope fairly cracked whilst it
cut into the flesh of his wrists down to the bone

    but the lashing was too strong to yield to even his frenzied efforts apart
from the fact that with his hands lashed behind him he had no opportunity
to exert his strength effectively and at length completely exhausted he was
fain to desist to the undisguised delight of a little knot of the malays who
had gathered round and were keenly enjoying the scene


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   so much pleasure indeed did they derive from it that they said something
to little percys tormentor which was evidently an incitement for him to
continue his ill treatment of the child for the fellow with an acquiescent
grin had no sooner finished his task of lashing the little fellow to the tree-
a task which he performed with the utmost deliberation anc gusto-than he
retired a pace or two contemplating the helplessness of his little victim with
malignant satisfaction and then with a glance toward grant and a few
laughing words to his companions he stepped forward and dealt the poor
child a savage blow upon the mouth with his clinched fist-sc cruel a blow that
it extorted another piercing scream of pain and terror from the sufferer and
caused his quivering lips to stream with blood

   grant said nothing this time nor did he renew his worse than useless
efforts to burst his bonds but he directed toward the fellow a look of such

                                                                                                                      - -a - l i

deadly ferocity that the wretch actually quailed under it and seem refif
enough to slink away into the background under cover of an order jli
another malay apparently one of the officers of the proa now steppesgr-
ward and gave him	 

   possibly the order given may have been to desist from further ill tfit-
ment of the child for the newcomer next said something to the group
of onlookers which caused them also to retire with many a backward glance
of animosity at grant which he returned with interest these dismissed
the officer if such he was looked at the sobbing childs bonds and with a
muttered word or two he proceeded to loosen them sufficiently to relieve the
little fellow from the cruel suffering they had caused him-a proceeding which
won for him a look of unspeakable gratitude from grant which seemed to be
not wholly unappreciated

   the loosening of his bonds afforded the poor child so much relief that he
now felt almost comfortable comparatively speaking and exhausted with
the pain and terror he had already endured he soon sank into a kind of
stupor which if it did not amount to actual insensibility approached it so
nearly as to afford the poor little fellow at least a temporary forgetfulness of
his situation and surroundings

   grant speaking quietly once or twice to him without obtaining a repty
at once saw with intense satisfaction the state his child had fallen into  and
to such a state of despair had he now been brought that he would have been
positively happy could he have been assured that his darling boy was dead
and beyond the reach of further suffering

   for as he now had leisure to reflect the future so far as they two were
concerned was without a single ray of hope to brighten it he knew of
course that those stanch comrades of his at the fort would not abandon him and
his child to the mercy of the malays without making some attempt at a res-
cue  but there were only three of them and what could three men however
brave do against such overwhelming odds unless acting upon the defensive
and behind stone walls 

   there indeed but not in the open field he had some hopes for them and
there he fully expected they would all very shortly have their hands full for
he momentarily expected to see the whole body of the malays-except of
the mutiny on the flying cloud



course a man or two to guard himself and his boy-move off to the attack of
the fort and if the attack failed as he hoped and believed it would the
malay loss would doubtless be very heavy  and he had heard quite enough of
their vindictive nature to feel assured they would take their revenge upon
him and percy yes the more he thought about it the more convinced did
he become that it was their doom to die

   well he murmured gods will be done it was best perhaps
that his child should die now young and innocent as he was  and as for
himself if he could but be satisfied that the little fellows death was quick
and easy he cared not how soon he followed him

   as he cogitated painfully over this problem he saw a party of twelve
malays detach themselves from the rest and move off in the direction of the
fort then after a considerable interval came the sounds of firing followed
some twenty minutes later by the return of four only put of the twelve

   a sickening fear came over grant at first that those in the fort had suc-
cumbed to the attack and that the eight absentees were remaining behind in
charge of the prisoners but a little reflection led him to believe that had
such been the case the prisoners would have been brought in triumph to the
malay camp

   could it be possible then he asked himself that the missing eight had
fallen in the attack  it might be so the bearing of the four who had re-
turned was anything but triumphant  and there was a great deal of excited
talk and gesticulation on their part seemingly in the nature of an explana-
tion and more excited talk among the others followed after a long and
stormy debate by the preparation and despatch of the letter the delivery of
which we witnessed in the preceding chapter

   this last act of the malays completely reassured grant as to the safety of
the fort and its inmates but it also confirmed him in his belief that his own
fate and that ot his child was sealed

chapter xxxv-fighting for life

   the messengers soon returned a few questions were put to them and
answered  a couple of sentries were posted with loaded muskets at the
entrance of the bushy path leading to the fort  a man was detailed to keep
watch upon the two prisoners  the watch fire was bountifully replenished 
and then the camp sank into a state of repose

 -the long weary trying night gradually wore to its close the moon
hung low in the western sky  the horizon to the eastward paled from violet
black to pearly gray  and -the stars in that quarter were beginning to lose
their luster

   the air which during the earlier hours of the night had been oppressively
sultry now came cool and refreshing to the fevered brows of the anxious
watchers the insects had subdued their irritating din as is their wont
toward the dawn  the watch fire had smoldered down to a heap of gray
feathery faintly glowing ashes  the two sentinels at the entrance of the
bushy path had ceased the alert pacing to and fro and having grounded


the mutiny on the flying cloud

their muskets were now drooping wearily upon them with their hands
crossed over the top of the barrels  while the malay who had been detailed
to watch the prisoners having some half a dozen times during the earlier
hours of the night tested their bonds and satisfied himself of their perfect
security was now seated on the ground beside his charges with his fingers
interlocked across his knees and his head bowed forward manifestly
napping

   the weariness of the long night had told upon both the prisoners their
conversation had first languished and then ceased altogether  but now the
cool fresh sweet smelling breeze had aroused them both grant first and
the poor tired out suffering child soon afterward  and while the first was
looking abroad over the tree tops at the brightening sky to the eastward and
thinking that now surely their fate must be drawing very nigh the little
fellow by his side stirred uneasily roused himself and put the question 

    father do you think that dr henderson and mr manners will come
and set us free  

   grant with their probable fate now apparently so near at hand was de-
bating witlfin himself what answer to return when his attertion was arrested
by a curious vibrating movement of his bonds as though they were being
tampered with from behind the tree to which he was bound before he could
collect his faculties sufficiently to even ask himself what it meant a low whis-
per from behind him caught his ear   hush  it is i-henderson 

   and at the same instant the ropes which bound him suddenly slackened
about his limbs and disappeared behind him then an arm appeared round
the bole of the tree and grant felt the cold barrel of a rifle being thrust into
his hand while the voice again whispered

    your own repeater fully loaded now to loose poor little percy

   then grant turned to his child-how white and haggard the dear little
fellow looked in the pallid light of the dawn-and with a heart brimful of
gratitude for the priceless gift of restored freedom said in reply to his
question 

    they are coming soon darling-now at oncein fact but percy dear
boy take care that you do not move or cry out when you feel the rope
loosening stand perfectly still and quiet my son until i tell you what
to do

   the little fellow looked eagerly up into his fathers face and whispered
 yes father and then grant saw his look of surprise as he felt hender-
sons hand releasing him

   the bonds fell away the child was free and presently grant saw a shad-
owy figure bend forward and whisper in the little fellows ear there was a
start a faint cry of rapture the little arms were flung lovingly round the
neck of the bending figure and grant caught the murmured the words 

    thank you dear doctor oh thank you 

   but that childish involuntary cry of delight faint as it was had caught
the quick ear of the dozing guard the fellow raised his head and seeing
that something was wrong-though he was still too drowsy to distinguish what
it was-scrambled to his feet and advanced toward grant
the mutiny on the flying cloud



    up to that moment the engineer had not moved  he was waiting for the
 blood to circulate once more in his cramped limbs and also for henderson to
 give him the cue for their next action

    he remained perfectly still until the malay had approached within arms
 length of him and then with a single lightning-like blow of his fist he
 dropped the fellow senseless upon the grass at his feet then swift as light
 he glided behind the tree where henderson stood with percy in his arms
 and convulsively gripping the others outstretched hand he murmured 

     a thousand thanks old fellow  now which way are we to go 

    i arranged for manners and nicholls to join us in the path yonder
 never dreaming that those two men would be posted there whispered hen-
 derson in return

     well come along then cheerfully observed grant  we shall have
 to shoot if they offer to oppose our passage ha  we shall be compelled to
 fight whether we will or not  that fellow whom i knocked down is reviving
 and he will raise the alarm before we have gone a dozen feet give me the
 child  my arms are still benumbed and scarcely fit to hold a rifle but i can
 carry him so that is it -as henderson handed over little percy- now

 	let us make a run for it  

    therewith the two friends started at top speed for the entrance of the
 path running straight toward the two malay sentinels

    no sooner however did they appear in the open than a cry was raised
 and in an instant the whole camp was on the alert some of the malays run-
 ning to intercept the fugitives whilst others hurriedly sprang for their mus-
 kets and opened a wild fusillade upon them

    the two sentinels faced about and seeing the white men running at once
 raised their weapons to their shoulders

     halt  cried grant setting percy down on the ground and facing about
 toward their pursuers   attend to those two sentries henderson  i will
 deal with the others 

    no sooner said than done henderson pulled up at once and coolly
 receiving the fire of the two malays-which however owing to their being
 hurried proved harmless-deliberately dropped them one after the other

     now on again  exclaimed the engineer snatching up his frightened
 child and regaining hendersons side as they ran henderson placed a
 whistle between his lips and blew a single short piercing call upon it that
 will soon bring the other two to our help he gasped

    they were by this time within a hundred feet of the border of the woods 
 but the light heeled malays were close behind them the time for decisive
 action had arrived

    seeing this grant once more placed his child on the ground and said 

     now run home as fast as you can dear boy and tell mother that the
 doctor and i hope to be with her in a quarter of an hour  

     then as the little fellow made off at top speed the father added  thank
 god his retreat is secured if we can hold out for ten minutes now hender-
 son true and trusty comrade let us make a stand here and shoulder to
 shoulder show these rascals how we can fight  


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   so without another word the two friends turned and stood at bay
finding time to bring down two of their foes before they were closed
with

   and then began a battle fierce and grim - sixteen malays to two
americans

    luckily for the smaller party the malays had at the beg inning of the dis-
turbance emptied their pieces ineffectually and had found no time to reload
them while henderson had provided himself in addition to the two repeat-
ing rifles with a brace of loaded chambered revolvers one of which he now
handed to grant with these and their clubbed rifles the two men fought
so desperately that not only were the malays effectually checked in their at-
tempt at an outflanking movement but actually foiled in their intention to
bear down the two men by sheer force of numbers and brute strength

   swinging their rifles club-wise with one hand and firing their revolvers
with the other whenever they saw a chance of making a shot tell the two
wrought such terrible execution that at length the malays drew back
confounded

   at this moment a cheer was heard close at hand and in another instant
up dashed manners and nicliolls breathless with hard running and placed
themselves on each side of their countrymen

    now let us give them a volley cried grant-who his blood fairly 
boiling at the recollection of the past night had been fighting like a demon-
and at the word up went the four rifles to the  present

    choose each his man   ordered the inexorable engineer and then out
rang the four pieces leaving three foes the less to deal with

   hark  what was that  not an echo of the rifle shots surely no it was
the boom of a distant gun unless the ears of all strangely deceived them

   whatever it was the malays also heard the sound and looking for an
instant in consternation at one another wavered turned and fled

   hurrah cried grant exultantly rescue is at hand after the
rascals and give them a lesson they will never forget 

   it was perhaps an imprudent thing to do but away after the flying foe
went the four men popping away with their revolvers and so severely gall-
ing the malays that sauve quipeut quickly became the word with the latter
who now evidently thought of nothing but how to reach their boats alive

    one in his frantic haste stumbled and fell revealing his features to grant
as he did so it was the wretch who had so cruelly ill treated little percy

   with a couple of bounds the engineer was upon him wresting the creese
from the fellows hand grant seized him by the collar and dragged him
along the ground writhing to a clump of canes growing close at hand
with his foot on the mans neck to keep him down the engineer then cut
with the creese a stout pliant cane lifted the wretch to his feet by main
strength and dropping his weapons to the ground and still retaining his
grip upon the fellows collar deliberately thrashed him until the cane was
split into ribbons and the clothes literally cut from his back finally dismiss-
ing him with a kick which-apart from the thrashing-it is safe to say that
malay will never forget so long as life shall last
the mutiny on the flying cloud	

   the unfortunate wretch hobbled off with remarkable celerity-considering
that every bone in his body must have been aching-eager to overtake his
comrades whose speed had been materially increased not only by the
heat with which they were pursued but also by the booming of the guns in
the offing

   grant folkwed more leisurely for in common with his three friends he
had suffered somewhat in the melee-though fortunately none of them was
seriously hurt-and he reached the cove just in time to witness the hasty de-
parture of the proa

    he seized this the first opportunity which had presented itself to heartily
thank his companions for their gallant rescue of himself and his child
inquired anxiously after the safety of the little lucille and then said 

     i have teen wondering what can be the meaning of that firing in the
offing i cannot help thinking it is intended as a signal of some kind to us
and assuming that to be the case i can only account for it upon the pleasant
supposition that captain blake instead of perishing in the hurricane as we
feared must have in some miraculous manner escaped  and that it is he
who is now outside on board of a rescue ship come to take us all off the
island i think it would be well if you manners were to take the punt
and with nicholls go out as far as the harbors mouth to reconnoiter tak-
ing care not to show yourselves until you are quite certain that the craft
is a friendly one

   the two men named eagerly adopted the suggestion and a minute later
were afloat and pulling rapidly down stream

   as soon as they were fairly off grant turned to henderson and said

    and now my dear fellow i think i will walk as far as the fort to ex-
change a word or two with ida and assure them all of our safety and then i
will rejoin you here to await the tidings from outside

   meanwhile manners and nicholls pushing off into the strength of the cur-
rent sped rapidly toward the two headlands which guarded the harbors
motjth  arriving at which they landed hauled the punt up on the beach and
made their way through the bushes to a point from which themselves unseen
they could get a clear view of the open sea

   and then what an exhilarating sight met their delighted eyes 

   a large full rigged ship lay in the offing about a mile distant hove to
under her three topsails spanker and jib

   manners happened to have in his pocket a small telescope which he always
carried about with him and this he quickly brought to bear upon the stranger
watching him eagerly nicholls observed him change color  a perplexed ex-
pression passed over his face his hand trembled for two long minutes he
remained steadfastly peering through the telescope  then he suddenly closed
it with an excited exclamation

chapter xxxvi-at island harbor

   turning for a while from the marooned passengers of the flying cloud
and their exciting experiences on refuge island we must take up the story

      l


the mutiny on the flying cloud

of the mutineers and their two prisoners in the retreat which captain josh
williams had christened island harbor

   in accordance with williams plans the clouds cargo was in due time
discharged and warehoused on shore in the newly built stores the ship her-
self stripped hove down scrubbed and repainted from her keel up  her in-
terior rearranged-particularly the forecastle which was extended sufficiently
to accommodate a hundred men the upper spars replaced by new ones
somewhat higher in the hoist cut on the island  her canvas altered to fit the
new spars  the bulwarks strengthened and pierced  the breech loading guns
twelve in number mounted on carriages and placed in position in short
the ship was made to look as like a man of war as possible though she as
much resembled the old fashioned sailing sloop which then still performed
duty on our more distant stations as a swan does a goose her sailing powers
far exceeding those of the fastest of them while williams alterations only
had the effect of imparting to her an extremely rakish and wicked appear-
ance

   in due time-not a very long time either taking into consideration the
amount of work done-the ship was once more ready for sea and ballasted
carefully down to her very best sailing trim she left island harbor for an
extensive piratical cruise

    it is not necessary to describe in detail where she went or the various ad-
ventures met with by her crew  suffice it to say that the cruise proved wou-
derfully successful several very valuable prizes being taken-no less than
three being vessels with large amounts of specie on board

   when williams first mooted to the crew his proposal to seize the ship and
convert her into a pirate he had met the strongest objection made by the
more scrupulous of the men by asserting that he had a plan whereby all blood-
shed could be avoided  this plan being no less than to practically enslave
such portions of the crews of the prospective prizes as refused to become
pirates and to confine them at island harbor there to perform the large
amount of work necessary to the complete furtherance of williams ambitious
schemes

   but as may be supposed the plan when put to a practical test failed
capture was not in all cases tamely submitted to-resistance was offered and
blood was shed in the conflict and when this had once happened all scru-
ples vanished the worst passions of the men asserted themselves and
breaking loose from all restraint speedily converted their possessors into very
demons

   sibyl stanley was daily and hourly in peril during the latter part of that
dreadful cruise still thanks to the compact with ned wilson and the hold
which he still had upon the crew the unhappy girl had so far escaped direct
threats and open insult

   but toward the end of the cruise matters had reached such a stage that
she saw the absolute necessity of effecting her escape immediately upon the
arrival of the ship again at island harbor the state of horror and terror
into which she was continually thrown was such that death itself seemed
preferable to a further continuance of such a life as she was then living
the mutiny on the flying cloud



    at length the ship once more glided into the secure haven of island har
bor and about five oclock in the evening let go her anchor the sails were
furled anyhow-discipline having by this time grown very lax on board the
flying cloud notwithstanding all william efforts to maintain it-and then
the men without going through the formality of asking leave lowered the
boats and went ashore in a body  sibyl ned and williams were left to fol-
low if they chose in the dingey which they did the steward being ordered
to remain on board for the night as anchor watch

   when the dingey reached the shore its occupants discovered that the
ships crew-among whom were several new hands who had joined from the
prizes-had already seized a cask of spirits and were evidently bent upon a
carouse in celebration of the successful completion of their first cruise

   they were then only rough and noisy the liquor not having had time to
operate but an hour later the entire band with a very few exceptions had
 become converted into a howling mob of drunken desperadoes ripe and eager
for any species of ruffianism which might suggest itself

   sibyl was at this time busy putting matters to rights in the hut which
ned had caused to be erected on their previous visit to the island and ned was
busy in the same way in his tent when williams happening to pass by
looked in at the latter

    hark ye youngster he gruffly remarked  you and the young woman
had better keep well out of sight tonight for if either of you are seen mis-
chief may come of it and whilst those beasts up there are in their present
condition neither i nor anybody else could help you the rascals are mad
drunk and hungry for mischief they positively laughed at me just now
when i tried to bring them to something like order but if i dont make
them smart for it tomorrow when we start to overhaul the rigging call me a
dutchman

   coupled with what he had already seen and heard this warning of wil-
liams so seriously impressed ned that he went to sibyls door and called to
her to put on her hat and join him outside as soon as she appeared ned
said 

   look here miss stanley williams has just been here to tell me that
the men up there are mad with drink and-as he phrased it-hungry for mis-
chief judging from the frightful noise and commotion among them i
should say he is right and i have called you out to tell you that i think it
will be best for you and me to return on board the ship  the steward is there
you know and he and i can keep the anchor watch between us whilst you
take your rest as usual in your cabin

    sibyl had long ago come to the conclusion that she could do no better than
follow poor captain blakes advice and unreservedly follow neds instruc-
tions so she at once announced her readiness to do whatever he thought
best upon this ned believing that no time was to be lost at once extin-
guished the lights and locking the door placed the key in his pocket after
which taking a somewhat circuitous route in order to avoid attracting atten-
tion he and sibyl made their way down to the spot where they had left the
dingey


the mutiny on the flying cloud

    the boat was still there with her oars and rowlocks in her just as she had
been left handing his companion in and instructing her to sit steady ned
placed his shoulder against the stem of the boat and with a powerful shove
sent her stern foremost off the beach springing over the bcws as he did so

   there was a bright moon nearly full riding high in the sky and ned
was rather apprehensive that this movement might attract attention and
provoke pursuit but the men had for some reason or other kindled a
large fire round which they were holding their carouse and the young
sailor could only hope that the brilliant blaze would dazzle their eyes
and blind them to everything beyond the circle of its influence perhaps
it did so for there was no sign of pursuit 

    ned had never allowed the idea of escape to be absent from his thoughts for
a single day since the memorable one upon which the ship had first been seized 
but fertile as he usually was in resource he had never been able to think of
anything practicable except that of seeking a refuge in the treasure cave 
and this scheme was open to so many serious objections that he and sibyl
had agreed together that it must not be adopted except as a very last resource

   now however as the dingey approached the ship and ned gazed admir-
ingly aloft at the tall graceful spars and complicated network of rigging and
reflected that at that moment the beautiful fabric was in charge of only one
man-and that man friendly to him as he had long ago ascertained-a daring
idea suddenly took possession of him and without giving himself time to
reflect he there and then resolved upon its execution

chapter xxxvii-a daring plan

   the wind was blowing moderately fresh from the northwest  but so
secure was the anchorage and so good the holding ground that on arriving
on board ned was not at all surprised to find that the steward instead of
keeping watch had gone below and turned in trusting to luck that once on
shore nobody would dream of going off again to the ship that night

   this arrangement however though it might be perfectly satisfactory to
the steward by no means suited ned who at once went below and uncere-
moniously routed the poor man out of his berth

    price said he  i have something of the utmost importance to say to
you i have noticed that in the course of conversation when nobody else
has been present you have frequently gone out of your way to remind me
that i am an unwilling member of the piratical crew in the midst of which
we find ourselves  and you have also dropped sundry hints that if ever i hit
upon a way of escape you will be more than pleased to accompany me now
i want to know exactly what you have meant by this  

   just exactly what i have said mr wilson or rather what you have
said answered price i joined the party because i had no fancy for
being left to die on a desert island like those unfortunate passengers or the
poor skipper and mr manners  but i didnt know then what was before me
sir i am a peaceable man i am and though ive had no hand in any of
the bloodshed that has occurred since we sailed from here i know that murder
the mutiny on the flying cloud



has been commited and i want to separate myself from the murderers if i
could i would have prevented the mutiny in the first place  but i never knew

that anything serious was intended-

   well never mind about that just now interrupted ned the
present question is this if i happened to have formed a plan of escape-
a plan we will say involving a considerable amount of risk and a great deal
of hard work would you be willing to join me in it

    would i  only try me mr wilson-try me sir  why there is no
risk no labor i would not willingly face for a good chance to escape from
that pack of yelling savages over yonder why what are they doing now
sir  blest if it doesnt look as though they had been and set fire to the hut
sir 

    ned raninto the saloon and brought the glass on deck

     they have  he exclaimed looking through the instrument at a bright
blaze which was leaping up among the trees on shore  well never mind
he continued  it does not matter for i intend attempting an escape from
them tonight-now at once-and glad enough shall i be to have your

assistance i intend nothing less than to run off with the ship  so- 

   to run off with the ship echoed price oh mr wilson we can

never do that sir-

     i shall try at all events interrupted ned  so while i slip out and
cast loose the jib do you go below to the boatswains locker and bring me
a cold chivsel and a good heavy hammer and well cut the cable

    without further parley price did as he was bidden and very soon he and
ned were busy knocking out the pin from the shackle in the cable which
happened to be nearest the hawse pipe the job occupied them fully a quar-
ter of an hour for the pipe was rusted in  but at length out it came and in
another minute away went the end of the cable out through the hawse pipe
and into the water with a loud rattle and a splash

     so far so good said ned  now price i want you to take the glass
and keep a sharp watch upon the shore the ship is now adrift and driving
slowly stern foremost toward the outer basin so long as we see no sign of
alarm from the people on shore i shall let her drift that will increase our
chances of a good start but the moment you see any indication of an
attempt to launch a boat give me the word  and we must then get the jib on
the ship and put her head round there is a fine breeze blowing and if we
can only get outside the heads without being overtaken i have no fears
whatever  	a

    so saying ned ran aft and placed himself at the wheel which he manip-
ulated in such a way as to keep the ship head to the wind with her bowrs
pointing toward the shore thus keeping up the appearance that she was still
riding to her anchor price meanwhile posted himself on the forecastle and
kept the telescope leveled at the shore

    for some time all went well the ship under the influence of the fresh
breeze which affected her with increasing power as she lengthened her dis-
tance from the land drove steadily astern and still no warning word came
from price


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   at length however when she had drifted about a mile and had arrived
within about a mile and three quarters of the contracted channel between
the north and south bluffs which divided the inner from the outer basin the
steward cried out 

   they are after us mr wilson  i can see the flash of oars in the moon-
light  

    all right   answered ned sending the wheel hard over with a spin
and leaving it to rush forward now price aft with the starboard jib
sheets and belay them-not too flat man  let them flow a bit-so thats
well  now tail on here to the halyards with me and let us set the sail up
with it  thats your sort  now take it under the belaying pin and let me
browse it up yo-ho  ho-hip  ho-ho  belay that  now the main topmast
stay-sail let go the down-haul  that is it that rope you have your hand on-
cast it off  thats right here are the sheets  hook the clips into the ring
bolt there close to the second gun that is all right now take a turn with
the running part round that cleat  capital  now wait a moment  

   the ship was by this time broadside on to the wind and gathering head-
way under the powerful influence of the jib necessitating a hand at the
wheel ned therefore ran aft and summoning the astonished sibyl from her
cabin where she was making preparations for passing another night on board
he sent her to the wheel with instructions how to act but concealing from
her for the present the fact that they were pursued

   with the aid of the winch the two men succeeded in getting the main
topmast staysail set after which they hauled out the spanker they were
now running for the passage between the two bluffs with the wind over their
starboard quarter the ship in her best possible sailing trim and going
through the water at a speed of nearly three knots

   this however was not fast enough to suit ned for though they had
secured a capital start and he conjectured that the pursuers were too thor-
oughly intoxicated to be capable of pulling a boat at any very great speed he
knew that at the southwestern extremity of the outer basin they would reach
the most difficult part of their navigation

   this consisted of a channel only half a mile in width by about a mile and
a quarter in length bending to the southeast where the ship would be
almost completely becalmed under the high land and it was here if any-
where that he expected to be overtaken

   so without wasting time in ascertaining the whereabouts of the pursuing
boat he hurriedoft and cast off the lashing from the main topgallant stay-
sail and sending the sheets down on deck descended and helped price to
set the sail

   	chapter xxxviii-the pursuit

   ned now had as much canvas upon the flying cloud as he believed he
and the steward could conveniently manage for the present he was there-
fore compelled to content himself with making a tour of the decks and so
trimming the sheets that the different sails set should draw to the utmost
advantage
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   then and not until then did he allow himself leisure to take a peep
through the glass at what was going on astern the sight which met his
eyes was by no means reassuring for he now saw that there were no less
than three boats in pursuit the foremost of which-one of the gigs- was
distinctly gaining upon him

    if they have nofirearms with them said ned to price  i think we
may perhaps be able to keep them from boarding even in the event of their
overtaking us  and in any case i think it will be advisable to have up on
deck and load a few of those rifles from the arm chest for having gone so
far it will never do now for us to allow ourselves to be taken get the keys
of the arm chest and magazine joe and bring up a couple of dozen rifles
and a few packets of cartridges  

   the rifles were brought on deck and loaded carefully half of them being
stacked in the waist of the ship whilst the other half with a liberal supply
of ammunition were taken up on the after house

   by the time that this was done the ship had reached the passage between
the bluffs and as soon as she was fairly through ned kept away dead before
the wind for the mouth of the  narrows as the contracted entrance chan-
nel was called

   the ship being under fore and aft canvas only this alteration in her
course was a disadvantage rather than otherwise the staysails refusing to
stand properly  moreover the high land was now once more close aboard of
them on both quarters rendering the wind light and shifty in consequence
of which the ship lost way perceptibly

   the ship was fully half way across the outer basin when the gig-the
leading boat-opened fire upon her the weapon fired was evidently a rifle
for though the boat was half a mile astern ned distinctly heard the whistle
of the bullet overhead showing not only that they were well within the
range of the piece but also that it had been skilfully and steadily aimed a
circumstance which led him to conjecture that williams probably the only
perfectly sober man in the entire crew must be in charge of the boat

   the ship being thus proved to be within range ned now took the wheel
himself sending sibyl below to the saloon with instructions not to venture
from thence out on deck until he should intimate to her that she could do so
with safety

   the sheets now had to be trimmed over but the ship being found to steer
herself this was not a matter of very great difficulty ned leaving the helm
to itself for the short time necessary to enable him and price to perform the
operation when he returned to his post he was greatly concerned to dis-
cover that the gig was less than a quarter of a mile astern and coming up
rapidly though from the uusteady way in which the oars were being
handled it was evident that the crew were pretty nearly exhausted with
their long pull

   the fugitives were now fairly within the narrows and in their narrowest
part moreover  the shore being within a quarter of a mile of them on either
hand this of itself would have been a matter of no consequence however
had the configuration of the land been different but unfortunately the


the mutiny on the flying cloud

cliffs towered high above the mastheads on both sides of the ship and as the
wind happened to be blowdng athwart the channel the canvas was almost
becalmed  indeed had it not been for the little draft of air which now and
then came down the channel astern of her the flying cloud would have lost
headway altogether

   as it was she still moved through the water though at a speed barely
sufficient to give her steerage way  and the crew of the gig seeing her
almost helpless condition raised a loud confused shout which they doubt-
less meant for a cheer and redoubled their efforts at the oars

   they saw the pirate raise his rifle and take a long steady aim then came
the flash

   the bullet struck the taffrail just at tlieir feet williams dashed the
piece down savagely disappointed at his ill success  and ned stepped o the
wheel and gave it a slight adjusting touch

   when he turned again williams was standing up in the boat with his
hands to his mouth and next moment came the hail 

     cloud ahoy  if you will heave to at once i solemnly swear that no
harm will come to either of you i will pass over and forgive your mad at-
tempt to run away with the ship  but if jou compel us to pull alongside
and recapture her look out  your punishment will be such that i will
make you positively pray to be put out of your misery do you hear me   

     i can see his eyes now said ned  i will fire first and directly the
smoke clears away you must follow suit take care to fire into the thick of
the crew so as to do all the mischief possible now 

   as ned spoke he leveled his piece and aiming carefully pulled the
trigger

   simultaneously with the report came a sharp yell of agony and a groan
and as the smoke drifted away two oars were seen to drop overboard and
twro forms to sink down into the bottom of the boat

chapter xxxix-the flying clouds escape

   ned wilsons successful shot caused some confusion in the pirates boat
which was increased when price the steward fired his rifle and williams
was seen to spring convulsively from his seat and fall forward the pur-
suit was now suspended for a time and ned went back to the flying clouds
helm

   by this time the ship having drifted past the highest point of land to
windward once more began to feel the breeze  and when the gig-having
lost a good hundred yards distance-again resumed the chase the ship was
creeping ahead at a speed of fully three knots with the wind coming truer
and fresher at every fathom of progress

   the men in the gig pulled furiously but ten minutes later the flying cloud
glided past the last point of land and was rising and falling on the open ocean

   as soon as the ship was fairly clear of the harbor ned kept her away on
a southwest course for the island on which the skipper and manners had been
lauded  and such excellent progress did they make that on the day but one
the mutiny on the flying cloud



following that of their escape from island harbor they had the satisfaction
of heaving to the ship off the skippers island here the colors were hoisted
and a gun was fired at frequent intervals a keen scrutiny of the island being
maintained meanwhile with the aid of the telescope so that if the captain
and manners were still there they might have an opportunity afforded them
to paddle off to the ship or at least to signal their presence

   hour after hour passed away however without any sign being discovered
of the existence of living beings upon the island  and at length just as
the sun was setting ned headed the ship about and laid his course for
refuge island shrewdly surmising that the skipper and manners had found
means to rejoin the passengers

   the mountain  refuge island was made out about three oclock next
morning from the deck of the flying cloud the atmosphere being some-
what hazy at the time  and daybreak found the ship off the northeastern
extremity of the island some two miles distant when the colors were again
hoisted and guns fired as before the reports serving as has already been
seen to greatly disconcert the malays and expedite their departure

   the first thing seen by the anxious watchers on the-ships deck was the
proa crowding sail out of the harbor a sight which filled them with the
keenest anxiety j and ned thinking it possible that his friends might at that
moment be prisoners on board the vessel was busying himself in making
preparations to open fire upon her with the hope that he might be able to
dismast her and so frustrate her attempt to escape when his mind was set at
rest by the sight of the punt pulling off with manners and nicholls in her

   running down toward the tiny craft ned and his companions soon had
the satisfaction of shaking hands with their two former shipmates after
which came mutual hurried inquiries and explanations in which on the part
of the islanders the adventures of the past night naturally occupied an im-
portantplace

   for the mouth of the harbor the flying cloud was now headed under
manners pilotage and half an hour later she rounded to and let go her
anchor in mid stream exactly opposite the creek to the unbounded astonish-
ment and delight of henderson and grant

   the delight and exultation of all hands when at length a general meeting
took place at the fort must be left to the lively imagination of the reader  an
entire chapter would be needed for its adequate portrayal suffice it to say
that there was only one bitter drop in the cup of happiness quaffed by the
party that morning and that was the sad loss of poor captain blake which
ned felt with exceptional keenness not only because it was wholly unex-
pected by him but also because he had ever since making good his escape
been looking forward with pleasurable anticipation to the moment when he
should be able to hand over the ship to her rightful commander

chapter xl-the launch of the petrel

   the whole of that day was spent by the party in the interchange of a
full and detailed recital of the various events which had transpired since the
	the mutiny on the flying cloud

moment of their separation  and when it came to neds turn he was as may
be supposed especially eloquent upon the subject of the treasure which he
had discovered

   his description of the contents of the cave together with the exhibition
of the pearls and precious stones already securedmade a profound impression
upon his hearers who fully agreed with him that such vast possibilities of
wealth were not to be lightly abandoned

   how to secure it was however the question-a question which ned
solved the moment he set eyes upon the petrel he proposed that she
should at once be completed and launched and that whilst the rest of the
party should effect a leisurely removal of themselves and whatever they
wished to take with them on board the flying cloud he with manners
should proceed in the cutter to josh williams island and watching their
opportunity run in during the night secure the treasure and leave again
next morning-as they could easily manage to do-before the pirates could
gain an idea of their being at hand

   it was a risky thing to attempt certainly though not nearly so risky as
it at first sight appears  and after a full and exhaustive discussion of the
chances for and against success the bold scheme was agreed to

   accordingly on the following morning all hands went to work with a
will  and they labored to such good purpose that the last finishing touches
were put to the little craft on the fridar following leaving nothing to be
done on the saturday but the actual launching and such trimming of the
ballast as might be found necessary when she was afloat

   the launch was effected successfully the ceremony of christening being
performed by little tucille  and it being found when the craft was afloat
that only a very trifling alteration was necessary in the distribution of the
ballast the alteration was at once made after which all hands repaired on
board sail was made and they went outside to try the cutters pacel the
result was more than satisfactory-it was a delightful surprise  for not only
in her seagoing powers but also in the qualities of speed and weatherliness
did the petrel far exceed the most sanguine anticipations of everybody in-
cluding her designer they worked to windward for about three hours and
then returned to the harbor where the remainder of the day was spent in
getting on board the provisions water and other necessaries for the projected
trip

   on the following monday the petrel sailed for island harbor with ned
as skipper and manners as mate cook steward and crew all rolled into one
-the adventurers receiving all sorts of cautions and good wishes as they said
good by at the cove

   the course to be steered was northeast or nearly dead to windward as the
wind stood at that season and the distance was about three hundred miles 
so it was calculated that the trip there and back would occupy about a week
but no sooner were they fairly outside the harbors mouth than ned and
manners exchanged the opinion that a smart little weatherly fore and aft
rigged craft like the petrel ought to do the distance in considerably less than
the time specified  and they forthwith took measures to practical demon-
the mutiny on the flying cloud

i

strate the soundness of that opinion  carrying on sail to such a daring
extent that even captain blake would have remonstrated had he been with
them

   the craft however was stanch the spars and rigging sound the canvas
new  and the youthful mariners though daring were by no means reckless
the weather also was settled and the wind steady if somewhat fresh all
therefore went well with them and so thoroughly did the cutter answer the
expectations of her crew that at dawn on the wednesday morning-the
second day out-the high laud of island harbor was distinctly visible from
the deck showing just above the horizon like a sharply defined purplish gray
blot upon the sky to windward

   at the same time the adventurers also made out something else to wit a
fleet of five sail of small craft dead to windward-in fact immediately between
the cutter and the island

   at first they were considerably puzzled to determine the character of
these small craft which were steering due west  but at length as they
closed and became more distinctly visible ned was enabled to solve the
riddle the fleet was none other than the boats belonging to the flying
cloud 

chapter xli-homeward bound

   ned conjectured that the hasty abandonment of island harbor indicated
by the appearance of the boats at sea arose either from a fear that ned might
give such information of the existence of the place as would lead to the
speedy capture of its occupants or a determination on the part of the dis-
comfited pirates to seek at sea a substitute for the noble ship of which they
had been so cleverly deprived

   whichever-if either-of these surmises might have been the correct one
a very lively interest in the movements of the petrel was speedily manifested
by the occupants of the boats makeshift signals of distress being promptly
displayed on each craft ned paid attention to these to the extent of closing
with the fleet sufficiently to enable him to establish their identity beyond
question after which he calmly made arrangements to avoid them

   when this was seen the boats hauled up in pursuit but they might as
well have attempted to pursue the sea birds which hovered in their wake
ned so maneuvered as to pass the nearest boat well out of rifle shot at the
same time steering such a course as would be unlikely to excite any suspicion
that he was bound to island harbor  and though the pursuit was maintained
for nearly an hour its hopelessness had by that time become so apparent that
the boats again bore up and were soon afterward lost to view in the western
board

   for the information of those interested in the ultimate fate of the pirates
it may be as well to mention here that they were from that time never more
seen or heard of

   it was just noon that day when the petrel entered the narrows  and
all fear of discovery by the pirates being now at an end ned took her directly


the mutiny on the flying cloud

alongside the cliff immediately underneath the entrance to the treasure cave
and began the shipment of the treasure

   this was an easy and expeditious task the jars of gold dust and the gold
bricks being simply slung at the end of a line and lowered down the cliff to
manners who received them below the casket with the remainder of the
gems was not forgotten  and a bale of embroidered stuffs which sibyl had
declared to be of priceless value was also taken as were such of the shields
and weapons as would bear handling-grant and henderson having expressed
a very particular wish to possess some of these as quite unique curiosities
but the ivory and the other bulky articles were left for the benefit of whom-
soever might choose to go after them

   the shipment was completed in about three hours after which ned
entered the inner basin and worked up as far as the anchorage which spot
was indicated by the buoy still watching over the slipped anchor

   though nobody was to be seen and the storehouses had all the appear-
ance of being completely abandoned the voyagers were far too prudent to
land-for which indeed there was no inducement-and having satisfied
their curiosity they wore round and proceeded at once to sea passing out
through the narrows again just as the sun was setting

   thirty six hours later or about six oclock on the following friday morn-
ing they once more entered grants harbor and let go their anchor to the
accompaniment of a surprised and delighted shout of welcome from nicholls
who-the entire party having removed on board the flying cloud-happened
to be keeping the anchor watch at the time

   but little more remains to be told the whole party made sail in the
flying cloud for batavia in java the nearest port which was reached
after a short but toilsome passage here they were fortunate enough to pick
up the shipwrecked crew of a new york ship who were only too glad to ship
for the passage home especially as ned felt justified in offering them the top
scale of wages  and the owners of the cloud having been telegraphed to and
letters written by all hands advising their friends of their safety sail was
once more made this time for new york direct on the voyage home the
flying cloud fully justified the name which had been bestowed upon her 
for carrying on night and day ned succeeded in making the fastest passage
on record from anjer to sandy hook the latter was sighted one fine even-
ing in april nearly two years after the ship had last passed it

   gayly the good ship had stemmed the tide as she plowed her stately way
up the harbor in the wake of a tug next morning and a right noble and
beautiful sight did she present in all the glory of fresh paint and newly
blacked rigging-laid on during the spell of fine weather experienced just
before reaching sandy hook-with her white canvas snugly stowed yards
laid accurately square running rigging hauled taut and neatly coiled down
and flag at each mast

   many were the admiring glances bestowed upon her from the craft which
were passing either going up or down the harbor-for being only in deep
ballast trim she towed light and passed ahead of nearly all the inward bound
craft-and at length a great bluff bowed deep laden bark was overtaken the
the mutiny on the flying cloud



quarter deck occupants of which appeared to manifest not only admiration
but quite a surprising amount of curiosity as the two vessels closed

   at length as the flying cloud ranged up on the port quarter of the bark
an excited figure appeared to suddenly go demented altogether for rushing
to the barks gangway he threw himself over rather than descended the ves-
sels side into a boat which was towing alongside and with imperious gestures
seemed to command the boatmen to convey him to the approaching ship

   they obeyed and the distance between the two vessels being but short
in less than a minute a voice-well known notwithstanding its excited ex-
ultant ring-hailed 

    flying cloud ahoy  heave us a ropes end will ye and let your captain
come on board   

   with a delighted shout the old hands rushed to the gangway ned fore-
most  the ropes end was thrown the boat sheered alongside and in another
moment captain blake alive well and as hearty as ever stood once more
on his own quarter deck shaking hands convulsively with everybody who
came near him with the unheeded tears chasing each other down his cheeks
as he huskily replied to the enthusiastic greetings of those who had long ago
given him up for lost

   his story was a long one but it may be condensed into a few words the
raft contrary to all expectation had held together and lived through the
terrific hurricane before which it was driven furiously to the southward to
be wrecked eventually upon a small islet whence after many months of
hardship and privation the skipper had been rescued by a sandal wood trader
and conveyed to singapore

   he there joined the bark homeward bound the hospitable skipper gladly
offering him a passage and by a singular coincidence had arrived in new
york harbor only an hour or two ahead of his own ship

   the arrival home of the vessel so long overdue and the publication of the
adventures of those who went out and came home again in her created a pro-
found sensation almost throughout the length and breadth of america  but
it was soon obliterated by the occurrence of events of greater importance to
the community at large and the chief personages of the story were allowed
to sink back into a welcome obscurity although the public interest in the
subject was fitfully revived from time to time by accounts of proceedings in
connection with the restoration as far as possible to its rightful owners of
the booty brought home in the flying clouds hold

   like most seamen ned was generosity itself and had he been allowed to
have his way the treasure found at island harbor would have been equally
divided among all those who had participated with him in that adventurous
voyage  but to such a proposal of course not one of the interested parties
would listen nicholls and price however eventually consented to accept a
moderate pension and the doctor and the engineer point proudly to their
trophies of ancient arms as they tell the story connected with them to their
friends

   captain blake still commands the flying cloud ship and captain alike
being the most popular in the trade  and bob manners was at latest accounts

the end

over the danger line

a thrilling experience on a fishing trip-face to face with eternity on the brink of niagaras
precipice-the mistaken impression that brought two men to the verge of death

j t was midsummer and a college classmate and i were camping on one of
the little islands that dot the upper niagara river the next years prizes
in latin and mathematics had constrained each of us to include in our
outfit books that could not be termed light and we devoted a part of each
day to earnest study nevertheless we found plenty of time for sport we
soon became familiar with all the usual best spots for fishing these
places although not exhausted had by degrees lost their charm we longed
for a change for novelty and our desire was unexpectedly fulfilled

   we had rowed down toward the head of goat island and were foolishly
permitting ourselves to experience the thrilling sensation of approaching the
danger line the uncertain boundary between safety and the possibility of
being drawn into the rapids that begin nearly a mile above the great pre-
cipice my friend was rowing and i was idly trolling but wdth no thought
of sport suddenly i felt a fierce tug at my line nothing but a black bass
and a large one could show such vim and so it proved after an exciting
battle a beauty was lauded in the boat

   the next day and for several succeeding days we returned to this place
and gradually became familiar with its characteristics the favorite place
for the fish seemed to be well down toward the head of goat island where the
water divides part to go over the american falls and part to go over the
horse shoe i hardly think that the selection of this place necessarily indi-
cated an intelligent design on the part of the fish but it is certain that in
this spot they will ever experience the greatest possible immunity from
fishermen the place was much farther down than we dared to venture

   to overcome this difficulty we added to the length of our line more and
more till we arrived at the measurement which appeared to give the best re-
sult we also gained in experience as to just how far it was safe to go with
our boat we would let ourselves drift down streamtill by pulling an easy
steady stroke the effect of the current would be neutralized while one
rowed the other would slowly let out the line it seldom happened that this
would be exhausted before a capture was effected

   it was the close of our summer vacation when late one afternoon we
sought the usual location for a farewell bit of sport our luck had been even
better than usual my friend was rowing and i had let out the line by
mutual agreement for the last time
over the danger line



    it had gone nearly to its full length when i felt a suddeu jerk then a
steady pull  this is the pick of the tribe i called to my companion over
my shoulder the victim was making a glorious struggle we both be-
came excited the strain on the line would relax for a moment only to be
increased till i feared it would part i began to pull in slowly at first and
then more rapidly as our game seemed to become exhausted my frieud and
i meanwhile kept up a running fire of comment i expected every moment
to catch a glimpse of a shining struggling body

    the line was nearly in and the strain had diminished to almost nothing
i looked into the water beneath the line seemed almost perpendicular then
the boat passed over it i was startled and looked around the hook had
been caught in a snag or fissure of the rock and all the time i had been pull-
ing in i had in reality been slowly but surely pulling the boat toward the
awful precipice whose mighty roar seemed to sound our doom

   for a moment i was paralyzed i tried to speak i could not force a
sound from my lips at last after what seemed to my excited senses an
age my voice came with a rush and with a sound so hoarse that it seemed to
mingle and be lost with that of the cataract  row row row   i cried

   before my voice could have reached him my companion had compre-
hended the situation and was bending to the oars then began a desperate
struggle for life i could do nothing but sit with bated breath and watch
his frantic efforts every moment was precious and the idea of my taking
one of the oars was not to be considered

   my friend was rowing with such a quick powerful stroke that hope
gradually came to me with each pull the boat would seemingly rise to meet
the oncoming water and then subside i looked toward the shore what
could cause that peculiar seesaw of the trees  i shuddered as i realized the
explanation between the strokes the boat was carried down by the current
apparently as much as it was forced up stream by the efforts of the rower

    difficult as the task was i forced myself to speak words of encouragement
in one breath i assured him that we were gaining at every stroke and then
lest he should relax his exertions i pictured the horror of the death that
awaited us at first no advance could be distinguished but after rowing for
a very long time as it seemed to me i detected undeniable evidence that we
were gaining clear space could be seen between a tree and chimney that
in the beginning had been outlined together against the sky so much time
and only a gain of ten or fifteen feet  would my friend ever bear up under
this fearful ordeal 

    i looked at him more attentively great beads of perspiration coursed
rapidly down his face every muscle seemed strained to the limit his face
had assumed a tense expression with eyes dilated and tongue protruding from
between his teeth yet invincible pluck was written in every feature

    any one who in a moment of danger has been denied the power of action
will appreciate the tax put upon my self control there is a sense of satis-
faction at a time like this in being able to make an heroic struggle  to fight
against the inevitable  to exhaust ones vital energy  to die hard this
forced repose while the sullen roar of the precipice sounded a dreadful menace


over the danger line

in my ears  this fear to even breathe lest the balance of the boat might be
affected  this dearth of motion where all around foaming gliding water the
drifting spray the dancing trees the oscillating shores the flying clouds
were instinct with motion-this was the most dreadful strain i was ever called
upon to endure

    i think all might have been well had i been able to control myself for a
few moments longer but driven to frenzy with the consciousness of my own
helplessness i urged my companion to still greater exertion a moment of
increased effort the sound of a splintering car the cry of horror from my
companion the sensation of suspended motion of the boat being whirled
lound in the powerful grasp of the current like a top the ominous impelling
iorce pushing us on with ever increasing speed-those were incidents that
followed each other with a rapidity that dazed all our faculties

    our eyes met and the same story must have been written there for we
both involuntarily spoke the one word that expressed all  lost  

    in spite of the hurry of events and the confusion to our senses the
scene of that summer evening is so indelibly fixed upon my memory that
nothing but death can efface it after years the picture often comes to me
in all its appalling splendor and i feel myself drifting down down toward
the awful precipice

    my friend had retained his grasp of the remaining oar and it was pro-
bably this that gave to our boat a sort of revolving motion one moment we
would be whirled round till dizzy then swept forward and over some sharp
decline where the spray would envelop us like a cloud and cause us to gasp
for breath again we would veer to one side of a huge boulder that
reared itself in midstream impregnable against the assaults of the raging
torrent tossed here and there on the foam capped waves each of which
hid an outcropping rock it was little short of miraculous that our boat was
not dashed to pieces

  we had but a vague notion of our location indeed it mattered little to
us since the end was one-an appalling plunge to death

    suddenly we felt the forward end of the boat caught by some obstruction
almost instantly it swung around as on a pivot with a violence that is inde-
scribable it released itself wasafloat for a moment then struck broadside
against an obstruction further on this time the boat held fast our mo-
mentum had been so great that we were nearly stunned by the shock

    we almost instantly recovered ourselves and the incidents that contributed
to our deliverance dawned upon us we were stranded upon the upper end
of luna island which with goat isiand is at the very brink of the preci-
pice our boat had first caught on some projection from a little nameless
island only a few feet in diameter and about fifty feet up stream from luna

    almost any day the visitor on luna island may see stranded logs and
drift lying on the very spot where our boat was landed  so one may see in
our deliverance neither the impossible nor miraculous but who will say
that behind all the innumerable forces that bore our boat onward to appar-
ent doom there was not a directing hand

an extraordinary

announcement

     what we have done for the magazine reader in putting magazines into hit hands at a right
     price we are now going to do for the book reader in putting books into his hands at a right price

t have given a lot of thought to this problem during the last two years and have a pretty cljar ijea
i what can be done our plan in a word is to publish first rate books-handsome cloth bound books-at

twenty five cents retail	 			  t

     this is i fancy a somewhat startling announcement but it is no more startling tnan the announcement i
made three years ago when i stated that a first rate magazine could be made and sold profitably at ten cents
when i speak of publishing books at twenty five cents i do not mean cheap reprints made from battered and
worn out plates-books printed  paper of cheap newspaper grade-but books made from new plates
printed on good paper and well and handsomely bound in cloth we shall open the series with the publica-
tion of a storv by robert mcdonald entitled  a princess and a women the story ran through munsey s
magazine nearly two years ago we shall add other books as fast as we secure copyrights and shall bring
out a line of stanclard books-novels histories poems biographies and essays	 	f 

     the policv that has governed us in magazine publishing will govern us  book publishing so tar as it
applies to excellence of quality and to the lowest possible price and twenty five cents is the price tne
standard price we have fixed upon for all books of medium size-such books as are now sold tor irom one
dollar to one dollar and a half	 		

      a princess and a woman  is now ready and can be had from your book dealer at twenty five cents or
can be had direct from the publisher of this magazine at the same price get it and see what we mean to do
for you in the way of book publishing

a professor of books -emerson

  in glancing through one of the early vol-
umes of charles dudley warners library
of the worlds best literature  we met in
the emerson section an extract from one of
the sages fine pages that ran in this wise

  meantime the colleges whilst they pro-
vide us with libraries furnish no professor of
books  and i think no chair is so much
wanted  

   it is doubtful if any phrase could so happily
describe at once the function and the achieve-
ment of mr warner in his new and great
work he himself is essentially a  pro-
fessor of books   although the charm of his
work has tended to make us forget his wide
and varied learning and knowing not only
books but living writers
and critics as well mr

warner has gathered
around him as advisers
and aids other profess-
ors of books  not men
of the dryasdust school
but those who possess
the same salient cliarm
and graphic power as
himself

   the result of this re-
markable literary move-
ment has been to pro-
vide the great reading
public the busy public
of ever scant leisure
with just what emer-
son declared more than
half a century ago we so
much needed namely a
guide to the best read-
ing

  emerson indeed lik-
ens a library of miscel-
laneous books to a lot-
tery wherein there are

a hundred blanks to one prize and finall
exclaims that some charitable soul after
losing a great deal of time among the false
books and alighting upon a few true ones
which made him happy and wise would do
a right act in naming those which have been
bridges or ships to carry him safely over dark
morasses and barren oceans into the heart
of sacred cities into palaces and temples

  this is precisely what mr warners new
library does in the fine critical articles which
preface the master-works of the greatest
writers

  exactly as the professor of chemistry or
physics or astronomy or biology gives the
student a view of the whole field of his
science the summary of its achievements
its great names and its great works so mr
warner and his associates have given us the

distillation not merely of the whole worlds
literature in itself a colossal attempt but in
addition its history biography and criti-
cism as well it is only when we grasp its
full import that we realize the truly vast and
monumental character of the library it
must assuredly rank as one of the most
notable achievements of the century

  in our last issue we called the attention of
readers to the fact that there is a wide-spread
desire on the part of people from all sections
of this great country to secure one of the
early sets of mr warners library

  in so important and costly a work as the
library the first edition is indisputably the
mostval liable  account of being printed from
the new fresh plates
thus causing both type
and engravings to stand
out with unusual clear-
ness and beauty and as
it is the custom the
world over for publish-
ers to charge a much
higher price for the first
edition than is demand-
ed for those that are
issued later one would
naturall suppose that
the earl volumes of mr
warners librarywould
have been sold fora high
price but the publish-
ers of the work have
actually so reduced the
price of this most valu-
able and desirable of all
editions so that just
now it is obtainable for
about one-half the regu-
lar subscription price
and the additional priv-
ilege of easy monthly
granted for the purpose
a few sets in each com-

   believing many of our readers desire to
 obtain this superior first edition we have
 reserved  sets of the few that now remain
 but care should be taken in writing for full
 particulars to the harpers weekly club
  fifth avenue new york to mention
 the argosy so that there will be no
 misunderstanding

   the publishers inform us that our reserva-
 tion in connection with those made by the
 other leading magazines fully exhausts the
 entire first edition of this valuable library
 and no more can possibly be obtained this
 is positively the last reservation we shall be
 able to make from the first and most perfect
 edition of this great libraiy
