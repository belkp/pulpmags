he earns
 zoo a week
seems like a lot of money to the man in the routine
job- a week-but not to the traitirrt salesman
today any number of men-and theyre not un-
usual either-are earning salary and commissions
better than  a year they travel irom one big
city to another-live comfortably at the best hotels
- mix daily with successful business men - and
they are continually growing in a business way
perhaps you have thought that selling required
some special gift but it isnt true
the successful salesman succeeds because ho
knows his lin-and because he is mailer of the
principles and methods of scientific salesmanship
and you too-if you have average intelligence-
can acquire that understanding and you can go out
and increase your earnings in a wav that will actu-
ally amaze you

youth stuff
i declare mis moffat i dont see
how you do it you look youngern
ever mrs horton bustled into her
shabby comfortable boarding house parlor
and held out both fat hands in cordial greet-
ing to her bi-annually returning guest  it
beats me how you folks from the middle
west seem to keep two jumps ahead of the
styles
the buyer from columbia ohio smiled
and the tiny well massaged lines about her
   	a
dark clear eyes and humorously curved
mouth crinkled
   we have to do you suppose sol
feingold would have been sending me here
more years than i care to count for the
new lines in ladies and misses ready-to-
wear if i didnt look as young as the sap-
piest finale hopper with a charge account-
at least from the back
  she laughed displaying a row of strong
white teeth and then sighed  youre
lucky to be in a business where flesh doesnt
matter how im going to resist the tempta-
tion of your pies the lord only knows

argosy-allstory weekly
but how is your family here simmy still
with you of course
   yes but i shouldnt wonder if some-
body wasnt taking notice of him at last
though i cant figger who talking of fat
he goes to a gymnasium two nights a week
reducing and he dresses more snappy than
ever if he does get married i declare i
shll miss him round the house after all this
time
   daisy larkins gone back home to take
care of her mother ralph best and pete
cook went out to chicago to start business
together and laura jennifer-well it got
to be too plain and quiet for her here
the motherly face clouded but brightened
again  henry jordans with me still
and little fannie gillespie and myrtle
harris
  but one name had arrested mrs moffats
attention
   what do you mean-too plain and
quiet for that jennifer girl-mrs horton
she demanded  thirty a week was what
she drew down modeling coats and suits for
marx  lefkowitz and she wasnt worth
half of it when i bought some whipcords
there last fall slouching on the job and
making eyes at the men buyers where
did she move to-the ritz
   shes got a little flat somewhere i
was real sorry to lose her for laura was
a nice girl but good times and the bright
lights went to her head put the tea down
here aggie and take mis moffats grip up
to her room
  mrs horton turned with evident relief
as a scrawny middle-aged housemaid with
untidy hair and a perpetually harried ex-
pression on her pointed face placed a tray
awkwardly on the center table
   youd better toast a coupla pieces of
that bread-
  not for me mrs moffat inter-
rupted decidedly  nothing between meals
thirty-fours are the rage now and im still
a thirty-six so the jennifer girl turned out
to be a weak sister youve got another
one that seemed to me to be heading that
way covering herself with cheap fake jew-
elry and going without lunch for new
clothes i mean fannie gillespie
   indeed she aint mrs horton assert-
ed vigorously  fannies a sweet little thing
and good as gold its natural for her to
like finery and all them rhinestone di-
monds-well you know how it is when
a young girl first comes to new york from
a small place-
   some girls mrs moffat corrected as
she stirred her tea there was amused af-
fection in the glance she cast upon her land-
lady  ruffle up like a mother hen dont
you when any one criticizes your chicks 
 well i kind of take an interest in
them mrs horton admitted  ive had
lots of young folks come and go from under
my roof during the last twenty years and
i like nothing better than to see them set-
tled in life i did think that fannie and
henry jordan would make a match of it
and i was glad for hes a fine steady boy
making good money selling those fireproof
filing cases but he didnt show her the kind
of attention her other friends do
   free lectures and the movies and now
and then a good concert are about his limit
with maybe a little bunch of vilets or
a pounda candy while fannie likes the
broadway shows and dancing where theres
a cover charge not paying the bills she
dont know or stop to think of the price
and though henry jordan aint stingy hes
the serious quiet kind with a bank account
and looking to the future
   i guess he figgered she was too fly-
away or maybe she got the notion that he
was too slow anyhow a few weeks ago
they stopped going out together and was
just frozen politeness and thats all it
aint blowed over and ive give em up
she poured herself another cup of tea
resignedly and the new guest laughed again
   which are you running-a boarding
house or a matrimonial agency ive often
wondered but the other one you spoke
of-this myrtle somebody it seems to me
i remember her big blonde isnt she-
with hands like a brakemans
   shes a big strong girl with yellow
hair mrs horton amended defensively
 myrtle plays a piano in a continuous
motion picture house uptown and i shd
think that would make anybodys hands
look like hams thumping and banging eight
or nine hours a day
bright lights

   shes kind of loud and flashy but older
with a level head on her shoulders and i
never had a minutes worry about her i
did think she was kind of crazy bout henry
jordan at first but he couldnt see her and
shes too sensible to cry for the moon
  ive got her now mrs moffat
stemmed the garrulous flow with a nod
 cold blue eye and circus clothes but she
will get on hello simmy darlev did
you come home early because you knew i
was going to breeze in
  the front door had opened and closed
and the stoutish slightly bald little man
of fifty or thereabout who paused on the
threshold was attired in the extreme of
fashion as it was recognized along the
rialto his waistcoat was resplendent his
spats the lightest tan and the soft felt
hat of the same shsde which he held with
his olivewood stick in one hand was of the
most approved collegiate shape
   mrs moffat this is indeed a pleasure 
he advanced with hurried short steps and
his voice squeaked cheerfully  i neednt
ask if you are well how is trade out in
columbia this spring
   rotten thanks mrs moffat returned
as she gave him her hand  thats why
im here for a new line to speed it up
ouch where did you get that dempsey
grip
   i told you mr darley had been going
to a gymnasium regular mrs horton re-
marked  he was a real help moving fur-
niture and hanging pictures for me after my
spring cleaning
  in all that magnificence with the
frankness of old acquaintanceship mrs
moffat eyed him from top to toe and sim-
eon darleys rotund face beamed with naive
complacency  you look more like a book-
maker than a bookkeeper 
   you always would have your joke he
protested deprecatingly  just keeping up
with the youngsters mrs moffat-thats
the thing nowadays if youll spare me an
evening soon i shall be delighted to have
you and mrs horton come with me to one
of the new restaurants the latest dance is
a variation of the toddle-
  listen to the man she exclaimed
 dont tell me its got you too after all
these years i havent toddled since i
learned to walk and late suppers dont
sharpen my eyes for job lots being put over
on me how come
  mrs moffat added the question in a low-
ered tone after he had left the room and
her companion shrugged
   he just wants to show you what a real
sport hes getting to be she remarked
comfortably  theres no harm to simmy
if there is mighty little else he tried to
take up with fannie after her and henry
jordan quit going together but she had
him run ragged in a week dancing till all
hours and then went back to her other
friends heres fannie now
  a slim small girl with fluffy brown hair
framing a pretty baby face had let herself
in with her latchkey but paused at the
foot of the stairs on hearing her name and
then ran lightly in her black pleated
frock and small moire toque were the last
word in smartness but a splashing laval-
liere of glassy stones glittered at her white
throat and the hand she extended was cov-
ered with meretriciously scintillating rings
   oh how do there was a self-con-
scious note in her nervous little laugh
 youre late this season arent you mrs
moffat the styles have changed so now
that long skirts are in and bonnets instead
of flats that youll find a lot of difference
  the older woman felt an impulse to
draw in her feet acutely conscious all at
once of the brevity of her tweed traveling
suit and the fact that her flat straw hat
must be outdated at least a month and the
girls appraising glance stung
   feingolds son came on for the earlier
stock im here for midsummers line and
first fall she replied abruptly and then
ashamed of her own chagrin she added
 thats a very smart little gown and bon-
net of yours my dear does ruthven like
you to wear so much jewelry to business
though
   oh didnt you know im not with
ruthven any more but with louisette
think of it mrs moffat the most ex-
clusive hat shop in town and you ought
to see the wonderful trade we have fan-
nies china blue eyes sparkled  of course
i couldnt wear my rings and things there

argosy-allstory weekly
i dont even dare put them on before i
start for home but carry them in my purse
i have to dress in plain black like this but
it costs an awful lot for i couldnt be seen
in wholesale things only imported models
you wont find anything with these lines at
places like marx  lefkowitz and this
little turban-
  she paused listening for a moment as a
key grated again in the lock of the hall
door and then shrugged at the step which
sounded in the entrance continuing in a
slightly higher tone
   as i was saying mrs moffat if you
want anything really swell youve got to
pay for it appearance is the whole thing
in business and everything else mrs hor-
ton can i press out my cerise crepe de
chine ive got a date to-night
   all right fannie but dont burn the
board again like a good girl the land-
lady added in kindly solicitude  wherere
you going thats a regular ball dress
   dance frock fannie tossed her fluffy
shining head  im going with mr rogers
to a perfectly grand affair mostly profes-
sionals down at brewster hall see you at
dinner mrs moffat
  she tripped humming out of the room
and up the stairs without a glance about
her although the footsteps had halted in
the hall now they advanced once more
and a young man appeared hazel eyed
with a touch of red in his curly brown hair
and broad of shoulders beneath the plain
blue serge coat his was a boyishly engag-
ing figure as his homely clean cut features
lighted with genuine pleasure at sight of the
new arrival the voice too in which he
greeted her was buoyant with vigorous
youth and his handclasp warm and firm
   im glad to be back myself mr jor-
dan mrs moffat replied to him  you
are still selling filing cases mrs horton
tells me and making a good thing of it
   just plodding along henry jordan
nodded  we handle all kinds of steel
office furniture now and weve had a great
winter what are you doing to-night
theres a dandy picture on at the interna-
tional and a fashion show added that you
ought to see before you start out to-morrow
id like to take you and mrs horton-
   not me henry-ive got a sight of
mending-but mis moffat  go with you
it was nice of you to think of it heavens 
she rose precipitately  do you smell
that sure as youre alive carolines burnt
the cake again mis moffat you just make
yourself comfortable your rooms ready
any time jrou like-
  her voice trailed back to them as she
waddled off hastily toward the back stairs
and henry jordan turned laughing to the
door
  just the same as ever isnt she i
dont know what any of us would do with-
out ma horton youll come to-night
   id love to if you dont mind trotting a
dowdy old woman around mrs moffat
responded  i feel quite smart back home
but im nothing but a hoosier here little
miss gillespie looked so stunning just now
that i realized how hopelessly out of date
i was
  she cast a friendly quizzical glance at
him and the young man flushed slightly
but he met her eyes with steady candor
   you look all right to me he said
briefly  i guess theres a lot more fool-
ish things than being a day or so behind the
styles well go as soon as dinner is over
so as to get good seats shall we
  later at the long table in mrs hortons
basement dining room mrs moffat encoun-
tered again the remaining member of the
household a loud voiced young woman of
amazonian proportions with brassy golden
hair elaborately waved and an air of so-
phisticated boredom myrtle harris was a
professional at last she assured mrs mof-
fat but it was a dawgs life and she didnt
envy paderewski or any of them other
artists knowing now what they was up
against
  it hadnt been half as hard when she was
plugging hits in the sheet music department
of silkworths five and ten though of
course nothing like being a real performer
in a theater the bronx coliseum didnt get
first runs but she supposed that wouldnt
matter ohio houses not getting them either
and mrs moffat must come some night and
hear her play
  the entrance of fannie gillespie radiant
in a brilliant cerise gown which displayed
bright lights

far too much of her girlishly thin shoul-
ders put a temporary end to the conversa-
tional efforts of myrtle harris and the
latter stared and then sniffed the laval-
liere had given place to a necklace of paste
diamonds which gleamed almost convincing-
ly under the glare of the electric light and
a ring with a single blazing stone adorned
one of fannies small animate hands in-
stead of the spreading cluster
  mrs moffat eyed it doubtfully and then
with deepened gravity she studied the girls
pretty doll-like face and listened to her
high pitched nervously gay chatter as the
meal progressed there seemed something
forced and unnatural about her vivacity as
if she were under some strain or pressure
for when her naively egotistical flow of
small talk ceased for a moment she twitched
and fidgeted more than once glancing at
the shaded area window as if she half ex-
pected to see a moving silhouette there
  was the girl afraid of some one surely
there had been shrinking dread in that look
and in repose her soft lips drooped at the
corners and the lids fluttered over the wide
blue eyes
  mrs moffat shrugged and turned to reply
banteringly to a labored compliment of
simmy darleys on her left after all
fannie was only one of the army of small
town girls with more looks than brains and
no great talent or ambition to keep her
forging ahead to a definite goal if she
were the incorrigible flirt she seemed and
anticipated some unpleasant scene or other
now she would only be running true to
type
  henry jordan devoted himself to his din-
ner with an appetite which argued well for
his peace of mind and afterward as he and
the buyer from ohio strolled toward broad-
way in the soft dusk which still lingered
before the late spring darkness fell his
companion studied him as she had the girl
young people interested her and in her
busy successful life she had found time to
make many of them her friends
  quiet without being taciturn light-heart-
ed without boisterousness he had attracted
her on her former visits as much by his
evident seriousness of purpose as by the
uniform thoughtful courtesy which ap-
peared so inherently a part of him it was
safe to conjecture mrs moffat reflected
that he would never make a fool of himself
over any little empty headed flirt nor
swerve if that square jaw and steadfast
gaze counted for anything from the future
he had planned
  the fashion exhibit posed before her on
the screen absorbed her keenest profession-
al attention but the feature picture with
its erotic star anfemic male lead and hectic
emotionalism seemed melodramatic and ut-
terly silly mrs moffat was surprised to
find her young host disposed to a serious
discussion of it when the performance over
they made their way to a soda fountain
   just a lemonade for me please she
sighed at a rich chocolate concoction foam-
ing from a near-by glass  the girl was
wonderful of course but didnt you think
the story absurd a plain everyday sort
of husband like that doesnt fly off at a
tangent and commit murder simply because
he has formed an ideal of his wife that
she isnt capable of even comprehending
much less living up to
  henry jordan shook his head
   i dont know it didnt seem absurd
to me he remarked   plain everyday
husbands  do that sort of thing every day
mrs moffat if you read the papers the
girl he thought she was never had lived and
maybe he felt that the real one shouldnt
either when hed found out how heartless
and wicked she was maybe he thought he
had a right to kill her sames hed throttle
a wild beast if he had nothing else to kill
it wh except his bare hands to keep it
from harming other people the way it had
him
  mrs moffat eyed him in amused aston-
ishment
   you think it was natural for him to
get worked up to the pitch of killing almost
in a minute like that-a man whod never
before bad the impulse to harm a fly do
you believe such things happen in real
life
   yes mrs moffat i do his tone was
still quietly impersonally argumentative
yet it had deepened in gravity  i believe
theres apt to come a time in any mans
life no matter how harmless and soft heart-

argosy-allstory weekly
ed he might be when hed like to kill some-
body not just for his own satisfaction i
dont mean but because he almost thought
he had a right that it would be better if
they were dead
  mrs moffat laughed outright
   i shouldnt wonder if wed all felt that
way in the abstract for a minute or two at
a time maybe but not seriously-not with
the actual idea of murder thank good-
ness life isnt quite like what the movies
would have us believe
  henry jordan frowned thoughtfully for
a moment and then laughed too
   i guess its a good thing he conceded
 will you have another lemonade
  mrs moffat declined and they walked
the few blocks to the boarding house in
comparative silence past the glitter of lights
on the great thoroughfare into the dim
shadowed side street where the faint glim-
mer of the stars worked eerie magic on
commonplace stone and brick and mortar
  the buyer would have a big day before
her and long habit had accustomed her
healthy faculties to obey her will yet to-
night for some reason she could not readily
compose herself to sleep it must be the
long nerve racking hours on the train she
told herself wearily or the thought of to-
morrows ever recurring problemthe right
choice at the right price and not to be
stung with a line of false alarms as fein-
golds son had been
  the door downstairs opened and closed
and a not-too-light feminine footstep ac-
companied by a whiff of reeking scent under
her own door announced the return of myr-
tle harris and then long intervals passed
punctuated by slow strokes from a distant
church clock and still sleep would not come
to mrs moffat
  midnight then one and then two was
that the front door again the sound had
been so soft that the involuntary listener
could not be sure but in another moment
the faintest of steps crept past her door
and on up the stairs and from a discreet
distance down the block there came the
diminishing whir of a taxi
  fannie gillespie of course she had
youth and health but taxis at two in the
morning didnt mean efficiency a few hours
later she wouldnt hold her job down long
with louisette or any one else for that
matter if she kept up this pace innocent
enough though it might be in fact
  yet what did the fannies of this world
matter to a busy woman with her own prob-
lems to face in disgust with herself mrs
moffat arose and throwing on a robe
crossed to her open window and dropped
into a low chair the street was deserted
the infrequent lamps glowing through an
orange haze beneath the cold steely light
of the stars and only the occasional rum-
ble of a belated truck breaking the si-
lence
  yet was the street quite deserted
wasnt that a moving shadow opposite in
the deeper gloom of the areaway mrs
moffat leaned a trifle forward and watched
for long minutes but if some one were
lurking there he did not betray his presence
again and with a little shrug of impatience
she returned to her bed at last
  nerves after all these years could it be
that silly sex play far fetched as it was it
had impressed that intensely serious young
man henry jordan what was it he had
said about the murderer something about
his right to kill the woman who had first
killed his own ideals and illusions youth
stuff of course but still-
  trying dimly to recall his exact words
mrs moffat fell asleep at last
chapter ii
chocolates and confidences
the next two days were busy ones for
the buyer for feingold  son and she
saw little of her fellow lodgers at mrs
hortons beyond a hurried greeting at meal-
time they were successful days too but
strenuous and late one afternoon utterly
fatigued she paused in the lower hall be-
fore ascending the stairs just as fannie
gillespie entered behind her
  the girl appeared pale beneath the light
flecks of rouge she had acquired since mrs
moffats last trip to the city and there
were faint bluish shadows about her big
childish eyes the little droop remained
at the corners of her lips even as she smiled
bright lights

waveringly in response to the older womans
nod
   its been an awful long day hasnt it
there was a flat dispirited note in the usu-
ally high pitched young voice  i do get
so tired everlastingly trying perfect dreams
of hats on the homeliest crossest people
you ought to see the cars they come in
mrs moffat and their clothes-oh and
their jewels i never thought there were
o many diamonds in the world as ive seen
since i went to work for louisette its
funny how some girls that arent a bit at-
tractive have everything isnt it
   well they havent-attraction mrs
moffat smiled and added on an impulse
 wont you stop in my room for a minute
on your way up i have a marvellous box
of chocolates that mark  lefkowitz sent
me and of course i mustnt touch one of
them id like to get temptation out of my
way
    may i the discontented face bright-
ened  i suppose youve been ordering
heaps of things id like to be able to go
out and buy everything i thought was
pretty
   even if the pretty things were to be
worn by somebody else her companion
led the way upstairs and into the pleasant
front room on the second floor  sit down
and take off your hat if you like here
is your candy
  she placed a huge beribboned box in
fannies hands and motioned toward a
chair seating herself with a sigh in the low
rocker
  if oh theyre lovely wont you take
even one the girl drew off her slightly
worn gloves displaying again the bunched
rings among which the single large stone
gleamed like a headlight and fell to munch-
ing the chocolates avidly  i dont eat
lunch very often now
    it doesnt cost so terribly to dress the
way eileen gaffney and the other sales-
ladies at iouisettes do and then i have to
have so many things to go out in no fel-
low wants to take a girl out unless he can
be proud of her and if youre dowdy you
dont get anywhere
   is it worth it mrs moffat asked
quietly  going hungry i mean just to
dress to please other people and have good
times that tire you all out so that you cant
put your best effort into your work and
get on
   why-y the blue eyes opened wide
 what would be the good of working at all
except so that you could have the good
times i like to have the boys i go out with
proud to be seen with me and i know
some dandy fellows who think nothing too
good for their girl ive been to the swell-
est parties lately and i dont mind being
tired
   i dont see any use in just working and
working without a bit of fun it  be years
and years before ill get old enough to be
a manager or buyer and by that time i
wont want to dance or care about theaters
and the beaches
   and you may not be qualified for a
managers or buyers job if you dont work
for it mrs moffat reminded her gently
 i suppose though you are figuring on
marriage as most girls do
  fannie shrugged
   the fellows who want to get married
only think of sticking you in a horrid little
flat uptown or a cottage in the suburbs
somewhere to do your own work and be
lonesome all day and never have any real
fun just put every cent in the bank she
made a little moue
   those that take you around cant af-
ford to get married but im not thinking of
that anyway for ages yet im having too
good a time the beaches are going to be
grand this summer ive got a friend who
has a concession at the new one knicker-
bocker park thats simply thrilling its
called the avalanche ride
  mrs moffat shook her head at the hope-
lessness of further argument
   i didnt know the beaches were open so
early she observed absently
   oh yes i found this in the sand last
sunday wouldnt you think it was real
she thrust out the finger upon which the
single stone glistened  first time i ever
found anything pretty im not lucky that
way you never saw anything so lovely
though as the rings our customers wear-
gracious is it as late as that
  her eyes had fallen on the traveling clock

argosy-allstory weekly
on mrs moffats dresser and she jumped
up closing the depleted box reluctantly
   take it with you to your own room
my dear mrs moffats glance had fol-
lowed the gesture  are you going out
again to-night
   yes but only for a little while with a
boy i dont care so much for any more
hes an auto race driver and he leaves for
detroit on the midnight oh did you know
theres a new boarder hes dark and
awfully good looking and his clothes look
as if they were made to order i saw him
last night when he came to make arrange-
ments i dont suppose he can be much of
a sport or he wouldnt want to live in a
quiet place like this but he looked different
somehow
   not like henry jordan mrs moffat
lifted her eyebrows
   mercy no henrys a dear and i used
to be crazy about him but hes the dread-
ful serious kind i told you about and
doesnt know what it is to really have a good
time i must hurry and change my dress
thanks for the lovely chocolates
  she closed the door nodding brightly
and hurried up to the top floor and her
tiny hall room in the rear while mrs mof-
fat rearranged her hair reflectively fannie
gillespie had changed in the few months
since last she had seen her then everything
had been wonderful and the simplest pleas-
ures delights although already the love for
the spurious finery within her reach had
made itself manifest
  now she was growing disillusioned
wearying of the simpler things choosing
her companions solely for their ability to
spend money prodigally race drivers con-
cessionaires at amusement parks sports 
-where would it all lead
  it was in vain that the older woman
told herself it was nothing to her the girls
piquant prettiness and innate candor and
honesty as well as her very human longing
for what she considered happiness had made
their own appeal what bitterness of fur-
ther disillusionment would the next interval
bring before they met again
  airs moffat was late for dinner and the
others had all gathered about the long table
when she made her appearance among
them was a new face and she recalled what
the girl had said about an addition to the
household
  mrs horton presented him beamingly as
air edgar north and the young man arose
and bowed politely with a quick flash of
his bright dark eyes the hand resting
on the back of his chair was long and
slender but not too obviously manicured
and his voice was pleasantly modulated
as he acknowledged the introduction and
then slipped into his chair with a graceful
litheness of movement that suggested
strength and control
  he was a bond salesman it developed
recently sent up to the new york branch
of a new orleans house and his accent held
the soft rolling slur of the south in his slow
not too loquacious speech
  myrtle harris leaned both elbows on the
table ignoring her veal pot pie as she de-
scribed the difficulties of an artistes career
to the engaging stranger and fannie who
had put on a filmy blue gown the color of
her eyes and long paste earrings that pulled
at her small pink lobes hung with flatter-
ing attention on his infrequent observa-
tions but if mr north was aware of the
personal element he gave no sign directing
his conversation in the main to the land-
lady with an unaffected deference which de-
lighted that honest soul
  li you dance of course fannie asked
when myrtle paused for breath
  the newcomer darted a swift glance at
her in which she read an eager response
but he only replied quietly
   i was raised to it miss gillespie
though not im afraid the kind of dancing
you do up noth i must try to learn of
cose when i have time
  myrtle laughed loudly
   you dont sell bonds in the evenings
do you
   hardly miss harris but ive planned
to study and attend some lectures at one of
the colleges heah he smiled showing a
flash of white teeth in his dark smooth
shaven face and turned to mrs horton
 im afraid i shall burn your lights vey
late some nights maam
   go right ahead mrs horton respond-
ed cordially  i like to see my young peo-
bright
lights

pie improving themselves my late hus-
band was a great reader though the sport-
ing extras never done him much good for
he usually picked the wrong one he could
talk real well when i had time to listen to
him and he got it all from magazines the
folks left laying around i always believed
in education what line are you thinking
of taking up
   finance and economics it seemed to
mrs moffat that there was a hint of amuse-
ment in norths tone  can you tell me
suh which of the colleges offer evening lec-
tures
  he had addressed simmy darley and
while the latter hurriedly disclaimed any
knowledge of the citys higher educational
advantages fannie pushed away her saucer
of rice pudding and arose with an annoyed
swish of silk and tinkle of earrings to
leave the room inadvertently mrs moffat
glanced at henry jordan and was surprised
at the look of pain in his eyes as they fol-
lowed the slender departing figure
  was he thinking again of a certain lost
illusion of his own it couldnt have been
an overwhelming one or he would scarcely
have remained under the same roof and in
constant daily association with the girl who
 used to be crazy about him but it
seemed evident that he was not yet wholly
cured
  mrs moffat spent the evening in her
room casting up accounts and preparing a
lengthy report for feingold  son and she
was so deeply preoccupied that she was only
subconsciously aware of the thud of the ves-
tibule door she glanced at the clock not-
ing idly that it was just half past ten and
returned to her report once more when a
muffled sob in the hallway made her turn in
surprise then arise and open the door
   is that you miss gillespie is any-
thing the matter my dear can i help
the little figure muffled in the soft blue
cape halted at the foot of the second flight
of stairs and then turned and came slowly
toward her
   its nothing mrs moffat only i think
men are horrid ive had a perfectly awful
time and it wasnt a bit my fault 
  as she came into the room closing the
door behind her the older woman saw that
the tears which stood in the round eyes were
those of anger rather than sorrow and her
lips were crimson as though she had set
her small teeth in them
   what happened tell me if you like
did you go out with the friend you spoke of
this afternoon
  fannie nodded and slipped the cape from
her shoulders as she dropped into a chair
   yes but i only went to be nice to him
because he begged so i told you i didnt
care for him any more she pressed her
hands to her flushed cheeks  he was aw-
fully good fun at first to run around with
and i liked it when wed go in a restaurant
just after hed won some big race and peo-
ple would whisper and stare but he-he got
to thinking everything was settled between
us as soon as he gave up the road and
opened a garage and then he began quarrel-
ing about everything my jewelry and my
other friends and even the way i happened
to look at people
   we had one last row and i didnt see
him for ever so long until just lately but
i wouldnt make up with him again the way
he wanted me to and i only went out with
him for a dance to-night because he was
going away and then he had to make a
perfectly dreadful scene
   why mrs moffat asked quietly
   just because jack rogers joined us
and i danced with him-well quite a little
hes simply elegant rut you must have
seen him lots of times on the screen frank
heard id been going around with him and
all of a sudden he got in a terrible rage and
-and wanted to fight him jacks the per-
fect gentleman though and he went right
away and i came home all by myself it
was horrid of frank-as if he had the
right
  she twisted her handkerchief nervously
between her fingers and mrs moffat re-
called the odd tension in the girls manner
on the night of her own arrival
   are you afraid of this frank she
paused and added  has he ever threatened
you
   oh no fannie replied quickly as she
rose gathering her cape about her once
more her eyes had darted toward the door
with a curious fluttering of their lids how-

argosy-allstory weekly
ever and she drew a hasty breath  what
could he do except make nasty scenes like
to-night i was so ashamed fellows say
crazy silly things about what theyll do
when you wont bother with them any more
but they dont ever do anything really
   i guess ill go to bed for theres going
to be a wonderful party to-morrow night
and ill hardly have a wink of sleep before
ill be due at the shop again i wish there
wasnt anything but good times ever
when she had gone on up the stairs mrs
moffat returned to her task but she found
it impossible to concentrate on poiret twills
and tricotines marvellas and duvetyn
the pretty shallow young thing who had
just left her was dominated by a serious
emotion at last and that emotion was fear
of whom or what was she afraid
  the unhappy scene of that evening which
she had so naively recounted had meant
only a  horrid  quarter of an hour to her
nothing more yet at the first suggestion
that she might have been threatened fan-
nie had betrayed her apprehension even as
she quickly-too quickly-denied it and
then retreated precipitately if the girl
wrere in any actual trouble-
  she decided to have a frank but tactful
talk with her on the morrow and learn what
advice or help she might offer and in the
meantime the report for feingold  son
must be put through forcing the prob-
lem of her young fellow lodger resolutely
from her thoughts mrs moffat wrote for
an hour with her accustomed conciseness
and exactitude and then retired to sleep
soundly until agnes knocked upon her door
   ha past seven mis moffat to her
still drowsy perceptions it appeared that
there was an odd quaver in the usually
thin sharp tones  will you dress real
quick please maam
  whats the matter thoroughly
awake on the instant mrs moffat rose and
threw her robe about her  is anything
wrong agnes
   i dont know im afraid so the
voice quavered still more and mrs moffat
opened the door to find agnes wringing her
hands with her apron askew and her wisps
of hair standing out in greater disorder than
ever its miss fannie ive knocked
and hollered till im hoarse but there isnt
any answer and mis horton told me to-to
fetch a policeman
chapter iii
behind the locked door
a policeman agnes repeated mrs
moffat aghast  what in the
world for
   to-to break the door down agnes
whispered with a fearful glance over her
shoulder up the well of the staircase  its
locked from the inside and the keys still
in the hole mis horton says the police
have got to be here in case anything ter-
rible shouldve happened deary me in
all the years- hear her now maam i
thought maybe youd go up to her before
she gets a stroke or something
  i will at once agnes mrs moffat
had paused to listen to the subdued pound-
ing and frightened entreaties in the land-
ladys usually placid tones and now she
started to close her door  ill just get
into a few things and youd better call the
officer without rousing the rest of the
house
    theyre all up only miss myrtles in
hysterics and the cook aint much better
agnes turned to descend the stairs  youll
hurry maam
  waiting only to pin up her heavy braid
thrust her feet into slippers and put on a
more substantial garment than the light
bathrobe mrs moffat hurried up the stairs
with her heart beating suffocatingly and a
nameless fear clutching at her throat
  the girl must be there she couldnt
have gone out again and besides there was
the door locked from inside why didnt
she answer
  from behind a closed door on the third
floor there came the strangling sobs of myr-
tle harriss noisy hysteria and a heavy
tread and hoarse breathing in simeon dar-
leys room showed that the alarm had been
conveyed to the middle aged bookkeeper
but mrs moffat was scarcely conscious of
the sounds that reached her ears she knew
only that the thumping and calling from
above had ceased and that her feet seemed
bright lights

weighted with lead so that she could hardly
drag them yet in reality she was all but
flying along the hall to the next flight of
stairs
  at their foot she drew back for an in-
stant as the door of the front hall bedroom
opened abruptly and the new boarder
edgar north confronted her fully dressed
except for the coat into the sleeves of which
he was straggling
   i beg your pardon but isnt there some
trouble he asked quietly his dark eyes
searching hers with evident concern  ill
lie very glad to be of any assistance-
   im not sure mrs moffat stammered
and then drew herself together  miss
gillespie cant be waked and mrs horton
is afraid she is ill i am going up to see
  she started up the last flight discovering
the landlady sitting huddled on the topmost
step and henry jordan coatless and collar-
less leaning against the balustrade on the
landing just over her head his face haggard
and gray in the cold searching light
 oh mis moffat mrs horton
moaned holding out her fat trembling
hands  ive called and called but fan-
nie dont seem to hear henry jordans
almost kicked the panels through and he
wanted to break the door down for me
himself only i wouldnt let him i know
she come in all right for i saw the light
from under her door long after eleven when
i took a last look through the house before
i went to bed the same as i always do
   shed have come to me if she felt sick
or anything you dont think that shes-
shes-
   i dont know what to think mrs hor-
ton but youll just have to pull yourself
together well know soon what has hap-
pened mrs moffat held the cold shak-
ing hands in a firm grip and glanced up
at the young man surprised to find that her
own voice was in such steady control once
more  you havent heard the slightest
sound from miss gillespie
  he shook his head speechlessly and then
another voice sounded from just behind and
below her
   i dont like to intrude being such a
stranger but is there any way i could be of
service mrs horton
   heavens its mr north id forgotten
all about you the landlady exclaimed
 maybe were only making a fuss over
nothing but miss gillespie-
  words failed her but edgar north nod-
ded understandingly
   i know mrs moffat told me you
said something a minute ago about break-
ing the door down perhaps mr jordan
and i could foce it-
    thanks north but airs horton thinks
wed better wait for the police henry jor-
dan found his voice but it was strained and
unnatural and he spoke with what was evi-
dently a tremendous effort  theyd have
to be notified anyway if theres anything
desperately wrong
   to be sure the young southerner
agreed in a low shocked tone  is there
a doctor on this street if miss gillespie
has met with some accident during the
night-
   of course why didnt i think of
that mrs horton cried  dr vaughn
lives just four doors away on the opposite
side and ill be ever so much obliged if
youll run over and bring him here do
bang on the door again henry maybe
shes come to and can hear us now
  the other young man had turned and
was running down the stairs and henry
moved obediently toward the door at the
rear of the hall which faced them with a
blankness that seemed portentous in its
silent menace mrs moffat noted his re-
luctant hesitation before he lifted his hand
to knock but the gesture was never finished
for at that moment a heavy door slammed
far below and an elephantine tread re-
sounded through the house as some one
came up the stairs
  mrs horton rose and the two women
instinctively drew together while henry
turned and took up his former position at
the rail feet pounded along the hall just
beneath myrtle harris opened her door
screamed shrilly and closed it again and
the next instant a burly bluecoat appeared
and ascended three steps at a time
   whats wrong mrs horton he de-
manded  your agnes says theres a girl
here one of your boarders that you cant
get any answer from which door is it

argosy-allstory weekly
  silently mrs horton pointed and the
policeman advanced
   keep back all of you not a single
one crosses that sill until i say the word
now then
  there came a mighty thud and straining
creak as his massive shoulder drove at the
panel but the stout lock held and it was
only after a second and third onslaught
that it gave way with a crash and the door
burst inward carrying him with it before he
could brace himself
  the shades had evidently been pulled
down for the darkness from within ap-
peared to rush out upon them appallingly
and the jarring vibration echoed in the
shuddering silence and died away while
they waited breathless and tense then
just when it seemed that the ultimate mo-
ment of endurance had come a smothered
exclamation reached their ears
   holy saints shes done the dutch
  everything whirled before mrs moffats
vision yet through it she still seemed to
see clearly the expression of hopeless horror
upon henry jordans face but mrs horton
uttered a choking cry and collapsed at her
feet a quivering mound of flesh as if she
had been stricken by a blow
  the next few minutes passed in a kaleido-
scopic jumble of hideous confused impres-
sions she was aware that simeon darley
passed her bellowing inarticulately with the
tail of his dressing gown streaking out be-
hind him that the young man from new
orleans had reappeared with a bearded
stranger carrying a small black bag and
that somehow agnes was beside her bend-
ing over the unconscious figure of the land-
lady wailing thinly and wringing her hands
while the sound of feminine weeping from
below seemed to have been augmented into
a chorus
  then the stentorian voice of the bluecoat
brought a semblance of order
   now then get back there no one lay
a finger on the body till the medical exam-
iner- oh tis you doctor come this
way please the rest of you clear out
clear this hall and the stairs but see that
not a cne of you leaves this house
  mrs moffat rose swaying from where
she had dropped to her knees beside the
landlady and in spite of herself her eyes
turned with awful fascination to the broken
door and the shadowy semidarkness that
lay beyond the wooden furnishings
showed merely in vague outline but the
bed had evidently been relegated from one
of the more elaborately appointed rooms
downstairs when its style went out of fash-
ion for it was of brass with square cut
posts reaching almost to the ceiling from
its towering headboard
   to mrs moffats dazed fearful vision it
seemed that from one of these something
swung in mid air-something slim and white
and unnaturally tall that loomed like a
specter and involuntarily she took a trem-
bling step forward
  the next moment a hand fell on her
shoulder and the same loud authoritative
tone admonished
    keep back lady get on downstairs
and take mrs horton with you doctor
dont let a one of them in there till i go
telephone to the station
  henry and the new young man between
them were lifting the landladys flaccid
bulk and mrs moffat followed slowly with
agnes down the two flights of stairs to mrs
hortons own rear hall bedroom on the sec-
ond floor myrtle harriss hysteria had sub-
sided to heaving sobs as they passed her
door but below they came upon caroline
the cook crouched at the foot of the stairs
rocking herself back and forth in a par-
oxysm of woe
    whut was it mistuh burke she had
gathered her wits together to demand of
the policeman as he descended in advance
of the others  whut done got po miss
fan lordy lordy fust time you was
evah in dis yere house ceptin fo a tase o
mah cookin
    lemme get by caroline and hush up
that noise he responded gruffly you
better tend to mrs horton-
  the landlady opened her eyes as they
laid her upon her bed and glanced shrink-
ingly about then her gaze fastened on
mrs moffats tense face
   fannie what happened to her she
whispered  she isnt- she cant be-
mrs moffat shook her head
    i didnt see but the officer said she was
bright
lights

dead at least he gave orders that no one
was to go near the body and he has noti-
fied some one over the telephone that is
all i know she turned as simeon darley
appeared in the doorway did you go
into that room
   yes god its frightful why did the
poor child do it his voice was low and
shaken and the flesh sagged in grayish folds
from his jaw as if his round face had been
suddenly deflated  its-its like a night-
mare what could have driven her to-
 to what mrs horton sat bolt up-
right  what are you trying to say mr
darley fannie didnt-
   shes hung herself he drew a hand-
kerchief from the pocket of his dressing
gown and mopped his fce  you never
saw anything so horrible shes hanging
there to the high brass bedpost with the
chair kicked away from under her-
agnes screamed and covered her face with
her hands and mrs horton moaned but
henry jordan stood rigidly staring straight
before him with unseeing eyes mrs mof-
fat glanced at edgar north and he nodded
gravely
   mr jordan and i saw her too its-
a terrible thing i dont know about the
fomalities of the law up noth but if there
is anything i can do for any of you ladies
for mrs horton- he paused and al-
though pale-faced his tones were steady
   i dont think so but you might ask
the doctor to look in on miss harris on his
way down mrs moffat suggested me-
chanically  agnes ill see to mrs horton
now get the cook quieted and back to her
kitchen everybodys got to have some cof-
fee whether they want it or not to brace
up and go through with this dreadful busi-
ness i suppose a crowd will begin to collect
pretty soon if the policeman was seen to
come in here and then the doctor-
   ill put on my collar and coat and
north and i can go down and keep them
away from the vestibule offered henry
jordan passing his hand across his fore-
head mrs moffat saw that it came down
glistening with moisture and his voice
sounded now like that of a man roused with
difficulty from a dream  i suppose they
wont let us do anything-upstairs
  he stumbled from the room in the wake
of edgar north who had preceded him and
simeon darley asked helplessly
   what can i do after i phone to the
office and to think how happy she seemed
at dinner last night and then to find her
dead hanging like that
  for heavens sake mrs horton
moaned covering both ears with her
hands  if you say anything more youll
drive me crazy something must a hap-
pened when she went out last night but
why in the world didnt she come to me
and tell me fannie was a dear good girl
and she might a known there was nothing
she couldnt talk to me about its won-
derful you can keep so cam mis moffat
im thankful youre here to help me though
its terrible for you to get mixed up in this
poor girl poor girl
  the tears were coursing down her cheeks
and she wiped them away with the end of
the pillow case as officer burke paused on
the threshold
   come on darley ill need you till
a couple of the boys get over here from
the station house i dont want anybody
let up that top flight of stairs
  the importance of his mission filling him
with sudden composure darley gathered
his robe about him and departed and as
mrs horton rose and tottered to her
dresser still weeping her companion pro-
ceeded to her own room there while she
dressed hastily and rearranged her hair the
hideous unbelievable fact kept pounding
into her brain fannie gillespie hanged her-
self
  the slim white wraithlike thing which
had appeared to float there in the semi-
darkness of the room had been her body
dangling from the bedpost as from a gibbet
the girl whose last words had voiced the
wish that there wouldnt be  anything but
good times ever was dead thrust into the
unknown by the act of her own hand there
in the dark
  it wasnt true it couldnt be even as
she forced the truth with monotonous re-
iteration upon her consciousness mrs
moffat found herself rebelling refusing to
accept it fannies nervous apprehensive
manner her evasion of the point-blank

argosy-allstory weekly
question as to whether the man she called
 frank  had threatened her and the very
words of her reply  fellows say crazy
silly things about what theyll do when you
wont bother with them any more but they
dont do anything really -all these re-
turned to mrs moffats mind but they
offered no adequate explanation of the girls
suicide
  she had feared a quarrel a distasteful
scene such as had actually taken place on
the previous evening perhaps but surely
nothing more surely nothing could have
threatened her which left only the dread
alternative of self-destruction
  yet she must have had some reason
for that sudden desperate impulse did
henry jordan suspect what it could be he
had borne the shock of the discovery with
remarkable composure even for one of his
quiet self-contained temperament consid-
ering the fact that up to a few short weeks
before he had appeared to be deeply at-
tached to the girl his face had expressed
horror pain shrinking revulsion but not
an overwhelming surprise could he con-
ceive of some motive for fannies mad act
which had been hidden from her other as-
sociates even from the motherly but not
too discerning eyes of mrs horton
  a car drove up to the curb and stopped
and heavy footsteps passed along the hall
accompanied by the low mutter of mascu-
line voices before she finished dressing
and when agnes appeared at the door mrs
moffat was not unprepared for her an-
nouncement
   the police doctors come with another
man and theres more policemen in the
vestibule and on the sidewalk keeping the
crowd back do you hear them
  mrs moffat had indeed been subcon-
sciously aware of an increasing babel of
sound from below and the shuffle and
tramp of many feet on the pavement but
she had given it no heed in the turmoil of
her thoughts now she stepped to the
window and lifted the shade which flapped
over the open lower sash a small mob
was eddying about the cleared semicircle
held by several bluecoats before the old
fashioned high stoop delivery boys and
children on their way to school formed the
inner ring and the morbidly curious of the
neighborhood were clustered in the back-
ground while gesticulating knots of people
had filled the doorways and opened windows
across the street
  from either avenue were coming oth-
ers in a continuous stream attracted by
the crowd already gathered and the sight
of the police car drawn up at the curb
and mrs moffat hastily dropped the shade
and turned away
   mrs horton says will you please come
down to the dining room for your coffee
agnes inquired  mr jordans took mr
darleys place upstairs aint it terrible
about poor miss fannie i dont know
what theyre going to do with her but i
heard the police doctor say something about
an autopsy
   i suppose thats the usual thing mrs
moffat repressed a shudder  tell mrs
horton ill be right down
  in passing she glanced at the chair be-
side the table there only a few short hours
before fannie gillespie had sat her soft
blue cape like a cloud about her and the
paste diamonds glistening bravely as they
swayed pendent from her small ears she
had been looking forward to a  big party 
to-night and earlier she had remarked with
the liveliest anticipation that the beaches
 were going to be great this summer
was that the mental attitude of a girl who
contemplated death who secretly faced a
problem to which she could find only the
most tragic of solutions
  in the meantime mrs horton having
dressed and stemmed her tears had sum-
moned henry jordan from his self-imposed
duty in the vestibule and coaxed him to
swallow a cup of steaming coffee after
which officer burke had ordered him to
stand sentry for simeon darley on the top
floor and he passed the latter on the last
flight of stairs
  its-its hell henry the rotund
figure seemed to have shrunken beneath the
dressing gown and the stubby hands worked
convulsively  a shutter or something is
banging in there as though her heels were
drumming against the wall and i could
have swom i heard something like a groan
its a downright shame to leave her that
bright lights

way dont go near the door again my
boy it  break you all up
  but when his footsteps had died away in
the echoing well of the staircase henry
jordan after a swift glance about him
had gone straight to the yawning aperture
at the end of the hall where the shattered
door swung on its twisted hinges and reach-
ing in drawn it toward him the key was
still in the burst lock its bit protruding al-
most to the ward from the outer side of the
keyhole
  henry bent and studied it then with a
second quick glance behind him he whipped
out his handkerchief wrapped it carefully
around his hand and reaching behind the
edge of the door withdrew the key
  retreating to the center of the hall where
the sunshine came down in a pallid streak
through the skylight he held the key-by
the bow and examined the lock end with
puzzled attention while a slight frown gath-
ered on his forehead but a sound from
below roused him with a start and he hur-
ried back to the door
  when he had replaced the key he pushed
the door so that it swayed back to its former
position and then as he turned his gaze
fell for the last time on the vague outline
of the pathetically small inert form sus-
pended high in the gloom within and a
groan forced its way between his set teeth
  when burke ascended the stairs a mo-
ment later with the assistant medical ex-
aminer and another behind him he found
his deputy standing motionless beneath the
skylight his hands gripping the balustrade
and his head bowed so that a deep oblit-
erating shadow fell across his face
chapter iv
stevenson from headquarters
 vv  was fannie gillespie where
w did she come from do you
know the names and addresses
of any of her relatives the assistant
medical examiner a portentously grave
young man with a high bulging forehead
and stiff upstanding yellow hair like a
brush above it peered owlishly through his
large rimmed glasses as he sat beside the
center table in the parlor and shot his ques-
tions at the still dazed landlady
   her full name is frances may gilles-
pie and she came from up state-from
bison new york mrs horton replied
in a tone that still trembled  her parents
are dead and i dont know-seems to me
i did hear her speak of a brother but i
cant recall that she mentioned his name or
where he lived
   how long has she boarded here
   she come to me a year ago last march
that  be nearly fourteen months fannie
hadnt been away from home long then
shed been boarding with the aunt of a
girl who worked in the same place as her
ruthvens wholesale millinery it was
    she was employed there until the pres-
ent time
   no shes with louisette now i
mean -mrs horton caught herself up
with a shudder of remembrance- i mean
she was there yesterday
  the doctor nodded unconcernedly
    how old was she
   just twenty-one she had a birthday
on the twentieth of last month and caro-
line baked her a cake-
   just twenty-one the doctor made a
brief note  do you know if she was en-
gaged to be married
   oh no fannies a real popular girl-
i mean she was-and she had lots of gen-
tlemen friends who took her out but i
never heard of her promising to marry any
of em she-she wasnt thinking of set-
tling down yet all she cared about was
just having a good time mrs horton
paused and then added hastily  dont
make any mistake though fannie was a
thoroughly good girl and brought up care-
ful as anybody that knew her could tell
it was natural for her to like finery and
she copied the rich customers at the stores
as close as she could but all her jewelry
was only fake that she bought herself and
shed do without most anything for a
pretty dress
   who were these gentlemen friends
what are their names and where did they
work did you meet them
   mrs horton shook her head at the broad-
side of queries

argosy-allstory weekly
   i dont know fannie talked about
them of course but i dont recall their
names except three i never met any of
them when they called to take her out for
i dont hang around and poke my nose in
my boarders business let me see- she
spoke of an auto racer named frank black
and mr jack rogers a motion picture
actor and there was a ben newell who
was a new friend he runs some kind of a
scenic railway thing at one of the parks
fannie knew the auto racer longer i
think
   who was her most intimate friend
   a girl that works with her at louisettes
-eileen gaffney shes been here several
times on sundays-a real pretty stylish
lively girl-and i know they went out to-
gether often i wouldnt have called them
specially intimate though fannie d tell
you everything she knew straight off if she
liked you she was that kind
  tears welled up once more in the kindly
eyes and the doctor frowned asking has-
tily
   do you know of any reason for the
girls suicide had she appeared to be in
any trouble or difficulty low-spirited
has she asked about any letters or tele-
phone calls that didnt come-
  there was a third person present the
man who had arrived with the assistant
medical examiner throughout the inter-
view he had stood quietly by the window
seemingly intent on surveying the crowd
outside through the thick coarse lace cur-
tains but now he turned sharply a stocky
thick-set figure with sandy hair and a
shrewd genial twinkle in his brown eyes
  il no she was the happiest little thing
alive mrs horton asserted she al-
ways asked whod called her up and what
letters had come for her but she didnt
seem anxious about any particular one and
she didnt know what low spirits was ever
since air burke broke the door down for
me and found what-what shed done ive
been asking myself why why until im
most crazy
   thats the only thing could have hap-
pened to her that she went out of her
mind and yet there never was a saner more
clear-headed girl for all her foolishness
about clothes and fun she got nice money
at louisettes didnt go in any debt that i
ever heard of and hadnt any serious love
affair there aint a reason in the world why
she should think of dying much less making
away with herself
  the doctor glanced at his companion and
rose
   then you dont know of any one to no-
tify about her death
   not unless you can locate some gil-
lespies in bison if you mean about the
funeral expenses i guess i can take care of
them fannies been most like one of my
own family and i couldnt think of her lay-
ing in any charity grave i spose youll-
youll have to take her away for an au-
topsy
  the doctor nodded
   well let you know when an undertaker
can send for the body if no one claims it
ill arrange to take it away at once
  he turned to the door and the other man
joined him airs horton rose but they
paid no attention to her talking together
for a moment in a quick undertone then
the assistant medical examiner departed and
his companion closed the door and came
briskly back to her
   sit down again please airs horton
this is a pretty sad thing to have happen
in your house and of course you are as
anxious as we are to find out what motive
the girl had for killing herself he began
in a sympathetically confidential tone
 lets see if we cant get at some reason
you havent thought of yet you say she
was the kind of a girl to give her confi-
dence to anybody if she liked them but
there might have been something in her life
that she didnt talk about something that
happened before she ever came here you
remembered that she spoke of a brother
even though you couldnt recall his name
can you think what she said about him how
she happened to mention him at all
  airs hortons wet eyes clouded as she
turned them upon him
   i dont know as i ought to talk about
her family and there isnt anything much
that i could say of course you come with
the police doctor but-
  he smiled reassuringly
                    a
bright lights

   thats all right im stevenson from
headquarters and were only interested in
family gossip in order to get a line on the
girl herself what did she tell you about
this brother of hers
   i couldnt say in so many words mr
stevenson i can only give you the general
idea i got for she spoke of him in an off-
hand kind of way i gathered that he was
quite a little oldern her and slow-going and
though she seemed fond of him i guess
they wasnt much alike
   i know he was married for fannie
didnt like his wife she couldnt get on
with her and i always thought that was
why she left home though she was crazy
about the city ive known plenty country
girls but never one so hungry for the bright
lights i dont believe anything happened
before she came here that she brooded over
any love affair i mean
   who was the girl that worked in ruth-
vens the one whose aunt she boarded with
before she came to you
   i cant remember the name but it was
uptown somewhere mrs horton replied
when the detective mentioned  headquar-
ters  she had shrunk from him in horror
but his manner was so full of consideration
and evident good will that in her bewilder-
ment and deep trouble her unsuspicious
mind opened to him she reiterated  fan-
nie hadnt anything to worry about from the
past
   that was a big jump for a little coun-
try girl without any pull to go right from
a cheap wholesale house like ruthvens to
such a swell shop as louisettes steven-
son seemed to be following a line of thought
of his own  howd she make it
   oh that was luck-and her own pretty
smart air she posed for the head for some
pictures ruthven was getting out advertis-
ing their early spring line just before christ-
mas and louisette saw them and sent for
her fannie wasnt like a country girl mr
stevenson she had style and a proud little
way of holding her head as if she belonged
to society all her life it wasnt only her
prettiness made folks turn and look at her
even in the simplest things she wore there
was something about her i cant explain
and everybody admired her
   	a
  mrs horton wiped her eyes on a damp
rag of a handkerchief and the detective
nodded
   i get her type clothes mad and cov-
ered with fake jewelry-is this her stuff
all of it
  he suddenly emptied a small glittering
pile from his coat pocket upon the table
and mrs horton started then leaned for-
ward to examine it rings and earrings
brooches a necklace and a pendant blurred
before her eyes and their meretricious bril-
liance seemed to dull
   i guess so she responded uncertainly
 fannie had an awful lot of it but her
liking for it was innocent enough good-
ness knows shed have outgrown that fool-
ishness later on it was just because shed
wanted pretty things all her life i guess
   and sporty company she didnt go
with the kind of men that are usually at-
tracted to a working girl mrs horton
   i know the landlady sighed then
she added in quick defense  they was all
right or she wouldnt have let them take
her out fannie could take care of herself
anywhere and she did men all liked her
young and old but she didnt give any one
a serious thought
   there must have been some one the
detective smiled again  you cant help
seeing a lot when you run a boarding house
and you must have known who it was she
liked best or at least was kidding along
whats the most serious case she had
   none lately mrs horton disclaimed
hastily and then checked herself  just
a theater with one fellow and a dance or a
motor ride or a trip to one of the beaches
in summer with another-thats the way
fannies been going
    lately you say i mean before that
stevensons eyes narrowed as he gathered
up the imitation jewels and thrust them
back in his pocket  you neednt be afraid
to speak this wont go any further who
was it had a crush on her youve got sev-
eral men boarding here was it one of
them
  mrs hortons honest face flushed and her
hands tightened in her lap
   mr north dont count hes just come
and as for mr darley and mr jordan they

argosy-allstory weekly
both liked her i guess i never was one to
gossip and nothing ever come of it so there
dont seem any use in talking about it now
poor fannies dead-
  her tone was filled with very real dis-
tress but stevenson pursued inexorably
   thats precisely why mrs horton
darleys the older man got up like a sport
isnt he was he in love with her
   mercy no he did start to take her
out a great deal just a few weeks ago but
fannie was young and she liked young
company and i shouldnt wonder if he
found it kind of hard to keep up with her
anyway she began going around with her
boy friends again and mr darley stood
aside but theyve stayed good friends
   and the young fellow jordan he
showed her attention too
   yes hes lived here near three years
as fine and steady a boy as youll find any-
where he never seemed to have time to
bother with girls before fannie came he
was too taken up with making good in his
business but she just kind of took him off
his feet i expect mrs horton caught
herself once more  of course there wasnt
any engagement or anything and maybe i
only imagined it but i thought he cared
an awful lot for her there wasnt any
quarrel that i knew of but they cooled
off all of a sudden she began going out
more than ever and he only worked harder
 what does jordan do
   he sells steel office furnishings and hes
been busy inventing some kind of a patent
lock for filing cases i dont know anything
about it except thai he gets his room in a
clutter mrs horton shrugged you
see mr stevenson i cant tell you any-
thing if fannie went around with one
gentleman friend more than another i didnt
know it and she was gay and light-hearted
up to the very last minute shes been out
every single night this week
   do you know where and who she went
with stevenson had been thoughtfully
pacing up and down with slow swinging
strides but now he halted in front of the
landlady  what time did she get in each
night youve got a quiet house here
havent you dont you usually know what
hours your guests keep
  i should hope so mrs horton
straightened in her chair  not that im
nosey but i sort of keep an eye on my
young folks and ive never had a minutes
trouble in all these years until this terrible
thing came i take a look round every
night before i go to bed and i can generally
tell whos in and out
   fannie got in early monday night but
tuesday she went to a dance-i let her
press a dress to wear i remember because
it was the day mis moffat come at
brewster hall the dance was and she went
to it with mr rogers the motion picture
fellow i dont know what time she came
home then or the next night for there
wasnt any gas on in her room when i
looked the last thing and when she was late
she never made any noise
   you dont think shed come in earlier
and gone to bed the detective suggested
   no when she was home there was al-
ways a bright light in her room
   why stevenson asked quickly
 what did she do write letters read
 i never thought about it replied mrs
horton surprised  fannie wasnt much
of a letter writer unless she mailed them
outside and i never saw her with a book
in her hand except a fashion magazine
maybe she was always neat and dainty
though i guess perhaps she was mending
and fixing her clothes last night she
musta got in early for i saw the gas going
in her room but everything was quiet if
she was in any trouble it musta come up
while she was out and i just cant under-
stand it
  there was a little pause while she lifted
her handkerchief to her eyes once more
stevenson had turned as if about to pace
back and forth again but after a moment
he wheeled to face her and she saw that
he held in his hands a coil of slender but
strong rope streaked with dust and soot
a slip noose had been made in it and the
end which dangled was not frayed but had
been cut clean
   did you ever see any rope like this be-
fore he asked
  mrs hortons brow knit
   it looks like a length of ordinary clothes
line to me she replied  ive got some
bright lights

just like it strung up on the roof there
wasnt room in the yard for all i needed
   how do you gel up there
   to the roof mrs horton glanced
up at him  why through the trapdoor in
the hall closet on the top floor theres a
ladder leading up to it its right by fan-
nies door-oh good heavens you dont
mean- that-that isnt the rope she-
horror choked the words back in her
throat and stevenson nodded gravely
   the body was hanging from this by an
ordinary loop mrs horton when the as-
sistant medical examiner and i took it down
it has only recently been cut from a longer
piece and with some very sharp instrument
you can see how fresh the end is and how
it has been clipped short off not sawed
through by a dull blade-
   i dont want to see  mrs horton cov-
ered her face with her hands and her fat
body shook take it away i-i cant
look
  never mind he returned with com-
forting reassurance  you neednt look
at it now but i may ask you to later to
compare it with other pieces now you say
the girl was always happy and light-hearted
are you sure you didnt see any change in
her lately i want you to think carefully
please taking into consideration what has
happened can you recall a word even a
look that would show something was on
her mind something that not only
grieved her but frightened her
   why should she be frightened mrs
horton half rose from her chair  folks
dont kill themselves because theyre afraid
unless maybe theyve done something ter-
rible thats against the law and of course
fannie couldnt have done that what in
the world would she be afraid of
  you havent answered my question
a note of stem authority had manifested
itself in his tone  i want to know if at
any time lately the girl appeared to be in
dread of anything it doesnt matter what
thats our lookout havent you noticed
the least change in her
   why no  there was a shade less cer-
tainty in mrs hortons voice however
 shes been real nervous lately but i
thought that was because shed been on the
go so much and maybe tired out with the
spring rush of trade it did seem as if she
was just living on excitement-
   how did she show this nervousness
the detective interrupted
   well she jumped if anybody spoke to
her sudden and she kept looking around
over her shoulder if she happened to sit
with her back to a door or window-not
that she was still a minute if she could help
it i never saw anybody so restless as
shes been lately i said  good-by  to her
at the door out there two-three mornings
when she was starting for work and shed
peek out of the vestibule as if to see if some-
body was there and then scoot for the cars
and when she come home shed hurry no
matter how tired she was
   she always slept with the gas burner
going full tilt in her room and one night
last week at dinner something went wrong
with the main out in the street and i
thought shed have hysterics before agnes
brought lamps-goodness it never come
to me until just now but it does sound as
if fannie had been actually afraid doesnt
it
  stevenson did not reply directly but he
nodded as if what she had told him was in
accord with some idea of his own
   how long ago can you remember the
first indications of this in the girl
   let me see mrs horton passed her
hand over her forehead  two-three
weeks anyway maybe a month its been
getting worse now that i think of it mr
stevenson what does it mean you as
much as told me to mind my own business
a minute ago but it is my business i must
know what come to fannie gillespie right
here under my own roof and what she was
so afraid of that she killed herself
   perhaps she was fraid of the very thing
that did come to her here under this roof
mrs horton mr stevenson remarked
quietly  her door was locked from the in-
side and there isnt any fire escape nor
ladder nor even vine outside her window
but for all that we have no proof that the
hand which slipped that noose over her
head was her own

author of harness shy 
a novelette-complete in this issue
it was a spring morning in bordeaux
the bright rays of the sun promising
heat were moderated by cooling wanton
breezes from the bay of biscay on the
second story of the hotel des girondins a
set of shutters had been thrown back and
a window was open indicating to thoughtful
souls among the passengers in the rue ste
catherine that the room behind the window
was inhabited by some sort of savage-
probably american
  inside the room the barometer was fall-
ing storm clouds hovered in the west and
the mercury was bulging the top of the
thermometer a lady with sharp patrician
features blue eyes the magnolia-petal com-
plexion and black hair of andalusia or erin
sat gracefully slender and straight staring
through her lorgnette at a letter
  facing her from the other side of a table
on which the breakfast was growing stale
sat her husband he was short burly red
of cheek his head had once borne a fine
coppery mane it seemed but now his fore-
lock was brassy and his temples silvery
he too held a letter in his hands and
glowered at it through his horn rimmed
glasses
  at first the silence in the room was so
dense that the noises from outdoors butting
against it in vain fell back into the street
but soon within the chamber might be
heard a genteel hissing as the lady exhaled
through her arched nose at irregular but
frequent intervals a certain crescendo gur-
gling from the man and the rustling of the
sheets of paper in their trembling fingers
this is what the lady read
                         san francisco cal
  my own dear mamma
    i hope you are well and that you are en-
  joying your trip
a fortune hunting fool

    oh i hardly know how to tell you i have
  fallen in love with a man since you left and
  though i should like to have you and father
  at the wedding we cannot wait until you re-
  turn
    he is that handsome clerk in the book store
  the one whom we agreed looked like a poet
  i think he is one he hasnt written any
  yet but you should hear him talk he is
  ever so much more wonderful than i thought
  when you first called my attention to him
  and i shall always be grateful to you for do-
  ing it
    by the way he is a scion of one of the
  biggest families and one of the oldest in eng-
  lish history dont think of hurrying back
  for the wedding-that isnt at all necessary
  we have decided not to have a bothersome
  formal affair
    if it isnt too much trouble please send a
  ot of cablegrams telling the police to prevent
  the marriage and give out good spirited in-
  terviews to the press representatives about itj
  pa will know how to get the most advertis-
  ing out of it for roys work
                your loving daughter
                                      viola
    june 
 each time the handsome lady reached the
end of the letter she turned loose the breath
she had been holding and went back to the
beginning meanwhile her husband was get-
ting up steam with the following
                           san francisco cal
 my ownest daddy
    i hope you are well and that mamma does
  not have too much trouble in getting you to
  go to museums and art galleries you should
  go to them you know
    i am sure you will be greatly surprised to
  hear that i have resigned my position in your
  offices but i have the very best of reasons
  for not remaining there when i love a
  person his word is my law as you know
  and as my fiance does not want me to work
  after our marriage which is to occur imme-
  diately i really had to quit
   it is all so wonderful when you and
  mother left i would have gone with you but
  for my determination to become a business
  woman and be as much of a son to you as
  possible now i have fallen in love with a
  young business man and that simplifies mat-
  ters because he will be your son you see
    he is a salesman at present but he bas
  larger operations under way which when con-
  cluded will enable us to live in comfort with-
  out depending upon his salary it would
  be handy though if you could increase my
  allowance considerably just now
    his name is roy jones and he was born in
  kansas please do not curtail your trip be-
  cause we will probably be married before you
  could get here anyway
     if roy would only consent to a big wedding
   and a lot of nice publicity i think it might
   help the sale of his product-dont you if
   you could pretend to be very very angry and
   get it all into the dispatches maybe that would
   do just as well
                 your loving daughter
                                       viola
     june 
  when the lady and gentleman had got
their respective letters by heart they crum-
pled them savagely into balls and looked
fiercely at each other
    i suppose said the lady speaking rap-
idly  that letter informs you that your
poor romantic daughter has been ensnared
by a rogue
  the gentleman still eyed her sharply
but now there was a difference in his ex-
pression
   i dont know that i would use your
term she probably engineered this her-
self certainly she is not romantic she
seems practical to me-cold blooded even
his wife lifted her brows as she replied
 you admit it and what of this craving
for notoriety now perhaps you realize
the effect upon her of having a father who
has contrived to make his name a synonym
lor dried prunes the world over
  he seemed about to utter a hasty retort
but the swift even flow of his wifes voice
prevented
    in her heart viola is essentially roman-
tic idealistic like me it may be just as
well for her to marry if in that way she
can escape the atmosphere of crass com-
mercialism with which she has been sur-
rounded so long there is at least nothing
sordid about this she counts her social
position as naught when weighed against
her love she condescends to wed a poor
man without a word of regret i dare to say
that i do not blame her
   i expect to be censured for this and
i am resigned i know that she inherits
her generous nature from me did i not
marry a stiggs her lover seems to have
family at least
  mr stiggs who had with difficulty kept
still so far suddenly found his opening
   ha family yes hes got plenty of

argosy-allstory weekly
family ill admit that family to burn
jones his name is-get that my dear
roy jones a good plain name i call it
   romantic nothing there isnt a bit
of wishy-washy namby-pamby romance in
the whole thing i am glad to see that
viola has some of my common sense and
practicality i said she was cold blooded
and i meant it but i admire her for it
dont mistake me
   i realize however that she has possibly
imbibed some pernicious ideas of a senti-
mental nature from you therefore the
wedding must be postponed until i can
investigate this jones i shall not increase
her allowance i shall not let the slightest
hint of this leak out thwarted thus they
will have to wait until i relent
  mrs stiggs looked at him glassily
   i agree with you perfectly she said
in a tone of amazement  and we must
start back at once
   of course we must
  they glanced at each other curiously it
was years since they had agreed so readily
upon any subject of importance each felt
that the other was behaving unnaturally
finally mr stiggs gulped a cup os cold
coffee and with a last worried look at his
wife rirhed from the room in search of a
timetable
ii
  on the evening of the same day but six-
teen hours later such is the difference in
wme oa having just eaten an early sup-
per at the cliff house in san francisco
spoke softly across the table to her hus-
band
   roy she said  i have deceived you
instead of being the remote relative and
trusted stenographer of the great stiggs of
stiggss prunes i am his only child
  roy joness dark eyes habitually gentle
in expression widened slowly reminding
viola of a wounded fawn his lean cheeks
paled and his tall wiry figure was tense as
he exclaimed reproachfully
   oh viola 
  she nodded her ruddy blond head em-
phatically unabashed
   i would have told you before you
know but it might have worried you i
didnt want to trouble you during the
honeymoon if i had done it right at first
you are so honorable and upright and silly
and everything that you wouldnt have mar-
ried me-would you
   haidly
   i knew it dont look at me that way
roy i feel like a stranger and weve been
married two weeks it isnt such a dreadful
thing to marry an heiress-is it
   was that why you made me quit my
job roy was watching her curiously
 did you suppose i would live on your
money
  viola had an entrancing smile some-
times you might think her chin was carried
just a trifle arrogantly that her blue eyes
sparkled with a metallic gleam or that her
lips were a little too firmly shut but that
was only when you had known her long
enough to become inured to her charm and
when you were feeling especially disagree-
ably critical even then just let her smile
  her chin became gently round her eyes
half shut and shadowed by dark lashes
lost their former likeness to polished jew-
els bringing to him on whom they gazed
the thought of violets and then as this
gracious mutation reached its climax her
serene lips parted softly curving to grant a
fleeting glimpse of little even teeth be-
nevolent despot that viola was she never
wept or stormed to gain her will to van-
quish the rare hardshell who opposed her
whim she simply smiled
  she did it now reaching acrossto pat
her husbands hand
   i made you leave that bookstore be-
cause they wouldnt give you two weeks
vacation for our honey-half-moon you
shant go back there either thats no
place for a man like you whos fond of
dogs and horses and whod love to learn to
box if he could steal a few evenings from
reading new novels and reviews if you
were not so nice and persevering and pig-
headed youd have quit it long ago
   besides you havent the slightest talent
for pretending to be a highbrow youre
too sensible even to want to be one so
of course youd never make a real bookman
anyhow
   but i cant do anything else viola
a fortune hunting fool

you know that and if you love me youll
have to agree to it because-
  viola interrupted him she had been
fumbling in her hand bag and now she
thrust toward him copies of two letters
   dont worry dear she said confi-
dently  i have a plan by which you can
make a fortune and support me in style
but before i tell you i want you to read
these i wrote them just a week before our
wedding
  even in his present distress and doubt
roy was meekly obedient he read one
letter without comment he laid it down
carefully when he had finished glanced fur-
tively at viola and began the other as
he neared the end of the second letter he
looked startled at last he passed his hand
across his forehead worriedly holding a
sheet of paper in each hand he compared
the two he dropped them at last and with
something like despair in his expression
peered at viola who looked strangely com-
placent even smug
   viola he began  i dont seem to
understand i suppose i should-you have
expressed yourself clearly but-well-in
fact i must be dull-
   no youre not she assured him  its
the letters tell me just what you think of
them
  roy hesitated stammered but at last
spoke out doggedly
   it looks as if youd lied in one letter
and then when you wrote the other forgot
what youd made up before and got out a
new set of prevarications contradicted
yourself too i dont say anything about
the apparent brutality with which you have
treated your parents but it strikes me you
could hardly have done better if you had
deliberately tried to prejudice them against
me you might at least have told that i
didnt know of their relation to you they
will think im a crook
  viola flushed delicately with a modest
lowering of her eyelids
   thats what i thought she said
  what viola
   oh i meant them to think that i
couldnt think of any other way to make
them come home its my duty to keep
them happy and contented you know the
letters will fetch them and what with their
secret liking for you theyll love you as
soon as they make your acquaintance
   i am sure you meant well said roy
kindly but sadly  though why you
think they should have any regard for me
i cannot-
   but they will she interrupted- that
is plain enough my mother is romantic
she is of ancient and exalted lineage too
so i described you according to her specifi-
cations for eligibility i used the same
system on papa viola continued  he
admires plain practical self-made men like
himself i told him you were one
   whether these are lies or not depends
upon you not me all you have to do is
to be dashing gallant practical and busi-
nesslike-a perfect lover and a financial
genius youd be that now if you had
any money and ill show you how to get it
   you wonder why i surprised them so
cruelly well you see my father doesnt
like to travel but he went to europe with
my mother as a favor she went to look
up the family records and ancestral estates
of her father theyve been there two
months and she has found no family no
lands no records father was getting dys-
peptic and sarcastic mother was becoming
a nervous wreck but would not give up
   this news will fix everything papa
will get back to pie and buckwheat cakes
in time to save his health and disposition
and mammall be able to say that she could
have located her ancestors if shed had
time
   i didnt want to take any more of my
fathers money now and i wanted to keep
our marriage from the general public until
you had time to get started so i asked for
money and advertising theyll ait me off
and keep mum
  roy shook his head wearily  i doubt
whether i shall ever understand you
viola he wondered aloud
   roy she said softly  happiness is
never bought except upon the installment
plan you get the first part on approval-
then struggle the rest of your life to pay
for that and the remainder of the set
   we met and loved that was our trial
shipment but to keep our happiness and

argosy-allstory weekly
complete it a payment was due i made it
you have admitted that if i had acted dif-
ferently you would not have married me
now i know that you would never have
done so you would have drudged along
and worried over it a while convincing
yourself that you were foolish to love me
and that brown eyed bookkeeper would
have got you the hussy
   as for not telling my parents what an
ignorant honest good foolish thing you
are-as for not telling them that you didnt
know who i was-nobody could believe it
who didnt know you so i didnt men-
tion it
   you are more clever than i said roy
   i am she admitted- clever and
tricky and a very useful liar i can
guarantee to offset your open and honorable
silliness
  she again gave him her hand and he
pressed it hard
   there now she said after blinking
rapidly several times  lets hurry you
must take me home and begin to make your
fortune before dark
   home you mean the hotel
   oh yes she agreed  we must go
there first to get our luggage then we
keep our tryst with opportunity dont get
excited dear im not taking you to the
family mansion

  and as it proved she certainly was not
roy was surprised and unnerved as carry-
ing two heavy traveling bags he stood on
the sidewalk looking up at the place she
called  home the more so as viola had
so far refused to tell him what it was that
she wanted him to do
  but it was not its distance above the
roadway which astonished him no a
san franciscan thinks little of having his
front door fifty feet above the sidewalk it
was the tall wooden house itself and the
neighborhood which made violas choice
seem eccentric
  it was a two-story building eight sided
with a door and two windows in each side
of the ground floor three windows in each
side of the second story and a pyramidal
roof surmounted by an octagonal cupola
it was painted a grass green with white
trimmings
  the knoll on which the house stood was
half a block wide at the base and sloped
so steeply that it was still forty feet wide
on its flat top it stood squarely between
two streets facing on a third yet for all
its height a steeper hill rose higher just
behind it the foundations of the tower-
ing tenements next door were as high as the
second story windows of the house on the
knoll on the side where roy stood the
ground was level for three hundred yards
or more all the way to the docks on the
bay
  though roy had never been there before
as many san franciscans have not he knew
that this north beach district was a strange
place for viola to live a district of tene-
ments inhabited by hucksters fishermen
laborers and bootleggers a district full of
hand laundries macaroni factories strange
odors of frying oil and crushed grapes and
fish and garlic this from the crest of
the hills to the street at the foot of the
knoll from there to the waters edge-
warehouses and factories docks and ships
  roy followed viola through a tottery gate
in a wooden fence and up a flight of stairs
half concealed in the luxuriant wild grass
which clothed the knoll to the wide wooden
platform which encircled the odd house
here he dropped his burden and sat down
panting on the top step
  viola settled herself beside him and with
the house at their backs they rested a mo-
ment looking out at telegraph hill upon
the right the heights toward fort baker on
the left and straight ahead the roofs the
wharves the ships the narrowed neck of
the bay and beyond that the purple hills
of marin county marching down into the
golden gate
  when she had got her breath viola ex-
plained a little
   this is my house roy she said  my
only dowry it was left me by my grand-
mother i furnished it and have been liv-
ing here with a servant ever since i have
known you thats why i never let you
take me home-afraid you would be offend-
ed by the neighborhood and quit me
   i sent the girl back to fathers house
a fortune hunting fool

in burlingame by messenger this morning
she and her husband stayed here while we
were on our wedding tour it is our only
property at present and apropos of my re-
marks on happiness earlier this evening i
think you may be interested to know that
even this geometrical love nest may not be
ours to enjoy without a struggle
   but isnt it yours now
   yes but some one is trying to steal
the greater part of it
   steal it
   yes the important part the house
is worth nothing practically and the lot
is valueless in spite of the crowded locality
because nothing worth while can be built
here until this knoll is leveled at tremendous
expense the value here is all in the hid-
den treasure and a man is trying to steal
that
 treasure roy exclaimed now
viola dont keep startling me this way
everything youve said to-day has been a
little more astonishing than the previous
statement if it isnt asking too much
would you mind telling me about this house
and the treasure and the person who is
trying to steal it
   it is strange isnt it remarked viola
cheerfully  first ill tell you about my
grandfather and this house which he built
my mothers father i mean the french
nobleman he came here and built it dur-
ing the gold rush gathered a fortune and
hid it without telling anybody and then
died
   the old noblemans end was tragic
he passed away from concussion of the
brain sustained by falling off this roof while
attempting to raise a flag on the cupola in
memory of the second election of general
grant his last words were concerned with
the treasure but he didnt have time to tell
it all he said  if you ever need money
look behind the old mop
   my grandmother followed this advice at
once the only mop she knew of was one
in a broom closet beside the fireplace she
looked behind that even tore out the closet
and part of the chimney but never found
the treasure my mother has searched too
and i have but we never found it we
would have decided perhaps that there
had never been a treasure if it were not
that this mysterious chap comes every so
often and tries to steal it
   he came once just before my grand-
mother died and frightened her nearly out
of her wits before she drove him away
with a muzzle loading revolver he came
once more when there was only a care-
taker in the house and tried to break in at
intervals for nearly two weeks however
after being captured by the police and es-
caping again on the way to the jail he dis-
appeared now however he is back again
and to make it more certain than ever
that it is the treasure he is after he acci-
dentally left a cryptogram undoubtedly
written by my mothers father telling where
the treasure is hidden
   he did roy exclaimed  where is
it hidden then
   i dont know viola admitted  i
havent been able to read the cryptogram
thats what i want you to help me with
   and you persuaded me to quit my job
so that i could help you search for it
   yes
   i think viola dear said roy  that
this is the most senseless proceeding i have
ever heard of but i assure you i shall enjoy
it immensely we can live on the remnant
of my savings as long as possible and hunt
this hidden hoard when we are entirely
exhausted financially and sure that we are
not to find any money i can go to work
again by that time you will probably be
ready to return to your parents
he broke suddenly into loud laughter
viola was astounded at the bitter hard
undercurrent of feeling in his voice she
was hurt and dismayed that he failed to
believe in the treasure
   i think we may as well go in she said
iv
  despite the bizarre look of the exterior
the inside of the house proved a cheery
place enough two sides of the big single
room which was the lower floor were occu-
pied by the great fireplace and the stair-
way to the upper floor only one of the
six doors seemed to be in use the other
five were blocked by pieces of furniture-

argosy-allstory weekly
two heavy bookcases a writing desk a
cabinet phonograph a grand piano divans
and window seats stood across the angles
under the windows and between the doors
reducing somewhat the apparent size of the
enormous room
now with polished floor reflecting the
light of the half dozen quaint ships lanterns
which at violas direction roy lighted and
hung from hooks on the heavy ceiling beams
and the wooden pillar in the center of the
floor its air was much more homely and
comfortable than he had expected he
would have liked to examine the apartment
in detail but viola beckoned him to a place
beside her on one of the window seats while
she struggled to unlock the antique and
massive oaken escritoire with a tiny brass
key which roy had noticed she wore like a
bangle on a strand of gold chain about her
wrist
 there she said as finally it yielded to
her struggles  please tell me what that
means
he stared at a slip of paper bearing the
words and design here reproduced

but this is new paper he protested
instantly  and that writing is not more
than a few weeks old the ink has barely
turned from blue to black
   of course it isnt the original she re-
assured him  you can hardly read that
its so faded this is a tracing i made it
is absolutely accurate
  roy still regarded the jumble of letters
with a frown of reluctant and perplexed
interest
   what he again inquired  is the
meaning if any of this jagged line on the
left and the straight border on the other
side and the ends
   i drew it she said  and very care-
fully too it represents exactly the size
and shape of the piece of paper on which
the original was written the left hand
edge of that was rough uneven and shred-
ded i think the note must have been writ-
ten on a page torn from a notebook
  roy nodded then laid the thing aside and
turned to viola with the kindly yet patron-
izing air with which one explains to a child
that there cannot be a bear in the upper
hall
   xow viola he said  just why do you
attach such importance to this scribble
viola sighed as women must in dealing
with the slower if more logical sex and
gave her reasons
  	 it came to me from the hands of the
mysterious prowler he missed it came
back after it and took it away with him
again so it must be something valuable
the value doesnt show on the surface so
it must be a cryptogram i should think
you could see that i know that it relates
to the treasure some way and even if i
didnt theres the word mop to prove it
   you got it from the prowler
   i did but i dont think he knows it
the day i came to see about fitting this
house up to live in i surprised an intruder
a man he saw me coming that is and as i
reached the top of the knoll he burst out
of the house through a door on the opposite
side and ran away he left the original
of this note behind him he couldnt have
been in the house long for the old man who
was taking care of the place for me was
pottering about upstairs and had seen no
one
   i suspected the value of what i had
a fortune hunting fool

found so i copied it and left the original
outside on the platform making sure that it
couldnt blow away that night the watch-
man heard somebody trying to break in
and in the morning the slip of paper was
gone
   that is different roy admitted eager-
ly  i begin to think that you have some-
thing which if not valuable is at least the
key to a mystery
   but i am afraid that this is only a por-
tion of the cryptogram in fact if the torn-
off part were restored there might be little
difficulty in reading it my theory is that
the other half of this sheet of paper is
concealed somewhere in the house your
nocturnal prowler knows that and is looking
for it now if he with greater information
than we possess cannot read the cipher nor
find what he is seeking it would be useless
for us to attempt it i think the proper
thing for us to do is first capture your bur-
glar then force him to divulge whatever in-
formation on the subject he may have
  viola clapped her hands softly but
dropped them into her lap as an objection
occurred to her
   but we mustnt call in the police roy
i want to surprise everybody when we get
the money and you mustnt be reckless
   i shall be in no danger said roy  a
person as timorous as he seems to be can-
not be a man of great physical strength or
hardihood has he been trying to break
in lately
   indeed he has the people who have
been staying here say that he has not missed
a night in the last two weeks they had a
system of strings connected to all the doors
and windows in this room in such a man-
ner that if any one of the cords was dis-
turbed it overbalanced a keg containing
several cowbells and caused it to roll down
the staircase from the second floor they
were never able to catch the disturber al-
though he was so persistent forcing them to
get up several times every night to reset
their mechanism that they were quite worn
out and ready to give notice when i relieved
them of their duties here
  ah said roy thoughtfully of
course they could not catch him the chap
was warned as soon as they were now
i	intend to let him think that you are
here alone he will approach as boldly
as ever i shall be in waiting and surprise
him he cannot elude me for i shall be
outside the house
   but suppose he has some coign of van-
tage near by from which he watches viola
asked  he probably makes certain that
the coast is clear before he approaches
   that is most likely roy agreed  but
hark
  they listened and in a moment a dis-
tant prolonged hoarse bellow came faintly
to them from the west he beckoned her to
the door and opened it more loudly now
carried by a cold damp smelling wind the
melancholy siren roared again
   one of the outer stations sounding its
fog signal roy told her  i think that
with this wind to carry it the night will be
thick enough for our purpose within half
an hour if you are not afraid i can pre-
tend to go now while it is clear as soon
as the mist is thick enough i shall creep
back
  viola demurred somewhat at this plan
chiefly it seemed because she was to have
little part in the excitement but she did
agree finally stipulating that roy was to
whistle a few bars of the barcarolle from
 hoffman  as a signal the instant the fun
started viola held the door wide for a
minute or two while roy made an elabo-
rate farewell for the benefit of any specta-
tor then he clattered loudly down the
wooden steps while she went slowly inside
v
  returninc through the fog after a swift-
ly circuitous walk through the back alleys
of the neighborhood roy was by no means
certain that he knew his way until at last
his outthrust hands encountered the damp
and spongy top rail of a fence he recalled
then that there had been such a barrier
around the knoll and climbed it he went
forward even more cautiously now through
damp tangible dark through grass that
soaked him to the knees
  he could see nothing at the fence the
street behind him where an arc light was
barely visible but plainly audible had

argosy-allstory weekly
seemecl slightly less dark than the space
ahead but before he had gone a dozen
paces strain his eyes as he might there
seemed nowhere the slightest graying of the
absolute murk at the hundredth step
twice the distance from the fence to the
bottom of the knoll he knew that he was
confused and halted
  at once now that his own movement had
ceased there came to his ears the sound of
heavy breathing the slither of clamp soles
on smooth hard footing and a hollow in-
termittent bumping all this was direcdy
in front of him and so close that he auto-
matically recoiled a step from sheer sur-
prise the next instant he rushed forward
tripped and sprawled on wet planks
  the shuffling and bumping could still be
heard plainly but now it was going from
him not in a normal manner however
the noise exactly similar to that of a man
in tennis shoes kicking an empty keg along
a boardwalk was mounting up into the air
in eerie style
   shuffle shuffle tunk
  at first the boards on which roy lay had
been vibrating in unison with it but now
the sound was high above him
  roy started again but more cautiously
and again was stopped sharply bruising his
shins against the stairway which led up the
knoll he hastened upward following the
noise he stopped at the top to listen
but heard nothing he ascertained by feel-
ing that the nearest door and the dark win-
dows at each side of it were still securely
fastened and moved on to the next faqet
of the house
  here also everything was secure he
moved stealthily on he was examining the
ninthdoor when he remembered that the
building held eight only he stopped to
consider the matter and was badly startled
when a sweet voice whispered somewhere
in the night  was that you roy
  pawing nervously about him in the dark
roy answered
 viola viola
   oh there you are came the reply
calmly  where have you been
   oh all around where are you
    at my window of course
   oh
   what are you doing now viola asked
after a short pause
   why i was thinking said roy  i
was wondering where the fellow had gone
perhaps ive frightened him away
  violas silvery response held just a hint
of impatience
   hardly he went up on the roof
   on the roof what is he doing there
  dont know youre supposed to be
watching him why are you whispering
have you caught cold
  roy spoke louder but humbly still
 wont he hear us talking
   he cant i think i can hear him mov-
ing about inside now in the cupola he
climbed up a ladder i cant understand
why you dont know that he made so
much noise carrying it that he woke me
you must be right beside it
   ouch exclaimed roy  yes here it
is
  he had backed up in a futile effort to see
the roof and in doing so had struck his
head against the underside of the ladder
whose foot was planted near the outer edge
of the walk
  the feeling of futility which always op-
pressed him in violas presence the melan-
choly certitude that whatever he did would
probably be wrong had been especially
strong during their last conversation he
had sensed that she was again disappointed
in him here now was the opportunity to
do something on his own initiative with-
out pausing for speech he trotted up
crouched in the gutter of the roof long
enough to give the ladder a mighty kick
and facing about started to climb the slope
of the roof on all fours
  luckily the roof was not steep for it was
very slippery roy reached the cupola
quickly and clinging to the two comers for
it was not more than five feet on a side
rose on his knees to peer over a window
sill waist high above the roof
  the window hinged at top was unfas-
tened and swayed at the touch of his nose
but roy did not enter at once for there
was a light in the tower and the scene he
beheld convinced him there was more to
gain by waiting a bit
  the floor of the eight-sided room was two
a fortune hunting fool

feet below the roof front roys point of
view the interior was like a pit but the
purpose of the tower was made evident by
a three foot brass telescope mottled with
verdigris which hung from the ceiling by
an iron bar and adjustable gimbals its big
end facing out to sea however roys more
immediate interest centered in the dark in-
distinct human figure who stooping low
was scrutinizing the rectangle of wall on
one side of the room below the window
frame
  with his back to roy and his face
pressed close to the figured wall paper the
fellow was going over it inch by inch-
peering feeling prodding with his fingers
rapping with his knuckles suddenly the
trespasser seized a thick piece of lighted
candle stuck on a bench against the wall
and moving it closer fixed it firmly again
then drawing a daggerlike knife from his
waistband he began to peel away the wall
paper from the center of the space he had
been investigating
  roy tilted the window inward with one
hand and lowered his leg over the sill the
burglar engrossed in his mysterious oper-
ation did not notice the slight sound roy
was breathing fast with excitement he
moved with the utmost stealth from the
window sill he slid down until his feet
touched the floor crouching so slowly that
his knees creaked with effort he swung the
window shut and bolted it
  certain that the stranger was about to
uncover the treasure roy planned to let
him do so then force him to disgorge
though he did not waver in this determi-
nation he began to wonder as the mo-
ments passed by what means he could ac-
complish his end he saw all but too late
that the fellow was taller than he also
inches broader in the back and that the
huge scarred hands plied the wickedly
sharp knife with ominous skill
  roy reflected that the sort of husband
viola deserved could knock a burglar sense-
less with a blow of his fist but roy feared
that such a feat was beyond him it sound-
ed difficult and he had never tried it he
wished now that he had made a practice of
assaulting brawny strangers from time to
time to get his hand in
  he decided with regret to abandon the
heroic style he reached upward to lift the
heavy telescope from its gimbals a rusty
creaking attracted his attention toward the
floor a trapdoor the only means of enter-
ing the cupola from inside the house rose
groaning three inches then it dropped
with a bang
  the robber whirled at the sound facing
roy for the first time
  he was wearing a pea-jacket with the col-
lar turned up to his ears and his old
flapped cap was pulled low yet roy saw
to his intense surprise peering out from
under the cap above the big burly body
the face of a man no longer young the
eyes though bright and quick seemed sunk-
en under wrinkled lids the cheeks were
flattened bowed inward the jaw was as
sharp as the corner of a board and the
point of the projecting chin was frosted
with a silvery stubble
  roy had been ready to act but the un-
expected quality of his foe caused him to
hesitate the thought of striking a middle-
aged man under the ear with a twenty
pound telescope was one which offended
his sense of propriety instead he stood up
and started forward with the intention of
being gentle but firm
  the prowler did not wait with a snarl
of rage he flew into action of appalling
violence carried away apparently by un-
controllable passion he dashed his fist
against the wall actually sinking his hand
into it above the wrist roy halted invol-
untarily at this feat of strength a sudden
weakness afflicting the pit of his stomach
the burglar withdrew his fist and doused
the candle with a sweep of his free hand
  the trap had been rising again before
the light went out but it thudded shut
just as roy was knocked off his feet and
flung aside by the intruder who was rushing
toward the window
  roys only injury was that to his sensi-
bility his feelings were hurt he lost his
temper and his former scruples at the same
instant he lost his breath he had no soon-
er struck the floor than he tried to rise but
something held him by the ankle with a grip
like the jaws of a bear trap
  one tug assured roy that he could never

argosy-allstory weekly
pull loose yet such was his rage that he
ignored his suffering and stretching out at
full length groped fiercely as the burglar
had just got the window open and was
passing out roys fingers found and seized
the tail of the pea-jacket
  roy dug in his nails and gritted his
teeth the burglar cursing horribly pulled
like a mule roy wondered panting who
would weaken first meanwhile the strain
on his fingers and arms was becoming great-
er and greater as the miscreant gradually
developed his full drawbar horse power
also his cursing in a hoarse yet high
pitched voice was becoming truly frightful
  at this juncture roy experienced a new
and peculiarly excruciating twinge in his
ankle it felt exactly as though some one
were sticking pins into him he groaned
and spasmodically contracted his muscles
with the strength of frenzy
  there was a ripping sound a piece of
cloth came away in roys hands and he fell
slackly against the floor listening to a swift
rushing sound as the robber so suddenly
released tobogganed down the slippery
roof the sliding noise ceased roy pic-
tured the body hurtling from the eaves off
into space a single wild cry faint with
distance reached his ears
vi
  roy was shocked by the sudden fate
which had overtaken the hoary desperado
but he was granted no leisure in which to
philosophize about it another stabbing
pain in his ankle caused him to writhe
and cry out with an intuition born of ne-
cessity
   viola stop hurting me youve caught
my foot in the trapdoor
  as he had suspected viola was close at
hand she answered at once icily
   my name is mrs jones to you the
sooner you tell me where the treasure is
and the more respectful you are about it
the sooner i shall release you
   but im roy the robbers gone
viola retorted skeptically  then whistle
the signal we agreed upon
   i cant he kicked me in the mouth
and my iips are swollen roy informed her
after an ineffectual effort  dont you
recognize my shoe and sock
  there was silence for a moment while
viola examined the evidence then the pres-
sure on roys ankle was suddenly released
the trapdoor flew open and viola climbed
through it earning a lamp roys first
glance at her was one of reproach but his
sweet disposition immediately prevailed and
he smiled forgivingly
  he related briefly his adventure while
renewing the circulation in his foot and as
soon as he could stand they hurried down-
stairs to look for the robbers remains
  it was a ghastly business-searching the
side of the knoll in the fog with only the
lamp to guide them dreading to find the
thing they sought they clung to each
other and spoke little thinking soberly
wondering whether they were entirely free
of responsibility for the fate of this their
fellow creature it was not until they bad
scanned one whole side of the knoll from
top to bottom that they began to hope
but when finally they reached the fence it-
self and made a complete circuit of the
knoll without stumbling over a corpse they
turned to each other silently entering each
others arms damp cheek against damp
cheek in wordless gratitude
  a few minutes later found them again in
the watchtower the candle still lay un-
lighted and the window through which the
robber had made his hurried exit was closed
viola went straight to the hole in the wall
but after a moments investigation she with-
drew her hand blackened with dust looking
both surprised and disappointed roy too
felt around in the hole finding oddly
enough a perfectly smooth empty recess
behind it about six inches square he had
withdrawn his fist slightly tearing the paper
at the edge of the opening when viola bent
again to look at it
   why no wonder he could put his fist
through it if he knew the right place she
cried-its nothing but paper
   but how did he know it
   i think said viola  that the treasure
was there and he knew it he broke in
and snatched the jewels when you sur-
prised him but until then he probably
intended to pull the paper away neatly and
a fortune hunting fool

paste it back again so that the patching
might pass unnoticed until he was beyond
pursuit
   but jewelry exclaimed roy  and
you think he got it
   if not in the form of jewelry how else
could a treasure of great value be com-
pact enough to carry away in one hand
whether he got them or not i dont know
   he must have declared roy despond-
ently  it isnt there now or perhaps
somebody beat him to it for i dont think
he could have got anything without my
seeing it
   but perhaps you did think hard try
to remember viola persisted
   hum roy ejaculated he bowed his
head and placed his hands over his eyes
for a minute then he slowly looked up
again
   viola he said sadly  i guess the hunt
is over after he made the hole in the wall
he put his hand into his pocket
   which pocket
   his right hand coat pocket oh why
didnt the old villain break his neck you
were right viola-it must have been a
jewel and hes got it-hes-
   i think not viola interrupted  ive
been asking questions simply because i did
not want to be disappointed roy tell me
what is that
  astonished roy leaned forward and fol-
lowed the direction of her stare then he
pounced upon something lying in the shad-
ow against the wall
   the piece of jacket i tore off and
from the right side at that with the pocket
in it
  he started to fumble at the flap but
stopped quickly and handed the rag to
viola she accepted it and drew out at
once an extremely short stemmed corncob
pipe blackened and stained and odorous
which she placed on the bench beside her
as far away as she could reach next she
produced a small piece of plug tobacco
which she placed beside the pipe then a
pocket notebook bound in brown calfskin
but though she turned the pocket inside
out it held no more
   i was wrong said viola holding up
the notebook  it was this he came for
not the treasure this must be the key to
the cipher
  roy dropped down beside her on the
bench while she opened the book and
flipped over the pages all were blank she
closed it and turned her bewildered eyes to
roy
   but look here viola-see here
he took the book from her and opening
it again pointed to the slightly protruding
ragged edge of what had been the first leaf
 see he has torn out a page
speechless they stared at one another for
a moment
   oh cried viola
  they jumped up and side by side ran
down the stairs to the old writing desk
the left edge of violas copy of the cryp-
togram corresponded exactly with the rag-
ged ruffle where the page had been torn
from the notebook
   it means something-but what viola
remarked
   i think roy answered deferentially
 that it means he like ourselves was un-
able to read the cipher but knew where
the notebook was and came after it hoping
or knowing that it contained additional in-
formation if i am right we are more than
even with him for we are in possession of
the property
   but what shall we do
  here at last roy was not at a loss his
extensive reading had made the proper pro-
cedure in such cases perfectly familiar
   we must learn the secret of the cryp-
togram at once he declared  we must
try every method of reading it also it is
more than likely that the seemingly blank
pages of that notebook have been written
upon with sympathetic ink we must test
them we had better try heating one por-
tion of each sheet dipping another in dilute
acid and washing the third with an alkaline
solution
   i could do that i think viola offered
eagerly  you try to decipher the cipher
while i do the chemical experiments
  a coal fire had been laid in the grate
and now viola lighted it and busied herself
with toasting fork and trays of vinegar and
soda water roy sat at the writing desk
he held a pencil in his hand poised over a

argosy-allstory weekly
sheaf of clean white paper with furrowed
brow he gazed alternately at the crypto-
gram and at an open copy of  the gold
bug
vii
  the fog had gone and the light of a new
day was beginning to dim the lamps when
viola finished toasting the last page and
roy gathering up an armful of scribbled
sheets came to add them to the fire
   i have found nothing viola told him
wearily
   nor have i its odd too i have tried
every method of reading ciphers that i ever
heard of and some i invented but none of
them worked
   how he expected grandmother to read
it i dont know
   the key to it all was behind the old
mop declared roy l wherever that may
have been
  viola nodded as he helped her to her
feet
   look she said going to the eastern
windows- it is just growing light we
have been up all night i dont think i
ever did such a thing before-except at a
party i shall make some coffee and waf-
fles before we worry about this treasure any
more
  roy did not answer convinced by the
events of the past evening that there really
was a treasure his constitutional dread of
the future his lack of confidence in his
own abilities had left him for a time
buoyed up by the thought that a great
stroke of good fortune was to befall him
he had dreamed grand dreams he had
always felt secretly that with a little cap-
ital to start him he could do great things in
business
  now tired mentally and physically at
the end of his resources he thought blackly
of poverty misery and dishonor and yet
this being the nature of mundane affairs
within a few seconds he was to strike a new
scent
  as viola started upstairs to the kitchen
there was a single loud knock at the front
door they were both nervous they both
twitched at the startling sound and viola
only half smothered a scream with irri-
table reaction roy ran to the door flung
it open and seeing no one there rushed
outside a moment later he returned with
the morning paper in his hand
  ob said viola greatly relieved-
 that awful newsboy he always throws
it like that some mornings he wakes me
up i thought that horrid man had come
back-or the police to arrest us for mur-
dering him but of course i knew he wasnt
murdered at all i mean i just felt that way
because i was startled-
  but roy was not listening
   look at that he interrupted pointing
to the top of the right hand column on the
front page of the paper  just read that
viola
 it was properly an obscure hospital
item and did not deserve its place but
the editor had seen in it a chance to knock
the police department and rail at careless
motorists two things he was keen on doing
just then so he had rewritten the bald
report and given it a prominent position
however violas interest was in the story
itself which with headlines omitted ran as
follows
    the victim of police laxity and inefficiency
  in curbing reckless driving an elderly man
  was run down last night on the north beach
  and spent several hours wandering in search
  of help before finding a patrolman
   at the emergency hospital where he was
  brought in at eleven oclock the victim who
  gave the name of sydney cove declared that
  he was struck down without warning while
  crossing lombard street near the presidio and
  painfully injured made his way along the
  water front halfway to the ferry building
  without meeting a policeman
    he cornered one at last near the foot of
  telegraph hill roundsman daniel grogan
  who sent in the call for the ambulance
   the victims injuries were diagnosed as
  sprains and bruises of the right arm and
  shoulder bruises and abrasions of the head
  and entire right side and possible internal in-
  juries he was unable to give the license num-
  ber or furnish a description of the machine
  that struck him owing to the heavy fog
  but the police as usual claim to have a clew
   cove gave his occupation as seaman and
  australia as his home his injuries are not
  considered likely to prove fatal
  but said viola guessing at roys
thought  this cant be our man he
                         	a
a fortune hunting fool

wandered for hours it says and he got hurt
out by the presidio
   thats what he told them roy agreed
 but you noticed of course that he was
found within a few blocks of this house
barely half an hour after our man fell from
the roof i shall call on him at the hospital
to see anyway
  roy attempted to telephone for a taxi
after breakfast but found the telephone
wires broken which accounted for the bur-
glars miraculous escape from death for he
must have fallen across them about half-
way to the ground checking in a great
measure the force of his descent viola
contended that they would not be allowed
to visit the hospital at such an hour and
that the street car was a conveyance better
suited to their financial status roy proved
unusually stubborn though and finally
went out to look for a public phone some
half hour later as they rode luxuriously to-
ward the hospital he explained his plans
   while i was about it i called the stew-
ard at the emergency and asked whether
any one had come forward to befriend the
unfortunate mr cove and remove him
perhaps to more homelike surroundings i
was told that some one had done so and
that the patient was to be removed where
he could be taken care of at this good fel-
lows expense at nine oclock
   some philanthropist do you know
who where is he going to
   not a philanthropist i am afraid one
of coves pals they are taking this meth-
od of removing him from the observation of
the police once he leaves his present quar-
ters i doubt whether we should ever find
him again
   but what can we do viola asked
   it has been arranged declared roy
darkly
  viola was greatly astonished at this evi-
dence of secretiveness and low cunning on
roys part but she would undoubtedly
have wormed his scheme from him if the
taxi had not come to a stop just then at
their destination
  roy got out beckoned the driver and
crisply telling viola to wait went into the
jail-like highly odorous building
  ten minutes elapsed before they came
   	a
out again and viola was becoming greatly
worried not only by the constant motion
of the taximeter but also by visions of
roy under arrest at last however they
reappeared the chauffeur and a white jack-
eted hospital attendant staggering as they
carried the much bandaged and carelessly
dressed figure of a large and bulky man
  viola could only see one of this fellows
eyes and a part of each cheek the rest
of his head and face being swathed in white
gauze but from the startled slightly blood-
shot stare with which he regarded her and
the struggles he immediately began she saw
that he recognized her the fellow was not
crippled but cleverly bound and gagged
with bandages she suspected that roy had
corrupted a public servant
  roy opened the door the im patient
was placed tenderly upon a folding seat and
roy got in grinning at viola
  the prisoner attempted immediately to
thrust his head out of the open window
to howl at some one on the sidewalk but
roy easily held him in place until the cab
had sped around a comer then as though
realizing there was no hope of escape
cove settled back into his corner and de-
manded in the weird jargon of the trans-
planted cockney  whats yer gime hi
oo are yer wot the bladder o lard
anyow
   i want to know why you have been
breaking into our house viola told him
firmly she held up the copy of the cipher
and the notebook before his bulging eyes
unless you tell us all you know about the
treasure we shall turn you over to the au-
thorities and charge you with housebreaking
and assault
   yus missus yere at ome ere an i
am in a strynge land yer could land me
in the workus if yer was minded but ow
if i told yer wot would yer do wif me
then hi
   i should return you to the hospital of
course
   ow i never eard of the bloomin treas-
ure before declared cove sullenly
   you know you did
   i never
   youre lying
   ow old yer blasted row

argosy-allstory weekly
   here no more of that said roy sharp-
ly  viola he doesnt want to go back
to the hospital of course now old-timer
keep your own counsel and go to jail or tell
us what you know about this treasure and
go wherever you please speak up
   missus whined cove  i cant go
umpin me bluey abaht in this rig will
you an yer man hike out o this if i tells
yer will yer leave me to go in the cab
an not set the bobbies on ter me
  she nodded after exchanging a glance
with roy
  cove spoke eagerly his manner was as
convincing as the circumstantial nature of
his tale they did not wish to believe him
but all the same they did
   ive never read the note he began
 an weary the years i ben tryin it on
i was a lad just but great pals with dini-
vin  syd e says  ive found a great
treasure hid share an share alike is the
lay syd if youll help me when the time

to see if there was summat in it id missed
larst night i mide it
  the old fellow stopped sighed and gazed
fixedly at the brown leather volume
   aint there nothen in there abaht it
   no said viola  there is not if
there had been we would not have bothered
you roy let us get out and leave this
man
  there was something like nausea in the
tightened expression of violas pale lips
something like pain in her clear eyes and
so though there were questions that roy
wanted to ask he stopped the cab and
helped her out
viii
   take me home please viola said
slipping her hand under roys arm when
the cab had gone carrying away sydney
cove  and lets walk it isnt far and
i can think more clearly walking
  roy was uncomfortably conscious that
viola was troubled also that she did not
wish to confide in him
   shall i talk or no he inquired after
they had walked a block without speaking
   no you must think she answered
 i want to talk roy i-i am selfish i
wish we had never heard of the treasure i
hope we never find it i wish that old
pirate had it-all of it i know that i am
mean and wicked and selfish but i cant
help it
  roy caught his breath  but viola-
why
  she looked up at him with troubled eyes
   roy i cant stand disgrace but it
isnt all for myself truly that sydney
cove is bound to demand his share it will
leak out we cant keep it secret and it will
simply kill my mother
   but what cried roy  what dis-
grace
  viola bowed her head
   i hate to tell even vou she said  but
i will
  she began her explanation with a ques-
tion  roy doesnt  sydney cove  sound
familiar to you doesnt it suggest the
same awful thing to you that it does to
me
a fortune hunting fool

   why no i guess not
   well then she continued  think of
your san francisco history dont you re-
call the sydney cove in the days of the
vigilance committee
   yes he assented excitedly  a lot
of australian ruffians and bullies were they
not who robbed and murdered the citizens
until a few ofthem were killed and the rest
driven away
  viola nodded and went on explaining
   you see then this man is not of
course old enough to have been a member
of the original gang but he is probably the
son of one of them he must have been
given that name as a joke and is either too
ignorant or loo brazen to want to change it
   now this ruffian this descendant of ruf-
fians was in my grandfathers confidence
i know from what he has told me that this
much was true he knows my grandfathers
name de novanne he knows that our
home on the knoll was originally a tavern
my mother has been very careful to keep
that a secret too
   the evidence is very clear to me that
the treasure is the bloodstained spoils of the
sydney coves which they were unable to
take away when the vigilantes came down
on them what else could it be why
otherwise should my grandfather give part
of it to this rascally friend of his and
remembering this can my grandfathers
name be longer venerated can his mem-
ory be held sacred can my mother pride
herself now on her illustrious descent oh
it is terrible
   it cetainly looks bad said roy
 but-
   if you can suggest any good reason
why an honest man should make a confi-
dant of that horrible old cove i may begin
to hope she retorted quickly
  roy pondered a moment then spoke
brightly
   there is a reason i knew i had one
if i could only think of it why old cove
himself explained that he said your
grandfather called him in to spell-
   that is ridiculous
   how is it ridiculous
  viola held her chin very high and looked
at him from the corners of her eyes
   do you think it likely she returned
 that a man who could invent such an in-
genious cryptogram would require the as-
sistance of a sydney cove in writing it
down
   it isnt likely i admit that roy ar-
gued  but its possible he might be as
brilliant as anything and still a little hazy
on spelling lots of people are i am
besides look at the words i never heard
of most of them before i bet shakespeare
himself-
   violas response was a trifle tart
   the best way to dispose of this sense-
less argument and explain to you why my
grandfather was never suspected of any-
thing like this before is to tell you his
story you are a member of the family
now and should know it of course
   he was touring the world and happened
to be on his way here when the gold rush
started he stopped off here and let his
ship go on while he visited the gold dig-
gings then he met my grandmother the
senorita ynez the belle of her fathers
rancho near san jose they fell in love
they eloped they were married with the
dust cloud raised by her relatives horses
approaching like the wind
   just as the american alcalde and jus-
tice of the peace concluded the ceremony
the enraged relatives burst in upon them
led by a man who had once been my grand-
fathers friend and later his rival for the
hand of the fair ynez
   my grandfather drew a derringer and
wounded his rival he was prepared to
fight to the death but ynez shielded him
with her body and the bystanders inter-
ceded for the lovers her fathers angry
protests and exclamations made something
clear to my grandfather which he had not
understood before the familys objections
had all been due to the lies of the wretched
rival
   seeing that his own suit was hopeless
he had tried to discredit my grandfather
he had told don alfonso ynezs father
that my grandfather was an ignorant irish
sailor named donovan who had deserted
his ship in san francisco because he was
too lazy to work
   my grandfather was furious when this

argosy-allstory weekly
preposterous charge was made to him his
hot latin blood boiled if not restrained
he would have slain his rival with a bowie
knife the wounded man was allowed
however to creep away and hide until his
wounds might heal but cowardlike he fled
the country and was seen no more
   don alfonso was soon shown his error
my grandfathers polished manners and gal-
lantry alone proved him no common man
he told of the ancient glories of his name
de xovanne he described his ancestral es-
tates in the sunny midi mentioned his edu-
cation in paris and then when the old don
begged his pardon spurned such a belated
approval and announced that he was taking
his bride to france
   ynez her mother and the old don
wept entreated and implored him de
xovanne relented he gave up his honors
and estates abroad and settled here in cali-
fornia never to return
  roy murmured something appreciative
but avoided violas eye
   i dont blame her now he said to
himself  i can understand how she came
to write those letters now and the way
she deceived me its inherited and she
cant help it whenever a crisis comes up
the spirit of that old grandfather of hers
enters into possession of her mind and she
just tells a gorgeous lie i wish i knew
how to commune with the dear depart-
ed-theres a thing or two id like to ask
her ancestors rival
  he turned again to viola
   was your grandfathers command of
the english language as perfect as that of
his native tongue
   indeed it was my grandmother who
spoke english imperfectly told me that his
parisian accent was so slight that no stran-
ger ever took him for a frenchman he
did not like english though and never used
it in writing
   he wrote ordinary letters in french
my grandmother said even to her when he
was away for a day or two although she
could not read them and had to wait until
he came back and translated in making
notes for his own use he preferred sanskrit
or hebrew
   how interesting said roy  i would
like to see some of his manuscript if you
have any lying about at home
   we have none
   but his letters
   it was a custom of his to tear his letters
up as soon as he had translated them
   i see said roy
  he had got the information he wanted
and suddenly became very quiet and
thoughtful although viola did not want
to find the treasure he felt more desirous
of doing so than ever he saw that the
only real evidence of her grandfathers in-
nocence or his guilt was the treasure itself
though sydney coves lack of information
had been very disappointing he had given
roy the germ of an idea viola had helped
it grow roys success in finally capturing
cove had gone to his head he wanted to
get the treasure and read the cryptogram
for the sake of the financial gain to re-
trieve if possible violas family honor and
last and very far from least he wanted to
do it just to show that he could the
strange part of it was that suddenly the
thought came to him that he knew just how
to go about it
ix
  it was nearly noon when they got home
roy kept his thoughts to himself until after
luncheon
   viola he said when they had finished
wiping the dishes  you look tired dear i
would suggest that you take a nap i will
take the cryptogram up into the tower and
try a little greek or perhaps czech on it
i	have made up my mind that your fears
on the score of your grandfathers charac-
ter are groundless to prove that how-
ever i must read the riddle and find the
treasure
   i think i could have done it before
but i was not aware of the extent of your
ancestors erudition the language in which
a cipher is written is naturally of the great-
est importance in its translation i see now
that your grandfather knew one language
which i did not try out last night
   oh cried viola her face lighting up
at once with rekindled hope and pride
 oh roy-if you can prove my grand-
father innocent i shall love you
a fortune hunting fool

   very well roy told her rather calm-
ly considering the circumstances  ill go
up then good-by for an hour or two
   good-by dear she cried and as he
ascended she stood watching him her face
aglow with smiles as his shoulders disap-
peared through the trapdoor viola called
to him again
   roy what language is it that you didnt
use last night
  he couldnt have heard her for he sprang
suddenly into the tower and slammed the
door down without answering
  now viola possessed a certain trait often
observed in capable people and this trait
is difficult to classify for accordingly as it
controls or is controlled by the possessor
it may be either a weakness or a source of
strength without vanity or egotism she
instinctively assumed supervision of and re-
sponsibility for everything which occurred
or was done in her circle she had taken
her parents in charge before she was able
to talk and one of her principal reasons for
marrying roy was that she saw he needed
a manager add to this a usual amount of
feminine curiosity and you can understand
violas feelings on this occasion
  she climbed slowly to the second floor
frowning a little she hesitated a moment
at the door of her room and finally
very softly went to the cupola stairs and
started upward
  meanwhile roy was exercising powers of
analysis which he had not known that he
possessed
   if he thought  viola had seen fit to
tell me sooner that her grandfather was an
irish bartender i might have solved this
puzzle long ago
  he ran his fingers through his hair star-
ing hard at the cryptogram
  	irish dialect he muttered  spelled
phonetically without knowledge of the sense
of it all by an australian cockney and then
written down by an illiterate i must re-
verse the process and allowing for illiteracy
and cockneyisms convert this scrawl into
the spoken brogue hum-m-m
   he made several false starts but at last
with a flash of inspiration crossed out the
two fragments of names and the tally marks
following them
    ill bet he soliloquized that those are
the names of two of his customers and the
score of the drinks they owed him for he
probably wrote this note on the same page
innocent of the desire to puzzle any one
   now- won luck it hole mop in hi-
bernian-wan luke ut hole mop wan
luke ut hole mahp i suspect coves influ-
ence in that h wan luke ut ole mahp
hot dog one look at old map the old
 mop  was the old map all the time but
what is next
   ill shoe sow hell on say- lets try a
running jump at it wan luke ut ole mahp
ill shoe sow hell on say-one look at old
map will show sow hill on sea fair
enough im getting the swing of it now
he bent over the sheet muttering rapidly
and writing his translation as he went at
the ninth line he stuck and to help get
the sense of it he shut his eyes and chanted
aloud one look at old map will show
sow hill on sea one jab at muckstick at
point of arrow wool till were two fine-
aha will tell where to find
  he fell silent again and started to scrib-
ble but sprang to his feet as the trapdoor
flew open and viola confronted him
  she snatched the two slips of paper the
cryptogram and its translation
  ah she said with a little sigh when
she had had time to understand just what
they meant  so he was an irishman-
not a frenchman he could not even read
and write and-and he was a thief
   why no roy protested  i dont
think he was a thief at all look at the
last two lines of the cryptogram dont
they give you any hope
    but i cant read it
   well lets see-i think it should be
pronounced like this haythin relics-sell
till bamum
   heathen relics sell to bamum but
what has that to do with the treasure
   i think roy replied  that the
heathen relics are the treasure phineas t
bamum you must remember was a con-
temporary of your grandfather doubtless
these relics are objects suitable for bar-
nums famous museum i think that now
we can look for the treasure with our minds
at rest for heathen relics are scarcely the

argosy-allstory weekly
sort of booty hoarded by the sydney
coves
   that sounds reasonable viola agreed
 you have certainly relieved rtjy mind of
a great weight it is a blow of course to
learn that my grandfather was not a french
nobleman but on second thought i think
i am prouder of him than ever ordinary
noblemen are born that way and cant help
it he raised himself to the nobility and
fooled the world if i am to be the de-
scendant of a liar i am glad it is a first class
stupendous epic liar i hate a miserable
crawling half hearted person now tell fne
where the treasure is
   oh protested roy modestly  i
thought that you understood the crypto-
gram i was afraid you might think me
presumptuous if i tried to explain it
   h-m well we wont quarrel about
that i have read it and made my own
deductions you go on and tell me what
you think that  sort of clear my mind
and may possibly give me an idea
   its like this said roy  mr dono-
van advised his wife to look behind the old
map but she thought he said  old mop 
and was consequently thrown off the trail
then the cryptogram mentions the map as
the key to the hiding place  one look at
old map  and so on again  one jab of
muckstick -a shovel- at point of arrow
meaning i suppose an arrow drawn upon
the map find that map and youve got the
treasure
   yes said viola heatedly  find the
map this is the most maddening thing
ive ever heard of were no nearer success
than when we started if there ever was an
old map around here it has been lost years
and years ago oh i wish id never-
viola stopped short and calmed herself
 roy she said  just because you have
more brains than i you tease me into a
temper if you dont stop it ill never for-
give you
   my dear- roy began
  she jumped up and seized his hair with
both hands  tell me where that map is
she demanded
   i dont know he protested
  she released him reluctantly  but you
know something she declared
   i dont know where the map is he as-
sured her  but ill tell you where i think
it is your grandfather said  look behind
the old map for what i think it was
for the notebook which contained the note
explaining the map you remember syd-
ney cove was peeling the wall paper off
with his knife before i-
  but viola was already kneeling on the
floor looking at the hole in the wall
   its there its there she cried
lend me your knife hurry up my
goodness grandfather never disturbed the
book i guess after he hid it here and died
thinking the note was still in it then
nobody knows how long after they papered
this room and finding the old map appar-
ently stuck on the wall simply covered it
up oh give me that knife
  it was stained with paste and tom but
not difficult to read for it was a crude and
simple chart drawn to a large scale with
heavy lines in the upper right hand cor-
ner was a cross marked on its arms with
the points of the compass in the center of
the design was a circle outlined with short
radial pen strokes so that it looked like a
moldy biscuit a heavy wavy line like an
angleworm crawled diagonally across the
paper passing near the biscuit accompanied
on the side farther from the fuzzy circle
by parallel hair lines a conventionalized
arrow transfixed the angleworm and rested
its point against the biscuit the latter
was labeled  sow hell and among the
hairs appeared the word  say
   this knoll is sow hill viola explained
 my grandfather used to keep pigs the
map is very old and as it shows when it
was drawn the knoll was at the edge of the
beach the tidal flats have been filled in
long ago and covered with buildings the
arrow touches the hill on the north side
doesnt it
   yes but look at this thing like a lad-
der drawn in pencil and here he has
written  tint stip we are to dig under the
stairway up the knoll at the tenth step from
the bottom
x
  passers-by in their street that afternoon
observed the activities of roy and viola
a fortune hunting fool

with indifference or with kindly tolerance
for their feverish industry but with little
interest almost any amount of excavation
in a front yard passes unnoticed in san
francisco for it is as much of a patriotic
duty there to raise a flaunting garden and
astonish tourists as it is for a native to
wear short pants and yodel at intervals in
switzerland front yards in that city are
usually of the upright variety anyhow so
if the hole is too deep for a flower bed you
naturally suppose the fellow is digging a
garage
  viola crouched upon the eleventh step
watching eagerly and giving advice roy
collarless coatless hatless toiled stubbornly
with a shovel down through a thin layer
of soil he dug then with increasing difficulty
through a hard packed layer of oyster shells
perhaps a foot of these and then with a
shout he uncovered the end of a plank
  an indecorous dance by viola mighty
deeds with the shovel he had revealed the
upper portion of a door and its frame set
into the slope like the entrance to a tunnel
  out with the lower nine steps twenty
minutes more hard labor a slight delay
to pry off the staple of a rusty padlock
then they dragged the door open
  the sunlight did not enter more than a
foot showing a bit of rough gray wall a
strip of sandy floor and nothing else black
darkness faced them
  roy struck a match impatiently and
cuddling the flame in his cupped hands
went slowly in viola clutched his elbow
and followed ten steps twenty steps
   some tunnel viola
  then viola started and turned back
  there was a confused movement behind
her at the mouth of the tunnel the harsh
grating of the rusty door hinges was fol-
lowed by a crash as the light of day was
completely shut out roy swept his arm
around violas shoulders as she screamed
they blinked at the incandescent disk of a
flash lamp
  a harsh familiar voice warned  turn
yer back me lad an ist yer hands
   sydney cove viola whispered
   how do you get like that demanded
roy hardily  open that door clear
out
    st yer ooks
  the command this time was peremptory
and savage
  viola turned to roy anxiously he did
not look like the man she had married now
his brows were knotted his head and
hands were thrust fonvard his shoulders
slouched loosely the line of his bowed
back was as tense as that of a crouching
cat she found herself unable to utter the
command that had been ready on her lips
roy sprang at the light
  for a second it was blotted out then
it flew upward in an eccentric orbit and
whirled down to the floor now its reduced
beam pointing away from viola displayed a
thicket of moving legs and feet feet and
legs that whirled lightly strained heavily
and slowly stamped hard
  the tunnel boomed and seemed to rock
with a tumult of shouts with blows with
grunts and hard drawn breaths
  viola cowered against the wall her knees
pressed together her elbows tight to her
shaking sides her hands unconsciously
clasped across her mouth
  sometimes she saw hands or faces or
trodden bodies down upon the floor once
she saw roys face dreadfully distorted as
he fell or was flung down but while the
sobs tore her throat in sympathy and her
muscles strained with his he fought up
again yet it was not more than a minute
or two until crouching on the ground her
knees having failed her her face hidden in
her hands she heard her own gasping
breath suddenly loud in silence she
sprang up startled and in the light of the
recovered flash lamp she saw roys face
again
  he was bruised and battered his shirt
was tom from his shoulders a dark trickle
barred his upper lip from nostril to mouth
his thin bare chest rose and fell jerkily
pumping hissing breaths between his bared
teeth but his eyes still shone fiercely and
the straining muscles knotted and quivered
on his lean arms and neck
  two men were holding him in the
fainter edge of the nimbus surrounding her
husbands countenance she could see their
dark rough hands clasping his wrists and
the coarse sleeves of their coats just a

suggestion she caught of swarthy or tanned
faces the burly silhouette of the man who
directed the light was unmistakable it
was sydney cove and if other means of
identification had been lacking his croaking
voice was raised again
   gblimey yeve ad yer needins now
i ope another start like that ere an ill
do yer in i will i carnt be avin me
tripes trompled at my age es a tarrier
mates old to im
  he turned slowly and swept viola with
light
   ah yeou he said petulantly  more
trouble no a bit yeve been
   you nasty old thing  rejoined viola
with returning spirit  go away
   not likely back up lets see wot
we ave ere
   you shant come in
  cove merely grunted at this and ad-
vanced upon her with one hand out-
stretched she recoiled with a swift shud-
der and step by step retreated before him
  it was not far she had to go she had
been standing practically at the end of the
tunnel on the threshold of a small room hol-
lowed from the hill it was no more than
six feet high by ten square as viola
brought up against the rear wall and stood
pressed against it coves searchlight swept
the rough gray sides and ceiling swiftly
  bare it was and save for the minute
and intricate tracery of silvered lines on
every side where generations of snails had
left their spoor it might have been newly
dug a cellar waiting to be stored
  there was a disappointed mutter from
coves companions and even he whispered a
surprised oath but he had regained his
self-possession immediately
   old ard he cried  watch yer man
i knows wots wot dont i
  with occasional quick flirts of the light
to assure himself that viola held her place
he went peering and prying around the
walls to and fro with the light upon the
ceiling to and fro across the floor four
pairs of eyes watched his progress with
equal intensity
  at last he stopped and stood still in the
middle of the floor staring down the bright
cone of light including his feet in its base
and rising to meet his lowered hand suck-
ing a sharp breath he dropped to his knees
he supported his weight with his hands
and stooped his face within an inch of the
ground he puffed gruntingly blowing
little clouds of dust
   mates he called  see wots ere will
yer
  dragging their prisoner they scuffled to
him even viola stepped a pace forward
and bent to look carved rudely in the
earth floor but unmistakable now that the
dust no longer filled its slight hollow they
saw an arrow its point at the foot of the
rear wall
   ere said cove drawing his knife and
playing the light along the blade  see it
young fightin cock no tricks mind yer
loose im mates yeve work to do
  so it was that roy and viola saw the end
of their treasure hunt standing side by side
as prisoners a candle stuck hastily in a
shovel scar on the wall gave the only light
while cove with roys own shovel and the
other pair with knives attacked the wall
  long long it seemed they stood and
watched the growing heap of rubbish and
listened to the thud and rasp of the shovel
to the heavy breathing of the workers
  at first every other moment brought an
exclamation from one of them as they held
up small objects for inspection in the candle
light but after a time silence fell upon
them and at last they began to grumble
then at a word from one of his helpers
cove cursed and struck him
  the grumblers knife flashed up wicked-
ly but the other caught his arm and while
they struggled cove darted forward and
struck the weapon from the fellows hand
then as roy crouched seeing his chance to
spring as viola flung her weight upon his
arm to stop him came faintly from the
outer air the inflected whistle of a bosuns
pipe it sounded three times and cove and
his companions answered it instantly
  before roy and viola realized what was
happening the trio had fled down the tun-
nel shot one by one through the bright
rectangle of the suddenly opened door and
slammed it shut behind them
  roy snatched a shovel and sprang after
them the door held against his first thrust
a fortune hunting fool

he hurled himself upon it headlong with
a crash the hinge bolts tore from the rotted
door post and roy staggered out into the
sunlight
  in the street a black touring car with
side curtains in place was gaining speed in
low gear cove clinging to a door ran
frantically and scrambled in with a roar
and a slide the machine took a corner and
headed for the water front
  a policeman on the other side of the
street seemed to be the cause of their sudden
departure he had halted his leisurely
stroll and now shouted an inquiry as to
the reason for the commotion
  roy wiped the blood from his face with
his sleeveless biceps glanced quizzically at
viola who stood pale and still frightened
in the mouth of the tunnel and replied gay-
ly  oh nothing much officer just a little
fun between friends
  the patrolman drew down a long upper
lip twinkled a blue eye and strolled on
   but roy youd better tell him said
viola as he came to her  they might come
back
   no
   why not
   because there is no treasure here to
steal and now they know it come ill
show you
  back in the underground room again roy
held the candle above a heap of rubbish
some shards of coarse pottery were there
some arrow heads of black obsidian a stone
mace with a crumbling wooden handle at-
tached by a thong
   the  heathen relics this is what your
grandfather found barnum might have
made a good thing out of them-we cant
xi
  viola watched roy as he gathered up
the scattered planks and replaced the steps
she thought him strangely silent oddly
grim
   figured out how those relics got there
he asked her suddenly
   why-why no
   shell mound he told her  theres
another one bigger than this on the oak-
land side of the bav more than that may-
be i dont know indians made em dug
clams and oysters out of the beach you
see and ate em on shore the whole tribe
ate all their meals at the same place every
day let shells lie where they fell a messy
outfit three or four hundred years and
they had a mound like this one careless
beggars with their tools and weapons i
guess anyhow the mounds are loaded with
em no money in the stuff ever try sell-
ing this property
   it cant be sold she told him mourn-
fully  the location would make it valu-
able if it were not for the prohibitive cost
of leveling this knoll that would be neces-
sary before building anything worth while
the house of course is worthless from a
buyers point of view
   thats what i thought
  setting his lips in a thin line he spiked
the last step down savagely he picked up
his coat and his tools and motioned toward
the house
    lets go in
  viola was frankly exhausted with excite-
ment and lack of sleep she went to bed
immediately roy still taciturn and unlike
himself disdained to follow suit she left
him still in his ragged shirt smoking a hor-
rid pipe and staring dreamily through a
window out at the bay
  he called her for supper but she refused
to get up at ten oclock that night though
she awoke again to hear him marching like
a sentry in the big room downstairs
  it worried her and after a bit she came
down to him through a blue haze of tobacco
smoke and tried to express some of her
contrition for leading him on to such a bit-
ter disappointment
  he stopped her brusquely with his palm
across her lips
   huh i wouldnt have missed it for a
million bucks he declared
  he stepped away from her his eyes shin-
ing a grin on his lips
   im a fighter dyou know that i
didnt until i got into this maybe i never
would have but for you and that sydney
cove i love that old crook like a brother 
he stepped forward suddenly with his
left foot shot out a straight stabbing left

argosy-allstory weekly
 fist and ducking made the air sing with
 a right hook to the jaw of an imaginary
 opponent
     viola he cried gloating  didnt you
  see me knock that big guy flat kid i
  surely smacked that boy they got me
  down but they couldnt keep me there i
  got a punch girl i pack a wallop
    viola stared at him dazed he slapped
 her shoulder exuberantly with a hearty
 force that staggered her beaming at her
 with vulgar delight
     go on to bed kid he ordered  dont
  stand there you bother me ive got to
  think
    viola went silently to the staircase start-
  ing to ascend she looked back at him he
  was pacing up and down the room with long
  forceful graceless strides one hand was
   thrust into his trouser pocket with the
  other he was deliberately standing his hair
  on end pulling it over his eyes his gaze
  was fixed upon the floor his cheeks were
  flushed already he seemed to have forgot-
  ten her
    slowly viola mounted the stairs and en-
 tered her room slowly she sank upon the
 bed and buried her face in the pillow
    what have i done oh what have i
 done she murmured
    roy did not sleep at all that night ap-
  parently yet he was not haggard she
  thought the next morning looking at him
  cautiously over her breakfast orange his
  bruises had turned a shade or two darker on
  his cheekbones and there was a lump on
  his left jaw but he bore them without
  self-consciousness or regret his conversa-
  tion when he finally roused from his ab-
  straction was even more remarkable than
  his actions
     how long will it take your parents to
 get here he began
     about three weeks i think perhaps a
 little less i suppose they have my letters
 now
   roy nodded
     call it two weeks we can be settled
 by then if we dont waste time
     settled viola ventured
     we cant stay here he argued  no
 place for you to entertain no conveni-
 ences bum neighborhood we can afford
 a decent house not too large out at in-
 gleside say-something like that we may
 move down the peninsula afterward but for
 the present while this treasure hunt is oc-
 cupying my time we had better stay near-
 by
   treasure hunt
   perhaps it would be more correct to
call it a gathering or harvest of treasure
of course the hunting is over now we
simply haul it away and sell it
  viola pushed away her plate her lips
quivered yet she heroically restrained her
emotion so as not to excite him  its all
my fault she said to herself  before i
married him he was kind gentle sympa-
thetic and sane now look at him ill be
good to him and maybe hell recover but
ill never feel the same about living with
him again
  she tried to meet his eyes but could not
 whats the trouble arent you hun-
gry he asked
   yes yes
   then why dont you eat
   i-i-i will ha ha of course
   i dont mean to criticize said roy
after a short pause  but your manner
seems odd this morning dont you feel
well is there anything troubling you
perhaps you think i dont know how to
handle the treasure as well as you do
   oh no no i mean yes indeed viola
answered  you know what is best isnt
it nice its so simple you just haul it
away and-and sell it
   yep imagine your family living all
this time right on top of a gold mine a
regular hill of treasure
   of course the excavating will inter-
fere with this house in a day or two so we
must find a new home perhaps youd
rather rent than buy though
   i-i think so just at present
   well then you go house hunting after
breakfast i shall be busy seeing the truck-
ing companies and arranging with the au-
thorities for men to do the digging
   what
   you dont think im going to dig and
haul away this whole knoll myself in two
weeks do you
a fortune hunting fool

   no no i didnt mean that but
mightnt it be more fun to sell the treasure
by the-well-by the piece
  roy laughed long and heartily
   it would take centuries
  viola considered this a moment she
must be cautious he talked connectedly
enough but there was the treasure what
treasure and buying a new house
   i dont feel like house hunting to-day
she said finally  i can do it to-morrow
-if you havent changed your mind
   very well roy agreed  now do you
wish to sell me this property or trade it to
me for a good house or do you wish to re-
tain control yourself if the latter i must
ask you for a salary to be taken from the
profits i would not ask it but i have no
income at present so if you do not pay me
i must go to work at something else in
that case you would have to dispose of the
treasure yourself
   i dont want to pay you roy said
viola plaintively  it sounds too business-
like id much rather trade for a nice house
then you can work with the treasure as
much as you like
  to herself she added  it may bring him
to reason he hasnt got a nice house nor
any kind of a house the poor thing is so
set on this treasure business that ill have
to humor him and let him come to his senses
by himself if i were to pay him a salary
he might moon around here for years think-
ing he was earning it and getting crazier
every day
   i think that is wisest roy agreed he
got up kissed her and said  im going
now may not be home until late this after-
noon good-by
   good-by said viola
xii
  it was a trying day first of all a gang
of men arrived in a motor truck they
tore down a portion of the fence laid boards
across the curb and sidewalk and drove
in onto the flat beside the base of the knoll
  viola went down to inquire and was in-
formed that her husband had ordered the
work she retired to the house and watched
them
  they built a stout scaffolding and plat-
form some eight feet high set up a gas en-
gine and other machinery upon it and then
departed
  when she was sure that they had gone
viola went down to the foot of the knoll
and investigated she mounted to the plat-
form by means of a long wooden ramp and
poked about trying to fathom the purpose
of the thing there was a machine with
a hopper like a giant coffee mill which was
driven by the gas engine this much she
learned at the cost of a hand embroidered
house dress ruined with black grease and
she went back into her room again even
less comfortable in her mind than before
  an hour or two later as she sat on one
of the window seats trying to think she
saw a small cheap automobile stop in front
of the house
  a slender little man slightly stooped
neatly and quietly dressed got out of the
machine he hurried eagerly through the
gate to the newly replaced steps here he
sank to his hands and knees peering at the
debris left by roys excavation he arose
after a moment and forgetting to dust off
his trousers rubbed his hands together
smiling happily he walked all around the
mound stopping occasionally to kick at the
grass with his heel his expression becoming
momentarily more benign at last he
climbed slowly up to the house
  he bent his gray head courteously when
viola opened the door and mentioned his
name which viola did not catch asking her
to inform her husband that the excavation
would start at nine oclock next morning
   i did not think i should start until the
next day he said further  but your hus-
bands samples interested me so much that
i came to see for myself i have now re-
solved to begin work at once you have a
great treasure here madam and your gen-
erosity in giving it away as you are doing
is as great as it is unusual
  viola thought after he had gone that he
must have thought her rather difficult she
had been unable to wring a single word of
commonplace speech from the turmoil of
her thoughts treasure he had said
  roy was sane or else had found a fellow
lunatic that seemed the likelier explana-

argosy-allstory weekly
tion this fellow was simply a craftier
type he had an automobile while roy
possessed nothing but the clothes he stood
in as usual she reflected the crafty one
had persuaded the simple one to give up the
mythical treasure but why and whence
the machinery
  she got roys supper and with a most
exemplary patience kept it warm for him
until he came trudging home at eight
oclock he was tired worn and the re-
silience and febrile excitement that had
buoyed him up so long was lacking strong
as her curiosity was her compassion was
mightier she did not question him and
with hardly a word to her he went to bed
and fell asleep
  she slept little herself fearing he might
be ill rousing frequently to look at him
  consequently when she awoke the next
day it was late in the morning roy was
up before her and there was a dreadful
chaotic noise outside
  by leaning from her window she could
see around an angle of the house a swarm
of men digging on the side of the knoll a
boy stood on the platform beside the mys-
terious machinery which roared and rat-
tled and backfired a big motor dump
cart stood beneath the platform roy pipe
in mouth hands in pockets stood halfway
down the knoll watching with irritating
complacency the busy scene before him
  it was too much viola stopped only
long enough to tuck her hair under a cap
before going to the window nearest her
husband and screaming his name until he
heard her and came in
   roy she pleaded  please what does
this mean why-why are you doing this
how are we to pay the hire of all those
men
  roy grinned cheerfully and picking her
up settled himself on a chair where their
view of the work might be undisturbed
   kid he said  look me over im a
fortune hunting fool the treasure of m
de novanne is the thing that saves us after
all i happened to recall that a party of
professors from the state university once
obtained permission to dig in the shell
mound over on the oakland side of the bay
and would have demolished it if the owners
hadnt stopped them that mound is valu-
able for it is one of the attractions in an
amusement park
   i took some arrow heads and things to
the university yesterday and offered to let
them dig if they would haul away the
debris they keep the indian stuff of
course
   they jumped at the chance so we are
now getting the ground cleared for nothing
and when it is once graded down to the
street level we will have an extremely valu-
able lot there will be no difficulty about
borrowing enough on it to erect some flat
houses which will insure us a moderate in-
come for the rest of our lives
   viola burst into tears
   oh she moaned clinging to him  i
thought you were a helpless dreamer just
because you let me lead you into failure and
disappointment then while i slept and
pitied myself you walked the floor all night
and by sheer determination and brains
thought out this wonderful scheme to save
us
  hush said roy sternly thats
what husbands are for
  the terrific noise of the machinery on the
platform had stopped when the loaded truck
drove away and had been silent while they
were speaking but now a second truck had
backed into place beneath it and the up-
roar began again
   now cried viola  what is that thing
for
  roy chuckled  that is the best part of
it all that machine makes it possible for
us to lay up a few nickels against a rainy
day to buy us a decent home and to keep
us clothed and fed until we can begin to
collect our rents that is a shell crusher
my dear he said
   go on man explain viola urged
   you see i had to make everything
count and it occurred to me that the shell
of which this great mound is entirely com-
posed ought to be worth something it is
not good enough to sell to a button factory
it would be too long and troublesome a
process to burn it for lime with a small
profit
   at last i remembered that such shell
broken up is used for chicken feed and
a fortune hunting fool

that on account of the thousands of chicken
ranches in this state there must be an un-
limited market for shell which can be got
as cheaply as i can furnish it i went to
several wholesale dealers with samples and
although there are thousands of tons of it
in this knoll i have made contracts for the
whole thing at fifty cents the hundred
pounds this gives them a big profit for
the shell sells for a dollar a hundredweight
retail
   the university men agreed to haul it
away so i let them take it to the warehouses
for me thus saving the cost of transporta-
tion true i am renting the crushing ma-
chinery and hiring that boy who runs it
but as each truckload is worth several dol-
lars to me i can afford that
   the only difficulty is that due to their
care in sifting out the curios the students
who are doing the work do not dig fast
enough to get rid of the mound in the two
weeks which is the time i am allowing i
decided this morning to get around that by
the
 inducing a spirit of rivalry in them to-
 morrow a force of men from stanford will be
 added to those now on the job and they will
 be augmented with husky gangs from the
 universities of oregon and washington and
 possibly nevada before the week is out
    im going to write to my parents
 again said viola  i dont think i put it
 strong enough before
    lets have breakfast he suggested
 after a moment  we can look at houses
 to-day and by day after to-morrow we will
 have saved enough to buy one
   no great lapse of time is required for the
 reconciliation of indulgent parents to even
 the greatest escapades of a daughter like
 viola mr and mrs ephraim stiggs now
 that a month or two have passed are upon
 the most cordial terms with mr and mrs
 roy jones there is but one difficulty to
 be met in their intercourse roy and viola
 must take pains to conceal the fact that
 mrs stiggss maiden name was really
 donovan

what has occurred in part i
 to the hall of svend the bloody a norse jar or noble a galley from gaul brings edvard son
 of haakon svends gentle brother who wooed a maid of the southland and died there his
 coming is not relished by svend who has had control of his brothers lands but svend fears
 the wrath of olaf trygvesson the king too much to do him open harm edvard seeming small
 and dark to the huge norsemen is called li the black jarl but he speedily proves his skill and
 courage in an encounter with magnus svends right hand man edvard incurs the enmity of
 magnus because brynhild a shield maiden magnus loves prefers edvard the black jarl himself
 enrages brynhild because he does not love her
      svend leads his followers to a fair at trondhjem by command of king olaf who hopes to
 bring about peace between svend and other followers of the old gods and the christian jarls

the black jarl

got through the guard and his blade de-
scended but not the edge of it the flat
struck a terrific blow against a winged
helmet and the man went down
   and now edvard cried
  eric the dumb released his man and
with a loud bellow of rage the warrior
sprang forward now he in turn learned
something of fencing back edvard pressed
him tiring him playing with him and in
time the fiat of his blade struck again the
second man lay stretched
  for a moment the son of haakon the
lover stood panting and then he turned
to the thrall
  you did well eric he said get
some others and fetch thongs bind these
men well and carry them into the tent of
magnus 
  he returned his blade to its scabbard
and leaned against a tree to watch eric
called to the other thralls and they brought
thongs
   bind them hand and foot edvard
commanded  now carry them to the tent
no man of you is to release them even
if they demand it do you understand
they are to remain so until svend returns
it will be death for the man who dis-
obeys
  he turned and beckoned to eric
  your back to me he ordered i
cannot ride or walk to the fair on my hon-
ored word-but nothing was said about me
being carried 
  and then the black jarl sprang up and
caught the giant thrall about the neck and
wrapped his legs around the mans middle
and so carrying edvard haakonsson pick-
aback eric the dumb stood and waited
  the son of haakon the lover pointed
down the dusty road
   to the fair he ordered
chapter v
the little maid
along the dust-deep highway eric the
dumb trotted slowly kicking up
great clouds of dust behind him
making nothing of the burden upon his
back edvard haakonsson laughed aloud
they passed none save here and there
some thrall sleeping at the edge of the
woods
    on good steed the black jarl cried
 remember that you are carrying me and
i	am not riding
  his words were those of merriment but
his thoughts were not he sensed a mystery
that was fraught with peril for himself
there were some things that cried aloud for
an explanation
  around a bend in the road trotted eric
the dumb with his unusual burden now
they could see the buildings of trondhjem
in the distance and the gay booths on the
level space where the fair was being held
people seethed back and forth common
folk straining their eyes to catch sight of
famous jarls and jarls and their men fight-
ing to win through the press and reach the
king
  now edvard haakonsson passed count-
less persons who looked at him in surprise
they knew him for a jarl and so restrained
their laughter he waved grandly at some
of them laughed and pretended to be
spurring eric on
  they were not more than two hundred
yards from the edge of the fair now ed-
vard could see the long lane with pavilions
on either side shield maidens and ladies
of jarls households were in the midst of
the throng men-at-arms scowled at one
another or greeted one another warmly
according to their creeds
   behind the booths edvard command-
ed and the thrall turned to one side on
he trotted but now the perspiration was
streaming from him and his breath was com-
ing quicker edvard haakonsson for the
moment was quiet and his merriment had
fallen from him he knew that he must
face svend and he preferred to do it before
the king
   and then a burst of gay laughter reached
his ears and he turned his head quickly
to one side of the road there was a small
company consisting of half a dozen men-at-
arms some thralls a few shield maidens
but it was none of these who had laughed
though all but the thralls were smiling
  edvard haakonsson looked again and
saw a maid he pressed his arms about

argosy-allstory weekly
erics throat and eric stopped thankfully
edvards teeth flashed in a smile
  the maid stood before the others she
wore a flowing gown caught with a girdle
about her waist her hair fell in a golden
shower down her back bound with bands of
metal her bare arms bore a weight of rich
ornaments never in his life before had
edvard haakonsson seen a maid like this
  the others held back but she took a
step forward and he knew by their man-
ner that she was a jarls daughter a
shield maiden whispered to her but she
waved the shield maiden aside and took
another step toward him and laughed
again
   you like my horse he asked
   he is a well trained steed to walk
on his hind legs she replied and her voice
was like the trickling of water over cool
rocks
  edvard haakonsson dismounted for
which act eric the dumb gave him thanks
again half a dozen steps forward he took
nor noted the black looks that the men-
at-arms gave him the maiden looked as
though she might retreat yet she held her
ground
   i am new come to this land edvard
said  yet it is now in my mind that i was
a fool not to come before
   and how is this
  	for had i come before perchance i
would have seen you sooner he said  i
have lived in a land where there are beau-
tiful women yet they seem old and ugly
when i look at you
  her face flushed with pleasure the men
she knew did not speak so rough norse
they were who knew not fine speech men
of war and work who did not consider it
necessary to speak soft to a woman
   you come from another land she
asked
   but four sleeps ago i landed
   yet you are a jarl
   it is my station he replied  i am
my fathers son
   and your father-
   haakon the lover
  her face turned pale swiftly and she
caught her breath
   you-you are the son of haakon the
 lover she asked  you are the nephew
 of svend the bloody
  i am his nephew edvard replied
  but a man cannot pick his uncles
  you are to live with him
  our interests are related
 oh she cried and it was in my
 mind to like you
  and can you not he begged  but
 you have not told me your name is it as
 sweet as you
  i am called thyra
  it is a sweet name
  but perhaps that of my father will not
 sound so sweet to your ears she said
  he is called harald the just 
  harald the proud to have such a
 daughter
 do you not understand between
harald the just and svend the bloody
there always has been war your people
and my people cannot be friends we are
christians
  cannot a christian be a friend
  but those who worship odin and thor
 will not she said  and what a shame
 it is-at times
 edvard stepped closer to her
  though our houses fight need we
 he asked  can we not be friends never
 before have i seen a maid like you if i
 wished one to sit at my right hand-
  there are maidens in your uncles
 house
  but not for me-now  he said
  and in the other houses where odin is
 a god
  i do not speak of gods lady he said
  i do not speak of houses and clans i
 speak only of you-and of me can we not
 be friends
  are you mocking me she asked
  can i trust one who is not a christian
  i have not said that i am not a chris-
 tian
  you need not-you a jarl of the house
 of svend the bloody how could you be
 in a house where treachery is bred
  but i have not been in that house
 long he protested  if you are a chris-
 tian you have charity you have faith
 you also should have love am i mock-
 ing you can you trust me
                         	a
the black jarl

  she raised her head and looked at him
bravely and his eyes did not falter
   i seem to read that you are an honor-
able man she said in a breath
   then we may be friends
   if you wish it
   friendship is but the basis often for
stronger ties he said
  her face flamed again
   it were well for you if you kept our
friendship a secret she said  if svend
the bloody hears of it he will break it fast
enough
   svend the bloody is my uncle but i
am a jarl in my own right and my father
before me edvard haakonsson declared
 i make what friendships please me and
break them only when i will i hope soon
to greet your father and to see you again
soon thyra
  he bowed before her lifted her hand
and pressed it against his lips she thrilled
   it is a quaint custom she confessed
 but it is a pleasant one
   now i must get me to the fair and see
the king he said  i must swear my al-
legiance
   but why do you ride on the back of
a thrall is svend the bloody so poor that
he cannot furnish a horse for his kinsman
she asked
   i have sworn not to ride or walk to
the fair he answered laughing  so i
am being carried ill explain it better
when again we meet until then
  he sprang upon the back of eric again
turned to wave at her and was gone thyra
of the house of harald stood silently looking
after him for so long that the men and
shield maidens behind her wondered wheth-
er they had been forgotten but presently
she turned and beckoned them and led
them on toward the fair
chapter vi
before the king
grim and austere svend the bloody
led his men through the throngs at
the fair magnus riding at his left
hand the company was an imposing one
as svend had intended it to be behind
   	a
the mounted men-at-arms came the foot-
men the archers and spearmen then the
mounted maidens of whom svend had
taken half a score along and then the
thralls each in a fresh white kirtle bearing
svends presents to the king
  the common folk surged back from be-
neath the hoofs of the horses and gazed in
awe at svends magnificence yet many
looked at his stern and inscrutable counte-
nance too and wondered what thoughts
were in being behind that mask of flesh
the common folk knew of the clash of re-
ligions and played a part in it
  svend the bloody was known as one of
the richest jarls in olafs kingdom though
not many knew that his jarldom belonged
in half to his brothers son magnus riding
at svends side curled his lips in scorn at
the common folk and now and then shout-
ed rough orders to the men behind him
merely as a show of authority at which
some men glared and others smiled there
were plenty of other lieutenants of other
jarls who hated magnus
  and so svend the bloody and his train
came before king olaf where he sat in his
big chair on a raised platform at one end of
an open space the booths and pavilions of
the fair and the mass of people forming a
background
  svend dismounted and the others with
him the thralls hurried forward some to
hold the horses and others to spread svends
presents before the king olaf trygvesson
waved a hand to show that he was grateful
and the kings own men carried the presents
away
  then svend approached the king he
strode like the jarl that he was pride in
his bearing his head held high his shoul-
ders braced magnus stalked behind him
while the others held back
  svend the bloody knew well that he was
making an impression in that moment he
was showing his wealth and power and
king olaf was a shrewd man svend
bowed before olaf and stood back but
as he glanced aside he saw something that
angered him
  another jarl was approaching from the
opposite side he too sent forward thralls
with rich presents he too had dignity in

argosy-allstory weekly
his bearing and behind him came men-at-
arms richly weaponed and glorious maid-
ens svend the bloody was facing his an-
cient enemy harald the just
  for an instant svends face was not a
mask but the hatred that flamed in it
was extinguished almost instantly then
he turned and looked at the king
   i make you welcome jarls olaf said
  thus he greeted them both at once nor
showed his preference he looked from the
one to the other and when he spoke again
it was to both
   there is too much dissension in the
land olaf said  it is our wish that our
people live in peace some of us there are
who follow the cross and the teachings of
the christ yet there are others who cling
to the old gods if a man is sincere i have
respect for him regardless of what faith he
professes
  svend the bloody opened his eyes wide
at that he had expected an attempt at
conversion he had anticipated an argu-
ment for which he was prepared and
wherein he would stand by odin and thor
and hurl his defiance but olaf he saw
now was too wise to risk splitting his king-
dom so olaf trygvesson knew that civil
war would follow an attempt to cram chris-
tianity down the throats of those who fol-
lowed the gods of their fathers later he
was to christianize his country with the ax
but the time was not yet at hand
  svend merely bowed without speaking
and harald the just did likewise and so
the two jarls faced each other before their
king their faces reflecting none of their
thoughts while their retainers waited be-
hind them motionless but ready for instant
combat
   svend the bloody you are a great
man king olaf said after a time  you
often have proved your loyalty that you
have courage and dignity and wealth goes
without being said and you harald also
are a great man and svends neighbor
word has been carried to me that your
households are not at peace
   that word did not come from me
svend said quickly  i do not allow my
men to carry tales i fight my own battles
never have i asked help of the king
   nor did it come from me harald said
firmly  i too can fight my own bat-
tles
   yet i have the word olaf told them
with something of sternness in his man-
ner  a man of my own reported on the
situation it is my wish that this strife
cease we gain nothing by fighting among
ourselves it is my prayer that this land
be a christian land but i know the thing
cannot be done in a moment a man has
the right to his individual belief however
there is no need of this continual strife
  the king ceased speaking and the jarls
waited for his further words knowing that
he had some and finally olaf looked down
at them again and his voice was more gen-
tle when he spoke
    it is our wish that you seal a pact of
friendship here and now he said  svend
the bloody and you harald the just clasp
hands before me differences in religion
you may have but let us have no other
differences your thralls must not fight
your men-at-arms must not attack one an-
other
  svend drew back a pace and a look of
astonishment came into his face magnus
drew in his breath with a sharp hiss har-
ald stood waiting proudly willing to do as
the king commanded but not wishing to be
the first to make the advance
  the mind of svend the bloody worked
like lightning then he might smite hands
with harald but there would be no mean-
ing to it he could repudiate this friend-
ship when it so pleased him and in the
meantime olaf and harald would be lulled
to a sense of peace and security
    harald olaf called
    i am agreed harald the just said
   svend
  it was a critical moment harald had
agreed and for svend to spurn the offer of
friendship now would mean an instant bat-
tle royal for even in the presence of the
king and the kings guardsmen harald
could not overlook such an affront to his
pride
   behind svend his men reached for their
swords and magnus glanced quickly
around and prepared to shout his com-
mands but svend had been thinking to
the black jarl

some purpose and already he had a plan
and so he took one quick step forward and
looked up at olaf
   i am agreed he said
  there were cheers from those near the
king but magnus and svends men gasped
their astonishment however it was not
for them to question their jarls sagacity
undoubtedly svend the bloody knew to
what purpose he was working
  the jarls approached each other before
the king there was a moment of silence
as their hands met and touched lightly
and then they stepped apart again
  but there was a tension in the air the
friendship scarcely had been cemented
there seemed to be something lacking and
harald the just supplied it
   svend great jarl this is the thing for
which i long have waited harald said
 the new religion of the cross teaches that
neighbors should dwell in love and respect
and friendship let us have it so
   let it be so svend ageed
   my house is open to you harald
said  do you journey to it as soon as
this fair is at an end with your men-at-
arms and your women and thralls the
gates will be standing wide it will be my
pride and pleasure to feast you and yours
to cement this bargain that we have made
 the invitation is a fair one and as
such cannot be refused svend replied  i
will do myself the honor of accepting your
hospitality as soon as may be and in turn
will offer mine
   well spoken king olaf cried  let
us then have peace let your men-at-arms
and thralls mingle without passing hot
words and black looks that they themselves
may form friendships after the pattern of
their masters
  svend and harald bowed before him and
each stepped back once more their fol-
lowers scarce could believe their ears yet
they knew that they had heard aright
magnus was scowling searching in his mind
for the truth of the matter for he knew
svend well and realized that this was not
the end
  and suddenly those in the great throng
at the side of the open space began ribald
laughter hounds scurried to cover and
snapped and barked children screeched
their merriment the king looked across
the clearing and harald and svend turned
to look also svend turned black with rage
  the reason for the sudden merriment was
easy to find into the clearing before the
king came a giant thrall perspiration
streaming from his face and carried pick-
aback was a man of black hair and dark
skin who wore the ornaments of a jarl
  edvard haakonsson had come before his
king
chapter vii
the ax thrower
waves of loud laughter rolled back
from the throngs men-at-arms
joined in save those who followed
svend the bloody for these latter recog-
nized the black jarl and wondered how their
master would take this affair
  svend seemed on the verge of choking
yet he stood straight and proud his eyes
flashed and the anger clouds gathered on
his brow edvard haakonsson urged eric
onward straight toward the king laughing
back at those who laughed at him waving
his hand to the maidens pretending now
and then to prod his unusual steed on
he came until eric was a few paces before
svend and then edvard stopped him and
stood to the ground and bowed before his
kinsman
  svends eyes blazed into those of his
brothers son he felt that his dignity was
outraged and he remembered his wish
that edvard remain at the camp his fear
that he would become a friend of olaf
   how is this svend cried
  but olaf stopped him with a gesture
 who is this man who wears the ornaments
of one of my jarls the king demanded
  svend was compelled to turn and face his
ruler once he bowed low yet when he
spoke there was anger in his voice
   great olaf this man is edvard the son
of haakon the lover and my nephew
svend said  he is but new come from
the lands to the south where his father
long resided and where this jarl was born
and bred

argosy-allstory weekly
   son of haakon the lover then is he
welcome according to his just rank but
why does he come before us riding the
back of a thrall is it a new method of
approaching a throne
  though the kings voice was firm his eyes
were twinkling
   those are questions for which i await
the answers also svend said  i thought
it better that my nephew remain in com-
mand of my camp word of honor he gave
me to do so unless two trusted men of
rank were there to take his place yet he
is here
   can a jarl forget word of honor olaf
demanded his brow suddenly black
   great olaf word of honor has been
kept edvard replied  i did give it not to
ride or walk to the fair yet i am here
but i call upon all of you to witness that
i did not ride or walk-i was carried
olaf laughed at that and his favorites
with him but svend did not the bloody
one stepped forward again and his voice
rang with venom when he spoke
   but how about the remainder of your
oath he cried  you have left my camp
and you promised there to remain unless
two men of rank were there in your stead
 and so they are edvard answered
for a moment his eyes met those of mag-
nus and the lieutenant betrayed his ner-
vousness
   two of your company dropped out of
the march and returned to the camp my
kinsman edvard continued  they
thought it best to pick a quarrel with me
for some unknown reason two giants they
were too but they remain at the camp
 dead magnus cried before svend
could speak  you have slain them-
you
   i had no wish to rob my kinsman of
two noble warriors the black jarl replied
 so i merely stunned them and had them
bound wth thongs and placed in a tent
perchance if they see fit to attack me again
they will bring a larger company
  once more olaf roared his laughter
svend turned purple and the face of mag-
nus was white magnus knew well that
the black jarl understood yet had not be-
trayed him and he promised himself re-
venge on the two warriors who had failed
in their undertaking
   this small black jarl pleases me much 
olaf cried  edvard son of haakon the
lover i must have speech with you before
the end of the fair you have come from
lands i visited when i was young there
the religion of the cross is strong and i
would speak with you later concerning its
developments
  that which svend the bloody had feared
was coming to pass edvard was making
a friend of the king svends rage was with-
held in a measure yet it was almost con-
suming him he felt compelled to expend
it and he did not dare expend it upon
edvard haakonsson after what the king
had said
  his eyes turned to eric the dumb the
thrall was but a thrall and upon him svend
could work his will slowly the bloody one
drew a dagger from his belt
   accursed thrall  he cried  you have
done this thing would you make a mock
of me before great olaf by turning your-
self into a horse your blood shall pay
he raised the dagger to strike but ed-
vard haakonsson sprang before the thrall
and held up a hand in warning
   if there be blame it is mine kinsman
he said  i commanded the thrall to do
as he did
  one side jarl i punish my slaves
when i please
  but it is not just edvard cried
 the thrall did only as i ordered can
he be blamed i appeal to the king
olafs brow darkened he had no wish
to affront svend now after the new pact
of friendship and there were laws re-
garding a thralls relations to his master
   it is svends right to punish the man
if he so wills the king said  i can
only hope that he will be merciful but
if he thinks it better not to be i can
do nothing to stay his hand a jarl may
discipline his slaves
  svend took another step forward gloat-
ing and once more the black jarl raised
his hand
   then let me be champion for this
thrall since the fault is mine he said
 it will furnish sport for the throng
the black jarl

   champion for a thrall svend gasped
 you have men of skill among your fol-
lowers kinsman put one forth against me
let us throw the javelin or the ax if i
win the thrall is mine to do with as i
please if i do not win you compel him to
punishment
   you would throw ax or javelin svend
gasped
   against any of your men
  magnus surged forward and touched
svend on the shoulder he thought that
he saw his chance to humble edvard
haakonsson before the king and when he
speke svend had the same opinion olaf
loved rough sports and he did not love
losers
   what would you svend asked  the
king has not given the order for the sports
to begin
   i have no hand in this olaf said
edvard bowed before him again  then
we will throw the ax he said  let my
kinsman choose his man
   you would pit yourself against magnus
for instance svend asked
   even against magnus
   he throws the best ax in my jarldom
   but never has he met me edvard said
   so be it
  the throng surged backward again eager
for the test here was sport they loved
far in front of the royal pavilion there
was a huge tree with a blazed space upon
its trunk
li there is the target olaf said
  now there was a clear space between the
kings seat and the tree on either side
pressed forward the throng noble men and
women in the front rows howling dogs
were kicked backward out of the way
magnus stood forth a smile upon his beard-
ed face and took up his ax
  he turned and looked once at edvard
gloating in his manner but the black jarl
showed no sign of nervousness he stood
to one side his hands resting lightly against
his hips his body bent forward
   it scarcely will be a test jarl magnus
said  your pet thrall soon will know the
taste of svends steel
   you have not yet thrown nor have i
edvard replied
  the brow of magnus grew dark again
one step forward he took he balanced the
ax and his great arm drew back the
crowd suddenly was still
  an instant of silence and then the flash-
ing ax whizzed through the air there was
a thud as it struck and quivered its blade
had bitten deeply into the bole of the tree
and less than the width of a hand below
the blazed space
  shouts came from the men at arms and
the common folk
   it is a good throw edvard admitted
 many men could not beat it if i do
not twill be no reflection on my skill
   then you think that you will not
magnus sneered
   in a moment we shall see said the
black jarl
  he sprang forward and toed the mark
and took up his ax eric the dumb
crouched behind him his lips moving none
knew to what god he prayed yet all knew
that he was praying none knew better
than eric the dumb what depended upon
the black jarls throw and it is not surpris-
ing if he had small faith in the outcome
for magnus was known the breadth of the
land as an ax thrower
  the son of haakon the lover flashed
a smile at those on either side of him and
then set his face grimly a moment he
stood poised then his blade flashed
through the air
  again there came a thud then a cry of
surprise and wonder the ax he had hurled
was buried to the hilt in the trunk of the
tree it quivered in the center of the blazed
space above that of magnus
  edvard haakonsson stepped backward
and bowed to the king a chorus of cheers
assailed his ears but magnus strode for-
ward his face black with wrath
  accidents happen he cried can
the black jarl throw so well again
   i have won have i not edvard de-
manded
   you have won olaf decided  the
thralls life is spared and he belongs to
you but i would like to see yet another
throw if you are willing
   i am willing edvard replied
  magnus snarled and stepped to the line

argosy-allstory weekly
again a thrall came running with the axes
magnus took his and balanced it for
a moment he hesitated and then he threw
a cheer answered his effort
  it was a better throw than the other for
the ax cut the edge of the blazed space yet
it was not so good as the first throw edvard
had made
  let us see you equal that magnus
said
  the black jarl laughed and once more
stepped up to the line he waited a mo-
ment for there was a commotion in the
throng two hounds were fighting and
men and women and children were pushing
back out of the way while thralls ran for-
ward to separate the big dogs
  their fangs flashed their howls rent the
air other dogs fought to get in the battle
the crowd surged backward
  and then a gasp of horror came from the
throng one of the great dogs had broken
away foaming at the mouth his eyes
blazing he was darting across the clearing
women and children ran from his path
warriors could not get through the press
to use their weapons
  and in the path of the crazed hound
stood a maiden dressed in flowing robes
her costume denoting her the daughter of a
jarl
  a bedlam of shrieks and cries frightened
the hound more the maiden turned to
flee but tripped and fell the great dog
sprang at her
  then it was that edvard haakonsson
gave a cry and hurled his ax quickly
through the air over and over it turned
yet it struck true the sickening thud came
when the hound was but a spring from his
prey the great dog paused in his leap
and dropped gasping out his life
  a moment of horrified silence and then a
shout from those who were the first to real-
ize what had happened half a dozen aided
the maiden to her feet a score rushed to-
ward where edvard haakonsson was stand-
ing
  but he thrust them aside and ran across
the clearing he fought his way through
thralls and warriors and men and women
he reached the side of the maiden who
was standing wilcf-eyed and panting and
she whirled toward him and clung to his
arm for support
   you are not injured he asked
  she fought to regain her composure for
she had remembered that she was the daugh-
ter of a jarl and then
   not injured thanks to you edvard
haakonsson said thyra daughter of
harald the just
  the crowd fell back and a big jarl thrust
his way forward his face was stern yet
a suspicion of tears glistened in his eyes
his hand fell upon edvards shoulder
  i thank you jarl he said our
daughter is precious to us
  and then another chorus of cries rent the
air
   hail edvard haakonsson hail ed-
vard the ax thrower 
  the black jarl had won a name
chapter viii
the day-and the night
there comes to many men a flood of
good fortune events tumbling one
upon the heels of the other and each
adding to a mans position and fame and so
it happened now to the black jarl
  the excitement of the moment died down
and thyra went with her maidens to a pa-
vilion her father had erected for after
all though the daughter of a jarl she was
but a woman and her danger of a moment
not enough to stop the fair
  king olaf gave the signal for the sports
to begin and edvard haakonsson avoiding
his uncle and magnus and many of the
others walked about the grounds peering
into booths and pavilions and enjoying the
sights eric the dumb always at his heels
  then there came a moment when edvard
turned and regarded eric gravely
   it is in my mind that you are of good
blood edvard said  i can tell it in your
manner and bearing tragedy has touched
your life mayhap but it is not necessary
that it endure forever it is necessary that
we have thralls yet would i rather have
a man cling to me and serve me through
love what will be your actions if i set
you free
the black jarl

  erics dull face lighted and he struggled
to speak the words came slowly but
finally they came
   still would i serve you master he
said to be free and yet to serve
you-that is enough i do not wish to re-
turn to my own country-too many years
have passed
   then shall you be free and serve me as
a free man
   and ever will i stand at your back
master to guard you against foes for
there be foes in this land who strike a man
in the back
  edvards face darkened  did you have
more wit i should take it that there is a
double meaning to your words he said
follow
  they went back to where the sports were
being held and men acclaimed the ax
thrower and urged him to show more of
his skill and so edvard haakonsson wish-
ing merely to enter into the spirit of the
games and seek his own diversion so man-
aged it that he made more enemies and
many in the following of his kinsman
  he wrestled and he won and it was no-
ticed that the big magnus took no part in
the wrestling he threw the javelin and
here he won easily for it was a weapon
with which he was familiar nor could the
swimmers defeat him which was looked
upon as a strange thing since norsemen are
clever in the water
  sport after sport he attempted and al-
most all he won now the throng of com-
mon folk acclaimed him and some of the
noble born yet there were men at arms who
thought that he attained altogether too
many honors
  the sports came to an end and edvard
the ax thrower was acclaimed the victor
and then he sat at the left hand of olaf
for a space and talked of lands far away
while svend the bloody watched from a dis-
tance his face a thunder cloud
  there was feasting in the open space as
the night approached but when it was
ended the jarls went back to their own
camps with their followings edvard
haakonsson was given a horse and rode in
style with eric the dumb trotting beside
his mount
  when the camp was reached magnus
hurried to his tent where he found his two
men bound he released them and what
words he said are not known but they
burned and afterward magnus went to
svends pavilion and held secret conversa-
tion there telling him what had happened
   this black jarl has belittled me mag-
nus said  nothing but combat and blood
can satisfy me now
  but svend held up a warning hand  he
must not be touched he said  he is
the favorite of olaf after this one day his
sudden death at this time would mean
trouble for us
   has the day come then when my jarl
fears the christian king magnus asked
boldly and hotly  are you not almost as
great as olaf did you lead the men of
thor you might yet be king in olafs
stead
  svend looked at him searchingly  per-
haps i am growing cunning magnus he
replied  there was a time when boldness
and strength always won but the day has
arrived when a man must possess cunning
also
   but i do not understand magnus said
 you bend before olaf you strike hands
in friendship with harald the just
   but with a reservation of mind svend
said smiling a bit
   how is this
   i have a plan svend said  we will
make this visit of friendship to haralds
jarldom we shall take a goodly company
and men at arms shall follow and hide
themselves in the forest
   you intend- magnus did not dare
voice his thought
   think you that my friendship for
harald could be real svend asked  the
fool grows soft look you how there were
tears in his eyes to-day when he feared
for his daughter he will welcome us with
open arms and suspect nothing it will be
the time to strike
   the laws of hospitality- magnus
began
   laws have been broken before magnus
it is our great chance i shall pretend an
illness and refuse to take salt with him
i can be busy speaking and forget to eat

argosy-allstory weekly
meat and when they feel secure when
his gates and doors are open-
  the men come in from the woods
magnus completed
   but this thing must not be spoken of
now svend warned  i do not trust this
kinsman of mine too much and he must
never know and there is another reason
for keeping him unknowing
    i wait to hear it jarl
   were this edvard to be slain now the
king would suspect us and we want his
trust for our plans we go to haralds
and before we leave we slay his men and
women and thralls and lay waste his es-
tate we can tell a tale afterward of thralls
starting the fighting of warriors joining in
twill not be too strong a tale hence it will
be believed harald the greatest of the
christian jarls will be gone and his men
with him even if the king suspect then
he will dare not strike for his forces will
be weakened and if he does strike then
we of odin and thor finish him
  and you will be king magnus sup-
plied in a whisper  none has a better
claim the sons of earl haakon have not
a better right
   haakon must i always hear that
cursed name svend cried
   and the black jarl-
   must be kept in ignorance as to our
purpose svend said  and what more
natural than that in the heat of battle
he falls
  magnus smiled evilly  i shall see to it
that he falls he said
   twill be a fair day when he does he
has made a fool of you he has become the
favorite of olaf in a single day he has
the heart of a woman he fights for a
thrall and now makes a free man of him
he saves a maid from a dog and that
maid the daughter of harald the just far
better would he have served our plans to
have held his hand and let the crazed
hound da its work it would not have
grieved me to see sorrow eating at haralds
heart
  svend walked to the door of the pavilion
and looked out over his camp thralls were
stretched around the great fires guards
had been placed warriors laughed and
jested and shouted the clear voices of
shield maidens came from tents in the dis-
tance and the bright moonlight bathed
it all
  svend turned back into the tent  pass
the word magnus that the black jarl is
not to be harmed he commanded  i
want no man to pick a quarrel with him
if we accomplish what we wish it must be
when we raid the jarldom of harald the
just
  magnus saluted and left to go to his own
tent and svend the bloody sought his
couch there to stretch himself and think
more on his plans in his own tent mag-
nus stalked back and forth his mind filled
with brynhild he would have to explain
to her why edvard haakonsson returned
from the fair alive
  edvard had departed from his own tent
as soon as the camp had quieted down
guards saluted as he passed nor looked
where he went he walked along the edge
of the highway and presently plunged into
the brush when he was at some distance
from the camp he turned into the road
again and strode forward yet ready to dart
out of sight if he met men
  he had ascertained where the camp of
harald was located and now he made his
way rapidly toward it in time he was
standing in a clump of trees and watching
the tents there was a great fire in har-
alds clearing too and his men were making
merry
  edvard the ax thrower circled the camp
halfway and then crept closer he made
out the womens quarters gusts of laugh-
ter came to his ears silvery laughter that
he thrilled to hear
  for a space he watched and waited and
after a time the flap of one of the tents
was lifted and a maiden stepped out into
the moonlight it was thyra
  one of the guards whirled quickly to-
ward her recognized her and turned away
again to watch the men around the fire
thyra stood for a moment looking up at
the moon then moved slowly toward the
edge of the woods
  nearer she came until edvard could see
her features beautiful features they were
and now thoughtful ones she stopped al-
the black jarl

most at the edge of the brush and turned
to glance back toward the tents her hands
clasped at her breast
 thyra he called the name softly
 like a caress  thyra he repeated
 she turned swiftly at the sound of his
 voice and sudden alarm was in her face
 and manner
  who calls she asked in a low tone
  him they call the ax thrower
 he heard the little gasp of surprise she
 gave for a moment she stood still look-
 ing toward the edge of the woods and
 then she moved nearer
  edvard son of haakon the lover she
 questioned
  it is i
 now he stepped out where she could rec-
 ognize him then went back a pace so that
 the guards would not see she followed
 swiftly
  what do you here at my fathers
 camp she questioned  if you are
 found-
  i do not come in anger he said
  then- she seemed to question why
 he should come at all
  is it strange that i should wish to
 look upon your fair face again he asked
  you might see me to-morrow at the
 fair
  and waste the long night
  but you are in danger she said
 there is not much trust between your
 house and mine
  then you did not wish me to come
 he asked
  i have not said that
  did you not hope that i would did
 you not know that i would
  how should i know
  did not your heart tell you so he
 asked  and why are you walking alone
 in the moonlight instead of listening to the
 shield maidens gossip
  perhaps i grow tired of their gossip
 if you do not wish to see me i can
 go away again
 she hesitated a moment  since you
 are here it were unmannerly to rush you
 away she replied
 edvard haakonsson stepped closer to her
 looked down at her
   never before have i seen a maiden so
fair he said  i give thanks that my ax
went true to-day
   and i give thanks to you because it
did
   our houses have plighted their friend-
ship this day and it is a good omen
   but there is not much trust she said
 edvard haakonsson you must beware
do not stroll about my fathers camp at
night there may come a thrust in the
dark she shuddered as she spoke
   yet must i see you
   in secret only ior the present per-
haps when days and days have passed and
svend the bloody has shown himself sin-
cere-
   but i cannot wait for days and days
thyra i-i want you for my wife
   you she gasped
   my heart already is filled with love of
you can there be no hope
  this was a wooing of the sort she never
had known before it were more the norse
custom for a man to want a maid and make
a bargain with her father she had ex-
pected that one day she would be betrothed
to a jarl or noble warrior yet this man-
ner of wooing pleased her best
   there-there may be hope she whis-
pered
   thyra 
   but how can it be think you that
my father would give me to you think
you that svend the bloody would have you
mate with one of the house of harald
   i am my own man  edvard said  i
am a jarl even as svend is a jarl in a
matter like this i seek none but my own
counsel thyra
   then must you win my father over
she said
   and i do not have you to win
   you already have won jarl
  he took the last pace toward her and
clasped her in his arms and then his lips
met hers a moment he held her so then
she stepped back again
   i cannot understand how this thing has
come she said  and i have the feeling
that there is danger to follow-for you
edvard you must beware if anything
were to happen to you now i should die

argosy-allstory weekly
   well will i guard myself he said
 when there is such a reason for it
   svend the bloody is to make us a visit
and you will come with him
   you may depend upon that in my
eagerness to see you i shall ride in the
van
   but my father must be won slowly if
we are to win his consent at all she told
him  you must teach him to trust you
as you have taught me perhaps when
you come for the visit-
   then we may be able to tell him
   perhaps she repeated  but we must
keep it secret now it has all come so
swiftly and we cannot blame my father if
he is slow to believe that svend and those
of his house have really changed
   then it must be secret edvard
haakonsson agreed  but let us hasten the
day
   and now you must go edvard my ax
thrower there is peril for you in the
woods i will return to the tent and there
pray for your safety and if you can
edvard let your heart turn from odin and
thor and toward the cross
  he would have replied but one of the
guards turned and walked toward them
and so he clasped her quickly in his arms
again and once more he kissed her and
then he stepped back into the darkness of
the dense woods and was gone
  thyra her heart singing turned toward
the approaching guard acknowledged his
salutation and hurried toward her tent
chapter ix
saved from sacrifice
svend the bloody and his company re-
mained two days longer at the fair
during which time edvard the ax
thrower saw thyra several times but not
once did he get the opportunity to speak
to her alone
  then there came a bright morning when
the jarls took their leave of king olaf and
edvard among them tents were furled
and the gallant companies left the town
of trondhjem and started back to their
jarldoms
  his heart and mind filled with love ed-
vard haakonsson did not notice that the
men at arms treated him in a peculiar man-
ner they gave him respect and the at-
tentions due his station but none of them
warmed toward him and each was par-
ticular to do or say nothing that might
form the basis for a quarrel for magnus
had passed the warning and had promised
heavy punishment at svends hands if the
order was disobeyed
  no sooner had he reached the jarldom
than svend the bloody commenced prepara-
tions for the visit to harald not all of
them however being made public he se-
lected presents and made up a roster of his
company choosing the more prominent no-
bles and men of good blood as though wish-
ing to do honor to harald but for a pur-
pose entirely different
   we must take some of the maidens with
us he told magnus  harald the just is
no fool if we seek to enter his house with
only warriors and thralls and no women
it may put him on guard
  and so it was decided that brynhild and
some of the shield maidens should go along
it being planned for magnus to whisper the
truth to brynhild at the proper moment
so the maidens could be rushed to some
place of safety
  and now svend the bloody took thought
on the enterprise he had planned and con-
sulted with magnus frequently his re-
ligious fanaticism burned brightly for this
was to be a battle for odin and thor a
service to the gods
   we go not half hearted into this thing
magnus svend said  we need strength-
ening for our sword arms
   there is one way to strengthen them
 i already have thought of it-sacri-
fice svend replied olaf trygvesson
has forbidden it but we do not take
orders from the king here we serve our
gods and let olaf serve his and see which
is the stronger
   you will make it a big sacrifice
   the greatest svend replied
  magnuss eyes opened wide  you-
mean-a human he gasped
   even so 
   and the black jarl-
the black jarl

   shall not know of it svend declared
 did he know of the sacrifice he would
wish to know the reason for it a human
being is not sacrificed these days merely to
ask good fortune on a journey and it is
my wish that edvard haakonsson have no
inkling of our real purpose
   then- magnus questioned
   we must hold the ceremony when he is
not near none but the trusted men at
arms will be admitted
   that is well magnus replied
   some thrall-any thrall-will serve our
purpose
  an evil glint came into the eyes of mag-
nus as he bent nearer the jarl  does not
our purpose demand the best he asked
quietly  shall we be backward when we
ask good fortune of odin and thor
   how mean you svend asked
   what is a common thrall to the gods
a little better than sheep or swine and not
half so much as an ox magnus said  can
we not do better than that in asking the
blessings of the gods on our enterprise
   speak
   a free man magnus suggested
  a free man are you out of your
wits how could such a thing be ar-
ranged
 eric the dumb is a free man-now
magnus whispered  how i detest the
creature he follows at the black jarl s
heels like a cur struts among his betters-
 it is an idea  svend admitted
   we can take him at night and bear him
to the sacrificial chamber after his blood
has bathed the sticks his body can be
thrown over a cliff and none will know
save trusted men would not that be
honoring the gods and flinging defiance at
olaf
  the eyes of svend the bloody glistened
 it would be a noble sacrifice he said
   a free man for the gods does every
jarl offer such a sacrifice as that
   you can arrange it
   i can magnus promised
   so be it then to-morrow night be-
fore the moon shines 
  during the day following svend and
magnus whispered to the men they had
chosen edvard haakonsson dreaming of
seeing thyra again noticed nothing wrong
the great house was a scene of confusion
because of the preparations for the visit
it had been planned to start soon after
dawn hence edvard the ax thrower sought
his couch early wrapped himself in his
furs and dreamed
  outside the door eric the dumb
stretched his great body on guard he too
was dreaming of his new position in the
world of men two thoughts were para-
mount in his slow working mind one was
that when the proper time came svend the
bloody should be made to pay for murder-
ing the thrall the day the ship had come
and the other that eric the dumb should
serve the ax thrower with his life and
guard him from harm
  finally the great hall was still the
thralls had finished their work and were
sleeping and all but a few of the warriors
had prepared for the journey of the com-
ing day one by one the great torches
burned out until finally only two remained
to cast fitful streaks of light across the big
room
  from one of the rooms slipped three men
they wore armor but their faces were cov-
ered from shadow to shadow they darted
until they came close to where eric the
dumb was stretched then one of them
uncovered his face and walked forward
boldly attracting the attention of eric
  eric looked closely at him but saw noth-
ing more than a warrior pacing back and
forth for a time before he sought his couch
and as he watched the other two sprang
upon him from behind smothering his head
in furs
  eric fought but only with half a heart
the years of thralldom had taught him
submission and the habit was not easily
broken still he fought but they bore
him down and stunned him and so carried
him away
  swiftly across the great hall they took
him and to the door of the sacrificial cham-
ber they carried him inside where svend
and magnus were waiting
  work swiftly magnus ordered
 bind him well and stuff his mouth with
fur
  again eric fought for his moment of

argosy-allstory weekly
semiconsciousness had passed but again
they bore him down and worked their will
thongs lashed his ankles and legs and fas-
tened his arms at his sides his mouth
was stuffed with a piece of fur which was
bound there so that he could do no more
than groan and then he was picked up
again and carried
  it was dark in the -sacrificial chamber
save for the light from a single torch at
one end of the room stood the altar and
upon it the bowl filled with twigs into
which the blood of the sacrifice was to be
poured human blood it would be this time
with which the warriors would sprinkle
themselves and svend himself would act
as priest since there was none other handy
priests of odin were scarce since king olaf
had forbidden sacrifices
  it is time svend said summon
the men but let them come quietly
  magnus and the three who had made
eric captive went to do his bidding the
chosen ones were waiting for the signal
one by one they slipped across the great
hall and through the door of the sacrificial
chamber slowly they gathered while
svend the bloody stood back against a wall
his arms folded across his chest a sharp
knife in his belt
  behind the altar was a stone table and
upon this eric was stretched and lashed
and the kirtle was cut from his left breast
eric knew what it meant for he had been
in the chamber before he tugged at his
bonds and found that they would not give
they were proof even against his great
strength he tugged while the perspiration
stood out upon his brow while his breath
came in painful little gasps and after a
time he groaned and ceased his struggling
he knew that it would avail him nothing
he could only wait for the end
  edvard haakonsson had heard the slight
noise at the door of his chamber when
eric had been taken for a moment he did
not get from his couch only remained there
listening but presently he got up and
walked across to the door and opened it
  he was suqrised to find that eric was
not stretched before the door as he was
usually and as he watched he saw men
slipping furtively across the great hall and
disappearing into another chamber and
knew them for warriors
  here was a thing that needed investiga-
tion edvard thought he knew that the
room into which they had slipped was the
sacrificial chamber and he knew that it
had a small rear door through which in
days gone by the priests had entered
  he did not even put on his mail or hel-
met he had no weapon save the knife at
his belt but he was not thinking of com-
bat across the great hall he slipped opened
one of the huge doors and went outside
  it was black night which suited him
he slipped around the corner of the great
house past the sleeping thralls about the
dying fire so he reached the rear and
fumbled in the darkness until he found the
little door
  cautiously he opened it and slipped
within he found himself far behind the
altar in front of which a torch was burning
he saw the sacrificial table-and the body
of a man stretched upon it
  then he realized the horror though he
wondered why his kinsman had not invited
him to witness the ceremony toward the
altar he went like a shadow stopping now
and then to listen he could hear the
voices of svend and magnus some distance
from that terrible slab of stone on which a
human being lay helpless
   there are four more to come svend
said  when they are in bar the door 
  edvard haakonsson almost stretched
upon the floor crept closer to the stone
table he reached it and raised himself
slowly and carefully his hands went up
and felt of the mans bonds his head
came up and his eyes looked into the wide
staring eyes of eric the dumb
  again he listened and heard another man
enter the chamber the time was scant he
knew his dagger came out and he slashed
at the things at the same time warning
eric by a pressure of his other hand to
keep quiet
  again he slashed eric started to rise
but edvard thrust him back but finally
the thongs were cut and he pulled the man
off the stone table and toward him eric
tugged at the gag but edvard haakonsson
motioned him to silence and led the way to
the black jarl

the little door they slipped through it
and into the night
   go into the woods  edvard command-
ed  let no man see you but when we
go to the house of harald the just do you
follow us through the forest keeping out
of sight you can find me at haralds
  eric had torn the gag away now he
knelt quickly and pressed his lips to ed-
vards sandal
   master-master he breathed
   go edvard said
  eric the dumb fled into the darkness a
band of sheep had settled for the night at
the rear of the great house and edvard
seized a lamb once more he crept through
the little door all the men had entered
now he guessed svend the bloody was
commencing the ritual in a short time he
would be at the altar
  with the thongs which had bound eric
the dumb edvard lashed the lamb to the
stone table once more like a shadow he
crept back to the little door he passed
through it and closed it softly behind him
  the words of svend the bloody rang
through the sacrificial chamber as he ad-
vanced toward the altar the others close be-
hind him
  mighty odin grant us victory he
mouthed  great thor give us the added
strength of thy hammer to thee we make
the sacrifice of sacrifices 
   the sacrifice of sacrifices the others
chanted
   aid us mighty odin against those who
would be thy foes give us the victory
complete send us back again to our
homes else take us to thy bosom and grant
us the glories of valhalla with this blood
of a living thing-
  he stopped he gasped a smothered
curse left his lips he had reached the
stone table and his knife was poised to
strike but no human sacrifice was there-
only a lamb
   a trick- magnus began
   can a man change to a lamb svend
demanded
  but how could he escape are the
gods frowning upon us
   fool  svend cried  dare you let
such words leave your tongue human or
lamb yet must we have our sacrifice stand
back
  he continued the ritual and men sprin-
kled the blood over their heads and then
svend furious threw open the door of the
chamber and stalked into the great hall
followed by the others straight to the
door of edvards chamber he went and
hurled it open
  a single torch was burning within it
showed edvard haakonsson as he raised his
head sleepily and then struggled out of the
furs pretending to reach for his weapons
   what is this he cried
   it is nothing kinsman svend the
bloody replied  we were crossing the
hall and thought we heard you cry out
 perhaps said the ax thrower  i
was dreaming of battle yet why should i
dream of battle when to-morrow we start
on a mission of peace
to be concluded next week

the caged and watchful look in
wootens eyes was evidently there
to stay for no mere passing mood
or temporary diffidence could possibly have
implanted it so deeply his eyes were blue
and mild and singularly agreeable they
matched the gentle structure of his short
straight nose and harmonized with the
clement curvature of his slender lips cer-
tainly wooten was not a man to start an
argument or indulge in verbal backfire pie
had come honestly enough by his caged
and watchful look the one was the prod-
uct of eight years of solitary confinement
in a receiving tellers pen and the other
came from being continuously on the look-
out for counterfeit bills and spurious sig-
natures prolonged contact with the ready
money of local depositors had ingrained
in him an air of politeness that nothing had
ever been known to ruffle
  if wooten ever played soldier during his
boyhood there was nothing about his pres-
ent appearance to denote that he had ever
led the juvenile onslaught upon glistening
fortresses of snow the cosmic ladle had
obviously left the ingredients of gusto and
generalship out of his meek personality
but there was a note of unquestionable
resolution in his compact small chin and
a gleam of fidelity in his watchful eyes that
bore witness that he had the loyalty to
follow if not the genius to lead
  he was not at all the romantic figure
that maisie had dreamed of marrying but
in due course she began to see him through
a borrowed nimbus of glamour that dated
back to a visit to new york during which
she had gone on a sightseeing trip to wall
street the tense energetic and myste-
rious atmosphere of banking and finance
had laid commanding hold of her and from
that day on the courteous little bank clerk
at home had grown more and more inter-
esting to her he impressed her as a re-
mote but definite part of the enchanting
world of which wall street was the center
and so she set her cap for him and finally
became his wife
  so faithfully had wooten served his
capital and surplus

eight years time in the receiving tellers
cage that soon after his marriage he was
released for good behavior and transferred
to the bond department where he was per-
mitted to sit at a desk instead of being com-
pelled to stand behind a counter it
seemed to maisie that this carried him
a step nearer to the inscrutable drama and
unfathomable power of wall street
  maisies discovery of the extent to which
wooten was wrapped up in his job did not
disturb her ambitious young soul it au-
gured well for his future and convinced
her that he was headed straight for the
presidency of the institution the earnest-
ness with which he labored and the austere
singleness of purpose with which the little
man slaved for his employers gave her the
comfortable feeling that he would never
come home to her with the dreary look on
his face of one who has been discharged
and must set out in search of new employ-
ment
  while she was moved to be sure by oc-
casional twitches of regret that he cared
but little for dancing or gadding and while
she began to realize by degrees that they
would doubtless both have reached an el-
derly period of life before he attained the
dignity and emoluments of an executive po-
sition she took refuge in the thought that
her husband would never be out of a job
and that surely even though slowly his
status and salary would be advanced
  maisie guarded wootens punctuality
like a watchdog and invariably had his
breakfast on the table promptly at seven
thirty each morning he never reached
his desk later than nine oclock and was
usually the last to leave at night for
several years he had now been performing
his duties in the bond department and he
had never made a mistake in figuring the
yield of a bond issue so closely had he
applied himself to his work that he was
hardly aware that maisie had changed
  her mercurial enthusiasm had diminished
and she was no longer deceived by her
early hopes that wooten was headed for
the top she noticed that other men at
the bank were moving up but that wooten
was standing still she would watch him
with a pitying look as he meekly mowed
the lawn on saturday afternoons and would
reflect that no one by the name of wooten
could possibly cut much figure in the ener-
getic world of finance she recognized that
he was hopelessly negative and acquiescent
she felt panic-stricken and frustrated
  one bright october morning wooten fin-
ished shaving and dressing according to his
unfailing schedule and descended to the
minute dining room of their small suburban
home but for once he detected no smell
of frying eggs or bacon or scrapple in the
air
   you eat your grapefruit a while said
maisie as she appeared for a moment in
the kitchen doorway the  a while 
harked back to her pennsylvania dutch
grandmother
  wooten consumed his grapefruit divid-
ing his attention skillfully between it and
the morning papers report of yesterdays
tendencies on the new york stock ex-
change each morning he consulted the
financial page with scrupulous care cher-
ishing the secret fancy that some day new
york might hear of his faithful services and
insist that he pull up stakes and accept
a position with one of the big wall street
financial institutions
  lost in his dreams he was unaware that
for some reason his breakfast was being
unduly delayed and only when maisie
brought in the rest of his meal did it dawn
upon him that he was twenty minutes be-
hind his habitual schedule when he con-
sulted his watch a look of pained resent-
ment flitted to his face and he began bolting
his food
   whats the matter inquired maisie
watching him with a look of cool amuse-
ment
   ill be late to work he said critically
   well what of it
  wooten gave her a look of grieved sur-
prise
   ive never been late to work before in
my life he answered pointedly
   what did it get you demanded mai-
sie testily
   what did it get me repeated wooten
in a kind of blank amazement  what did
it get me thats a funny question for you
to ask

argosy-allstory weekly
   that isnt any answer said maisie
with a shrug
  there was something cool unprecedent-
ed and deliberate about her manner-some-
thing portentous and disturbing it created
an atmospheric pressure that had hitherto
been foreign to the house of wooten and
its meek little master was quite at a loss as
to how to cope with the situation
   thats no answer at all continued
maisie with an air of gentle belligerence
 id like to know why we should always
have to jump through hoops at this hour
of the day i take notice that were not
getting anywhere in particular its just
the same old thing over and over again
day in day out year after year and what
are we getting out of it
   what do you want me to do-lose my
job is that it
   i dont know that it would be such a
tragedy i take notice that plenty of oth-
ers are shooting right straight ahead of you
while youre standing still its very amus-
ing to hear you talk about your job one
would think that it was the only job on
earth there are young men in this town
making five times as much as you are
   what at spluttered wooten
   storekeeping contracting real estate
enumerated mrs wooten pleasantly
   real estate sniffed wooten
   yes and there are a lot of day labor-
ers who make more than we do added
maisie
   at least theres dignity to being con-
nected with a bank said wooten defen-
sively  money isnt everything
   a bank roll means a good deal more
than a bank job contended the wife impa-
tiently  what fun do we get out of life
we cant afford to belong to the country
club we arent able to travel we havent
even got a car buying a hat or a dress
is such an extravagant transaction that i
feel guilty every time i think about it ive
never had a maid in my kitchen and never
will have were as poor as church mice-
thats what we are i should think youd
be getting sick and tired of it i should
think youd have too much pride to make a
drudge out of me
  wooten looked sternly at his watch
never had he lingered so late at a week-
day breakfast he pushed back his chair
with nervous haste
   oh finish your breakfast ordered
maisie  if i can stand over a hot stove
and cook it for you the least you can do
is to take time to eat it
   but i tell you ill be late complained
her husband  i cant afford to be late
 is there anything we can afford
   youve knocked the appetite all out of
me declared the bank clerk fretfully  i
couldnt finish my breakfast on a bet this
is no time to start in on a tirade like this
im just as disappointed as you are that
we havent had better luck but thats
neither here nor there im doing the best
i can ive stuck to my job just as faith-
fully as any man ever did i havent
shirked for a minute you know that as
well as i do- im surprised to hear you
let out such a roar and if you expect to
gain anything by it youre mightily mis-
taken ill tell you that i never knew you
were so quarrelsome whom have you been
talking to anyway
   talking to i suppose ive been talk-
ing to myself i dont get a chance to talk
to anybody else the friends you used to
have at the bank have all become officers
or department heads and they dont look at
us any more even the shepherds havent
been here for three years why should
they now that hes a vice president
  into her final question maisie poured all
her pent-up anger and brooding and despair
 youre so wedded to that job of yours
she went on relentlessly  that you dont
even care whether youre making a drudge
out of me you dont care whether ive got
any friends night after night you bury
your nose in a book about your fool bonds
but as for getting busy and making enough
money to buy a few bonds i dont think
it ever occurred to you you hardly ever
open your mouth unless it is to talk about
the bank and the bond department and
your two-by-four job your job why
youre wedded to it you may think youre
married to me but youre wedded to your
job youre a bigamist-thats what you
are
  wooten did not answer he rose seized
                         	a
capital axd surplus

his hat stalked savagely to the door and
slammed it violently behind him it was
the first time he had ever left the house
without kissing maisie good-by his brain
was in a turmoil his nerves were in a state
of peculiar tension
  he strode angrily to the interurban car
line missed the eight fifteen and realized
that he was stuck until the eight forty-five
he reflected sullenly that he could not pos-
sibly reach the bank until ten and that
for the first time he would be more than
an hour late at his desk his features hard-
ened into a stem and gloomy expression
he could not think coherently and the
whole world suddenly seemed topsy-turvy
  the unexpected events of the morning
had struck a blow to his pride that filled
him with all the fury he was capable of
experiencing maisies outburst had given
him a wrench that made him feel reckless
she had never talked to him in any such
terms before and if this was how she felt
he reflected grimly their married life had
descended to the level of burlesque
  a bigamist was he so that was what
she thought of him in his exasperation
strange notions began twisting through his
brain he imagined himself never going
home again never going to the bank again
he pictured himself taking a train for some
outlandish place and starting life all over
once more how would it be he wondered
to lose himself in some island in the tropics
and live like a savage he recalled maisies
rebuke on the score of their lack of worldly
possessions
  she had angered him but after all he
had to concede that she was not far wrong
it was a shame the way she had to work
while other women no better than she never
had to go near a pan of dish-water some
people were certainly bom to good luck
  he got off the interurban and started
across the street to the bank
  look where youre goin yelled a
chauffeur with an oath jamming on his
brakes
  wooten jumped
   close shave that said a familiar
voice as a friendly hand seized wootens
arm it was shepherd one of the vice
presidents of the bank  what are you try-
    	a
ing to do get run over he asked good
naturedly
   why not id never be missed
growled wooten in a tone the like of which
he had never used before in addressing a
superior	
   indeed you would be missed said
shepherd
  wooten detested the amiable manner in
which the other could utter such common-
place insincerities he was resentfully
aware of the healthy glow on shepherds
face his robust confidence the springiness
in his walk
   how have you been old man shep-
herd was asking
   rotten snapped wooten
  shepherd looked at him with unconcealed
surprise he had never known wooten to
be anything but sweet tempered and mild
and agreeable he could scarcely believe
his ears his interest and curiosity were
aroused he tightened his friendly hold on
wootens arm
   look here old man this wont do
whats troubling you
   what the devil do you care whats
troubling me demanded wooten ungra-
ciously
   i care a great deal
  wooten did not answer and as they en-
tered the spacious bank together shepherd
added sympathetically  cheer up woo-
ten dont feel so down on your luck ill
see you later
  the clerk went sulkily to his desk an-
gered by shepherds patronizing air and by
his pretense of interest he could remem-
ber what a raw young fellow shepherd had
been when he first went to work for the
bank he had himself helped break shep-
herd in had helped steer him and show
him the ropes he had watched him climb
from nothing to a vice presidency wooten
realized that he himself had at one time
been the better man of the two yet to-day
he was the serf and shepherd one of the
masters
  he had worked like a dog and yet just
as maisie said he had stood still while oth-
ers no whit better than he had climbed
right on up to the top even street the
president had been nothing but a paying

teller fifteen years ago it made wooten
sick to think of it
  the manager over wooten was a square
jawed executive named jarvis he had
only recently been appointed to the posi-
tion and was making a strenuous effort to
key up the department into high speed
performance and to break a few records for
efficiency
   good afternoon said jarvis with a
glance at the clock as wooten opened his
desk and began work
   good evening answered wooten with
a deliberate scowl
   whats the matter to-day demanded
jarvis twirling round in his swivel chair and
eying wooten inquisitively
   theres nothing the matter with me
whats the matter with you asked woo-
ten bluntly
   we used to be able to set the clocks by
you
   its a lovely life being an hourglass
replied wooten sarcastically
  he picked up a printers proof of a new
municipal bond circular made a final check-
ing of a table of rates maturities prices
and interests he glanced at the footnotes
and hedge clause o kd the proof and
threw it into a wire tray
   whats that-the circular the front
office is in a big sweat for that circular
remarked jarvis
   its ready for the printer said woo-
ten sharply
   many corrections
   a few
   i was hoping we could get it on the
press early this morning  thats the reason
i didnt want you to drift in here so late
on this of all days
   you held up the circular yourself for
nearly a week retorted wooten
  jarviss eyes narrowed he was in no-
wise accustomed to hear wooten talk to him
in this manner
   ill run my end of the business you
run yours he ordered  get that stuff
over to the printer and get it there quick
if theres no messenger about take it over
yourself there was a snap in jarviss
voice and an answering snap in wootens
   im no errand boy said wooten with
quiet rage pressing a buzzer for a mes-
senger

  when wooten crossed the public square
on his way to lunch he cast a hostile look
at the chamber of commerce building
where street and shepherd and jarvis and
other officers of the bank foregathered at
noon he recalled the airs these men put
on and he recalled with acute satisfaction
that he had talked that morning to at least
two of their number without mincing words
he had bowed and scraped to them and
had been their meek and lowly servant as
long as he intended to
  since maisies candor at the breakfast
table it no longer made a vast amount of
difference to him whether he kept his posi-
tion or lost it her attack had touched a
buried spring of independence in him it
had worked changes in him that affected his
whole being and bearing she had given
his pride a trouncing had roused it from
its coma and stirred it to the core
   there was a subtle difference in his stride
and his mild blue eyes gleamed with a re-
discovered sense of humor it had certain-
ly been amusing he reflected to talk back
to shepherd and jarvis and to see them
blink
  instead of grabbing the usual hasty lunch
at the cafeteria wooten did an unprece-
dented thing he went recklessly to the
leading hotel and spent a dollar and a quar-
ter for a meal instead of smoking one of
his usual seven cent manila cigars he se-
lected a twenty-five cent havana sank into
the deep upholstery of an enormous chair
in the lobby finished his smoke without
haste and strolled back to his desk nearly
thirty minutes late
   it was his first rebellious mood and there
was a novelty about it that rather fascinated
him curious impulses had invaded him
and he had discovered that there was some-
thing in life besides tranquil and unresisting
servitude
  soon after he returned to his desk shep-
herd dropped around he seemed unusually
thoughtful and solicitous he said  i
hope youre feeling better old man your
manner this morning worried me is there
capital and surplus

anything wrong with you how is your
wife
   fine hows yours
   never better and that reminds me
we havent dropped in to see you people in
an age going to be home to-night
   were home every night
   well how would it be if we ran over
with the car and took you and the lady for
a spin
   all right well be glad to see you
said wooten and went to work
  wooten went home that evening as if
nothing unusual had happened that morning
at breakfast toward the end of dinner he
announced that the shepherds were coming
with their car
   whats come over them demanded
maisie  did you ask them to
   certainly not what do you take me
for asked wooten
  there was a mellow bite in the autumnal
air that evening as they motored over the
winding slope of the country roads maisie
beside shepherd wrho was at the wheel felt
a touch of the old gayety that had al-
most deserted her since her marriage to the
bank clerk they wound up at a roadhouse
eighteen miles from town there was an
orchestra and there was dancing and maisie
danced for the first time in almost a year
even wooten uneasy at first at being taken
away from his lawn and his volumes on
finance soon found himself enjoying it
  next morning maisie had breakfast on
the table again on the dot wooten was at
his desk at nine and that evening he re-
turned to his garden hose and later to his
books and pamphlets on public utility
bonds
   i wonder if the shepherds will ever take
us out again remarked maisie finally  it
was wonderful last night wasnt it
   i dont know that it was so wonder-
ful answered wooten  what we ought
to have is a car of our own god knows
weve worked hard enough to own a few
things we dont have to be patronized by
the shepherds
  his wife pricked up her ears but went on
with her sewing
  now that fall had come jarvis the
square jawed executive of the bond depart-
ment started a heavy mailing campaign to
prospective bond buyers throughout the
county he himself prepared a form letter
to accompany a circular of selected offer-
ings and prided himself upon having writ-
ten a document with some real selling punch
in it there was but in the extensive mail-
ings that followed the letter went to nearly
all the names listed in the telephone direc-
tories of that and adjoining counties
among those who received the letter
was streets father-in-law a crusty old
financier and one of the chief owners of the
bank
  when that old fellow was in the midst
of reading the letter he grew red in the
face and when he had finished it he spent
the next twenty minutes making sarcastic
marginal comments and dispatched it to
his son-in-law the president of the bank in
a great rage
  two minutes after the communication
reached street he strode angrily to the bond
department
   who wrote this letter he demanded
waving the form letter in wootens face
   mr jarvis i believe returned woo-
ten calmly
   where is jarvis
   i havent the slightest idea
   i want to see him when he comes in
tell him i said so
   with pleasure sir said wooten
  the president had by no means had time
to cool off when jarvis reported to him a
few minutes later
   who wrote this letter demanded
street thumping it with his knuckles
   i did whats the matter with it
   everythings the matter with it  ex-
claimed street  the idea of sending a
letter like that to the principal owner of
this bank and to god only knows how
many more veteran bond buyers how
many of these letters went out
   about a hundred thousand
  the president groaned  why you talk
to these people as if they never heard of a
bond before in their lives you seem to
assume that theyve never even learned how
to save their money you insult them in
practically every paragraph and then ex-
pect them to come trooping in here and

become customers its a hell of a letter
look at those comments on it
   jarvis read them in silence then he said
 he seems to resent the selling punch
   selling punch snarled street  the
people of this county bought more liberty
bonds than any other county in the state
you dont have to send them any such
ballyhoo circus stuff as this if they want
jazz they can turn on the phonograph
dont let me catch you sending out any
more stuff like this
  jarvis went back to his desk beckoned
to wooten and said
   dont mail any more of those form
letters were going to send out a different
kind of a letter i want you to try your
hand at it something very genteel write
it as if you were addressing a bunch of old
codgers who never did anything else but
buy bonds you might refer modestly to
the bank as a fine old established institu-
tion but dont for heavens sake make it
appear that were really trying to do any-
thing so crude as to sell any bonds oh
dear no keep the letter so genteel that
it leans backward refer only in a most
casual way to our offerings see
  wooten accepted the assignment without
argument he suspected what had hap-
pened and from his knowledge of the
abandoned sales letter he had a fairly
correct notion of the kind of critical fire
it had drawn he knew that jarvis had
been on the carpet on account of it but
he welcomed the opportunity to try his hand
at a new letter and that night he composed
a dozen different versions before he felt
satisfied with the result
  after the final polishing and typing
wooten delivered the letter next morning
to jarvis he watched jarvis knitting his
brows and at length heard him burst forth
petulantly
   you didnt listen to me you didnt
do what i told you this letter is liable
to sell some bonds and thats exactly what
i dont want
   whats the letter for to send out
asked wooten
   certainly its to send out what else
do we write letters for thats a bone-
head question to ask
   is it asked wooten unruffled
 since when does the bank send out letters
that arent supposed to bring results
  a crafty expression gathered in jarviss
eyes he said  im afraid the situation
may be a trifle too-subtle for you to under-
stand this isnt a matter of brute force
but of strategy jarvis paused impres-
sively he looked at wooten with the de-
tached superiority of a human being con-
templating a worm  there are phases of
the administration of such an institution as
this that you could hardly be expected to
comprehend he added with slight but
devastating emphasis
  but instead of being devastated wooten
replied with a burst of spontaneous laugh-
ter such as had rarely been heard in the
austere old institution during banking hours
  it is a painful ordeal to be publicly
laughed out of countenance by a subordi-
nate and jarviss face grew red
   stop it he snarled  you make too
much noise with your mouth if theres
a joke its on you do you hear its
on you get your hat and get out of here
if you think ill stand for any insubordi-
nation in this department youre mistaken
get your hat and get out youre dis-
charged youre fired
  the grin on wootens face was so broad
that when he put on his hat and walked
out of the bank no one who saw him go
had the slightest idea that he had been
dismissed before boarding the interurban
for home he stopped at the arcade for a
bunch of roses and a box of candy in
the sunny sitting room he found maisie
ndustriously engaged in knitting a sweater
she looked at him with that quizzical ques-
tioning look of misgiving that enters the
eye of the wife of a wage slave who comes
home from work too early in the day
   im fired he announced before she
could make inquiries in his voice was a
note of unmistakable triumph  i got into
a racket with jarvis and got fired for in-
subordination he added with a conscious
expansion of the chest  its the best days
work i ever did ive been a worm so long
that it had become second nature for me
to crawl but my crawling days are over
and from now on im on my toes
capital and surplus

  there was a singular look of elation in
maisies unsentimental eyes  what are
you going to do she asked
   i may try storekeeping or contracting
or real estate in short im going to make
some money
  it was by far the most exciting thing
that had ever happened in the house of
wooten and as maisie listened she felt a
curiously satisfying chill running up and
down her spine
iii
  one week later down at the bank and
in the office of the president street and
shepherd were in conference
   that man jarvis has proved a great
disappointment to me street was saying
 his judgment is faulty and his methods
arent at all in line with our established
policies ive decided to let him go ive
asked for his resignation
   its not an easy post to fill answered
shepherd thoughtfully
   the manager of our bond department
has got to be forceful and enterprising but
also tactful and diplomatic continued
street  hes got to know bonds but
hes also got to know human nature jarvis
antagonizes too many people i never felt
comfortable with him about securities
cant be shoved into a clientele like ours
with a ramrod
   at the same time weve got to sell
bonds contended shepherd
   without a doubt in selecting a suc-
cessor to jarvis we cant afford to make
another mistake how about obrien
   obriens got a good head on him
rejoined shepherd  good personality
lots of drive hes made a good assistant
to jarvis theres only one thing i dont
like about him he worries too much hes
got one of those extravagant wives she
blows in his money as fast as he can make
it theyre driving too big a car for people
with their income they entertain an awful
lot theyve just traipsed their daughter
off to a finishing school in new hampshire
hes worried all the time ive lent him
money myself
   all right obriens out answered
street  what about smithers
   too valuable a man where he is we
need more assistant cashiers instead of cut-
ting down i wouldnt know how to replace
smithers
   havent we any tellers who are showing
executive ability
   you cant tell much about a mans ex-
ecutive ability as long as you keep him in
a tellers cage besides we need some one
who already knows something about the
bond business im afraid well have to fall
back upon some out-of-town man
  street pondered for a moment  i dont
like to go outside the institution if i can
help it he objected  a bank ought to
be able to train its own executives i wish
that man wooten werent so namby-pamby
hes a quiet clean cut serious minded fel-
low an exceedingly hard worker and ap-
parently loyal but he was never cut out
for an executive he hasnt enough drive or
force hes too damn nice
   well wooten is no longer with us any-
way said shepherd
   whats that asked street pricking up
his ears
    he and jarvis had a row of some sort
and it seems that jarvis threw him out
for insubordination explained shepherd
 theres been a good bit of a change in
wooten here lately one day last week he
snapped out answers to me in a way that
nearly bowled me over you know how
painfully pleasant he has always been
well i got to wondering if they could
be having trouble at home so mrs shep-
herd and i called but found everything all
right  another time i overheard him talk-
ing back vigorously to jarvis and the next
thing i knew jarvis had fired him
   fired him repeated the president in-
credulously
   yes but i never did find out just what
the trouble was all about
   how long was wooten with us asked
street
   i dont know probably ten or fifteen
years
   any complaint about his work previous
to this blow-up
   never heard of any i dont even know
that there was any complaint about his
work at the time he was discharged

argosy-allstory weekly
   well its too bad im sorry it hap-
pened
   so am i said shepherd turning to go
   you might get in touch with wooten
and have him run in and see me some time
added the president  id like to talk to
him myself and find out whats troubling
him
iv
  when word reached wooten that they
wanted to see him at the bank he said to
maisie
   i know what they want they cant get
any one to fill my place at what they were
paying me and most likely want me back
   maybe theyll be willing to pay you
more said maisie hopefully
  wootens reply was brusque and menac-
ing
   well theyll have to talk real money
if they want to do business with me he
declared
  after waiting for a few days wooten
dropped in at the bank where he was pres-
ently informed by shepherd that the presi-
dent wished to see him but when wooten
entered the large and somber office of the
president the latter paid no attention to
him remaining preoccupied with the papers
on his desk
  wooten cleared his throat but did not
speak in the presence of the bank presi-
dent the old timidity was flooding him
again the old meekness and subservience
and trepidation the courage and bellig-
erence he had lately achieved were ebbing
away and the old cringing weakness was re-
lentlessly taking possession of him again
he despised himself for his cowardice and
felt a sudden animosity toward the self-
confident official whose calmness and poise
inspired it but with a stalwart effort woo-
ten pulled himself together and with a
show of courage that he far from felt he
said
   i was told that you wanted to see me
mr street is that correct
  street looked up  hello wooten just
a moment for half a minute he busied
himself with his papers then he leaned back
in his chair and regarded wooten with a
quizzical air
  then  i hear youve been getting your-
self into trouble wooten whats the mat-
ter what does it mean asked the presi-
dent in a friendly tone
   im afraid i cant answer that ques-
tion replied wooten respectfully  per-
haps mr jarvis can
   ive talked to mr shepherd but he
doesnt seem to know what its all about
no one seems to know just what was the
trouble wooten questioned the president
in a kindly tone
   there was a difference of opinion be-
gan wooten then he checked himself
 but whats the use discussing it its a
closed episode im through but perhaps
i may venture to add just this mr presi-
dent there must be something wrong with
a system under which an officer of a bank
has the power to fly into a rage and dis-
charge a man who has put in fifteen years
of faithful service dont misunderstand
me please im not beefing im out and
its the best thing that ever happened to
me but i know this that if one of your
officers has the arbitrary power to assassi-
nate the business career of one of his men
for no reason that any one can discover
then if youll pardon me there must be
something radically wrong with the system
under which it can happen
   just a minute wooten interrupted
the president  thats a pretty serious
charge youre making
   if a man can be slaughtered right under
your very roof during banking hours con-
tinued wooten tensely  and no one knows
why it happened then there must be some-
thing wrong somewhere
   dont get excited wooten calm your-
self urged mr street
   calm myself echoed wooten with
a shade of bitterness in his words  ive
been calm for fifteen years fifteen years
ive stuck to my job with all the patience
i had fifteen years ive been a clerk in
this bank hoping against hope that the
time would come when my value to the
bank would be recognized and there would
be something better in store for me but
what happened i remained a clerk-noth-
ing but a clerk
   my wife kept wondering why but i
capital and surplus

couldnt tell her why if theres a streak
of laziness in me i dont know where it is
if theres any inferiority or inefficiency i
cant discover it ive studied and ive
ground and ive stuck others have gal-
loped on ahead of me but my chance never
came and yet i venture to say that i
know as much about banking as any one in
the place ive worked while others talked
with the result that the bank hardly knew
i was on earth why this is the first time
in years that ive been inside your office
i had to get fired in order to cross your
threshold to-day
   look here wooten put in the presi-
dent  we are not as indifferent about your
case as you seem to think
   and yet all you know about me is that
for fifteen years ive been one of several
hundred clerks who wear green eye shades
you dont know what i was fired for and
you dont know what i contributed in the
way of work
   just what have you been doing since
you left the paying tellers cage inquired
the president with interest
   youll have to ask my superiors dont
ask me ask mr jarvis if i tried to tell
you you might think i was boasting
   ive made some inquiries but no one
seems to know just what youve been do-
ing pursued the president
  wooten regarded the other steadfastly
   for fifteen years he answered dryly
 ive been on the job early and late i
never shirked yet you dont know what
ive done nobody knows what ive done
youll pardon me im no longer in your
employ im out so i can speak frankly
the books of this bank have to be balanced
every day at the close of business when
the bank inspectors make their rounds
everything is in shipshape order you know
to a cent how much every one of your de-
positors has to his credit you know all
about the dollar equation but you seem to
know mighty little about the human equa-
tion you want to know what value i have
been to the bank but you cant find out
youve got to call me in and ask me do
you have to ask your customers how much
money theyve got on deposit not much
its your business to know and if youll
pardon the suggestion it seems to me to be
just as much the business of a bank to know
what an employee has deposited in the form
of service
  the president had listened with attentive
interest
   thats an interesting point of view
wooten he replied  youve touched
upon an important point it is possible that
an injustice has been done you what do
you propose what do you want done
  wooten shook his head it isnt for
me to say what should be done but it
seems to me that if i were in your place
id want to know what the department
heads were doing with their power and id
want to know more about the fellows who
are willing to stick patiently to their jobs
year after year and who do most of the
actual work that the executives get the
credit for the capital and surplus of a
bank like this cant be measured merely
in terms of money and securities no-
theres capital and theres surplus in the
men at the desks and behind the counters
good day mr street
v
  the president of the bank gazed thought-
fully into space for several minutes after
wooten had gone then he sent for his
first assistant and said to him
   an old employee of the bank has re-
cently been discharged his name is woo-
ten i want to know what kind of a record
he made during his term of employment i
want a complete and detailed report of what
he has done i want some one to dig
through the records and find out
  no time was lost in carrying out the
presidents instructions night after night
the investigation continued officials and
veteran clerks were interviewed innumer-
able ledgers files documents and carbons
were dug into and as the trail of the dis-
charged clerk was followed up it disclosed
his services in connection with masses of
important transactions his painstaking
handwriting his initials his o ks were
found in thousands of forgotten places it
was found that a score of men who had
subsequently shot ahead of him on the pay

roll had been turned over to him for in-
struction in their early duties and six of
them had eventually become officers of the
bank
  he had blocked three different attempts
at embezzlement he had written hundreds
of bond circulars pamphlets and booklets
he had repeatedly persuaded managers of
the bond department to inaugurate policies
that had worked out successfully and be-
come established practice his patient and
unobtrusive labors had time and again been
capitalized by ambitious superiors to their
own exclusive credit
  after a week of investigation the report
was laid on the presidents desk he read
it attentively and then he called his secre-
tary and dictated the following letter
  my dear wooten
    since talking to you i have caused an in-
  vestigation to be made of your services while
  you were in our employ and am surprised
  at the volume of work and the quality of
  work for which you have been responsible
    i am indebted to you for some of the sug-
  gestions you made when you were in here the
  other day and have given considerable
  thought to some of your views you were in
  the banking business for fifteen years i have
  been in it for forty years but you have
  given me some good advice
    i agree with you as to what you said re-
  garding capital and surplus the mistakes
  in management you pointed out will not oc-
  cur again if we can help it we are at work
  now revising our system of accounting to in-
  clude the human equation
    drop in and see me again at your conven-
  ience i want you to come back into the
  organization we need your help in making
  some of these changes
faithfully yours
                            john street
  wooten read the letter and then handed
it to his wife without any comments
  well she exclaimed happily you
have certainly brought them to their senses
they want you to come back you will go
wont you she asked anxiously
  i dont know it depends on what
theyve got to offer
   maybe theyll be willing to pay you
more she said hopefully
   im not worrying about that part of it
answered wooten confidently  but if i
do go back i know ill get a square deal
and thats something
u	v	rr
you are
  volt are the day
   in whose white radiance
  my sense can find the time
  for naught but play
  you are the night
  in whose soft splendor
  my thoughts like twinkling stars
  do dream of might
  you are all time
  in which fantastic dreams
  i weave that have as yet
  no reason and no rime
  you are all space
  in which theres room
  for naught besides the presence
  of your tender grace
  you are the tide
  on whose surging roll
  my joys and sorrows too
   forever ride

chapter xv
 the prince knows nothing
jenny walked up and down the arch-
duchesss sitting room she had
switched on all the lights
  on the mantelpiece a golden flying cupid
held a little crystal clock it struck nine
with a chime like a musical box all the
clocks in the castle were kept half an hour
fast so it was half past eight she had
been up there nearly half an hour
  down in her sitting room the ex-empress
was telling prince nicholas the truth
  he knew it by now he knew that she
was a fraud she would never see him
again he wouldnt want to see her he
was hating her despising her she had
helped to make a fool of him no man
could forgive that
  she stood before a mirror she wore sil-
ver lace over pale rose and the long chain
of rubies that matched in fire the magnifi-
cent ring on her left hand
there was no gayety in her mouth to
hersell she looked ugly and old the color
in her cheeks and lips stared at her and
made her angry she took her handker-
chief and rubbed vigorously leaving cheeks
and lips ghastly white after the glow of
friction had subsided at least she need
not do that any more
  she wondered what they would do with
her probably get her out of the castle at
once their plan had failed they would
want to get rid of all traces of their de-
ception of course the prince would back
them up however disgusted he might be
they would all hang together she could
see herself being let out of the distant pos-
tern gate and bundled into a swift but in-
conspicuous motor car once more being
carried londonward through the night
  in memory she heard nicholas command-
ing her to think of him every second until
he came back she had obeyed she had
one of his letters inside her dress at that
moment-a little note that had made her
grow pale as she read it and bury her face
in her hands and picture his return quite

forgetting that hand in hand with his return
for the wedding must go her disappearance
from the scene
  it seemed to her that hours passed why
did nobody come had they forgotten her
had the prince gone away at once it
could not take all this time to tell him
  how angry he must be how splendid
he must look when he was angry oh
what a fool she had been to do it what
had she done but broken her own heart
  she would never see his dear face again
he would never hold her in his arms again
and call her  little girl  and kiss her and
look at her with that half wonder in his
eyes as if the fact that they loved each
other were too good to be true
  symbolically she took the ring from her
finger she held it for a moment kissed it
passionately sobbing to herself like a lost
soul and was about to take it into the
dressing room and lay it in its case when
the door opened and the baroness dora
luini came in
  the pale precise lady looked like an
apparition she seemed to glide over the
carpet without a word
  the little crystal clock chimed out the
hour of ten
   have you heard anything the baron-
ess asked  has any one been up here
   no said jenny dully  do you want
me to get ready to go at once
   my dear said the elder woman  the
empress has been taken ill she is lying un-
conscious the doctors say it was a stroke
she was weak you know the shock-
   the shock of telling the prince said
jenny solemnly
   i dont know she hasnt spoken
   but the prince
   i only saw him for a moment he
was alone with her majesty when it hap-
pened
   didnt he say anything to you
   no only how grieved he was
   but he must know the truth
   i suppose so but it was no time to
discuss it
   what am i to do i had better go
   i dont know the baronesss agita-
tion was painful to behold  he asked
to see you-
  oh no i couldnt cried jenny in
horror
   i said you were indisposed it is only
natural
   i had much better go at once
   i dont know supposing-supposing
she did not tell him
  but she must have told him cried
jenny
   yes i suppose so the shock of tell-
ing him must have brought on the attack
i am at my wits end i must consult the
archduke when he is visible he is with
the empress now countess grioch and
general mortis insist on leaving everything
to me it is hardly fair but they say
that i was more entirely in her majestys
confidence in this matter i suppose they
are right dont move from here until i
come back
  she left the room and jenny gave herself
up to her miserable thoughts
  the baroness came back about half an
hour later more distressed than ever
   the archduke-oh my dear what a
terrible business this is he-you know
how simple and silent and vague he always
is well now he is like a child he wor-
ships her majesty i can get no sense out
of him
   i had much better go said jenny
again
   the prince has returned to broad-
meads thinking he might be in the way
he has seen the doctors he left word
with general mortis that he hoped to be
able to see you to-morrow general mor-
tis is strongly of the opinion that you
should stay here of course the marriage
will be postponed general mortis is see-
ing to all that fortunately it was to have
been so quiet that it wont make much dif-
ference so it cannot hurt if you stay for
a day or two
  the baroness presented such a pitiable
spectacle that jenny could not be angry
with her but it was just the same as ever
her feelings were not considered in the
least they expected her to remain in this
odious position perhaps even to bear the
brunt of the princes anger and scorn but
that she was determined no power on earth
should persuade her to do
another womans life

  jenny was firm she would not see the
prince when he came the next morning
they must explain to him they said it
was quite natural for her to be upset
  the ex-empress still lay unconscious
   cant you tell whether he knows or
not the girl asked desperately
   no the baroness answered  he says
nothing his manner has not changed in
the least he seems very much concerned
about you it is most mysterious i cant
help hoping-
   hoping asked jenny driven to dis-
traction  what can you hope you
must see that for me it is unbearable
   you have been so good was all the
baroness could murmur gazing appealingly
into the girls white face
  toward evening the ex-empress recovered
consciousness there was a hopeful rally
prince nicholas sent constant inquiries and
said he would remain until he received
definite news and until her imperial high-
ness was -well enough to see him
  at ten oclock jenny was alone in her
rooms having played with the food served
to her and half inclined to slip into bed
without summoning the maids and find
a brief respite from her miserable thoughts
in sleep
  but the baroness came to summon her to
the ex-empresss bedside
   her majesty wishes to see you she is
extremely weak the doctors fear the
worst but her mind is perfectly clear
come please her majesty wants to see
you alone
  jenny looked at her dressing gown the
baroness nodded
   you must change she said  her ma-
jesty wishes everything to go on as usual
  so it was in full evening dress that jenny
was taken to see the wonderful little old
lady in her sumptuous room
  at eleven oclock jenny and the baroness
were alone again in the archduchesss sitting
room
  the girl was sobbing with a mixture of
awe and grief
   oh it was terrible she said  how
could i do it and what else could i do
   my dear try to collect yourself the
baroness urged  it is so important
everything depends on you now so her
majesty had not told the prince the
truth
  jenny wiped her eyes and struggled for
calm
   no she said she was thinking out the
best way to tell him he had not even
begun to speak of me-i mean of the arch-
duchess she was trying to break it gent-
ly to him-and then she remembered noth-
ing more
   her majesty is quite herself is she
not
   oh yes-so wonderful but she fright-
ened me too lying there with that loaded
revolver by her side and her eyes-they
seemed to be seeing things in another world
i felt as if she had already gone away
   so the prince knows nothing
   no and she asked me to stay on un-
til the archduchess came back she im-
plored me to she said she was sure to
come back i could hardly hear her voice
-it was like a silver thread she made
me give her my promise i did oh but
i oughtnt to have done it it makes it
worse than ever
   my dear you were generous and right
and what difference can it make there
can be no wedding yet and her majesty
is right the archduchess must come back
when she hears of her grandmothers ill-
ness she cannot be lost to all sense of
decency
   but i cannot see the prince  jenny in-
sisted  you must understand that it
would be too hateful he would condole
with me on her majestys illness i should
have to accept his sympathy and it seems
too utterly low it is playing the fool with
kindness of heart i cant do it and i
wont 
   we must manage somehow agreed the
baroness
  some one came to the door it was an
officer of the household to summon the
baroness to the ex-empresss room
  there were assembled the archduke
gabriel the ex-empresss chaplain and the
principal members of the imperial house-
hold

  on the stroke of midnight melita ariadne
marguerite louise alexandrine ex-empress
of rosemark breathed her last
chapter xvi
jennys resolution
the funeral ceremonies were over
there was no news of the arch-
duchess stephanie
  jenny had resolutely refused to appear as
a mourner the idea shocked her too
deeply
  the baroness arranged everything the
archduchess was seriously indisposed owing
to the shock of her grandmothers death
on the very eve of her wedding such a
condition of affairs was generally under-
stood the press was most sympathetic
toward the young couple
  it was announced that the wedding would
be postponed for six months
  one brilliant april morning jenny clad
in deep mourning which revolted her sense
of decency and fitness faced the baroness
with the look of a hunted animal in her
velvet brown eyes
   i know i promised she said  but
i cant keep my promise-i simply cant
   a promise to the dead reminded the
baroness
   but the archduchess has not come
back she must have heard of the em-
presss death
   there must be some reason she may
be ill she will come back
  the baroness was transformed her pre-
cise voice was full of passion-the great
passion of loyalty to the family she had
served all her life  it is only a few days
longer the prince is leaving to-day i
only ask you to see him once more when
he comes to say good-by it would be so
cruel to let him know of her majestys de-
ception now-so soon after she has been
laid to rest he admires her so and she
thought so much of you only a day or
two before she died she said to me  she is
a sweet girl a good girl i only wish
stephanie had her disposition i think i
believe she loved you jenny and you
gave her your word-on her death bed
  the solemn words seemed to fill the room
with the strange spiritual strength of the
old ladys presence right or wrong jenny
was hypnotized she gave in
  and just then the chamberlain came to
announce that his royal highness prince
nicholas of galmatia was in the library
  jenny looked at the baroness in mute de-
spair when the official had withdrawn the
baroness pointed to her left hand
   the ring she said
  jenny went into the dressing room and
took the glowing ruby from its case slipping
it onto her finger it was another symboli-
cal act she was putting on her mask
again she was deliberately helping to break
her own heart
  in somber black unrelieved save by the
blood red stones on her finger she accom-
panied the baroness out of the room
  in her perturbation the baroness did not
even notice that the girls face was not
made up
   oh stephanie you poor little ghost
i am so sorry-so awfully sorry 
  prince nicholas stood before jenny in
the great library with its somber richness
of books and woodwork and the famous
collection of roman and greek bronzes
and the mysterious persian rugs like car-
pets of flowers and the real flowers the
blaze of spring tulips in the copper and
bronze vases
   i feel a perfect beast the young man
went on  for worrying you to see me i
didnt understand somehow that you would
feel it like this you thought all the world
of your grandmother i suppose
   she was very wonderful jenny said
he made no advance toward her for a
few moments he stood looking at her
at last he said in a low voice
   how lovely you are how much more
lovely than i ever thought
  and then even the shadow of death could
not restrain his youthful fire and he took
her into his arms and kissed her passionate-
ly hungrily
   stephanie you are my little girl still
i shant mind going away now ive seen
you again i wont say anything to hurt
you sweetheart only think of me thats
another womans life

all i ask my mother will write to you
perhaps youll be able to come and stay
with her for a little while-later on they
say we cant get married for six months
now dont they
   yes jenny breathed half of her was
in heaven and the other half loathed this
wicked assumption of grief she did indeed
feel some grief the ex-empress had never
met any one on whom she had not set a
seal of her magical personality but this
grief that she was supposed to feel was a
mockery
   stephanie tell me you love me  whis-
pered the caressing voice
  and out of the depths of her heart she
confessed it
   i love you nicholas
  the scene was more than she could bear
she could see that her sorrow to him was
sacred he would not speak of himself of
their plans not even of their love he had
asked her for the one simple statement and
she had satisfied him but although it was
true it was also false and the falseness
seared her soul
  his arms released her
  he was gone
  she had played her part but this was
the end she took a solemn oath she had
played these peoples game she had pre-
tended to be what she was not
  to play the fool with his position with
his rank with the political aspirations of
his country and of the imperial family of
rosemark-that was one thing
  but to play the fool with his love for her
and her love for him-that was another
matter and that no power on earth should
persuade her to do
  this was the end
chapter xvii
an unlucky meeting
hat was a strange day
  jenny saw the archduke gabriel
for the first time since his mothers
death he was now of course the head of
the household the ex-empress had left
him the whole of her enormous fortune and
her estates for his life and afterward the
archduchess stephanie would inherit every-
thing the ex-empress had already made
a princely marriage settlement on her
granddaughter so that the absent girl was
probably the richest heiress in the world
  the archduke made an even stranger im-
pression on jenny than before
   do you know she said to the baroness
afterward  it almost seems as if he thinks
i am really the archduchess he was so
nice to me this morning so kind he said
now we two were all alone and what a
great loss we had sustained and how he
hardly felt strong enough to manage every-
thing and i must try to be a help to him
and he gave me a lot of money and said
he hoped i would order the meals it made
me feel so creepy
   i am afraid his mind is going the
baroness answered  he has never been
quite like other people he was in the
terrible battle of fresinelle as quite a small
boy and they think it affected him but
he was a splendid soldier you can see how
he is wrapped up in his war maps now it
is a great comfort that he takes you for the
archduchess oh that wicked girl how
can she have the heart to stay away
  it was then that jenny announced in a
solemn tone of voice
   i cannot meet the prince again in-
deed i cannot if she does not come back
you must make some arrangement so that it
can be avoided you must see it yourself
to accept his sympathy to pretend-no
its impossible its indecent she added
violently
   we must see what we can do said the
baroness looking alarmed  my dear
your sentiments do you the greatest credit
you see there are six months and you
will be expected to lead the quietest of
lives and the prince would hardly pro-
pose himself to stay here for some time to
come
   he suggested my going to stay with his
mother
   we must get over that somehow but
of course of course the archduchess must
come back
   i must go away for a few days said
jenny to the baroness a few days later

argosy-allstory weekly
 my brother has gone to the seaside i
have not seen him since he has been moved
there he will think something has hap-
pened to me it is so mysterious the way
i have been sending the money every week
besides i must see him he is the only
person i have in the world
  the baroness hated the risk but jenny
was adamant so it was given out that the
archduchess was confined to her rooms and
the girl slipped out of the distant postern
gate into the inconspicuous car and was
driven to a junction on the railway there
she waited for a train direct to margate
where bertie was
   one of the maids from argar castle
she heard a porter whisper to a country
woman who looked at her with interest
  she found bertie much as usual the
air was doing wonders for him physically
but it did not improve his temper he
grumbled because she did not come more
often he did not like the home he
hated so many open windows he was al-
ways cold
  jenny had meant to go to london but
she decided not to she would stay in mar-
gate for the three days of her absence in
london she might have run across some-
body she knew there was the possibility
of a meeting with marcus phare she had
heard nothing more of him and almost
persuaded herself that she had been mis-
taken in thinking he had recognized her
the excitement and bewilderment of the
ex-empresss death had put him out of her
mind but london was no safe place for
her
  it was fate
  on the second afternoon of her stay she
was taking a stiff walk along the cliffs it
was such a relief after the confined life of
the castle she was a girl naturally fond
of exercise and poverty had made her into
a great pedestrian
  she wanted to breathe fresh air-physi-
cally and mentally her life of lies was
telling on her she saw what a high price
human beings paid for earthly greatness
she had a hundred pounds in her hand
bag and if she chose to take it a good in-
come for life was guaranteed to her but
she was utterly miserable and she wished
herself with all her heart and soul back at
mme lacours the humble manikin with
her heart in her own keeping and able to
look every man in the face
  the past was spoiled for her she did
not suppose she could ever go back to it
and the future she dared not think of it
held the unspeakable moment the moment
in which nicholas discovered the truth
  on her return she passed the large hotel
at the eastern end of the town a man was
just coming down the steps of the glass-
covered porch he was protected against
the keen north wind by a thick ulster and
a white woollen scarf
  as jenny passed he stared hard made
a little sound of astonished recognition and
started in pursuit jenny all unaware was
going over her parting with nicholas in her
sorrowful mind
  a quiet voice sounded behind her
   is it your imperial highness or is your
visit here incognito and should i say miss
devon
  she turned to meet marcus phares smil-
ing gaze
  it was sheer cruelty she had not gone
to london for fear of meeting him and
here he was and he had recognized her
  blindly she set her feet on another path
of lies there seemed nothing else to do
   i dont understand you mr phare
she said coldly
   dont you perhaps i didnt make
myself clear i went to argar castle near
lordstone not long ago with a deputation
to wait on her imperial highness the arch-
duchess stephanie of rosemark with a wed-
ding present she received us in company
with her fiance prince nicholas of galma-
tia and the royal lady was none other
than yourself
   i cannot understand you jenny said
again
   you are going to deny it then of
course you would i have been investiga-
ting portraits of the lady you are amaz-
ingly like her but i knew you at once
there is only one jenny devon in the
world
   i think you are mad mr phare said
jenny scornfully
   oh no but deeply interested i am
another womans life

going into this of course the main idea
is clear enough for some reason the
young lady is absent and you are taking
her place but does the prince know he
is a good-looking boy isnt he how do
you like being engaged to him
   i dont know what you are talking
about
   it must have been pretty awkward
when the empress died went on the suave
mocking voice  i noticed that the arch-
duchess was overcome with grief and kept
to her own apartments i suppose you
wouldnt like to tell me the truth
  jenny flashed him a withering glance
she was half paralyzed with fright but
there was too much at stake
   i shall try to find out said phare
blandly  you see i am very much in-
terested in you i would hate you to come
to harm it seems to me that you are
playing a slightly dangerous game i think
i can get into touch with some one who
would help me i know one of the arch-
duchesss most intimate friends i never
had the honor of being presented to her-
until the other day you were quite de-
lightful i must say
   really mr phare i wish you would
not talk such nonsense said jenny  i
havent the slightest idea what you mean
i am here visiting my crippled brother
she walked very fast he kept step with
her
  they were about to cross a side street
when two ladies came round the corner
both were elderly distinguished-looking
and dressed in black one of them gave
jenny a startled glance then stopped and
made the slight regulation curtsy that the
occasion demanded
  the girl hurried on the man by her side
her cheeks were flaming
  phare looked back
   the ladies are glued to the pavement
he chuckled  wondering why you did not
acknowledge the salutation
  jennys heart was pounding she was
ready to cry with distress there were
quite a number of people in the castle who
did not know that she was not the arch-
duchess that lady must be one of them
and must have recognized her
   it is a great game said phare  i
admire you intensely youre as clever as
youre beautiful and as plucky i want
you to be my wife and i hope youre going
to say yes indeed i am sure you are
   is that a threat mr phare she
asked
   no but i warn you im going into
this business it is far too interesting to
drop unless of course youll tell me all
about it
   theres nothing to tell jenny said
 you are making a ridiculous mistake
good-by mr phare im going to see my
brother
  she left margate the next day full of
terror she saw nothing more of phare
but the thought of him was always with
her sinister menacing
  and yet frightened though she was she
could not bring herself to tell the baroness
about him
chapter xviii
three meet
two days later jenny was alone in the
archduchesss sitting room in argar
castle
  it was about half past seven oclock
she had a book open on her lap but she
was not reading time hung heavily on
her hands of necessity she had no com-
panionship the baroness was busy with
general mortis sorting out their late mis-
tresss papers other members of the
household she hardly ever saw she took
her meals in her own rooms except when
the archduke gabriel invited her to share
his table but that was more painful than
anything else he was convinced that she
was his niece and to play her part with
him was the greatest of all her difficulties
  everything was at a standstill she had
no ordinary relaxations no housekeeping
no shopping her mourning clothes had
been sent down by mme lacour without
fittings the trousseau of course was
hung up until the first period of mourning
should be over
  life was just a dull waiting for the arch-
duchess to come back

argosy-allstory weekly
  jenny rose and walked over to the win-
dow and looked out at the quiet waters
of the moat reflecting the pale primrose of
the evening light
  the door opening made her turn and she
saw a stranger come into the room it was
a woman wrapped in a dark fur coat with
an enormous collar she wore a fur cap
and a thick veil and as she raised it jenny
had the curious experience of looking into
a face the very living image of her own
  she could see the likeness herself and
had to own that it was extraordinary of
expression she could hardly judge but the
vivid make-up struck her and she realized
that hers had never been quite so obvious
also she noticed the much more careless
carriage an assurance born of a position
that could never be called in question
  so this was stephanie of rosemark she
had come back
  well my little substitute said the
archduchess and jenny heard the difference
in the voice and wondered how prince
nicholas could ever have been taken in
 ive stolen a march on you i wanted
badly to see you i slipped into the castle
and found one of the old servants one can
trust and put him on his honor not to tell
anybody i am here
  she surveyed jenny with mocking but
not unfriendly eyes
   youre prettier than i am she said
but we really are as like as two peas
ive been ill thats why i didnt come
before poor old grandma i have been
a nuisance to the whole lot of you no
wonder nicholas fell in love with you my
dear i suppose youve had some grand
times together and now hes gone back
to his country well what do you think
of me
   your imperial highness began jenny
slowly
   oh stop the imperial highness my
child cried the careless voice you
know what it is to be one yourself
   im glad youve come said jenny from
the bottom of her heart
   what tired of poor nicholas al-
ready but i dont know that im going
to stay altogether im pretty fed up with
the life ive been living being hunted is
no fun i can tell you i feel quite sorry
for the fox
  she glanced mischievously at the ring
ofi jennys finger  i say our young man
has good taste hasnt he she asked
then she stopped holding up her hand to
enjoin silence
  there were sounds in the adjoining room
she ran to the communicating door and
locked it then she came back to jennys
side
   i want to talk to you before anybody
sees me she whispered  i suppose the
maids have come to dress you come with
me well slip down to the library by one
of the back stairs its a room thats never
used nobody will disturb us there prob-
ably old luini will be looking you up here
before long ive got a lot to say to you
  jenny could do nothing but comply
also she was deeply stirred by the fascinat-
ing careless figure with lines of a secret
history already written on her young face
  she followed the archduchess and they
slipped down a side staircase at the end of
the corridor
  they met nobody on the way to the li-
brary the archduchess opened the door
and they went in jenny shutting the door
behind her
  the room was lighted up as they en-
tered a tall young man rose from a chair by
the fireplace he wore an ulster thrown
open and a tweed traveling suit under it
it was prince nicholas
  jenny stood rooted to the spot stepha-
nie gave a little laugh
  all three gazed at each other in profound
silence
   jennys first sensation curiously was one
of immense relief the truth was out the
deception was over she could breathe
again it was as if a great load were sud-
denly lifted from her
  her second sensation was one of anger at
the archduchesss frivolity how could she
laugh at such a time
  how prince nicholas came there was a
mystery he was supposed to be back in
galmatia there had been no expectation
of his return
  but there he was and for a few moments
                          	a
another womans life

-each seeming an endless age-he looked
from one girls face to the other his eyes
dark and cold as a thundercloud in winter
rested finally on stephanie who stood
careless and to jennys eyes insolent just
as she had sat her horse in the film that the
girl had seen on that dreary sunday now
more than six weeks ago
  the girl of the hunting field said
nicholas at last
  then he looked at jenny and his eyes
grew more threatening still
   the girl of the little china room his
voice was low and he spoke as if to himself
the next moment it rang out harshly
 ladies i make you my compliments
you have both fooled me beautifully
would it be presumptuous to ask for an
explanation
  jenny had once thought how splendid he
would look when he was angry she saw
him now it was a cold imperious wrath
his eyes were like stones his face was white
under the tan on his temple she saw a blue
vein throbbing his lips were curved in a
scornful smile
  she was dumb she stood head bowed
the picture of misery of fear of repentance
a convicted sinner deeply conscious of her
sin
   the explanation is simple began
stephanie lightly she moved over to
jenny and put a careless hand on her shoul-
der  you are not to blame this pretty
little girl my dear nicholas
  at that moment the door opened and the
baroness dora luini came in
  she gave one look at the trio then a wild
shriek which she tried hard to smother with
her hands her knees gave way and she
sank into a chair
  nicholas bowed to her
   i am only asking for an explanation
madame do not alarm yourself
  long training came to the distracted
ladys aid the passion of her loyalty to
the great house of rosemark surged up in
her and gave her strength
  she rose and mechanically curtsied to the
prince she was trembling still and her
whole being was given over to devastating
despair but she did not showff she had
acquiredcmiposure and dignity it was as
   	a
 if the collective spirit of the imperial family
 of rosemark had entered into her in order
 that she might defend their cause
    i beg leave of your royal highness to
 make the explanation she said  neither
 her imperial highness nor this young lady
 is to blame have i your royal highnesss
 permission
    certainly please go on madame
    i will ask her imperial highness to allow
 me to conduct your royal highness to an-
 other room said the baroness  i will
 ask this young lady to wait here and her
 imperial highness to go to her own apart-
 ments
    my good old luini interrupted
 stephanie  not a living soul knows im
 here i came in by a back door and only
 old victor saw me and he wont tell i
 went up to my rooms and found my little
 substitute there i brought her down here
 because i wanted to talk to her undisturbed
 i had no idea that prince nicholas was
 going to complicate matters like this it
 cant be helped now ive given the whole
 show away its all my fault of course
 and you can blackguard me all you like
    i have not been back to galmatia
 nicholas put in  i had a message from
 my father telling me to go to paris on
 some private matter i stayed at our em-
 bassy incognito i came back before going
 home because i wanted to see- he
 stopped short his eyes were fixed on
 jenny who dared not look up  because
 i wanted to see the archduchess he con-
 tinued in a frozen voice
   then jenny did look up she met his ac-
 cusing eyes and gave him one wild look of
 adoration and despair
   the baroness and the prince left the
 room after stephanie had gone she pro-
 tested that she wanted to talk to jenny
 but the lady in waiting pointed out that
 the archduchess must be in her rooms to be
 dressed for dinner
   stephanie gave way the baroness was
 all authority she dominated both the
 headstrong girl and the furious prince
 jenny was left alone in the library
 lrhalf -an hour later the baroness came
 jback she satidown and put her hands to

argosy-allstory weekly
her head jenny who was walking up and
down the room paused
   the prince has gone said the lady
in waiting in a thin tired voice  he did
not wish to stay i would not urge him
his car was waiting outside he wouldnt
even stay to dine oh what an awful thing
that he should have come back
   what did he say jenny asked
   very little hardly anything i told
him the truth of course i made light of
the archduchesss escapade oh why did
she come back like this hasnt she caused
us enough misery already
   i suppose he was very angry
   yes very its quiet cold anger that
frightens you i suppose he was more
angry because he was taken in hes going
home at once
   i suppose he will not-break off the
engagement asked jenny the words
sounded banal and silly
   oh no he would not do that he
did not speak of it you see it is all ar-
ranged it would be impossible think of
the scandal and besides the marriage is
still as desirable circumstances have not
changed
   no thought jenny bitterly- only
the girl
   there are six months before the wed-
ding the unpleasant impression will pass
now that the archduchess has come back
it will be all right i am sure we can never
never thank you you have behaved ad-
mirably throughout
   i had better go now
   yes it will be safer one cannot take
risks i will take you up to my rooms and
fetch your clothes for you you must have
some food up there and i will order the
car to fetch you about ten oclock i am
so sorry its so late but we must take no
risks
  jenny took the ruby ring from her finger
and laid it in the baronesss hand
 i shall be glad to take off this mourn-
ing she murmured  it-it stifles me
 you have behaved admirably through-
out the baroness repeated  we can
never make it up to you
  no they could never make it up to her
they could not bring back the love light
into prince nicholass eyes now she would
certainly never see him again that was
her last look at the beloved face with the
furious harshness in the eyes and the cold
reckless smile on the lips
  she had helped to fool him and he hated
her
  the archduchess demanded to see miss
devon she insisted she threatened
  so it was arranged jenny consented
unwillingly enough although she could not
help a certain curiosity but she was too
wretched to have any strong feelings except
about her own sorrowing heart and her
empty future
  dressed in her plain coat and skirt with
her hat on she went up to the orange and
gold sitting room while some trusted ser-
vant kept the coast clear
  before she had had a clear understand-
ing with the baroness she would take no
money except what was absolutely needful
for berties and her expenses until she could
find work again the baroness pressed a
thousand pounds on her she took a hun-
dred she wanted to give back the pearl
necklace and the diamond and topaz brace-
let the baroness implored her to keep
them the pearls her late majesty had
especially chosen for her from her own jewel
case she had worn them herself as a young
girl she wanted miss devon to have them
she had such a real feeling of gratitude
and kindness toward her she had so thor-
ough understood that miss devon wanted
no money for what she had done
  jenny gave in and kept the pearls but
the bracelet she gave back it could only
embarrass her the baroness almost tear-
fully begged the girl to let her know if she
were ever in need of help she must not be
too proud she must realize that she had
done more for them than they could ever
repay
  jenny got the impression that the bar-
oness did not fear for the future the arch-
duchess had come back the prince might
be angry but he was bound by the rules
of his caste as all men and women were
after all when he agreed to take stephanie
for his bride he had never seen her it
could not make much difference to him
another womans life

  jenny found stephanie in a deep chair
smoking a cigarette the remains of a
meal were on a table jenny herself had
pecked at some food up in the baronesss
room in order to please that much per-
turbed lady
  the archduchess wore a filmy black gar-
ment with flowing sleeves and a knotted
girdle of dull black beads she had no
make-up on her face and her skin looked
sallow and there were hollows under her
eyes she said she had been ill and she
looked it
  her face fascinated jenny more than ever
-that face so like her own and yet to-
night so different the secrets were show-
ing through something sad something re-
bellious something desperate she was not
wearing the ruby ring
   i want to talk to you she said and
through the carelessness of her voice sound-
ed a quality that played on jennys feelings
like nervous fingers on a harp  do you
know i have absolutely nobody to talk to
i never have had my head is bursting with
things to say its so queer looking at you
-so like me and yet not a bit prince
nicholas was taken in-actually thorough-
ly taken in he didnt understand me when
i turned up before he thought i was ca-
pricious and being horrid to him he fell in
love with you at first sight
   please your imperial highness said
jenny faintly
   dont call me that for heavens sake
be natural nobody is natural with me
my grandmother never was she believed
in discipline my uncle gabriel is dotty
ive always been on my own-inside of me
if you understand what i mean at least
listen to me i trust you i know you wont
go back on me youre as good as youre
pretty im not good i loathe the life here
-everything about it i loathed the idea of
this marriage-from the first imagine
being engaged to a man youve never
seen but you understand that now-that
is why i can talk to you-thats why i
must talk to you do you know where ive
been tell me straight
   i was told said jenny hesitating
   that id run away with a man with
count saxt
   yes
   well its true the first time i put
them off the scent we hadnt time to get
married and there were other difficulties
so i pretended to come back like a good
girl when i was found and i told them
the count had nothing to do with it but
he had the second time we had laid all
our plans we got married-
   married exclaimed jenny in amaze-
ment
   well we went through a form of mar-
riage my people wouldnt allow it was a
marriage of course i was crazy about
him you see i cant help telling you all
this i must tell some one you know i
suppose that they followed us-monsignor
stellaria my confessor and other people he
employed we were hunted and harried
from place to place but we gave every-
body the slip and got to constantinople
where for the moment we were safe am i
boring you
   oh no said jenny her eyes fixed on
that vivid haggard mysterious face now
quite unlike her own-the face not of a
girl but of a woman at grips with life
   count saxt has deserted me said the
vibrant voice careless even in its naked
misery
   oh gasped jenny
   that was why i was ill-in constan-
tinople it nearly killed me i tell you i
was crazy about him i worshiped him
   but-how could he do such a thing
you were married
   i felt i was married i would never
have looked at another man
   didnt he-love you
   who knows when a man loves or when
he doesnt they got at him-my people
i found out afterward they bought him
thats what men are i gave up my posi-
tion-everything-to go and be his wife
i would have lived in a garret with him
in a slum-anywhere my people said it
was no marriage they bribed him he
took money from them-money to desert
me
  jenny was shocked to the depths of her
being
   how awful she said she forgot the
insolence the harshness the unsympathetic

argosy-allstory weekly
frivolity that the girl displayed she saw
only a woman shamed and humbled she
looked into a naked soul
  the archduchess took a flat locket from
under her dress it was of gold and had
some letters in diamonds on it she opened
it and handed it to jenny
   i was crazy about him she said again
 you dont wonder at it do you
  jenny looked at the mans face it was
not a very young face it was handsome
in a barbers block way-wide liquid eyes
curved lips a silky-looking mustache
rather curly hair a weak insipid-looking
face and the girl loved him passionately
and prince nicholas with his masterful
manly beauty was merely a cypher to her
   what are you going to do jenny
asked
  the archduchess shrugged her shoulders
 he has deserted me he slipped away
without a word leaving a note explaining
things explaining things thats what
men are i would have stood with him
against the world he listens to my peo-
ple the marriage will be annulled my
marriage will be no marriage
   and you will marry prince nicholas
i suppose so if he will have me
she laughed with an indescribable bitter
levity and repeated
  if he will have me
chapter xix
a threat
a month later on a sultry may eve-
ning marcus phare was passing
 charing cross station when he en-
countered jenny devon coming out of the
gates her skin looked whiter than ever
her eyes were full of even sadder questions
she was dressed in deep black
  he took off his hat and held out his
hand saying in his quiet dangerous voice
   i was wondering what had become of
you so youve given up your role as royal
understudy for the moment but i see
etiquette has a hold over you you are in
mourning for the late empress i take it
 i am in mourning for my crippled
brother jenny said coldly
  the mans voice changed to a note of
concern
   oh i am sorry forgive me it was
unpardonable did the poor little chap die
suddenly
   yes-the end was quite sudden he
was at margate everybody thought it
was doing him good then he caught a
cold-and pneumonia he hated the
place she added almost childishly  he
didnt like the open windows he said he
was always cold and now hes dead he
was buried to-day
   look here said phare reading signs
of exhaustion inher voice and manner and
no doubt a certain weakness that might
further his own ends  youre coming to
have some dinner with me i insist youre
tired to death ill take you to a quiet
place why you poor child youre ready
to drop
  he hailed a taxicab and put her into it
it was just about seven oclock he had
been going home to dress and dine at his
club
  jenny did not resist her nerves were
on edge there was thunder in the air she
had eaten nothing since the morning she
felt utterly desolate she had not known
herself how she clung to poor disagreeable
bertie as the one person belonging to her
now she was all alone in the world
  the taxi drove a very short distance and
stopped in front of an old-fashioned restau-
rant that had taken a new lease of life
  they were shot up in a lift to the very
top and entered a large room decorated
like an italian garden on a hilltop with
cleverly painted walls showing beautiful
landscapes and the tideless blue sea below
about the tables were arbors of vine
orange and lemon cunningly lit up
   this place never fills up until supper
time phare said to jenny  you neednt
be afraid if you dont want to be seen
  he ordered a choice little meal a hid-
den orchestra played italian airs some
of the glamour of the south seemed to creep
into the girls weary veins and a good deal
of it was certainly to be heard in marcus
phares voice
   i am lucky to have met you i have
been thinking about you all these weeks
another womans life

i suppose you are an independent young
lady now
   what do you mean she asked
   that your working days are over
   you are wrong i am working very
hard
   as a manikin
   part of the time
   eut not at mme lacours
   no
   that would hardly do-now
  he smiled at her disarmingly his man-
ners were really perfect there was some-
thing oddly attractive too about the mix-
ture of the libertine and the intellectual in
him jenny hated and feared him but she
could not help feeling that charm no
woman could there were not a few wom-
en of the great world who would have been
glad to be in the girls place that night
  he encouraged her to eat and drink
life and animation soon came back to
her she was so young so superbly
healthy neither nervous strain nor sorrow
could long injure her beauty
  when he had lit his cigar he leaned
across the table and said
   i may as well tell you-i know all
about it
   about what
   about the archduchess stephanie
  he turned round and called a waiter ask-
ing him to bring some illustrated papers
he did not speak until they were brought
neither did jenny
  he opened one and gave it to her
  it was a picture of the archduchess and
the archduke gabriel attending a requiem
mass for the late empress in the chapel at
argar castle celebrated by a special emis-
sary of the pope jenny had seen a much
worse printed replica in one of the daily
papers there was also a picture of a mag-
nificent wreath sent by prince nicholas of
galmatia and a snapshot of the prince
taken at some public function while in
england he was fiddling with his tie in
a way he had jenny remembered his do-
ing it when he was with her at the laying
of the foundation stone of the childrens
hospital and when they received the depu-
tation of which her present host was a
member
   the young lady has returned said
phare in a low voice  and so you are
just an ordinary person again miss de-
von
  please mr phare she protested
   you may as well listen to me i told
you in margate i should find out all about
it the archduchess ran away with count
saxt with whom she was infatuated and
you being her double were induced to take
her place she has been abandoned by
saxt and has returned home and no doubt
there has been the devil to pay you and
i are the only outsiders who know this in
the whole world-or so i imagine i as-
sume that the prince was taken in at first
  jenny caught her breath was there any
use in denying the story
   i presume the marriage will take place
in due course phare went on  the se-
cret has been well kept you were on the
spot and i dont suppose nicholas wants
the world to know how he was fooled but
the world would enjoy the story wouldnt
it
  oh gasped jenny
   theres nothing to stop my telling it
  you couldnt do such a cruel thing
   i dont know he played idly with
his coffee spoon his steely blue eyes were
fixed on her flushed face
   mr phare what good could it possibly
do you to make such a scandal what
have they done to you the poor empress
is dead you would drag her name into it
too you would ruin the archduchesss
life and the princes
   it would not do me the least bit of
good in the world he answered frankly
 unless it helped me to win you for my
wife
  it could never do that her breath
came in gusts of indignation
   are you sure why wont you be sen-
sible i dont know whether youve fallen
in love with the prince but you cant pos-
sibly marry him do you want to go on
slaving all your youth for a few shillings
a week wearing yourself out i can give
you nearly everything in the world you
would be one of its richest women you
are wonderful much more than beautiful
you have power over men you werent

argosy-allstory weekly
out of place in argar castle you certain-
ly wouldnt be in my houses im quite
frank at first i wasnt sure but now i
know that i want to marry you
   but i dont want to marry you mr
phare said jenny stiff and distant al-
though her heart was thumping with fright
   well perhaps this knowledge of mine
will help you to change your mind
   but you couldnt be so cruel as to do
it besides who would believe you
   i think i could prove it and any-
how royalties cant afford even rumors
they have all to be like casars wife
   oh but you couldnt do such a thing
   why not
  he looked at her with his disturbing
covetous gaze then he smiled
   im not going to be in a great hurry
ill give you time ill say nothing more
for a week or two you can think it over
only-dont try to escape from me to hide
because it wont be any good and now tell
me all about yourself
  jenny kept a brave front she talked in
an ordinary way the man took stock of
her following his own train of thought
making his own deductions
  when he saw her into a cab his eyes
pierced her with their blue fire his quiet
voice seemed to take possession of her
   you are a wonder theres nobody
like you in the whole world youre a
woman who cant be bought with money
youve done all youve done for these peo-
ple at argar castle and youve never got
anything out of it
  he shut the door of the cab and gave
the driver her address
  then he leaned through the window
again and said more quietly still
   little jenny all women have a price
i must find out yours
chapter xx
a gentleman to see you
jenny earned less money than at mme
lacours but she was of course better
off because of poor berties death
  she had found a post in a big knights-
bridge shop she felt easier among a crowd
of other young women it was a temporary
post for the season
  she did not attract much attention per-
haps her looks had fallen off a little per-
haps her eyes were too sad and her mouth
never showed its gay enchantment but
she still walked like a spring day and as
a manikin there could be no fault to find
with her
  her heart was not in her work she
could not concentrate on this life the life
of argar castle strangely enough seemed
much more real it was not that she cared
for the luxury and splendor of it it was
the prince of course reality had gone
out of her life with him daily hourly
she pined for him wherever he was hating
and despising her for a heartless fraud
what phare said was true she had some-
thing more than beauty he called it
power over men but it was really one
mans power over her
  that she had changed in this short time
was clearly proved to her one day when
she met linette gurney in the street of
course she had changed the way of doing
her hair again and there was no make-up
on her face but it was something more
than that
  linette was very pleased to see her dear
miss devon and told her about her visit
to argar castle and raved about the arch-
duchess never dreaming that the girl she
was talking to was the very unapproachable
princess she had so humbly admired
   i think you really are a bit like her
miss devon she said dubiously but
that was all
  and thinking of stephanie jenny real-
ized that she too had changed in the short
time she was not the girl of the meet nor
the girl whose photograph prince nicholas
had seen before he came to england
womanhood looked out of her eyes the ex-
cited hollow dark-ringed eyes of the girl
who said she had been  crazy  about a
man
  the next day was sunday jenny went
for a long walk in regents park in the
morning she had promised to dine with
marcus phare she didnt want to but
she could hardly help herself she was so
afraid of what he might do he had said
another womans life

it was no good her hiding and she knew
it twice she had dreamed that he had
published the truth from the housetops
and that prince nicholas was the laughing
stock of europe in one of the dreams the
archduchess stephanie committed suicide
jenny had hardly touched her food that
day
  phare had written and asked her to dine
a very kind letter without a hint of a
threat it frightened her all the more
  she came back from her walk uncon-
sciously rested and soothed by the beauty
of the trees and flowers in the park she
looked radiant black suited her the
empresss pearls glistened on her white
neck she wore them finding everybody
thought them artificial
  her landlady met her at the door
   a gentleman to see you miss devon
luckily mme glorias away for the week-
end so i showed him into the drawing-
room
  jennys heart sank it could only be
phare why had he come at such a time
when they were to meet in the evening
he must have something disagreeable to
say
   what name she asked
   he didnt give none but he said he
was sure youd see him such a handsome
young gentleman oh there my joints
burning  she shuffled off toward the base-
ment stairs  let me know if youre ask-
ing the gentleman to stay to dinner miss
devon she called back
  jennys heart pounded as she went up
to the first floor a handsome young gen-
tleman
  she opened the door she was half pre-
pared but her breath failed her and she
thought she was going to faint
  prince nicholas stood with his back to
the marble mantelpiece he looked-he
looked a prince to jennys eyes he filled
that commonplace bloomsbury room with
tight and glory
  she could not speak she stood there
swaying a little
  he came over and shut the door behind
her
  they looked at each other he was not
smiling but his eyes were alight
 jenny felt like somebody drowning in
 happiness-the happiness just of seeing him
 there she had never expected to see him
 again in all her life
 nicholas walked back to the fireplace
 he did not offer his hand still he did not
 smile
  how do you do he said convention-
 ally
  you-you are here murmured jenny
  i have come to see you
  how did you find me
  i made the baroness luini give me your
 address
  i wonder she did
  she had to his mouth was grim
 he came nearer to her
  she told me your name is devon
  yes jenny devon
  what a pretty name his eyes were
 accusing  why did you do it the
 baroness told me you would not take money
 why did you deceive me like that
  i dont know she answered  the
 baroness implored me to they were in
 a terrible state i dont think i quite un-
 derstood she talked of a terrible scandal
 she said i was the only person who could
 save them
  and the second time he asked
  why did you do it the second time
  oh-i dont know i cant tell you-
 really i refused i refused point blank
 i felt i couldnt do it again
  but after all you did
 after alli did
 there was just a hint of melting about
 his face
  and the third time why did you do
 it then
 this she could answer
  because the empress made me prom-
 ise she was on her death bed she made
 me promise to stay until the archduchess
 came back i couldnt resist her she
 died i didnt know what to do
 he came quite close to her his eyes
 looked as if a fire had suddenly been lit
 in them
  did you never think of me didnt
 you know it was wrong
  of course i did she whispered
  but you didnt care

argosy-allstory weekly
   of course-i cared i knew you would
hate me-when you found out
  you did think of me-then his
voice was low it was warm and caressing
again  when you came back-did you
think of me
  his hands were on her shoulders he
pulled her toward him she was helpless
under the fire in his eyes he drew her
very soul out of her body
  i-i only thought of you she
breathed
  his lips were on hers on her neck on
her hair on her eyes she found herself
sobbing wildly
   my love my little love you have told
me everything nicholas said he was
transformed ardent passionate triumph-
ant  you love me you are just what i
knew you were-the most wonderful girl
in the world
  he held her so close that she could hard-
ly breathe such happiness she had never
dreamed of it was so strangely delicious-
ly made up of both peace and violence it
was like coming from a dark rugged val-
ley in one blinding moment onto a hilltop
swimming in golden sunshine
  she remained in a breathless ecstasy un-
til at last he released her then she shiv-
ered with the icy chill of memory of reality
  tell me you love me jenny the
warm voice pleaded
   i mustnt she said struggling to col-
lect herself  how can i it was all-all
untrue you are a prince and i am a
little manikin how can we love each
other you are going to marry the arch-
duchess stephanie
  he gave a short angry laugh
   nothing in this world he cried  will
induce me to marry the archduchess
stephanie
chapter xxi
a parting
arent you playing rather a danger-
ous game
marcus phare spoke to jenny
devon over the dinner table that same
night
  it was a large fashionable restaurant
phare had proposed it and jenny had
agreed thinking she was more lost in a
crowd
  the soft night air came in through open
windows from the river on the table
creamy yellow roses lay around a bowl of
lilies of the valley the lights were golden
shaded jenny wore a thin black frock
the top was transparent and showed black
velvet ribbons over her white shoulders
a wired black lace headdress half toque
half cap covered her corn colored hair with
a quaint bunch of ribbons hanging down
one side the empresss pearls completed
the toilet
  her eyes were dreamy her face was
brushed over with the magic of love to
the mans jealous eyes she was quite obvi-
ously in another world
  his question brought her back to this
one quickly enough
   what do you mean she asked
   i saw you this afternoon at the old
road house near st albans having tea
with prince nicholas of galmatia
  you saw me she said in a distressed
voice  i did not see you
   quite obviously he retorted  you
saw nothing and no one but his royal high-
ness i think it is a dangerous game i
dont think any one else happened to recog-
nize him but they might have done
  the waiter was changing plates and
dishes jenny was silent while phare made
a few trivial remarks
  her thoughts were back in the afternoon
he had seen them it had been wrong of
her to go with nicholas she knew it
but she could not help herself he had
carried her off saying he could not talk
to her in that stuffy room on such a lovely
day it was immediately after he declared
that nothing would induce him to marry
the archduchess he said they would not
talk about her any more or about argar
castle or about anything that was past
but only about themselves and his man-
ner had changed he became his old
merry frivolous irresistible self the mas-
terful light hearted beautiful young man
who had taken possession of her on their
very first meeting
another womans life

  she protested that they might be seen
when he suggested taking a taxicab out into
the country and having tea somewhere he
said nobody knew him he was incognito
staying at the embassy the ambassador
was old and nearly blind the secretaries
were excellent fellows there was no wom-
an in the establishment his excellency be-
ing a widower he came and went as he
pleased he had come over especially to
see her to find her out ostensibly of
course it was a private visit in order to
see his fiancee
  jenny went with him the afternoon
was a blur of delirious happiness all un-
pleasantness was forgotten he had for-
given her he was assured that she loved
him he assured her that he would never
love any other woman they might have
been any boy and girl together on a perfect
early summer day
  the hours sped and they drove back
jenny in a dream when she reached her
room she had barely time to change to go
to dinner she had to go now more than
ever although she hated it more than ever
too but the idea of the fraud practiced
on prince nicholas being revealed to the
world was intolerable she simply had to
keep in touch with marcus phare
  and marcus phare had seen them
  the appetizing odor of the  chicken
maryland  on her plate rose unheeded to
her nostrils
  phare plying his knife and fork smiled
at her
   i had to tell you he said in a con-
ciliatory voice  candidly isnt it danger-
ous a nice titbit for any scurrilous news-
paper-prince nicholas of galmatia having
tea with the double of the archduchess
whom he leaves pining in her castle
  jenny looked at him in a helpless rage
she had no answer
  his manner grew almost paternal
   youre very young jenny wont you
believe that i am your friend what good
can come of such meetings granted that
you and the prince fell in love-what can
come of it what can he offer you noth-
ing-honorable
  she kept her eyes on her plate making
a pretense to eat
   i am naturally concerned he went on
 i want you to be my wife i want to
keep you from anything that can harm
you
  what do you mean why are you
saying this she was so disturbed that
she nearly choked over the words
  he poured some mineral water into her
glass
   drink that by gad you look pretty
even when you choke my dear i want
nothing but to warn you of danger the
prince is a very good looking young man
he has had his head turned ever since he
was a lad and he isnt at all likely to be
particular in his conduct toward a girl like
you forgive the apparent harshness but
one must look facts in the face what
could you be to him
  jenny could not speak she was afraid
of bursting into tears
   do face the truth urged the quiet
voice  prince nicholas will marry the
archduchess and amuse himself with other
women i dont want you to be one of
the-other women
  jenny could have killed him for speaking
in this ugly way of her beloved she was
so angry that she became childish
   i think you are impertinent and hor-
rible  she said fiercely  i hate you 
   i hope that mood wont last he an-
swered  its a very unfair one any true
friend of yours would tell you the same
thing
  that was the hideous part of it he was
right
   but im not going to worry you any
more now he went on  do lets be pally
and have a nice time youre eating noth-
ing let me peel you this peach
  later he saw her into a cab she would
not let him drive her home she was so
firm about it that he did not insist
   youve never looked more lovely than
you do to-night he whispered as they
crossed the pavement together  i am
giving you time i am very patient you
must admit that
  the next day nicholas wrote to jenny
saying that he was coming to call for her
to dine with him at an out-of-the-way cafe

argosy-allstory weekly
in soho-a place he assured her that hard-
ly anybody knew but the small italian
shopkeepers of that region
  mme gloria was back jenny could not
have the use of her room she could not
see the prince in her own all the others
were occupied
  she must see him it was to be for the
last time what was she to do she went
  again it was like a dream being there in
that funny little half underground place
with the sanded floor and all the rows of
colored bottles behind the desk of the smil-
ing swarthy  padrona they ate smoking
dishes of macaroni she and this gay boy so
handsome that he delighted all the habitues
foreigners every one talking to them in
their own language smiling laughing heart-
ily snatching the guitar from the hands of
a musician to show him how a passage was
to be played humming in a rich warm
tenor voice a tune that he wanted them to
learn
  to jenny it was paradise like nothing
she had ever known or dreamed of as
he played the instrument nicholas tossed
his head and his brown hair became untidy
and fell in a thick lock over his forehead
like that he was more iresistible than ever
he insisted on her drinking some red wine
and he toasted everybody and everybody
toasted them  il bello signorino e sua bel-
lisisma ragazza he translated it to jen-
ny  the beautiful young man and his
most beautiful girl 
  all things have an end
  out in the street nicholas proposed they
should walk back to her lodgings he fell
into silence as they walked pulling her arm
into his and holding it tight
  under the great shadow of the british
museum soft and majestic in the moon-
light as some mighty greek temple jenny
made the little set speech that she had been
preparing all day
   prince nicholas i am very sorry but
i cannot see you again
   jenny why he asked almost roughly
 i must not please you must under-
stand you are a prince
  worse luck jenny for that reason
am i to have no happiness
  you must understand she persisted
 i-i cant bear it
   you mean that you love me
   yes
   i think i do understand he said after
a pause in a low discouraged voice  i
jove you too much jenny we love each
other too much
   thats it i knew you would under-
stand its too good to be with you to
see you to go about like this its too
beautiful and its no good
  he did not speak she could hear his
quick rebellious breath
  in her ears rang phares quiet warn-
ing voice  i dont want you to be one of
the-other women
  in desperation feeling that she must con-
vince him she said brokenly
   what is the good of our loving each
other what can i be in your life
  he caught her close to him with one arm
still walking they came to her doorway
   i know he said and his voice sounded
like a miserable boys  you can be noth-
ing in my life-that i want you to be
they made their sad little pact tears
were streaming down her cheeks he kissed
her-only once it was farewell his last
words as she put her key in the lock were
a pretty foreign sounding little sentence
 i leave my heart with you

in addition to the start of the new hopalong cassidy series there will
be the opening chapters of homer eon flints  out of the moon a
striking five-part serial and crab reef a complete novelette of
extraordinary adventures by theodore goodridge roberts
in the dying light of day the broad acres
of armand gauthier lay smugly content
under the mellowness of the hour father
brisson diverting himself and pleasing his
host claude deboissv-with whom he was
making an overnight visit-by inspecting a
new pair of field glasses of deboissys pur-
chase focused them upon these acres on the
farther slope of the valley his mood in-
duced a new appraisement he had always
rather liked the place now he became
confirmed in a recent vague suspicion of
smugness
  a house roomy built of stone straddled
a slight rise and was approached by a trim
graveled walk bordered with whitewashed
stones and flaming red geraniums lawn
and flower beds in front primly laid out
a market garden to one side a flower gar-
den with fruit trees behind fenced off
spreading on four sides away from the rise
fields of wheat of barley of com of hay
of everything that repaid cultivation under
the hands of the hired men and the sons-
in-law of m gauthier and in the lush
pasture lands sloping toward the river
sleek mild eyed cattle-jerseys in the
smaller field to the left just a few black
and white holsteins dominating the larger
area to the right armand himself discern-
ible when the focus was properly estab-
lished smoking a long pipe in the ruddy
light and looking upon his work with the
satisfied air of a man who found it good
  the priest watching saw the man turn
to the north to the south to the west gaz-
ing long in each direction he was not
at a loss for interpretation bordering the
actual acres upon which the useful tithes of
armand gauthier were assessed were the
strips of land that had once belonged
to the holding upon these strips white
houses stanch houses nestled cozily satis-
fied self-sufficient places even to the wisps

of smoke rising virtuously to heaven at this
very minute three wisps across the north-
ern fields three across the southern men
might say-and did-that m gauthier did
well in supplanting the sons of his desire
with the sons-in-law that his daughters
brought him but they must admit that the
sons-in-law did fairly by the deal to each
was there not a girl as sleek and plump and
pleasing as any in the country a house
with its strip of ground a horse and rig and
a share cooperatively in the agricultural
efforts and results of m gauthier himself
what more could son-in-law ask yes or
daughter six of them already so estab-
lished matrimonially and well content with
it and every one by now channels of early
grandparentage for armand gauthier
  there remained the seventh gabrielle
the youngest and so the last for armand
believed in an almost mechanical orderli-
ness it was doubtless at thought of her
that her father looked to the west and ap-
proved-m le cure was certain-the sev-
enth white house its new starkness unre-
lieved by vines ready and furnished com-
plete for immediate occupancy father
brisson detected too a white figure sepa-
rated from the man by greenery but gazing
also into the west
    she is looking at the house he has built
for her and rene said the priest with a
catch at his heart
  in this he was mistaken
   a train whistled its blaring tone softened
by distance into music with glasses one
could see even the flashing streak of the
windows flame colored it wound its way
along the valley following the course of the
stream losing itself in the dark greenery of
the pine woods through which it must pass
to the station leaving behind its trail of
smoke shot through with sunset gold drift-
ing lazily attaining an ethereal loveliness as
it faded into a turquoise sky
  m gauthier cupped his hands to his
mouth and called
  the priest could imagine its exact sound
commanding yet mingling paternal right
with tenderness on the second call the girl
started as from a dream and turning came
toward him how different was her slender-
ness when one thought of the sturdy sisters
six already safely married the one most
like in every way her dead mother the one
least able as armand declared boomingly
when first the curd timidly raised the point
to endure the hardships life-elsewhere-
might offer
  m gauthier drew his seventh daughter to
him and kissed her then he motioned to-
ward the house rather imperiously and pre-
ceded himself rubbing his hands to-night
would be a great one at the gauthier farm-
house never had he failed on the eve of
a daughters wedding to give a grand
soiree he loved these occasions it pleased
his emotional palate that many should come
to the feast of his bounty envy his pros-
perity and mark well his success in life
  gabrielle remained for a moment outside
the train whistled again for the station
the last faint touch of smoke vanished a
married sister appeared at the door im-
patiently gabrielle hastened in obe-
diently
  it meant nothing to the priest that the
window of gabrielles room which faced
toward the station held in its narrow in-
closure a lamp whose rays for the moment
offered but feeble competition to the sunset
glow that burnished the glass and metal
with a ruddy light perhaps the priests
line of vision did not permit it or again the
ordinariness of a light in a window aroused
no suspicion it may be also that he was
too deeply engaged in the matter of prayer
to notice
ii
  m gauthier himself admitted frankly
that his soiree was a huge success he made
this clear to m le cure and to his friend
deboissy-whose opinions he respected and
who were courteous in their confirmation at
no expense to the truth was not m
lafond from st paradis there to lend
quality and talk of politics of crops of
financial affairs so vast that the habitants
sat pop-eyed as one might say was not
old sansfaqon there to crack musty jokes
about the matrimonial estate and enable
m gauthier to show his democratic good
humor in booming laughter that outdid the
timid cackles of the lesser folk
  add to this the six married daughters
the seventh son-in-law

displaying themselves in new dresses that
showed off their generous forms and their
cooking in dishes of the most striking pat-
tern and expensive ware ever seen in ste
marie-en-bas and the six sons in law-
stanch solid fellows in vivid black suits
white ties and watch chains of heavy gold
in their vests golden chains binding them
to the donor their father-in-law every one
of the six hallmarked with the smug con-
tentment of the gauthier acres and gau-
thier cattle and gauthier houses and gau-
thier customs
  ah yes-and gabrielle was there ga-
brielle amazingly attractive in a gown she
had chosen at her fathers insistence
specially for this prenuptial event ga-
brielle never more beautiful-for her re-
cent pallor that had rendered him uneasy
gave place to-night to rich colorings when
any spoke to her or looked at her steadily
most of all armand himself who could not
look enough
  rene constant was there of course a
secondary but brilliant star rene so
debonair with such a carriage as only a
son of that old aristocrat beaudet con-
stant could have-the best declared m
gauthier by his faith and every saint of
all the seven matches his diplomacy and
shrewdness had effected
  m le cure stood in a little alcove watch-
ing chin cupped in hand there was no
more striking figure present than he and
none less conscious of it the slight stoop
of age did not detract nor did his com-
paratively small stature he stood there in
his black robes his face limned with the
voluntary servitude of years that found him
faithful by day and night alike his mouth
rebelling as the years had fled from its first
firm-set line until the wrinkled corners were
distilleries of tempered sunlight and his
eyes deep pools of blue their surfaces ruf-
fled by breezes more wistful than gay
  just now though there was a set stern
look his steady gaze was on rene con-
stant whose eyes whenever they met the
priests as they seemed to at every turn
held in order evasion fear bravado bold-
ness the latter triumphing so that in the
end renes voice was heard above all in
laughter and light badinage
  father brisson felt a heavy hand on his
shoulder a voice boomed in his ear
   well father admit you are wrong for
once and that my choice of a son-in-law
is good i ask you is there a more gallant
young fellow or a keener wit in the place
to-night-hey
  the priest did not smile he simply
said  i am fond of your daughter ga-
brielle-very fond
   which reminds me said m gauthier
glancing hastily about  i have missed the
little minx this last while i wonder now-
she is such an odd girl and not like my
others it was of indifference to her if
we had this event or not i wonder- did
you see her go out father i have known
the minx to escape as she would say it
that way before
  he glanced toward the door that led to
the garden
    is it not more likely said father bris-
son  that a young girl should be showing
her wedding finery to her intimates at such
a time i saw mile adrien and others go-
ing above
  ah true of course cried armand
gauthier satisfied rubbing his hands
again his lips as expressive as a cats
that has tasted cream  such a trousseau
as that girl has though and such an odd
girl one would think such things were
bought every day
  he lifted his hands appealingly as if
calling on heaven to bear witness it was
beyond him and moved off to indulge in his
democratic booming with the lesser folk
  the priest stood statuesque his eyes
were pools of light his fingers clenched
and unclenched his mouth was at once
very stern and very tender the pools of
light darkened as he stood there after a
time he slipped quietly out into the star-
lit night by the same door through which
his observant eyes had not long since seen
gabrielle make her escape
iii
  the night was very dark but by con-
trast the stars seemed very near at hand
the season being well advanced the august
night was quite chilly and father brisson

argosy-allstory weekly
concerned with the chill discovered himself
in the gateway of the garden before he knew
it a gate that with its attendant fence
protected green growing things for personal
and special uses of the farmhouse against
the depredations of domestic animals and
rabbits from the field and woods a sus-
picion which seemed more than that to
him was his that something was amiss and
that his duty led him to the protection of
the girl gabrielle-in this at least where
elsewhere he must fail
  as if in answer to unspoken prayer the
form of gabrielle grew in the darkness be-
fore him and he took a pace backward as
one might before a vision then reality was
restored-to be quickly lost again above
the stars dimmed a little that a new glory
might appear from a pillar of light in the
north cloudy battalions came flashing their
spears through the sky advancing retreat-
ing in incredible maneuvers and now the
spears no longer flashed but disintegrated
into cascades of light-fairylike waterfalls
of boreas dropping into elusive pools
above which drifted silver clouds of mist
  the girl stood for a moment hands
clasped in ecstasy then moved farther into
the garden with silent step a mans form
showed quite clearly just ahead he stood
hands clasped behind him legs a little
apart firmly balanced on the turf head
uptilted motionless watching the sky into
its ethereal beauty came again a piercing of
blue flashing spears-a yet colder blue
darting earthward then withdrawing
   par dieu he said quite reverently
  a twig crackled under her foot he
turned swiftly to greet her taking her
small hands in his great ones
   gabrielle
   philippe
  father brisson caught his breath sharp-
ly in his eavesdropping course and a little
pulse within him sang
   gabrielle philippe frigon said at last
 all wonders such as that have brought you
to me-all things of beauty tore my heart
i think because of you he hesitated
 have you no greater welcome for me
gabrielle he rushed on impetuously
then  was it a dream then-just one
of many such-that when i sent word by
jean lafontaine who was hitting the trail
for home that i was coming soon if all
went well he came back after two months
trip to our far post to say if i came to
come by the twentieth at the latest as i-
loved you-
  she broke in faintly  it was an impulse
philippe the good god forgive me but i
wanted to see you-
   and i am here he said a little grim-
ly  i will not complain gabrielle that
the trail was hard or the way long or that
the brief harvest must be left to other hands
to gather these would not matter they
mattered not because of what lay ahead-
your welcome-you ah gabrielle what
does it all mean montpetit at the station
grabs my arm as soon as i arrive just now
by traveling day and night the last forty-
eight hours to railroad  it is well he said
to go easy philippe she bade me tell you
if you saw a light in her window to come
then to the garden more than that he
would not say leaving it he said for your
lips is it your father gabrielle i know
he never cared for me and insulted me
grievously at last but i am not afraid of
that if it is for your happiness
  father brisson though his was no ear for
gossip was not unmindful of such history
of gabrielles affair with frigon as had
leaked out it was common knowledge that
at mention of his desire to pay court to his
daughter-a rather belated mention per-
haps-armand gauthier had ordered phil-
ippe out with a tongue that having brought
blood to the lads face drove it from him
again and left him with a white high pride
which he took with him out into the night
gabrielle had run to him it was said and he
had stood there arms folded at sight of her
to say
   he is unfair i am no neer-do-well
and he knows it your kind are not mine
yours follow and live fat on the lands we
make for them my father was here with
the first and after the trees were felled and
the stumps out and the roads easy for
travel your father came in and settled
down in comfort to reap but the spirit
of my father drove him farther on to the
hard things again is it anything against
my character that his blood flows in my
the seventh son-in-law

veins and that something at least of his
spirit is mine
  then so the tale was told she had for-
gotten maidenly reserve and pleaded with
him not to be angered above all not to go
and suddenly he had drawn her to him and
told her  i will go and when i have made
a home for you i will come for you  and
she had watched his tall form striding down
the gravel path where the moonlight lay
bright upon the whitened stones
  a message came from him that he had
reached the goal whither his pioneering
spirit led him days became months and
months-twenty-four of them-marked the
passage of two years and yet he did not
come and though her sisters and others
began to scoff memory remained true
  life was like the soil and the growth of
things she knew so well one sowed and one
reaped in kind she had sowed in that
moment when his arms received her and
his promise was in her ears comfortingly
and always because of this there would be
a harvest of memory twice since that
first direct message word of philippe had
come from outside sources filtering from his
northern outpost but none direct from him
  her father began to bring pressure-her
father her sisters and others and not
least of all rene constant who had a way
with him where women were concerned
there came a time when-she having heard
from a man who had himself seen philippe
and reported him doing well and yet no
word had come-she had no spirit left to
defy them and most of all her father so
greatly wishing this thing of her he had
his way and rene began to be much with
her and folk nodded their heads approving
her wisdom at last
  father brisson having remembrance of
this history found himself in a most as-
siduous eavesdropping just now lest he miss
her answer
   ah philippe she said sadly  it is
too late
   too late no no-the twentieth you
said and i have traveled almost day and
night
  she held out her hand warningly as he
would have drawn nearer
   to-morrow she said simply  to-mor-
row morning i marry rene constant it is
wrong that i even see you this way to-night
i should not have sent that message by
jean lafontaine for it was too late then
but my heart cried out to do it and when i
came to myself jean had already gone
yet i said you would not come for how
could you care for me still when you sent
no word in all these many months
   no word he started  each time
young bruneau went to the railhead which
was quite often for he had attraction there
he took my letters and brought me mine
i wondered at the little i had in reply
  gabrielle whitened
   in months i have not heard till this
last message she said despairingly
  philippe swore softly
   fool that i am he declared  bru-
neau is a bosom friend of this man rene
constant who always liked you and i
doubt not he fancied to do him friendly
service i think that mail was never post-
ed despair changed to exultation  it
is not too late my gabrielle-for have i
not come in time to-morrow morning is
not due for hours ah look look
  from a pale lake of light in the north
there was reared in the sky what was not
unlike an arch through which if one had
imagination the wraithlike wisps passing by
might have been fairies dancing in unearth-
ly beauty quickly to pass away
   it is an omen said philippe gravely
 the spirits of the northland i like to call
them i have seen them so before they
always bring me good fortune up there
on frosty nights i have seen them like the
stars so close one could think to pluck
them out by a reaching of the hand and
their very voices can be heard ah-per-
haps i am too fanciful but it is very
wonderful in the great spaces gabrielle
when the world is so silent and one feels-
alone with two there it would be won-
der-without loneliness if the other-un-
derstood
  she was silent he put his hand out
and touched her
   you are shivering child he said and
as the silence came again he placed his own
interpretation upon it  you are think-
ing of the hardships perhaps-the long

argosy-allstory weekly
cold winters the short summers the great
distances the solitude the scarcities i
would not make light of them gabrielle
you have heard of these things-and it is
true he waited she did not speak he
turned away  i could only have prayed
that you might have loved the very bigness
of it all perhaps i expect of others that
which is in my inheritance of blood alone
i ask too much
  then she who had set signal within her
narrow window place night after night of
late with little faith that he would come
to open the door for her escape from the
fate that awaited her in rhe seventh white
house seeing the door now open closed it
tight again taking advantage of his certain
misinterpretation
   alas philippe she said sadly  if
you only knew how much you ask
  her voice broke on the last word and
he turned swiftly to her it seemed to the
old man still watching almost grimly-for
his ethical side was sensitive-that for the
moment a magnetism greater than all bar-
riers held them drew them-drew them-
his lips moved in prayer a voice
boomed impatiently through the night
 gabrielle
   i must go in said the girl quickly
 i have been out too long now and they
have missed me
  a door banged a twig crackled under-
foot near them philippe sprang back
  come whispered ihe cure taking
gabrielles arm  come-your father is
seeking you and will be angry if he finds
you thus
  she suffered herself to be led away the
voice they had heard boomed again
 gabrielle-gabrielle
   we will go around by the front said
the priest hastily in the last of the cover-
ing darkness she took his arm
   father you will keep this that you
have seen secret you will do nothing to
hurt him much of my happiness is in
your hands now father
he started then said slowly almost me-
chanically  i must do my duty child
she shivered and moved from him as
from an enemy when she looked back
after they parted in the lighted doorway
he was still gazing after her but it was
in his face and features that the greatest
agony lay
iv
  the priest in fact watched her long
after she ceased to be conscious of his re-
gard then gayety flooding past him drew
him into a laughing group of young folk
and he must needs laugh with them
  father brisson was an unusual man
reared in the spartan simplicity of a home
that dedicated him to the priesthood and
that gave him-at a time when his labor
would have helped eke out a scant ex-
istence on a rocky farm-to an education
that involved direct financial sacrifice a
studious lad who won by conscientious
plodding what he could not have had by
any brilliance that was his he brought to
his life ministry in this country parish a
rigorous personal code and a simplicity of
outlook in which the quiet of rural life con-
firmed him birth he knew and blessed
death he knew and hallowed but of life
itself more the gentler side than otherwise
for his confessional yielded up few secrets
other than the ordinary shortcomings of
average lives
  almost upon the fingers of one hand he
could count the other times the revelations
that had sent him home sick at heart hor-
rified at the depths of human depravity to
fall upon his knees and pray his god that
the absolution he had granted for spoken
penitence might have more content of real-
ity than it had of his own priestly faith
this worried him not a little for he was a
sincere believer in the priestly office and
he had perforce to hug the thing to his own
bosom
  he would have cut off his right hand
rather than by word or hint or inflection
broken the sacred seal of the confessional
the little portion of the mercy seat over
which according to his belief he presided
  the music and the merrymaking grew in
volume where ordinarily his simple soul
would have rejoiced to see happiness so
expressed to-night the very scrape of the
violins tortured him he went out again
into the darkness passed silently through
the garden gate his black robe-that would
                         	a
the seventh son-in-law

soon be quite green did his conscience not
permit the extravagance of a new one-
brushed the bushes with a sighing sibilance
  he called softly  frigon philippe
frigon
  save for small insect noises there was
silence for a moment then a figure ap-
peared beside him
   ah i fancied you would still be here
son said the priest going right to the
heart of his subject  forgive me-but
you love gabrielle
   would a man come through better than
a hundred miles of bush otherwise father
 then protested the cure eagerly
 you will not lack persistence and daring
to see it through he added with embar-
rassment at his impulsiveness  you have
come to take her away-even now you
will marry her and take her away and be
goodto her
  philippes gaze was toward the north
where a pale aftermath of light still lin-
gered
   why do you ask
   because i care for her my son
   and you would send her to hardships
few women willingly endure
   far better my son far better cried
father brisson more eagerly than he knew
 you will not fail her
  philippe stared
   your reasons father
  the priests eagerness died he said
hastily
   n-nothing my son no reasons i
can give you in as many words you must
trust me
  philippe swung sharply upon him
   listen he said  there was a wom-
an up in the place from which i come who
threw herself in the river because the soli-
tude and the bigness of things preyed on
her nerves there was another she died
in childbirth because there was no medical
aid to be had in time for complications
with my own hands father i have made a
place for gabrielle cleared as fine a lot as
any built for her a house not far from
neighbors since i have learned of these
cases-these unfortunate women you see
my difficulty apart from this i have not a
sou to offer even if i were to force myself
 	a
to settle down and try to appear happy
here with her own lips she confirms my
fears i ask too much i would never
forgive myself if i forced my love upon her
better i should never trouble her this
rene constant is of her kind with him her
way will be smooth and easy under the
eye of old gauthier himself with me-
he shrugged his big shoulders  in the
morning i shall return north father it is
better so
   my son  called the priest urgently
  philippe turned unwillingly
   well
   you do not understand the case fully
 nor you father the thing you would
have her face in spite of her fears
   ah but not worse than-
   than what why do you stop
   than-unhappiness with him
   she does not fear this unhappiness evi-
dently as much as that the life i offer prom-
ises he spoke bitterly now ending with
a quick question  have you anything
special against him-his character father
that might be different if so speak-if
not-what right have i to interfere fur-
ther
  the priest was silent his head was
bowed
   i have nothing to say philippe
frigon shrugged his shoulders wearily
and the darkness swallowed him up
father brisson did not call after him this
time his hands reached out in trembling
impotence then dropped helplessly to his
side
   god he said in agony  must i keep
silence must her sweet flesh and spirit
be joined till death with a murderer
v
  father brisson wandering within
again did not could not remain long
where the riot of sound within brought
added confusion of thought and the sight
of rene claiming a dance that put his bride
of the morrow into his arms stirred a mad-
ness in his pulse the out-of-doors breath-
ing a great calmness made a background
against w-hich one might range a more or-
derly foreground of reflection

argosy-allstory weekly
  the priest checked back his actions his
results his prospects his actions remon-
strance with rene constant blocked by his
own sensitiveness in the matter of the con-
fessional and by the combined refusal of
rene to accept such delicate hints as the
old mans ethics would permit him to give
and a sneering bravado illy covered long
talks with armand gauthier in which the
cure came more than once to the very verge
of breaking the seal irritated at the obdu-
racy of the man attempts in less direct
ways now his failure with philippe frigon
his results nil his prospects in ga-
brielle herself
  ah from that he had so far kept telling
himself if he could not-as deboissy would
phrase it-put all his cards on the table to
hint at things might the rather drive her to
the man constant who admittedly had
magnetism of a kind and a telling tongue
young girls were like that he had tried
it once before with anne perechon whose
protective instinct and interest for a man
he had aroused to her own hurt who came
seldom to mass never to confession and
lived an unhappy life with a man unworthy
of the loyalty she gave bearing her lot
proudly in a defiance that flashed through
the hurt soul of her whenever she chanced
to meet the priest
  no-that was not the way her rela-
tions with philippe frigon then ah that
was his chance he would here await her
coming intuitively he knew she would
slip out again at the first opportunity
  he had not long to wait
  he heard her soft footfall he rustled the
bushes
   philippe she called gently
   it is i-father brisson he told her
approaching  my child i was speaking
to philippe but he has gone
  she gave a little cry half anger then
steadied herself
   you sent him away you are too
hasty father reading peoples actions i
came but to say good-by you know we
have been good friends philippe and i
   only friends when she did not an-
swer he took the plunge  gabrielle
child i feel for you philippe frigon is a
good man his face is a true index as all
faces are not in the morning he goes north
again must he go alone
  she gave a little gasp of surprise
  he added  if i find him for you if i
stand by you both-
  she broke in with a quick remonstrance
 father father you think to be kind but
you are cruel she paused it is not
that i do not like rene-do not misunder-
stand me i do  her voice broke  and
yet my heart-my heart cries out for phib
ippe whose love i may not have
   may not gabrielle
   unless i chose to break my fathers
heart rene is of his kind and choice
and-i have caused him enough of sorrow
already
   sorrow dear child how could you
have brought aught but gladness to him
she did not speak for a moment when
she did she said in a low voice  he loved
my mother dearly when-when i came
i took her from him you know oneclay
my eldest sister emmaline told me being
angered over some childish fault she did
not know how deep she struck my child-
ish heart nearly broke i think with sorrow
for his sorrow he wondered why i stroked
those gray hairs of his so tenderly that
night when i went to my room i knelt
and vowed by st joseph i would bring him
sorrow no more you are wise father and
know life and duty and must understand
tell me what i should do for my heart
pulls so strangely two ways
  an oblong of radiance joined that of the
windows on the garden side of the house
a voice called boomingly again
   go my child said the priest sadly
 your father calls for you
  after she had obeyed the cure dropped
upon his knees regardless of the heavy
dew and his rheumatic joints as he
prayed the northern sky grew brighter once
again and across it drifting masses and
shafts of light were flung slowly the
priests eyes from a devoutly humble pos-
ture facing the earth were lifted to the
firmament the northern lights penetrated
the dark heart of the sky so it seemed a
light soft mellow illuminating stole into
the being of this humble old man stilling
the tumult calming his fears bringing a
the seventh son-in-law

peace that having no foundation of human
reason did indeed pass the understanding
of men
   now the good god be praised cried
father brisson  for as to thy servant of
old thou gavest the damascus vision so to
all who sincerely follow duty thy light shall
come
  he rose from his knees he went in
the party was breaking up with much
merrymaking over the coming of the mid-
night hour and felicitations for the two
who now stood together to receive them
as was the gauthier custom
  the priest found himself caught by the
tradition
   may such happiness as you deserve be
yours he told them
   i will call for you at five thirty in the
morning father rene reminded him
meeting the cures eyes boldly  and drive
you to the church
  father brisson nodded and went out to
join deboissy in the waiting rig as he
took his departure the old gauthier clock
chimed twelve
  the calm of the material universe ush-
ered into a new day in the purpose of its
maker was not deeper than the unexplain-
able quiet in the heart of father brisson
as they drove to deboissys under the stars
vi
  it was the cures first impression when he
woke that gabrielles wedding morn was
to be cloudless yet rising at the first
streakings of dawn after a singularly re-
freshing sleep in which a few hours seemed
to do the merciful work of many he found
that the upland on which the deboissy
home stood enjoyed a clarity of atmosphere
that was lacking below one of the heavy
mists not infrequent in this district in cer-
tain seasons hung over the valley blotting
out the town that would otherwise be clear-
ly seen from here dominated by the spire
whose graceful upreaching was a constant
pride to the cure and under the shadow of
which one might say he had had his abid-
ing place for half a century or more
  father brisson prepared himself with
deliberation for the ceremony in which he
was to play so vital a part with similar
deliberation he took from his little black
bag and from the folds of an intimate gar-
ment a less innocent object this metallic
article he regarded with the subdued con-
cern of a determined man unused to fire-
arms for a moment hesitation overcame
him should he not leave all to a higher
power well-there was that phrase about
 keeping your powder dry he must
neglect nothing he conquered his hesita-
tion and slipped the little weapon into a
pocket of his robe his hand when it was
withdrawn still trembled
  he welcomed the respite afforded pres-
ently by the frugal meal which was all he
permitted his friend to set before him de-
boissys choice of subjects dear to both
their hearts aided greatly he almost for-
got a clock struck the hour
   hullo cried m deboissy  your man
is late isnt he
   perhaps replied father brisson curb-
ing any show of eagerness  perhaps he
will not come something may have hap-
pened-already he left the table and
went to the window overlooking the road
up which rene must arrive to fetch him
  deboissy whispered in his ear  i will
have alphonse drive you
  but no cried father brisson if
it is the will of god he will come if
not-
   the mist is exceptionally heavy said
deboissy
   praise god returned father brisson
in his heart
  ah-look he comes at last
   renes mare is a roan this is jet
black cried the priest his heart sinking
none the less
   true but i have not retained my sight
into age for nothing the beast is black as
satan but the driver is none other than
rene constant he consulted his watch
 with haste you will still be in time
  father brisson bowed his head as if in
acceptance of a decree was not isaac
bound and the knife already upraised
   you are late he greeted rene as he
climbed into the rig  the fog is bad
eh
   it was not that-but why that mare of

argosy-allstory weekly
mine must cast her shoe to-day of all days
beats me it was just past m fournies
establishment and to save time i hurried
in there faith but ntsieu was sleepy and
cross until he knew the urgency then
says the old fellow grinning with all his
yellow teeth  yes but have the horse back
sure by noon for he must draw pierre al-
ard at two thirty to such rest as may be
found in the protestant burial ground
a wedding in the morning and a funeral
in the afternoon what a life he says and
grins again
  rene laughed himself and spat at the
bushes on the roadside
  father brisson fingered the golden cross
that lay against the dark background of his
robe
   god rest his soul he said and sighed
 pierre alard followed his gleam sincerely
and not without purpose-though we dub
him after our fashion a heretic
  rene sheered you are too easy-going
father your heart is far too kindly to-
wards such
   toward those who err in frailty of
flesh in human weakness-not to the de-
liberate evil doer rene
  his eyes were full upon the youth rene
constant turned away and lashed the horse
sharply father brisson rebuked him
   we are late arent we said rene
roughly  and this damned mist is thick
enough to cut
  they drove on in silence the shroud-
ing fog became so closely wrought that even
the black head of m foumies horse was
visible only through drifting swirls
  rene said after a time  i hope the
horse knows the road better than i do
father brissons heart gave a little leap
he had noted this uneasiness and that they
had ascended a rise where the muscles in
the horses flanks stood out  well
laughed rene with his characteristic shrug
 they cannot go ahead without us eh
father what matters an hour or two de-
lay when there remains a whole blissful
lifetime of union
  there was a sneer on his lip that matched
the words father brisson felt the keen-
ness of the thrust he discovered himself
in the act of gripping the metal hidden in
his robe and recoiled trembling as one
awakening from a bad dream
   par dieu swore rene presently  if
this is the right road i am a numskull
what now there is no sharp turn such
as this for the animal had veered sharp-
ly to the left and the wheels crunched over
gravel  whoa there whoa what the
devil now a curse on old foumie and all
his father the black beast has brought
us to the burying ground
  a little breeze springing up sent the fog
in swirls past them curling curiously about
the horses ears as he looked back at his
driver after the mildly questioning manner
of his kind the impenetrability gave
place to misty wreathings that as the fog
began to lift disclosed the nearer rows of
tombstones and monuments about whose
upper parts the fog clung in a likeness to
winding sheets
  the cures heart almost stopped beating
this time his simple direct mind accepted
the thing that had come to pass he knew
now where they had stopped-this small
open square at the entrance to the grave-
yard on it three or four prominent fami-
lies had their lots the bergerons mori-
settes the lafonds the lafonds where
the great monument was
  come up there rene clucked ur-
gently to the horse the animal would not
budge
   to turn said father brisson steady-
ing his voice with effort for he knew now
to an inch where the rig stood- one must
back out and with care the chapel is
directly ahead the beast knows better
than you
   then take the reins since you are ac-
customed here and make haste father
cold sweat stood on the youths face
  the priest accepted the reins but for the
moment they lay idle in his lap his face
was eager his lips moved in a soundless
 the sun dear god the sun and an in-
stant later he rebuked himself for being
overanxious
  the sun suddenly pierced through the
remaining mist father brisson was not
mistaken in his estimate of location trem
bling with ill-controlled emotion he put his
hand on the young mans shoulder yet
the seventh son-in-law

even now his ethical restraint forbade him
and he withdrew it nor did he point to the
thing that was now revealed to their gaze
 immediately opposite them stood the
great monument which family pride and
anger had caused to be so placed that all
who came and went might see upon a
granite pillar an avenging angel was poised
beneath was an inscription boldly cut
sacred to the memory of
emile lafond
  who was foully murdered by an unknown
  hand on the night of july   and who
  is here laid to rest in the assurance that
  justice shall triumph in such a day as god
  wills
    vengeance is mine i will repay saith
  the lord i
  the priest glanced quickly from the in-
scription to the man beside him renes
face was a study his brow was still beaded
with sweat a glow of triumph filled the
old mans being
   shall we go he said calmly  we
are late now for the wedding
  rene did not speak then color began
to flood his face in anger
   you think to frighten me with super-
stitious nonsense  he almost shouted  it
was his life or mine we quarreled and as
it happened he got the worst of it i told
you that before
  a touch of steel flashed in the mild blue
eyes
   in supposed penitence then as to a
priest said father brisson  but now
in evil bravado to-an ordinary citizen
easy now rene i am an old man and
inoffensive but  - the weapon trembling
in his unaccustomed hands as it came from
t	v
his robe caught the sunlight and reflected
it- quick-your hands behind you-so
father brisson clambered into the back
seat of the rig  now you may take the
reins he said
  rene obeyed
   you will drive said father brisson
 under my orders to the town the
mayor will doubtless not mind an inter-
ruption as serious as this to his breakfast
he glanced at his watch  it would be
well he said with a queer little twist of
his mouth  if you could urge m four-
nies beast to a little greater haste the
up-train leaves for the north at nine fifty-
seven and there is the little matter of m
gauthiers seventh son-in-law yet to be ar-
ranged
vii
  it is recorded in town annals that on
the sabbath father brisson preaching
with great eloquence upon  the damascus
vision and its lessons was guilty of an
amazingly long digression in which with
fervor and humility he warned his hearers
against the sin of malice
  had it been any one but father brisson
the length would have been unpardonable
eager as the congregation were for the
church steps and the gossip that would
pounce with avidity upon the subject of
the arrest of rene constant and that would
propound and with great gravity discuss
the question of what would become of the
seventh white house of m gauthiers
building now that his youngest daughter
had gone so suddenly north as the wife of
that estimable young man philippe frigon

 the horror deepens
he breath of death dennis re-
peated awestruck  god save us
whats that are you trying to say
that the french girl is in orbits house
dead
well soon see mccarty shook off
the chinese butlers grip and dashed up
the steps and in at the door with dennis
just behind and ching lee bringing up the
this ttory began in the argosy-alutory weekly for november 
                                                 
rear chanting a weird refrain of lamenta-
tion
   the door of the huge conservatory also
stood wide and its hot humid breath heavy
with fragrance stole out to meet them the
silent organ with slender pipes gleaming
softly like silver birches in moonlight loom-
ing up in the semigloom a group at the
marble bench facing it stood out against
the background of leafy palms and thorny
cacti holding their eyes irresistibly in dread
fascination
annihilation

  orbits tall figure with the bellamy baby
clasped tightly in his arms stood before it
and beside him jean the houseman was
bending forward while little fu moy knelt
at its foot on the bench itself a slender
form lay relaxed as though in sleep the
head with its bright hair rippling from be-
neath the trim little bonnet resting against
the high white stone back the small gloved
hands limply extended at either side
  mccarty halted for an instant and den-
nis crossed himself but ching lee darted
forward and seizing fu moy dragged him
away as though from the mouth of some
unnamable peril then orbit turned his
face white and set and mccarty advanced
to meet him
  thank heaven it is you the nor-
mally resonant well modulated voice was
hoarse and shaken  ching lee thought
he caught a glimpse of you passing and
i told him to rush after you mccarty
look-look at this girl what is this hor-
ror that has come to my house
   is it-dead she is mccartys own
tones were reverently low  how did it
happen what was she doing here
   listening to the organ she was to all
appearances as bright and well as this little
child but when i finished playing and
turned she was as you see her now i
feel as though i were going mad as though
i couldnt credit the evidence of my own
eyes what can this fearful thing mean
 wed better be finding out mr orbit 
mccarty was rapidly recovering from the
first shock and his quick mind leaped to
meet the exigencies of the tragic situation
 denny run next door to goddards and
get the inspector but not a word to any-
body else jean take the little one home
to the other house and tell mrs bellamy
that her nursemaids took sick here but will
be over it in a little while and shes not
to bother understand think you can
put it sos she wont come tearing in here
to make a scene
  jean straightened and nodded not trust-
ing himself to speak his sensitive gallic
face was working but he controlled his
emotions by a valiant effort and took the
baby which his employer held mechanically
out to him little maude broke into a low
wail of dismay at the abrupt transition and
stretched out wavering dimpled arms to
the familiar but strangely inattentive figure
on the bench her sobs echoed back to
them as she was borne quickly from the
room
   now mr orbit what did you do when
you turned from the organ and saw lucette
stretched out like this on the bench mc-
carty began  where was the baby how
did ching lee and jean know that some-
thing was wrong did you call them have
you sent for anybody else
  orbit passed his hand across his forehead
as if dazed and the other noticed that it
came away glistening with moisture
   for the doctor of course he replied
to the last question first  allonby around
on the next block i havent had a physi-
cian for years myself but some of my
neighbors swear by him i told ching lee
to telephone to him as soon as i could make
myself realize that-that she was gone
  a slight shudder ran through him and
he averted his gaze from the rounded child-
ish face relaxed as though in sleep save
that the bright blue eyes were dull and
staring widely at the lofty ceiling
   she wasnt dead then the first glimpse
you had of her after you stopped playing
mccarty himself did not find it easy to con-
tinue with that silent dominant presence
before them
   i dont know-but she must have been
of course she didnt move and there was
no sign of her breath i cant understand
it what frightful thing can have stricken
her
   suppose you tell me from the begin-
ning mccarty restrained his impatience
 how did she and the child come here
    was seated here alone at the organ
improvising as  do when i am disturbed
in mind for this misfortune to little horace
affected me deeply
  he paused as though to collect himself
glanced again with a shudder at the body
of the young french girl and turned away
 the room seemed overpoweringly warm
and i went to the window there and opened
it wider to see lucette and the baby just
outside listening the child is entranced
with music and once or twice before lucette

argosy-allstory weekly
has brought her in at my invitation mrs
bellamy is much amused at little maudes
devotion to me
   when i saw them standing there i sug-
gested that they come in and myself opened
the door for them lucette seated herself
there where you see her now and took the
baby up on her lap and i returned to the
organ really forgetting their presence the
moment i was seated again before it han-
dels  largo  came into my thoughts al-
though it is scarcely the sort of thing to
appeal to a child and i played it through
to the end in the silence as the last notes
died away the patter of small feet running
across the marble floor recalled my guests
to my mind and i turned
   little maude was playing about that
palm over there trying to reach the lowest
of its broad leaves but lucette was-as you
see her i dont know-i cant recall what
i thought for the moment-possibly that
she had fallen asleep or was still relaxed
under the spell of the music but almost
instantly it came to me that something was
wrong i called her name sharply i re-
member and hurried to her side but before
i touched her i seemed to know the truth-
that she was dead 
   you didnt move her mr orbit the
position of the body is just the same
   i raised one of her hands to feel her
pulse but there was no slightest beat be-
neath my fingers and i lowered it to the
bench and drew her head forward one
look was enough and i let it roll back
once more calling for ching lee the
baby had trotted over to me and i took
her up in my arms to keep her from ap-
proaching lucette i think it was jean
who appeared first but ching lee came
immediately after and i told him to send
for the doctor when he came back from
the telephone he said you were passing and
i had him stop you
  orbit passed a shaking hand once more
across his forehead  what could have
brought death to that girl mccarty im
not ignorantly superstitious but it seems
as if some horrible malign thing were set-
tling down over us here in the mall and
the horror deepens first hughes then
horaces disappearance and now this inex-
plicable tragedy right under my roof in
my very presence it is enough to shake
a mans reason
   youre sure you were alone in the house
with just the servants i mean mccarty
had advanced to the body again and was
scrutinizing it carefully without touching
it  those front windows are flush with
the sidewalk but nobody could have
climbed in very well in broad daylight with
the watchman patrolling the block how
about that glass wall where it bulges out
the lower panes open as well as the upper
ones dont they
  he pointed to the farther side of the
room built out like a huge bay window and
orbit nodded
   of course but they are never touched
except for an hour on the hottest of sum-
mer days the tropical orchids banked there
would die instantly if a cool breeze blew
over them and the sections of glass can
only be reached with a long pole no one
could force a way through the plants with-
out leaving some trace or making their
presence known there is a french window
in the card room which is probably open
and a person might enter unseen from the
court between this house and goddards
and the kitchen or tradesmens door may
have been left ajar
  he spoke slowly as if to himself  the
cook is out and jean ching lee and fu
moy are the only others in the house be-
sides myself great heavens sir philip
arrives this evening i had a wire from
him 
   thats the english gentleman whos on
his way from the west sir philip dever-
something mccarty recalled their con-
versation of the previous day
   sir philip devereux he comes at a
most inopportune moment orbit groaned
 this poor girl-mccarty there must be
some rational explanation
   what did ching lee mean mccarty
asked suddenly  when he grabbed me
outside in the street there he said lucette
had  breathed the breath of death it
didnt seem only a chinese way of express-
ing himself have you an idea what he
could have been getting at
   is that what he said orbit walked
annihilation

quickly over to the nearest orchid and in-
dicated the great distended purple bloom
shot with angry streaks of livid orange-
yellow
   there is what he meant one of the
rarest of my specimens and a hybrid a
cross between two of the least known
varieties of orchid in central america
the natives down there regard it as poison
and believe that to inhale its odor which
is rank and nauseous means death there
is an old superstition among them that it
is part vegetable and part animal life and
that the curious vibration of its petals-so
like pulsation do you see it-is the act
of breathing to smell it is to take its
breath to die ching lee heard me telling
this to some guests one evening and noth-
ing could ever induce him to approach it
since there is nothing in the idea of
course the plant isnt poisonous in any
way but i suppose that was the first
thought that occurred to his mind when he
saw lucette lying dead
  mccarty edged cautiously over toward
it but footsteps sounded in the hall and
jean presented himself at the door
   mme bellamy is not at home but
snape took the little maude to place in the
care of one of the maids he reported
 he says that he will explain to madame
the docteur is not come
  before orbit or mccarty could reply the
doorbell rang violently and he hurried away
to admit dennis and the inspector the lat-
ter had evidently been prepared by his
companion for he glanced hastily at the
body and then turned to orbit
   how long has she been dead
   i dont know about twenty minutes i
should say inspector it occurred while i
was playing rather a lengthy movement on
the organ and i wasnt aware of it until
i had finished orbit started as the bell
pealed again and added in relief  that
must be dr allonby now
  jean ushered in a slender dapper indi-
vidual with a small pointed blond beard
and the unmistakable air of a professional
man who greeted orbit suavely by name
nodded with suddenly alert interest when
the inspector and his deputies were intro-
duced and then advanced to the body
  while he examined it the four grouped
themselves about him but jean crept to
the door and joined ching lee who was
hovering just outside they whispered to-
gether but the others waited in tense si-
lence
  finally the doctor straightened
   this woman has been killed by the
inhalation of some gas some poisonous
fumes but of what nature i am unable to
determine he announced gazing from or-
bit to the inspector with keen incisiveness
 i have never encountered a similar case
but the symptoms admit of no other diag-
nosis they are like and yet unlike some
of those i noted on the battlefields of
france a few years ago but undoubtedly
death was induced by asphyxiation the
autopsy will reveal its nature
  the inhalation of poisonous fumes mc-
carty heard a faint but high pitched ejacu-
lation in the hall in ching lees chattering
tones and involuntarily his eyes strayed to
the distorted bulbous luridly glowing or-
chid which seemed in the shadows to be
moving reaching out toward them could
it have been the  breath of death  in-
deed he felt the nerves crawl beneath
his skin and his scalp tingled but the
matter-of-fact voice of the inspector re-
called him to stern facts
   how long would you say shed been
dead doctor
   not much more than half an hour the
body is still warm you have taken charge
here
  the inspector nodded
   then i may suggest that you notify
your medical examiner without delay i
understand that this death is-er-a mys-
tery mr orbit
   an unaccountable one dr allonby i
was here in the room at the time it oc-
curred playing the organ over there and
lucette and the baby-this young girl was
the nurse for mrs bellamys child next
door-were seated on this bench
  the doctor started and asked quickly
 the child what has become of it
   the houseman took it home after you
were summoned orbit replied
   but it was unharmed the child was
seated here beside the nurse

argosy-allstory weekly
   oh no orbit interrupted  while i
played it had climbed down and was amus-
ing itself over by that palm
  a miraculous escape the doctor ex-
claimed  had it remained here it would
undoubtedly have met with the same death
which overcame the nurse was that win-
dow open just as it is now the one directly
behind those plants back of the bench
the doctor had never taken his eyes from
orbits face and it seemed to mccarty that
his tones had quickened
   just as you see it now affirmed orbit
 nothing has been disturbed or changed
in any way but doctor are you positive
of your diagnosis i am not questioning
your knowledge but this terrible affair is
utterly inexplicable to me i heard noth-
ing saw no one when i seated myself
before the organ lucette was to all casual
appearances a perfectly normal young
woman glowing with health when i turned
from it a few minutes later she was
stretched there dead the child was ab-
solutely unconcerned and i am sure she had
noticed nothing she is a shy little crea-
ture uneasy in the presence of strangers
and if any one had stolen in and approached
the nurse it seems incredible that she would
not have cried out or run to me thank
heaven she is old enough to talk we may
be able to learn something from her later
 that is an important point conceded
the doctor  when you approached the
body did you notice any peculiar odor in
the air it would have been pungent irri-
tating almost choking think mr orbit
you must have been conscious of some for-
eign highly chemicalized odor even if it
were almost instantly dissipated
  there was a pause and then orbit slowly
shook his head
   i was conscious of no such odor he
replied  it is odd for i am peculiarly
sensitive to things of that sort but then i
was overwhelmed with the shock of what
had taken place as soon as i realized the
girl was dead i called the servants- they
might have detected this odor you speak of
jean ching lee
  the two advanced reluctantly from the
hall but in answer to the physicians
queries supplemented by more brusque
ones from the inspector they could only
reply in the negative jean had been pol-
ishing some brasses in a near-by room and
heard mr orbit call ching lee he had
thought it strange that he did not ring as
usual and when he called again there was
something in his voice that made jean think
he needed help he rushed in and saw the
bonne stretched upon the bench and mr
orbit standing there with the little maude
in his arms
  ching lee had entered just behind him
and their stammered stories corroborated
that of their employer in every detail
they had noticed no odor but that of
the plants all about and they were quite
certain they had seen no stranger lurking
in the immediate vicinity to say nothing
of getting into the house itself they had
both been on the lower floor all the after-
noon
   i live on the next street and i shall
be glad to render any assistance possible
to your medical examiner dr allonby
then turned to the inspector  i will look
up this case among my notes and try
to ascertain the nature of the chemicals
used to generate the gas or vapor which
caused this young womans death mean-
while holding myself entirely at your dis-
posal mr orbit i regret that i arrived
too late to be of real service but in any
event the end must have come almost in-
stantaneously
  hebowed still with that guarded air of
repression and left the room ching lee
accompanying him to the door and orbit
shrugged throwing out his hands in a hope-
less gesture
   you saw i believe the man actually
thinks i am withholding some facts from
him but who wouldnt i cant bring
myself to believe it either even with that
poor girls body here before us it is awful
-awful
  he sank down upon a low stone seat
resting his head upon his hands and the
inspector observed
   poison gas thats a new one on me
except for the carbon monoxide generated
from motor cars standing in inclosed spaces
i never was connected with the bomb squad
but i thought most of that stuff had to be
annihilation

exploded you didnt hear anything did
you while you were playing
   not a sound the  largo  is not
necessarily thunderous in volume but it
has swelling chords which would have ef-
fectually smothered any slight noise what
are we to do now inspector i am in your
hands
   wheres your telephone ive got to
notify headquarters and get the medical
examiner thats the first step as the doc-
tor said of course i want no one to leave
this house
   assuredly not orbit lifted his head
 ching lee show inspector druet to the
telephone and then see that fu moy re-
mains quietly upstairs until he is sent for
ching lee bowed and followed the offi-
cial from the room dennis who had been
fearfully regarding the body of the dead
girl moved toward mccarty
   by all thats unholy whats doing
around here he whispered audibly  are
the powers of darkness let loose entirely
poison gas my eye mac how would
anybody reach her except with a squirt gun
or a grenade through that window
   who gave hughes that poison that
not one in a thousand has ever heard of
and how was the goddard kid snatched
from off the face of the earth mccarty
retorted but in a cautiously lowered tone
  he had approached the bench once more
and was gazing down at the still figure
 you remember what ching lee said
lucette was the  next he dont think
this devilment is goin to stop even here
and no more do i unless our luck turns
and we can stamp it out this girl
now-
  he paused staring down seemingly at
the small feet incased in their neat shoes
which peeped out from beneath a fold of
her skirt dennis drew back with a shiver
  it turns me fair sick to look at her
to think we was only talking to her this
morning it seems to me there is a kind
of a funny smell in the air dont you get
it mac maybe its something that creeps
over you gradual and before we know it
we could be corpses ourselves id like well
to be out of this room
   tis your imagination and not that
nose you brag of thats working now
mccarty thrust his foot forward in a push-
ing motion until his knee struck smartly
against the edge of the stone seat on which
lucettes body lay  theres no smell
whatever barring the scent of the flowers
himself has been here through it all re-
member
  he indicated with a jerk of his head the
seat where the bowed figure rested at
that moment the inspector reentered the
conservatory
   mr orbit is there any other entrance
to this room besides that door
  orbit looked up and then rose slowly
shaking his head
   none but the windows are open as
you see-
   well close and fasten them and then
lock this door behind us i want every-
thing in here left undisturbed until the med-
ical examiner comes take us somewhere
private where we can talk
   my stud upstairs orbit suggested
 all right riordan close the windows
will you and fix the catches the in-
spector turned and fumbled with the key in
the lock as dennis started for the windows
and orbit after a last horror-stricken glance
at the dead girl preceded the others from
the room
  mccarty eyed his superiors back for a
moment then stooped quickly and drew
out from under the bench the object he had
carefully kicked there a minute or two be-
fore it was a slender stick with a wad of
shriveled limp blue rubber dependent from
one end snapping the stick he thrust it
back beneath the bench again and placed
the fragment with the clinging clammily re-
silient pouch in his pocket then he too
glanced once more at lucettes dead face as
though ratifying some agreement between
them and turned to follow his superior
chapter xiv
the blue balloon
orbit told of the afternoon s tragic
experience again in detail for the
inspectors benefit mccarty and
dennis listened carefully but the account

argosy-allstory weekly
differed in no way from his first description
and just at its conclusion the medical ex-
aminers assistant was announced the in-
spector descended with orbit but mccarty
and his colleague discreetly effaced them-
selves
   were leaving just when its getting
good dennis sighed with morbid relish
as they went down the steps and out into
the lengthening shadows of late afternoon
 id like to have had a good look by our-
selves around that conservatory that doc-
tor may be all right for the fashionable ex-
pensive ailments of the crowd around this
neighborhood but ive been fighting fires
too long not to know what asphyxiation
means and twas not that killed the poor
young thing in that great vault of a room
with the windows open wide behind her
how the devil do you suppose she did come
to die mac
  im past guessing mccarty con-
fessed  tis the worst case since ever i
went on the cops and were up against the
cleverest murdering wretch thats been
loosed on the world youll mind i told
you once that brains and not brawn was
back of it all brains it is with the genius
of them twisted and gone wrong and a
knowledge of poisons and such that means
the learning of a lifetime well slip around
to the back of the house and wait till the
medical lad from headquarters has gone
im thinking theres more besides us would
like a minute or two in that conservatory
   why dennis looked startled is
something hid there do you mean how
could it be with the servants all the time
and orbit right there in the room tis
the first murder ever i heard of that could
be pulled off with a man playing the organ
not twenty feet away and a little child run-
ning about in the midst of it and neither
of them the wiser theres the baby now
  they had reached the rear court and in
the tradesmens entrance of the bellamy
house next door a buxom housemaid ap-
peared with little maude in her arms she
stood eying them in undisguised curiosity
and interest and mccarty lifted his hat
approaching her with a bland smile
   maudies after having a new nurse i
see  he began ingratiatingly  tis a pity
lucette took sick back there in mr or-
bits-
   how is she the woman interrupted
 what happened to her i know who you
are youre from the police trying to find
out who killed that valet from in there
mccarty acknowledged the recognition
with a bow as graceful as his girth per-
mitted
   youve got us right we just hap-
pened to be on hand to-day when lucette
got sick shed brought the baby in to hear
mr orbit play and he told jean to bring
her back home while the doctor was com-
ing i guess that french girls pretty bad
but they didnt tell us what was the matter
with her
   lucette the child had caught a fa-
miliar name  maudie wants lucette
wants to hear mans play adain
  she struggled to free herself and the
woman stooped and set her on her feet
but kept a careful grip on the fluffy skirts
   shes a handful her tone was ex-
asperated  it was all i could do to get
her quiet and now shes started hollering
again lucettes got a wonderful knack
with her and patience too and maudies
took a great fancy to her considering the
little while shes been here shes a nice
girl and i cant think whats ailing her for
she was all right when she started out with
the baby for a walk this afternoon
   want to walk now maudie an-
nounced making an abortive dive forward
 want to go to lucette
  hello there mccarty held out a
stubby forefinger and maudie looked up
at him for a moment then shyly clasped
her chubby hand about it  what hap-
pened to your pretty balloon
   balloon her other hand went to her
mouth and she sucked her thumb reflec-
tively
   sure mccarty urged encouragingly
while dennis stared at him in surprise
 the grand blue balloon you had whats
become of it did you break it
   she had no balloon- the woman be-
gan but maudie was of another mind
  did have she contradicted flatly
 lucette buyed it
   off a wop-i mean a man-with a big
annihilation

basket full of them down by the gate
mccarty asked  a big basket with a lot
of balloons red and blue and purple ones
maudie nodded
  big bastik she affirmed lucette
buyed balloon an i tooked it into the
mans house where he made the music
she was evidently trying hard to remem-
ber and mccarty waited but the effort
proving vain he prompted
   you broke the balloon while the man
was making the music didnt you when
you got down off lucettes lap to play
around didnt you break the pretty bal-
loon
   didnt bwoke it maudie shook her
curls decidedly  dave it to lucette
   whilst the man was making the mu-
sic mccarty persisted
   no lucette tooked it when we went
into the mans house where the garden is
an the fing that makes the music want
my balloon
  the corners of the rosebud mouth
drooped pitifully and a premonitory mois-
ture dimmed her eyes
   what did lucette do with it do you
know
  the question was beyond maudie how-
ever and she could only reiterate  want
lucette want my balloon
   did lucette have many friends here in
this country do you think mccarty gave
it up at last and addressed the housemaid
who fortunately did not note that he voiced
his query in the past tense
    no she hasnt shes got plenty of fol-
lowers if thats what you mean but shes
real sensible for such a young thing and
dont bother with them she would not have
gone in mr orbits house if that hughes
had been alive though she hated the
sight of him and small blame to her
mccarty chuckled
   he was a gay lad from all accounts
but i guess there are others that lucette
hates too eh shes kind of afraid of some-
body isnt she
   not that i know of the woman
tossed her head as she caught up the pro-
testing maudie once more  ive no call
to be talking about her to a stranger any-
way get along with your nonsense
  mccarty laughed again good naturedly
 a bit of gossip does no harm but weve
work to do denny and me good-bv
maudie
   by-by that young person responded
graciously and the two departed for the
orbit house
   what for were you asking the kid about
the balloon dennis asked when they were
out of earshot of the woman who still stood
in the door watching them  i saw none
anywhere near the girls body how did
you know shed bought one for the child
 what would that wop have been hang-
ing around the gate for if hed not sold
one already in here and hoped to get rid of
more mccarty countered  who else
would be wanting balloons when theres no
other kid on the block since the burminster
girls not back from the country and hor-
ace goddards gone
   gone it is  denniss voice lowered
fearfully  i feel it in my bones mac
that the boy will never turn up alive
there goes the car with the medical ex-
aminers assistant theyll be sending now
for the body and then twill be all over
the neighborhood who in the devil is back
of it all
   wholl be the next one marked for
death or disappearance retorted mccar-
ty  tis that has me worried now for
the hell hound is working faster and faster
as if the killing fever was getting the best
of him and by that same token thats my
one hope that twill get the best of his
shrewdness and cunning and hell give him-
self away thats the question now den-
ny wholl be the next
  they reentered the orbit house by way
of the tradesmens entrance to find that
andre the cook had returned and was
visibly wrought up over the fate of his
countrywoman his hands trembled as he
shelled chestnuts for a glace and dire
threats issued in a choked monotone from
beneath the fiercely bristling mustache
   that hughes should have been taken
perhaps it was the hand of fate or le bon
dieit for he was of use to no one in the
world except msieit and a perfect valet is
easily found especially among the french
but that the little horace should be made

argosy-allstory weekly
to disappear and now lucette the beautiful
one is kill-it shall be for the revenge
youre right it shall mccarty re-
turned grimly  andre do you know the
parsons cook across the street
   it is a she andre looked up with a
shrug of unutterable contempt  a wom-
an big like a brigadier with three moles
upon her cheek how should she know
the art of the cuisine but what would
you  they are of the old bourgeoisie these
parsons i am not acquaint with the
amazon of the three moles
   did ever you notice the eyes of her
mccarty asked suddenly  do they be
looking two ways at once
  but yes andre stared it is as
though she would see behind of her has
she then tell to you something of value to
your search
   shed have to see more than just behind
her to do that andre
  they left him still muttering and passed
through the pantries and down the hall to-
ward the front but mccarty drew dennis
hastily back as the doorbell sounded vo-
ciferously
   that  be the ambulance to take the
body to the morgue for the autopsy he
whispered  the medical examiners as-
sistant must have phoned for it before he
left that its here so quick well just be
laying low till its gone
   and weve no chance for another look
at the corpse dennis mourned
   what for twould help us none and
tis not from whats already happened well
find out the truth but from whats maybe
coming its as well to have the poor
things body out of the way
  in silence then they listened to the heavy
tramp of feet but when the front door
had closed once more mccarty beckoned
to his companion and started for the con-
servatory its door stood wide the win-
dows had been flung open again and a slight
breeze which had sprung up stirred and
rustled the leaves of the palms but nowhere
did there remain any sign of the tragedy
so recently enacted
  walking over to the organ mccarty
scrutinized it critically and then seating
himself on the stool before it with his back
  to the instrument and hands outspread on
his knees he regarded the marble bench on
which lucette had met her death while
dennis shifted from foot to foot watching
him all at once with a grunt he doubled
forward and appeared to be peering at the
space beneath the bench
   nothings under there denniss eyes
had followed the direction of his gaze
 the floors as bare and clean as the palm
of your hand what more is there here
for us to see
   not a thing now mccarty replied
nevertheless he crossed to the windows
and examined the sills before leading the
way from the room
  in the hall they met orbit there were
deep lines graven on his face by the shock
and strain of the afternoons horror and
he was holding himself in such deep repres-
sion that only his eyes betrayed his emotion
glowing darkly like live coals in an ashen
pallor
   it is-all over he asked in a hushed
tone  jean tells me the body has been
removed and the conservatory thrown open
again  would gladly close it forever
i	feel that i can never touch the organ
but i suppose that is morbid whatever
mysterious horrible thing came to destroy
that girl we can be thankful that the baby
escaped your inspector is quite beyond
his depth i am afraid but have you and
riordan no clew
   did the medical examiners assistant
say it was poison gas did it the same as
the doctor mccarty evaded the ques-
tion
   he didnt express an opinion while i
was there but your inspector went away
with him perhaps for some data that may
reveal the actual cause of poor lucettes
death with all respect to dr allonby i
cannot convince myself that the girl was
gassed the sheer impossibility of it under
the circumstances cant be overcome in my
mind but dont let me keep you unless
of course there are some questions you wish
to ask me
   not now mccarty shook his head
 well be back later likely youve my
own phone number in case anything turns
up
annihilation

  orbit nodded and himself showed them
out the front door bill jennings met them
as they approached the east gate and
immediately launched into excited queries
concerning the murder but mccarty cut
him short
   you know as much about it as we do
ourselves he asserted  the girl died
sudden sitting in the conservatory with the
child playing around her feet and not even
the doctors sure what took her bill do
you mind that balloon peddler you chased
away from the gate when we were coming
in did you ever see him hanging about
before
   many a time returned the watchman
promptly  balloons are a new line with
him it used to be peanuts and before that
little plaster images tony his name is-
he knows this boy coming now that de-
livers the evening papers for the whole
mall is there anything wrong about him
he aint ever been inside the gates while i
was on
  lord no mccarty replied hastily
 i thought he looked kind of like a dago
i used to know myself dont let any re-
porters in bill until we get back
  he hurried through the gate dragging
dennis after him and around the corner
where he came to a halt
   i want a word with that paper boy
he explained  happen hell give us a line
on this tony well collar him as he goes
back
   balloons again dennis exclaimed in
disgust  well i know youll not talk
till your own good time but tis in your
mind that a balloon had something to do
with that girls death id better be get-
ting back to the engine house laying up
some good sleep against to-morrow for its
small use ill be while you keep me in the
dark
   im in the dark myself denny mc-
carty confessed in contrition  tis only
a wild guess on my part but ive a busted
toy balloon in my pocket that i picked up
from the floor of that conservatory right
foreninst lucettes feet after the doctor had
gone i dont know has it anything to do
with the case but twas the gas that bal-
loons are sometimes filled with that put me
in mind of it i broke the stick off it and
threw it under the bench and when we
went back just now it was gone
  denniss jaw dropped
   but how in the world could gas poi-
soned or no be put into it he began  i
never heard tell of the like-
 whisht the lads coming now
mccarty cautioned then stepped forward
 hey just a minute sonny where 
i find your friend tony him that sells toy
balloons i saw him around here this
afternoon and i want to get a dozen or so
off him for an entertainment bill jen-
nings the watchman there at the mall said
you could tell me
  the boy an olive skinned lad with soft
dark eyes and a shy ingratiating smile
pushed his cap farther back on his curly-
black hair
   tony primavera he nodded  tonys
got de best balloons fer a dime in de city
mister he ought ter be troo busness fer
de day now but youse can find him over
where he lives wid joe de ice man in a
basement on thoid avenyer near eightieth
street hell have his stuff dere wid him
too
  thanking their informant they started
east to the avenue indicated and up along
that teeming thoroughfare to eightieth
street where they readily found the steep
basement stairs with the sign outside that
orders for coal and ice would be taken
below
  with dennis close behind mccarty de-
scended to the dark half cellar lighted dim-
ly by a single flaring gas jet besides the
table and broken backed chairs two cots
covered with soiled blankets and a stove on
which a pot bubbled and gave forth a
strong aroma of garlic denoted that the
apartment served for living as well as busi-
ness purposes but their eyes were caught
primarily by the huge basket in the corner
bristling with toy balloons so that it seemed
a miracle it was not lifted from the floor
by its aerial freight
   are they the same he had with him this
afternoon asked dennis
   if they are hes not sold many re-
sponded mccarty  wheres he gone i
wonder tis a grand sight well be trail-

argosy-allstory weekly
ing them through the streets across town
but im going to find out whats inside of
every last one of them this night
  dennis betrayed acute symptoms of
alarm
   what if we find what were looking for
and the two of us keel over he demanded
 if youll listen to me for once mac well
take them up to the park in the fine fresh
air and bust them with rocks-thrown
im not saying weve done such a hell of a
lot so far in this investigation but wed do
less laid out cold and stiff 
   well do the spellbinders-of the los-
ing party-tell us the town is going to the
devil when we depend on the likes of you
thats afraid of a childs toy to protect us if
we drop a cigarette or coax the stove along
with a bit of kerosene  retorted mccarty
adding with naive inconsistency  that
wop aint carting poison gas around with
him in ten cent balloons but im going to
be sure anyhow
  a clatter on the steps interrupted the
debate and the swarthy vendor of the after-
noon appeared with a round porous loaf
and a pale bulbous cheese unwrapped be-
neath his arm
   joes out he jerked his thumb to-
ward the table  write do ord on da slate
an bime-by he bring it
   tis not coal nor ice we want tony
but some of your balloons a lot of them
mccarty replied  you know the kid that
delivers the papers over at the new queens
mall he told us where to find you for
theyre giving a childs party where we work
and weve got to have the balloons right
away
   how many tcny deposited the
bread and cheese on the table with a thump
and proceeded eagerly to business  fine-a
balloon only fifteen-a cent-
   a dime was what you were asking this
afternoon and a dime youll get now mc-
carty announced with decision  how
many have you there
  the italian shrugged philosophically and
counted on his grimy fingers
   twenta-two he looked up with a
grimace  bad-a biz to-day
   well take the lot declared his cus-
tomer  tie the stems of them together in
two bunches if you can heres your
money
  the bargain was soon concluded and they
sallied forth with their burden but it ex-
cited so much comment chiefly of a humor-
ous nature that mccarty himself was glad
to subside in the depths of a taxi encoun-
tered on a side street
   dont sit all over me he warned his
companion irritably as they started anew
 youll be busting the damn things before
we get home is it grinning the chauffeur
is the blockhead
   tis two lunatics he thinks hes driv-
ing dennis averred gloomily hed
grin with the other side of his mouth if he
knew he was carrying a load of sudden
death maybe ill thank you to move over
yourself timothy mccarty and not be
poking them gas bags in my face 
  thereafter conversation languished until
they drew up before the door of mccartys
rooms m girard the dealer in antiques
came to the door of his shop and raised
his withered hands heavenward at this lat-
est demonstration of his neighbors eccen-
tricity but mccarty vouchsafed him only
a curt nod and then followed dennis who
was gingerly ascending the stairs guarding
his cargo with almost maternal solicitude
  in the living room he deposited it in
the middle of the floor and opened the
windows wide before turning on the light
the balloons rose slowly ceilingward in a
variegated cluster and he made a wild dive
to secure them
   tie your bunch to the arm of the
chairmccarty directed  well start
with mine hold them till i get out my
penknife and jab it into one
  dennis shut his eyes tightly and holding
his breath extended his long arm until the
joints cracked but a sharp pop like the shot
of a miniature revolver made him gasp for-
getting his caution he opened his eyes to
behold one of the balloons hanging a mere
deflated wisp at the end of its stick
   nothing but plain air mccarty com-
mented  tis not gassed you are is it
denny
   not yet replied dennis with a palpa-
ble reservation  youve twenty-one left
though
                          	a
annihilation

   well make short work of them mc-
carty jabbed a second balloon with his
knife and the ensuing report was productive
of a like harmless result
  thereafter the air was for a space filled
with a rapid succession of small detona-
tions and when it was over and not a bal-
loon was left intact denniss apprehension
gave place to disgust
   tis in our second childhood we are
he declared  whatever put it into your
head that the toy balloon had anything
to do with the girls death-
  but mccarty was not listening he had
drawn from his pocket the shriveled shred
of rubber on its fragment of stick and was
smoothing it out thoughtfully between his
fingers all at once he straightened
   denny that first balloon we stuck the
knife into was red wasnt it
   sure it was  denny looked his sur-
prise
   and the second was blue and the third
green
   i disremember-but what of it
look at them stretch them out and
see if theyve changed color since mc-
cartys tones shook with excitement and
dennis caught the infection he drew the
limp rubber out and scrutinized each torn
balloon in turn then shook his head
   theres nothing different about them
that i can see what are you getting at
 just this when i picked this up it
was blue as blue as that second one we
broke and look at it now the rubber
wisp he held out was a greenish gray mot-
tled with brown spots which were already
disintegrating  denny the others didnt
change color because twas just air they
were filled with but this is different its
rotting before our eyes twas this childs
toy held the poison gas that killed lucette 
chapter xv
midnight marauders
the litter of wrecked balloons was
cleared away and the one which had
changed color with such sinister sig-
nificance was carefully deposited in an
empty tin cracker box with pipe and
 a
cigar alight dennis and mccarty were dis-
cussing the latest development the fatigue
from the previous nights sleepless activity
forgotten in their renewed zeal
   theres an old guy i know living far
uptown thats a wizard about chemistry
mccarty observed neglecting to mention
that the  wizard  had an interesting police
record  ill take the box with whats left
of that blue balloon in it up to him some
morning but well not breathe a word of it
to another living soul tis somebody on
the mall or with easy access to it thats
walking around with two murders and a
disappearance on the conscience of them
maybe giving us fair words every day and
the grand laugh behind our backs we
dont know who it is and till we do well
be telling nothing to any of them
   true for you dennis nodded im
thinking though tis on the north side of
the street youll find your man mac for
everything thats happened hit the three
households on the south side orbits valet
and goddards son and now mrs bellamys
nurse girl the only two houses opposite
that are occupied since the burminsters
are still away are five and seven-the
sloanes and the parsons well not be for-
getting that swede otto who beat it away
from the sloanes at the first alarm and
weve not so much as crossed the door sill
there yet but then theres the parsons too
they hold themselves better than their
neighbors and have them that are next to
royalty no less for company and still and
all they have an ex-convict and suspected
poisoner at that to buttle for them if i
was that ambassador id have thought twice
before i stayed to lunch
   theyve a houseful of crooks  ex  or
no mccarty asserted regarding his cigar
thoughtfully  i got porter right but
twas the inspector first gave me the wire
without knowing it when he said the house-
maid and page boy looked familiar and as if
hed seen them somewhere before but he
couldnt place them where would he have
seen them if twas not at headquarters or
on trial andre put the last touch to it
this afternoon though
   orbits cook
   he did that do you mind when i

argosy-allstory weekly
asked him if he knew the cook over at
parsons he said it was a  she a great big
woman with three moles on her cheek
jennie malone shoved about twenty thou-
sand dollars worth of the queer-in the best
stores of the city for the carpenter counter-
feiting gang before she was pinched and
shed never have been caught after she got
the office to make her get-away if it hadnt
been for those three moles that gave her
away ever since andre tipped me off
unbeknownst ive been asking myself what
was the rest of that household like and did
they have more reasons than one for keep-
ing the neighbors at arms length
  dennis sat forward suddenly and took his
pipe from his mouth
   do you mean the parsons themselves
are not on the level he demanded  the
old gentleman with his grand charities and
his pious talk the old maid sister and the
young niece three generations of them
have lived in that same house goddard
said and the women of the family must
be out of it but do you think the old
gentleman is cracked maybe and turned
murderer wholesale is it him thats plant-
ed a hotbed of crime right there in the
mall
  somebody has mccarty shrugged
 of course the two murders happened in
orbits house if twas there hughes got his
dose of calabar bean and the goddard kid
disappeared from next door-
  dennis snorted
   would orbit be killing the valet that
give him perfect service all these years
till he cant so much as put on his own
shirt for himself no less murdering a nurse
girl and running off with a boy none in
the bellamy household could have had a
hand in lucettes death and it stands to
reason goddard didnt kidnap his own son
orbits likely to be under fire now and come
in for a lot of notoriety and maybe-well
theres others under that roof besides him-
self
   ive been turning that over in my mind
too mccarty took a last pull at his cigar
and laid the stub in the tray  weve put
in this evening so far breaking balloons
and thats about all weve been doing since
first this case started opening up one gas
bag after another and getting nothing but
empty air id like a chance to go through
the parsons house and orbits too with
no one the wiser and if you were not such
a clumsy heavy-footed galoot denny wed
be paying them a little visit to -night with-
out leaving our cards
   clumsy is it dennis repeated indig-
nantly  me thats been scaling walls and
ladders since you tramped your first beat
weve broke in an empty house there in
broad day and we can get in the others at
night just as easy in spite of what new-
fangled burglar alarms they may have for
im on to most of them through fighting
fires thanks be
   ive felt in the soul of me since the
first night we went through those gates
that sooner or later wed be marauding in
there like a couple of second story workers
and now its come if instead of parsons
and his convicts it should be one of those
frenchmen or the chink in orbits house
well spot him
   the first thing we spot will be the res-
taurant around the corner for tis near ten
oclock and weve had no dinner mc-
carty rejoined  we wont be showing up
near the mall till midnight or after and
weve a lot to plan first
  their meal finished they returned again
to the rooms but mccarty paused in the
doorway of the living room for a moment
a peculiar expression crossing his face
   sit you down and light your pipe
denny he threw open the closet door
as he spoke  ill be with you in a minute
now where-
  he left the closet and went into the bed-
room and dennis paused in the act of
tamping his pipe to listen open mouthed
for an unaccustomed sound came to his
ears mccarty was whistling wheezilv
and off key but there was something oddly
reminiscent in the simple insistently re-
iterated measure moreover mccarty never
indulged in that or any other form of me-
lodious expression unless in a blatant at-
tempt at dissimulation
  what was he doing anyway that he
didnt want his own pal to get on to hed
opened and shut the door of his clothes
closet and now he was in the bathroom
annihilatiox

still trying to whistle that funny little tune
almost like the ones mollys kid learned at
the kindergarten
  dennis shrugged and went on lighting
his pipe as mccarty reentered the room
and going to the mantel selected a cigar
from the box reposing there
   did you find what you were looking
for
  mccarty reddened
   i did not but no matter he replied
shortly  i unearthed an old kit of bur-
glars toois that i took once off of black
matt that  maybe come in handy and
heres a revolver for you
  ive no use for it remarked dennis
hastily regarding the weapon with small
favor  something short and hefty is
more in my line with no trigger to go off
unexpected and send me to the chair
   do you think id trust you with it if
it was loaded his host retorted  tis
only to throw a bluff if were cornered and
well be wearing handkerchiefs over our
faces like movie burglars for whatever
comes we dont want to be recognized it
dont matter what tracks we leave behind
us as long as we get clear ourselves so well
take these nippers to ait every wire we
see
   and to-morrow therell be a new job
for us tracking our own selves dennis
grinned and then his face sobered
 weve the hardest job on our hands as it
is that ever we tackled mac with this in-
human devil to lay low
   ive a creepy feeling that theres more
than him at work mccarty dropped the
tools he had been sorting and stared re-
flectively into space  i dont know how
to put it but it seems as if there was some-
thing powerful and as evil as a spirit from
hell itself thats helping the wretch in his
destruction hes getting bolder denny
hell over-reach himself yet and if we could
figure whos to be the next we could close
in on him
   tis too deep for me dennis shook
his head  is there a glass-cutter and a
lump of putty in that layout
  for more than an hour they discussed
the forthcoming adventure and at mid-
night left the apartment and took a round-
about way across town to the new queens
mall waiting until dave hollis the night
watchman had strolled to the other end of
the block they let themselves in at the west
gate and slipped into the court between the
burminster mansion and the sloaness
smaller residence next door the original
plan had been to visit orbits house first
but a light still glowed from the lower floor
indicating that the host and his guest sir
philip devereux had not yet retired but
the parsons establishment was decorously
dark and they proceeded to its rear along
the open back court like two moving shad-
ows there they paused to adjust hand-
kerchiefs over the lower part of their faces
and dennis took stock of the situation
there was no moon and even the stars
were partly obscured by scudding clouds
while the rising wind that swirled through
the alleylike spaces between the houses be-
tokened a coming storm
   tis the equinox no less thats on the
way dennis shivered more from nerv-
ousness than chill and his voice came in a
muffled whisper from beneath the hand-
kerchief the flash light in his hand wav-
ered as he directed its infinitesimal ray
against the house wall
   look at that now if the old gentle-
man keeps any valuables here he must think
that the crooks under his roof are enough
protection from them outside for hes still
depending on the old kip electric system
that a babe in arms could disconnect get
you to the mouth of the alley mac and
keep an eye out for the watchman
  mccarty obeyed and when after an in-
terval during which hollis had passed twice
he heard a cautious hiss behind him and
returned it was to observe loose wires
dangling innocuously from the wall and a
yawning aperture in one of the windows
where dennis had removed a whole pane of
glass
   i made a good job of it the latter
whispered complacently  the telephone
is cut too and the inside burglar attach-
ment the old gentlemans not such a fool
after all for hes got an installation that
once set would warn him if a window or
outside door was touched but i put it out
of business take off your shoes like i

argosy-allstory weekly
did and then come on ive fixed the catch
already
  he raised the window inch by inch while
mccarty removed his shoes tied the laces
together and hung them about his neck
then he crawled over the sill drew his
bulkier companion in after him and flashed
his light quickly about
   theres the door you said not to
bother with any rooms downstairs except
the old gentlemans private study or sitting
room if hes got one didnt you
   yes i can see the foot of the back
stairs at the end of this hall so shut off that
light mccarty whispered in response
 youre breathing loud enough to wake
the dead
  dennis grunted indignantly but made no
rejoinder and they fumbled their way to
the stairs and up the silence was oppres-
sive and to the amateur housebreakers it
seemed to hold an ever-increasing menace
they padded along in their stockinged feet
through the wide hall pausing at each door-
way as mccarty directed his own electric
torch within but only stately drawing-
rooms and a dining hall huge enough for a
banquet met their gaze
   wouldnt you think hed buy more fur-
niture mccarty forgot their equivocal
situation for the moment as he gazed dis-
paragingly down a long portrait gallery
where cavalier and puritan forbears of
the parsons looked down only upon a few
chairs placed at wide intervals against the
wall  there are not seats enough in all
the parlors to hold a decent funeral and
what there is is old and dull like the junk
in girards antique shop
   maybe tis worth as much and more
dennis suggested sagely  im not facing
jail this minute though for a chance to
look at it theres a smaller room beyond
that might be the old gentlemans study
  he had guessed truly though the apart-
ment in which they found themselves more
closely resembled a business office a roll-
top desk and swivel chair filing cases and
a solidly compact safe met their gaze and
the rugs upholstered furniture and tall
bookcases which completed the appoint-
ments formed merely an incongruous back-
ground
   unless youre up in safe-blowing which
i doubt i dont see as this room is going to
tell us anything dennis whispered
 them keys that you stuffed your pockets
with will do no good
   wont they mccarty chuckled grim-
ly and strode toward the nearest filing case
 hold your light steady denny fireproof
this thing may be but all the sections of it
open with the one lock and i could pick it
with a buttonhook
  the lock confirmed his opinion by yield-
ing to the third key tried and the various
sections filled with an orderly arrangement
of ledgers and documents were at their dis-
posal
   look at the fine neat writing of him
dennis was rummaging in the topmost one
 whats this tis a lot of typed stuff
with his own notes on the margin and
headed  report chris porter -
 hes wrote under it  reasonable
doubt pardon essential  then  pardon
granted help needed 
  give it to me mccarty demanded
 are there any more like it these ledg-
ers have nothing in them but notes on
charity cases
  heres another something about a re-
formatory and in his own writing  weak
not vicious useful if right influence its
headed  danny sayre  this one is
about that jennie malone-
  let me have them all- mccarty in-
terrupted  dont you see what they are
the criminal records of all the hired help
take the next section after 
  a pause broken only by the rustling of
papers ensued and then dennis exclaimed
in an awestruck whisper
   mac heres a lot of notes about ways
of killing all mixed up with religion and-
and among ems poison gas fluorine
hydrogen and h  f -
   grab it mccarty hastily thrust the
documents he had been examining into his
pockets and closed the filing case  grab
all the notes and come along well need
look no further in this house
  yet on the way to the door he paused
and ran the pinpoint of light along the rows
of books in their towering cases they
appeared to be volumes of references on
annihilation

widely diversified subjects from hygiene
and sanitation to law and religion and all
arranged in meticulous order save on a low-
er shelf where the huge tomes of an en-
cyclopedia had been stacked helter-skelter
one volume that labeled  bronze-ce-
phalaspis protruded from the row as
though too hastily replaced and mccarty
stooped on a sudden impulse and drew it
out the morocco covers fell apart and
the book opened midway where a thin sil-
very leaf-shaped object had been inserted
as a mark
  at a muttered injunction dennis held
his light trained upon it and mccartys
eyes traveled down the page then stopped
and for a long minute there was no sound
except their mingled breaths then the
latter whispered
   listen denny heres a queer one
 it is used in the form of an emulsion by
the natives of africa as an ordeal when
persons are suspected of witchcraft it is
believed that if the suspect vomits it he is
innocent if it is retained and death oc-
curs he is guilty 
   a mighty sensible arrangement con-
sidering dennis commented if hes
guilty and id not put witchcraft past them
heathens theyre saved the bother and ex-
pense of an execution but what in the
name of common sense has it got to do
with whats been going on here in the
mall
   nothing mccarty tore out the -page
wrapped it about the leaflike bookmark
and pocketed it  nothing whatever ex-
cept that the stuff they make the suspects
take is calabar bean
  he replaced the mutilated volume and
they stole from the room making their way
down the stairs and back to the open win-
dow through which they had entered the
silence still reigned unbroken and when
they had crawled through the aperture and
out into the wind-swept court mccarty
leaned against the wall balancing himself
precariously on one foot as he drew on a
shoe while dennis softly closed the win-
dow
   well not be breaking into orbits
the latter asked as he followed his com-
panions example  them notes about
poison gas the marked page telling of cala-
bar bean and the life history of the crooks
he surrounds himself with - if benjamin
parsons isnt the man were looking for ill
eat my hat
   then maybe youd better be working
up an appetite against the future sug-
gested mccarty dryly  theres no more
proof against him than there was against
that otto lindholm and if the lights are
out over at orbits im going to take a
chance
  the miniature palace across the way was
in total darkness but its marble front
gleamed whitely in the faint glimmer of
starlight before a wind-driven cloud ob-
scured the sky once more escaping the
vigilance of the night watchman they
crossed the street and passed down the
opening next to the goddard house where
the glow from all the upper windows bore
mute testimony once more to the sustained
anxiety and heartbreaking suspense within
  mccarty halted his companion before
the little side door
   ill wait here while you go around back
and cut any wires you find he directed
 the bulge of the conservatory hides me
from the street and tis not likely any of
the goddard household will be looking out
their windows what with the murder
and then company and all ching lee may
have forgot to fasten this door proper on
the inside and we can force it easier than
the iron grille outside the rear windows
dont be all night denny
  dennis glanced rather dubiously up at
the next house and then out to the side-
walk but he hurried away without a word
mccarty took out his keys and waited
  the strangely coincidental facts he had
unearthed with such fortuitous ease in ben-
jamin parsonss study gave him much food
for reflection but long experience made him
more wary of jumping to conclusions than
his optimistic colleague parsons was
known as an eminent and practical philan-
thropist what if hed taken those ex-con-
victs into his home to reform them at first
hand it would be natural enough for him
to keep reports on their past records cala-
bar bean had been prominently mentioned
in the papers in connection with the mur-

argosy-allstory weekly
der of his neighbors valet mightnt he
have been interested sufficiently to look it
up as a rarity the notes on poison gas
 mixed up with religion  were more diffi-
cult to explain but then only dennis had
seen them yet and-where the devil was
denny anyway
  mccarty craned his neck to stare into
the darkness toward the rear but no deeper
shadow moved and no sound came to him
but the moaning swish of the wind denny
had maybe found a burglar alarm that
wasnt so easy to put out of business
  hollis pounded heavily past on the side-
walk then returned and went on again
and still there was no sign of his erstwhile
companion but all at once the bolts of
the door against which he leaned were
drawn back and mccarty had barely time
to spring aside and flatten himself in the
corner of the out-curving glass conservatory
wall when the door itself swung inward
  he held his breath but no one appeared
and then at last a low hiss assailed his
ears
   tis you mingled relief and exas-
peration lent emphasis to his whispered
ejaculation  for what did you play such
a damn fool trick i near landed on the
flat of my back-
   forget it denny interrupted with un-
accustomed assertion  come on in before
the watchman passes again youd never
have got past these bolts only i found a
way in through the little pantry ventilator
you couldnt have squeezed through it in a
year now which way is it up to the
floor where the frenchmen and them two
heathen sleep that well be going no-
bodys stirring
  he had closed the door and noiselessly
shot the bolts and mccarty responded
   i want to make sure orbit said he
wasnt a good sleeper youll remember
and if he could rest easy in his bed this
night with that poor girl murdered under
his roof not so many hours past hes not
the man i took him for well go up the
back stairs and then sneak along the hall
to his door thanks be we know the lay of
this house
  they crept silently through the card
room and past the pantries to the back
stairs where they stopped and removed
their shoes again before venturing upward
no faintest ray of light shone from under
any door on the floor above to compete
with their darting flash light but from be-
hind one on the left deep and regular
breathing denoted that one at least of the
household doubtless the distinguished ar-
rival of the previous evening slumbered un-
haunted by morbid visions
  before the door of orbits own bedroom
they halted but no sound came from with-
in and at length mccarty motioned to his
companion and tiptoed into the sitting room
adjoining
   youve been in that bedroom before
his lips barely formed the words close to
denniss ear  youll know how the fur-
nitures placed so as not to fall over it
go in and see is he asleep ive our story
all fixed if he should jump you
  ive not dennis retorted in palpable
reluctance  moreover theres a queer
sweetish smell in the air dont you get it
if he or anything else in there jumps me
i hope youll get busy first and explain
afterwards 
  he left mccartys side and  the latter
heard his feet pad softly off toward the
connecting door between the rooms a
pause ensued then came the- footsteps
again but fainter now and after a mo-
ment a low light flashed it wavered
steadied went out suddenly and a dull
thud came to mccartys ears as the elec-
tric torch itself struck the thick pile of
the rug he started forward as denniss
low shaking voice was borne upon the si-
lence
   for the love of the saints come here

coming	officer an interesting tale
 soon	by hulbert footner under an arresting title
by charles francis coe
the most trying of all times for the
fighter is that endless period which
crowds itself into the two days before
 fight time then it is that tensity of
perfect physical condition rebels against the
enforced restraint of the rest period the
inactivity palls upon taut nerves straining
muscles concentrated thought maudlin
expressions of supreme confidence are
upon every lip assurance the more osten-
tatious because of its lack of depth is bel-
lowed across unthinking lips unreasoning
minds and the hours drag with the weight
of centuries
  socker dooley had been through all this
many times of yore it was  old stuff  to
him so he trod the confines of the training
camp with the brooding silence that most
befitted the condition no socker was not
going to figure as one of the principals in
the coming fray the impending matter
was one which interested him only from
the standpoint of how well he had trained
the boy who was going to do the fighting
socker to all intents and purposes had long
since passed the fighting days his present
unfortunate state was that of capitalizing
those things which he knew rather than
those he could do that is one of the weak-
nesses of the fight game just about the
time a man learns enough about it to be
good he is too old to do his stuff
  it is during the last two days before the
fight that everything annoys no matter
what it is that happens it is irritating to
the fighter knowing the value of entering
a ring in a contented frame of mind socker
intended to see to it that the kid was not

argosy-allstory weekly
bothered by interviewers the newspaper
fellows werent so bad they knew the
trick and never asked a lot of fool ques-
tions but there were others
  for instance that reformer who came in
behalf of the league for the suppression of
brutality that bird had left the kid so
mad that it took the entire camp to get him
smiling after the talk there would be no
more of that-not if socker had his way
  so he kept a watchful eye peeled for in-
truders two days before the battle his
efforts were rewarded by the appearance of
a dignified old lady who came in behalf of a
womans club try as he would socker
could not forestall an interview the papers
had aroused a vast interest in the fight and
the public was interested in anything that
appeared in print to refuse to talk would
have brought a storm of protest-or so
said the promoters of the fight-so socker
agreed that he would talk with the lady
frankly he wholesomely admitted total ig-
norance of the why and wherefore but
there was nothing else to be done the
kid couldnt possibly see that woman it
meant too much nobody seemed to under-
stand that
   its dis way maam said socker when
the kindly soul had been introduced to him
and leaned back to gaze upon his battered
physiognomy through her lorgnette  de
kid is  on edge  an needs ter git sleep i
just got im tucked erway an cant shake
im loose whatever yer wants ter know
why just ask me-im socker dooley
the manner in which he announced his
identity seemed to impress her far more
than the announcement itself
   i wanted to interview the principal
we are interested in his psychologies his
mental processes his general background
 he aint got none uh them socker
assured her  i spent de last free weeks
tryin ter teach im the whole works we
gotta wait till de mill ter see whether deres
anyting above de shoulders except jaw
are yuh goin tuh de fight
  the lorgnette trembled perceptibly and
the pampered face behind the glasses crim-
soned slightly
   i have no intention of seeing the de-
grading affair sir
   den wots de use uh gabbin about it
asked socker rather practically  an yuh
neednt  sir  me i aint stuck up on ac-
count uh bein good in me day lady
   i fear that this interview will not an-
swer my purpose snapped his caller
   wots yer purpose ill answer any-
ting yuh ask me
  apparently this logic was a little too
strong for her she shifted her position and
cast a withering glance upon dooley it
was plain to be seen that her continuance of
the interview was actuated solely by a sense
of duty
   i wanted to secure information first
hand that i could report to my associates
we are opposed to prize fighting and ex-
pect to find any justification for it which
may exist by keeping an open mind and
lowering ourselves to personal investigation
rather than decide a matter without all the
facts before us
   oh
   if there is anything chivalrous any-
thing uplifting anything that makes better
men and women of us in this fighting the
place to learn of it is among you who make
a business of it am i not right
   ill say you are old kid socker was
beginning to understand the lady wantejl
to learn the game  an you just take it
from one as knows-theys a hell of a lot ter
learn about it 
  the kindly interviewer was beginning to
sense conditions which had not been fore-
seen she actually felt qualms as to her
personal safety then socker grinned con-
genially and it was evident that under the
veneer which proclaimed lack of culture
far more than lack of manhood there was
a dormant sense of chivalry which would
have offered its full measure of protection
to a lady in distress rather than see a hair
of her head harmed
  she took what she considered a tactful
course
   this promises to be a most interesting
chat mr dooley
   sockers good enuf he assured her
magnanimously
   very well socker i take it you have
engaged in fistic combat yourself
   well i wasnt born wit dese ears lady
socker dooley demon

an i aint never been in no railroad
wrecks
  to be sure did you-like the busi-
ness of fighting
   kin a duck swim
   to be sure you fought for the love
of fighting and the lady made a few
notes in a black book she carried
   fer de love of ut gasped socker
 sweet patootie yuh never stopped a belt
on de lug did yuh did yer old man ever
take a swipe at yer mug when he had a
few shots aboard love of ut goodnight
dere aint no fun in wipin no gloves outa
yer lamp lady dats de way wit women
dey aint got no understandin of a mans
business
  with the fortitude of a martyr the good
lady overlooked these remarks every pio-
neer in any field must expect hardships
these were the penalties of being a pro-
tector of public welfare she must coun-
tenance them with patience and courage
while regaining her composure she made a
few more notes
   to be sure she giggled finally  you
are a fighter who commercialized the-art-
that is-the ability
   i never done nuttin wit it but grab de
coin
   indeed-yes and let me ask you
was there considerable animosity on your
part against the man you fought with
socker thought that over a bit the puz-
zled expression upon his face enlightened
her as to the lack of response
   i mean-did you hate the man who op-
posed you
   hate a guy dat brought me a nice
purse socker was amazed at the thought
 why should i hate him
   how could you fight with a man whom
you had no reason to dislike
  socker was hopelessly involved there
seemed no head or tail to the thing no
manner in which the thoughts of this be-
wildering lady could be answered well-
there just wasnt any sense to it if you get
me finally in desperation he said
   i dont git yuh maam if its about
de fight game yuh wanna know dere aint
nuttin to ut but who is de first guy ter
knock de udders eye loose dats all dere
is to ut in me day i used ter climb troo
de ropes figgerin ter drop de udder birds
hat rest in de last aisle tuh de right as soon
as i got a crack at ut-dats all dere is to
ut
   you mean his head
   well-mebbe only his chin dats
enuf grinned socker
  the lady rose in horror the interview
was at an end she had learned enough
she trembled once more for her own safety
here was irrefutable evidence of the mur-
derous intent of pugilists
   you said your name was socker doo-
ley i believe
   i sed ut right sister dats de case
socker rejoined
   once more the pencil flew across the note-
book then with a chill smile the inter-
viewer swept toward the open door and the
waiting car her sigh of relief was no more
audible or expressive than that of socker
  but the next morning a wild promoter
appeared at the camp the baleful glare
in his eye warned socker of impending dis-
aster the man did his best to release from
his straining system the thoughts that
brewed there it was no use they would
not lend themselves to expression in a
frenzy he finally stuffed the morning paper
into sockers hand and pounded a trembling
finger upon an article which he profanely
commended to sockers immediate atten-
tion
  well there it was
fistic battle should be stopped
by police
prominent society folk to appeal to
governor to take immediate steps to
prevent coming ring encounter
  laboriously socker struggled through the
two column article not alone was his every
statement included but many that he could
not have thought of much less made the
good lady interviewer was none other than
the famous mrs fink member of the four
hundred what she hadnt said about the
brutality of boxing and the fixed intention
of boxers upon entering the ring was what
socker had failed to mention and what she

argosy-allstory weekly
and the reporter who had written the arti-
cle couldnt think of it wasnt a whole
lot
  and then there was what the promoter
had to say most of those bimbos can talk
against time and when any one casts a
shadow over their income there just isnt
anything more to be said the first chance
socker got he sneaked out into the barn and
hid one of the perquisites of fighting is
judgment and socker showed his
  the pull of the promoter plus feverish
effort and many agreements on the matter
of reciprocity finally squared things as well
as could be expected the fight wasnt to
be stopped
  then came one of those incomprehensible
twists of the public mind which has marked
american history since its beginning and
made luminous its pages with deeds of
might and valor performed under stress of
sudden impulse
  one writer commended socker for the
spirit of combat that was his he pointed
out that this was the spirit of conquest
that it was the factor of competition which
assured genuine skill determined effort
the idea took hold sockers name ap-
peared in the role of a great fighter who
knew little of expressing his thoughts the
very crudity of his exaggeration which had
so frightened the lady marked him as one
of the few men who had made fighting the
clean game it should be
  just let a fan rest assured that the man
he pays to see means to fight to the limit of
his powers and he asks no more for the
first time in many months the name of
socker dooley crept into the headlines
  and then came into the life of socker
one whose influence was to mean much he
appeared at the camp the morning following
the turn in newspaper sentiment over
his arm he swung a jaunty cane his frail
body was swathed in a perfectly fitting suit
his genial smile illumined his features with
as dapper a light as is within human pro-
pensity
  he got to socker on the strength of that
smile
   socker old kid youre there fortune
has seized you in her whimsical grasp and
is about to waft you to the crest of fickle
adoration all that you need is the finished
touch of a genuine leader-and ive both
the touch and the leader if you have one-
half the judgment that i can see lurking in
the lustrous depths of your shantied lamps
you will seize my hand with the warmth of
gratitude see-i hold forth said hand un-
qualifiedly fate has seen to it that we are
to share opportunity
  mechanically socker took the extended
hand things were breaking a trifle fast
for him a little beyond his powers to grasp
but there was something about this chap
which fascinated one found it difficult to
argue with him because one had no oppor-
tunity to talk he did all that
   ah yes we are brothers of fortune
you of small intelligence and i of great
you of great brawn  of none wonderful
dont you think they say it is always
darkest just before the dawn ill wager
that you have been blue for the last few
days am i right i am
  and he was socker recalled the day
he had spent in the barn after that pro-
moter had called indeed he had been
blue
   and so it goes at the very darkest
hour-i appear even now you cannot see
in that the great good fortune which it real-
ly is in a very few words-we are the ideal
combination you a body in search of the
mental spark which lights the way to fame
and fortune i the spark in search of a
body to follow the path i illuminate shake
again socker god is good
  socker shook
  then he followed the other into the quiet
of the gymnasium and there listened spell-
bound to the words of wisdom which
poured from the glib lips of his new friend
terminating the conversation the newcom-
er drew forth an envelope from his inside
coat pocket hanging the flourishing cane
over his forearm he leaned over a wall
pulley and wrote upon the envelope
    this is an agreement that lewis latts is
   the manager of socker dooley until written
   notice to the contrary is mutually signed as
   such said lewis latts is to arrange bouts
   for socker dooley on a profitable basis and
   is to receive from socker dooley one-third
   of the proceeds of these bouts lewis latts
   agrees to pay all expenses of training
socker dooley demon

  both men signed the document imme-
diately latts set forth in search of the pro-
moter he had a very definite idea in mind
in his pocket he carried the strongest article
that had appeared anent the desire of sock-
er to annihilate all opponents it was the
insurance for the fan who paid to see a fight
and was too often stung by too careful fight-
ers that he would get the worth of his
money
   i have always admired the wisdom of
your matchmaking latts assured the pro-
moter  there are certain features about
fighting which reflect credit or discredit
upon the matchmaker more than upon the
fighters themselves those qualities you
possess it is for that reason that i am
here
  in his own inimitable manner he pointed
out to the promoter how distinct a draw-
ing card socker dooley had suddenly be-
come he was in the public eye he had
publicly gone on record as one who thought
only of the demolition of an adversary a
fighter worthy the name one who fought
with the primitive fury of his antediluvian
ancestors a caveman-a demon
  and so it was that an extra bout was
added what socker might lack in phy-
sique was made up in heart what he
might have lost by reason of his long record
was more than compensated for by the fact
of his sudden appearance in the public eye
it was truly one of those incomprehensible
twists and one which bade well for the
socker dooley coffers to say nothing of
those into which went the worldly wealth
of lewis latts manager extraordinary

  provide three thousand men with ques-
tionable tobacco crowd them into a poorly
ventilated building give them plenty of
matches and then feed them excitement
the experiment will reproduce the average
 club  on fight night
  add to this the catcalls of a hundred
pseudo wits the scraping of six thousand
feet and the perspiring presence of half a
hundred ushers who act as though they
never before have been inside the place
and you have the background
  there are other nondescript attributes
which classify the affair in a category all
its own for instance levy litsky is en-
gaging in his first bout in the fifty cent
gallery are levys vociferous admirers
every time levy disturbs the resin with any
portion of his anatomy other than his feet
there is loud recriminations from said ad-
mirers across the balcony are the admir-
ers of pat gilhooley possibly of irish ex-
traction the fight takes place as much
outside as inside the ring the pande-
monium is the only thing of certitude about
the affair be the victor levy or pat cer-
tain amount of hell is assured from the gal-
lery gods
  into that atmosphere strode the rejuve-
nated socker dooley many there were
about the ring who looked not so far back
to the days when the appearance of that
grinning face was significant of action
these shook knowing heads a little sadly
there is something disheartening in the
prostitution of faded glory
  across the ring reposed the somewhat
frightened form of abie epps abie was
the possessor of the head which socker
was to attempt to deposit in the extreme
right aisle if one can believe the papers
to all intents and purposes abies affection
for that same head was increasing momen-
tarily
  he was surrounded by a corps of chat-
tering water slopping  seconds  who war-
bled diversified advice of a technical nature
into a head that knew not the cause of
the simplest of things the head bobbed
occasionally but whether from understand-
ing or the frenzied rubbing that tortured the
back of the neck which supported it will
never be known
  socker was happy there was that in
the very air which carried him on the wings
of memory into the faded past the roseate
recollections of supremacy obtruded beyond
the misgivings of judgment many a man
has been sustained by finding himself the
cynosure of admiring eyes back of the
battered eyes of socker dooley was the best
fighting brain in some thirty odd states
the body that caged it might be lacking in
all ways but the brain would always func-
tion in that atmosphere

argosy-allstory weekly
   demon dooley some one yelled and
the cry was taken up from all quarters
the fans want action dooley had been
portrayed as the inventor thereof one
look at the bilious color on the face of
abie epps and socker mustered his most
violent expression there is a lot in an ex-
pression when one is facing a newcomer
if abie or any of his friends could read
socker knew that the demon idea was well
seated in that young mans mind
  the clang of the bell galvanized the aged
body of socker dooley if youve never
been there you cannot appreciate what the
combined odor of resin and perspiration
mean to the scrapper as the nimrod
breathes deep of the pine aroma of his
chosen playground so did socker dooley
chortle his knowledge of a return to the field
of endeavor which was his by right of con-
secration thereto
  he was across the ring like a bolt from
the heavens that expression was at the
height of its terror bestowing powers some-
how things looked different than ever before
to abie epps he whipped his hands into
fighting position quivered in anticipation
of some unknown thing commensurate with
the awfulness of those gleaming eyes-then
grinned sheepishly and did a ridiculous little
dance purportedly one of confidence
  then socker mailed the famous old
sock special delivery the elbow of
his right arm crooked the wrist arched
inwardly and the shoulder and hip on the
right side of his body swung into proces-
sion behind the flying fist doubtless abie
saw it coming in any event it was a
thing that was bound to assert itself sooner
or later with a thud that caused a pro-
longed o-o-o-h from the assembled
fans the big glove slammed against the
most prominent portion of abies pale
face
  the body of epps swung dizzily as
though on a pivot then sank floorward
the whites of the eyes showed a combina-
tion of terror and disinterest abies knees
landed in the resin and the agonized cries
of the gallery gods who swore particular
allegiance to the neighborhood whence he
came wafted him back into the land of
material things
  some one had told abie to  take a
count the words rang in his ears at the
moment some one was saying  five-
six  that would be the referee again
there popped into the dizzy mind of abie
further good advice that rang from the
hazy past  clinch that was what he
would do so he leaped to his feet and
grabbed the first thing he saw it hap-
pened to be the referee but this was of
no significance to abie he hung on
were those cheers which rang thunderous-
ly in his ears
  the third man in the ring cursed raved
and struggled to free himself seconds
shrieked words that meant nothing socker
galloped around the struggling men intent
upon one more opening for that right
finally it came again came the coordina-
tion back of the lightning swing and then
it happened through a mind that failed
to function clearly abie got an idea it
had to do with taking another count so
he swung sharply away from the man he
had been holding and dropped to one knee
  like a good many other ideas it was all
right except that it didnt work out ex-
actly as planned the flying glove of
socker shot over the wavering head of
abie and chugged neatly under the chin of
the referee a blissful smile of content
overspread the judicial features of that gen-
tleman with the grace of a dying swan
he piled himself inanimately beside the
kneeling abie the gallery gods set up an
incessant chant which was a fitting melody
to the tragedies being enacted
  but the mind of abie was beginning to
clear at his feet lay a vanquished foe
just how it all occurred abie didnt know
things happen with amazing rapidity in the
ring and the true fighter is he who takes
opportunity as she presents her glowing
self
  the thought of victory still further
cleared his mind then he saw socker
dooley standing nonplused and frightened
in the center of the ring if he read aright
the sockers mind he saw that the old-timer
was facing something new in his variegated
career at a moment like this unusual judg-
ment was required and socker didnt have
it but there was one here who boasted it
socker dooley demon

lewis latts accordingly socker dooley
turned toward his corner to get the proper
advice
  all that he saw was a wild look of agony
upon the managerial countenance too late
he realized its import
  whirling toward the center of the ring
he placed his genial mug directly in the
path of the trusty right of abie epps and
that was that
  abie regarded the fallen socker momen-
tarily then the roaring advice from the
maddened crowd percolated his dull wit
the time had come when some one must
count and the only man to do it was still
roaming the elysian fields of  poppy
grove
  abie rushed to the prone referee and
grasped him under the arms
   vake up fer gawds sake vake
up cow-int-cow-int he bellowed ex-
citedly  he iss k-nocked ouit pleese
cow-int
  the difference between the pugilist and
the layman was never more clearly demon-
strated than then despite the entreaties
of abie epps the referee slept peacefully
on whereas the good socker dooley gath-
ered his shattered faculties in a matter of
eight seconds he rose totteringly to his
feet and paused long enough to survey the
situation then with the stately tread of
one on a mission he veered forth to do bat-
tle in convincing manner
  abie chanced to see the form of socker
approaching again came that horror of
combat with demon dooley he refused
to rise again socker circled his prey all
in the ring were deaf to the pandemonium
outside it
  then the referee came to it wasnt a
sudden process he did nothing more than
open his eyes slowly but abie saw it what
if the referee blamed him he was safer
on his feet before dooley than on his knees
beside this abused personage
  so he rose socker leaped for him what
trick of fate caused the second stage of re-
turning consciousness to actuate the referee
in his first attempt to rise at that identical
moment ah well-who will ever know
  suffice it to say that he made the attempt
and became entangled in the flying feet of
socker dooley the result was to shoot
socker like a catapult through the air the
head of abie epps and that of socker met
immediately their bodies enfolded in a lov-
ing embrace as together they slid into the
folds of oblivion
  the referee shook himself as though to
get free of the tangle he rose gingerly to
his feet in his eyes beamed a far-away
look that bespoke lack of mental clarity
he poised himself a moment tipped for-
ward from the hips to view the tangle at his
feet then jerked upright in all his official
dignity like a drunken sailor he teetered
to the ropes and raised his hand for atten-
tion into the teeth of the roar that he
heard not nor understood he pronounced
his decision
   s a draw he babbled  the damn
fights a draw
  then he swayed increasingly to right and
left felt his clutch on the sustaining rope
slipping and finally in returned abandon
slipped dizzily to the floor
  we left an hour later and they were still
cheering
iii
  outside the arena socker sought to push
his way through the crowd in his pocket
he carried some six hundred american dol-
lars prosperity had returned on his arm
hung the talking lewis latts
  the discourse was interrupted by the
sudden appearance of a white haired lady
who peeked through a lorgnette
   ah mr dooley and did you accom-
plish your nefarious purpose she in-
quired
   are you back again growled socker
dooley
   but wait insisted lewis latts he of
the money thoughts  you may say for
socker dooley that his one regret is the
unfortunate premature ending to the bout
he had scarcely begun to fight given
more time he would have dismembered this
epps person with one annihilating crusher
as it was he landed but one blow and that
almost killed three men we are saving
his glove with the idea of selling the gold
from the teeth that are still imbedded in
the leather

on the stairs
the shrill of that voice rang on but
oiivetta heard no more what she
screamed instead she was listen-
ing to a turbulent outbursting of noises
from the lower part of the house doors
were crashing open deep hard voices were
calling to one another and over all she
could make out the bull-like roar of huge
tom lanier directing his men to the at-
tack then began the swift thunder of
many heavy feet rushing up the stairs be-
low them
  when that tumult began john hodge
had stretched out an arm of iron and barred
her advance now he caught her arm and
in his excitement his grip sank deeply into
her flesh yet she felt the pain almost as
a thing detached from her an experience
not of her body
   keep your courage now he said
 it means fighting have you the gun
 no-i-oh i left it below-
   good god well-then theres only
my hands but theres still a ghost of a
hope-in the darkness to help me-
  the roar of feet and the crashing sound
of voices pouring up at them drowned his
words
  he turned leaned wrenched at a balus-
ter it was torn from its place and he
shook it before him in a silent joy to show
that he was armed no matter how feebly
  in the darkness the old demoniac look
was in his face the look which had so fas-
cinated her and so repelled her
  and then the mass of men swerved up
the stairs at them
this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for november 

the stranger at the gate

  one came first as a sprinter darts out
before a field in the last leap for the tape
so this man suddenly shot out before the
others he whirled around the turn and
came at them far in front and then oli-
vetta knew that if she had had the gun
with her she would have been able to shoot
and kill without a tremor save of thank-
fulness
   no shooting panted a huge voice in
the rear the voice of great tom lanier
 knives boys slide a knife into the
damned long-legged rat-but no guns
they make too much noise we dont
want the whole town to hear us working
  that great voice beat into her ears and
she saw the flash of steel like a disembodied
pale flame in the shadows as the leader
leaped at john hodge
  the baluster wielded like a short club
rose and fell the knife fell with a clatter
the assailant flattened against the stairs
but behind him came three more swinging
about the turn so fierce was their gasp-
ing eagerness as they came to the kill that
they jammed in a sudden tangle between
the wall and the creaking sagging balus-
trade
  john hodge stooped and lifted the body
of his stricken man shoulder high with
a shout he cast the body into the faces of
the three he cast the body and he hurled
his own weight behind it and all the mass
went down into a groaning heap smashed
against the outer wall at the turning place
one form disentangled itself from the
shapeless masses lifted itself into the clear
  it was the gaunt wide-shouldered form
of john hodge he faced another man
laboring up the stairs in the rear of the
rest and in that last form she recognized
the squat and solid bulk of tom lanier
yet not an instant did john hodge hesitate
he sprang at the head of the giant and
the two crashed down the stairs
 olivetta sped in after them she
scooped from the stairs where it had fallen
from the hand of john hodge the baluster
with which he had stricken down the first
man and that small club might lend suf-
ficient weight to a blow from her arm to
aid hodge in a crisis
  she whirled around the corner of the
stairs one of the stunned breathless men
reared to a sitting posture and gripped at
her with an oath she struck the hand
away with a blow of the baluster she felt
the wood bite through to the bone she
heard a howl of rage and pain as the arm
was beaten down another hand caught
her skirt but she tore it away and speed-
ing on down the stairs she saw the two
tumble across the floor of the hall below
  they disentangled and rose to their feet
in this hall as in all the others there was
only one light burning at the farther end
a closely hooded dust-dimmed light and
in this hall it was further darkened by the
fact that it was nearly burned out and
what olivetta saw was merely two shadows
among shadows
  half stunned by their fall they had
staggered apart but plainly the big man
tom lanier was the more injured of the
two his own weight had helped to batter
him in the struggle down the stairs and
now as he reeled helplessly away john
hodge turned toward olivetta and with
a clear way before him made for the head
of the stairs
  she was beside him as she leaped down
the last few steps and then a shadow
flew by her struck john hodge and
knocked him headlong to the floor it was
the guard he had struck down in the second
hall above and he had recovered in time to
block their escape effectually he had
thrown himself bodily from the landing
above and the force of the fall while it
stunned john hodge tumbled the assailant
half senseless beside his victim
  and yonder was huge tom lanier curs-
ing and mumbling to himself still too
stunned to know what was actually going
on around him just as a prize fighter will
sometimes stagger through half a dozen
rounds striking warding mechanically but
all his movements directed by a subcon-
scious brain so tom reeled up and down
the hall groping blinded his forehead
had been gashed in the fall the blood he
could not wipe away as fast as it trickled
into his eyes a terrible spectacle in that
half light to olivetta
  past him she sped and dropped to her
knees beside john hodge his head was

argosy-allstory weekly
limp to her touch she shook him his
body was inert there -was no mark on his
lace but he was stunned completely
was he perhaps killed
  she glanced to the side there yawned
the stairs and one flight down them was
the street level and safety for her but
she could not leave him helpless in this
fashion it would be certain death to john
hodge and even though her staying could
do no good still her heart was sickened at
the thought of leaving him
  over him she crouched sobbing his
name shaking him in a frenzy of eager-
ness for on the stairs where he had
knocked down the four men a second or
two before they were rousing she heard
their groans their fierce curses one of
them came wavering down the stairs he
who had stunned hodge was now picking
himself off the floor and john hodge
himself was only beginning to gasp for
breath tom lanier came toward them
at a run his brute brain was cleared of
the fog of battle at last
  jack he cried what in hell are
you doing here over him what-by god
it aint jack
  a stream of profanity was turned upon
her and she was bidden stand back but
olivetta gripping the little heavy billet of
wood hard and hiding it in the fold of her
skirt stood with her shoulders pressed back
against the wall
  oh for gods name she pleaded to
him holding out her other hand  dont
touch him-let him go-hell do no more
harm-
   no more hes done enough
  he stepped closer
  stand off from him get - what
you-
  the last was a snarl of rage as she reso-
lutely stood her ground he raised his arm
for a back-handed stroke which would have
knocked her senseless to the floor and
then olivetta struck straight for his fore-
head
  at the last instant he saw the danger
and tossed up his striking hand to guard
against it but the guard was raised too late
the weapon struck home there was a
shiver of the wood in her gripping fingers
and tom lanier dropped heavily to his
knee
  help was coming to him now however
across the hall at the foot of the stairs he
who had just descended had discovered
them at last and with a hoarse shout start-
ed to the rescue and poor john hodge
was only now coming reeling blinded to
his feet
  she cried his name he turned toward
her a face contorted with the effort to un-
derstand with all his might he was strug-
gling to clear his brain and to control his
numbed limbs but here was an enemy al-
ready upon them and yonder down the
stairs lurched others
  even if she now wished however she
could escape they would stay to close
on this one man who had battered them
all so terribly and w-hile they were dis-
posing of him she could flee unhindered
but there was no thought of flight in the
mind of olivetta
  she sprang in before john hodge and
struck into the face of the oncoming man
the blow made him throw up his head and
reel there with his arms cast out she
struck again with all her might and a sav-
age thrill of satisfaction ran through her
as the stick tingled against her palm with
the-force of the blow she had struck him
squarely along the side of the head and he
lurched senseless to the floor
  tom lanier his face a bleeding mass
rushed on them and she whirled on him
only to find that john hodge had rim be-
fore her she saw the blows speed into the
face of lanier - saw him stagger away
then she whirled toward the stairs again
with john hodge striding at her side
  there were three men coming from the
stairs but as though the fighting had
made him drunk with battle john hodge
ran straight for them with a shout of exul-
tation she herself raced behind him feel-
ing that they were lost now indeed but
though the odds were so greatly in their
favor the three who blocked the path had
had enough of fighting they winced from
the encounter one man went down under
the driving fist of hodge the others
stepped away between them they rushed
to the top of the stairs and then down
                         	a
the stranger at the gate

  as they turned the landing place she
looked back the red face of tom lanier
was looming above them and behind him
came all of his legion but now she was
down in the lowest hall she reached the
front door the knob gave under her hand
and they plunged into the blessed cool the
divine silence of the outer night
chapter xxix
john hodge speaks
there was one great advantage the
door opened flush with the street and
there was no flight of steps to de-
scend they turned to the side and there
john hodge dragged her back into a narrow
passage between two houses
  they had barely turned the corner of
the house when tom lanier and his men
went by running blindly ahead in their
furious rage
  then they heard lanier calling to his
men-calling in a half muffled voice to bid
them scatter and search around all the
houses for every house was vacant and
in one of the passages they surely must be
  a cellar door was to their left against
it john hodge set his shoulder and the
door gave way with a faint scraping they
stepped into a dark and musty smelling in-
terior
   but theyll follow us here- breathed
olivetta
   theyll never think of looking for us
here-theyll at least comb all the passages
around the houses before they start to go
through the houses themselves said john
hodge
  they stood quietly for a while a foot-
fall went down the cement walk outside
and as it passed she pressed closer to
hodge he found her hand and patted it
   well start up now he murmured
 theyve gone farther down the line of
houses but step softly
  he produced a small electric torch and
with the aid of an occasional flash from it
they were able to find their way among the
cellar rooms until they reached a stairs
which brought them to the first floor of the
house there in a corner of a great blank
   	a
dusty room they sat down on the floor to
rest and wait
  still through the wall of the house and
the closed windows they could hear an
occasional sound of the pursuit a voice
calling lightly or footfalls in a clattering
chorus but these at length were quiet
and another set of noises began small in-
timate sounds which had not been notice-
able before but which now grew into series
of small murmurs and squeaks like the
treading of men up a hall or a great soft-
breathing sound as when a door opens and
a draft rushes through
  to olivetta it began to seem that tom
lanier and all his corps of assistants were
stealing up on them she could hear the
scraping of the cellar door as it opened
and after that she could hear every ap-
proaching sound as they stumbled across
the concrete cellar floor and then climbed
the noisy stairs to the first floor and crossed
the kitchen and entered the hall and then
paused with a hand on the knob of the door
of the room where she and john hodge were
then waiting
  but john hodge was speaking no longer
in a whisper but in a low voice which was
a proof that there was no foundation for
her fears she could have blessed him for
the solid strength of his nerves and the sup-
port they gave her
    well wait here till the dawn begins
he said  because thats the time that
paralyzes tom lanier and his ilk they
hate to have the eye of the day looking at
them you see it seems to read them
through and through and yet thats the
time that the rest of the city will be most
thoroughly asleep we can wait until then
and then go out safely-safely for you at
least
   and you she asked
   i said john hodge  have no right
to be considered i have to take my
chances with the rest
  she shook her head
   that she said  is not true
   why he asked curiously
   because i have discovered the truth
about you after all john hodge
  so mortally thick was the blackness in
the room that she could only vaguely make

argosy-allstory weekly
 out the broadening of his outline as he
 turned toward her
  then-whats the truth madame
 it seemed to her that there was a change
 in his tone a peculiar touch of anxiety in it
  i have discovered she said  that you
 are an honest man
  what he gasped  at the end of a
 trail on which youve found me with stolen
 jewels do you mean it stolen jewels
 thieves and knaves for companions-
 dont say all that she cried and
 pressed her hands across her ears
  but how do you explain
  i dont explain said olivetta  i
 used to try to explain everything now-
 i cant even explain myself i-i-i find
 myself sitting here and looking back on all
 the terrible things which have happened as
 though they were simply a part of a great-
 great game of some kind-dont you see
  god bless you said john hodge
  and yet she said  if you would ex-
 plain-just a little-
  you couldnt believe
  you dont know said olivetta  im
 a great believer i-ive even liked fairy
 stories quite lately
  you want me to tell you
  yes yes everything about yourself
 because you see ive guessed the main
 thing-that youre an honest man
  where is your proof
  because no dishonest man could have
 done all the things youve done youve
 been brave youve been generous youve
 thought more for me than for yourself all
 the evening and yet i came here to trap
 you oh it sickens me to think of how i
 came after you john hodge
 he made a gesture of disclaim
  very well he said at length  ill try
 to tell you so that you can believe
  and begin with your real name
  my real name
  because john hodge-doesnt fit you
 he laughed softly
  my real name is a stopper for you i
 am really francis fitzroy blackwater
 campbell
  scotch cried the girl happily
  dour scotch he admitted  but chief-
 ly american at that
   francis fitzroy blackwater campbell
she echoed  why on earth did you ever
pick out such a name as john hodge
    because take it by and large its about
the best contrast one could think of for my
real name
   it is of course she added  unless
it were shortened to frank campbell
   they never would shorten it to that
sighed he  they raised me in the midst
of a flock of tutors and governors and what
not you understand when i stopped
being master francis i became mr camp-
bell because my father died while i was
young a stout-hearted old aunt took
charge of me and managed to mix up my
affairs so terribly that when i came to the
end of my college career i found that my
total assets were an invitation to hunt big
game in india-that and a large assortment
of clothes and rifles and a scattering of
books otherwise i didnt have a cent in
the world my total income-bringing prop-
erty was lost
   thats rather a facer for a youngster
but i managed to survive i was too
keen for the hunting trip to care much
about any thing else i was living in the
midst of visions of charging elephants and
dying tigers
  he laughed again in reminiscence
   then there was no truth in it when you
said you couldnt use a revolver
   im afraid not but in the pinch we
were in then it was better that you should
have a gun with you-right up to the very
end-
   i understand she said hurriedly
   well he went on  at any rate i
boarded the boat with the rest of our party
we hit havre then we shot across con-
tinent and grabbed another boat on the far
side of suez and wound up in the jungle in
due time he sighed  to cut that part
short-
    but i dont want it cut short protest-
ed olivetta  i want to hear every single
detail
   that would make it too long really
the fact is we had a fine party the rest
of em liked it well enough but i was fair-
ly stung i had my luck with me i
slaughtered beasts right and left as i never
the stranger at the gate

have since as a matter of fact my luck
was so very good that it attracted a little
attention and people began to pick me up
   you know how it is with young fel-
lows they dont have to pay much of the
way theyre supported by the people they
help to have a good time and thats the
way it was with me i had my togs and my
guns which id laid in long before the finan-
cial crash was announced to me and i was
taken in hand by the very best
   wherever people were making up a
party to hunt the big game some one had
a word to say in my behalf it was said
that i brought good luck and in fact i
seemed to for not a single expedition that
i went on turned out a frost we always
located the stuff and got it
   you may feel that tm playing a loud
horn in my own behalf but ive hunted
for a good many years since that time and
ive never again run into such luck
   of course the success of it all went to
my head i suppose i was an unbearable
young beast for a time every one was
turning to me every one was paying me
royal attention because when men go out
to hunt the best hunter is the king and dic-
tates all that matters is that a man can
hold a gun straight when there is a living
target in sight a billionaire is only a ten-
derfoot in a hunting camp until he shows
what he can do with a gun
   but after a while i began to wake up
to the fact that life is something more than
a hunting party i began to be dunned for
the money i owed and in the midst of this
awakening i received my first visit from-
what shall i call him because even now 
cant give him his true name or his true
title suppose i call him rajah pundar
then at any rate i can string the story
on that title as well as on another
chapter xxx
a rajahs difficulty
npo olivetta it seemed that the darkness
 made the story thrice vivid for every
word he uttered called up in her mind
a picture contrasted on absolute blackness
 rajah pundar went on john hodge
for olivetta still could not think of him
by the other name he had given  was a
little slender man who went about with an
eternal smile he seemed to know some-
thing about life which enable him to laugh
at every one who took it seriously for his
own part he never pretended to do anything
worth while
   he had his education given him at ox-
ford and a good job they had made of it
he had his greek pat he was fond of
theocritus and never went far without a
pocket volume of the stuff in other things
too he was a good deal of an exquisite
and he knew much in fact that when he
laughed at life one felt there must be some-
thing in what he thought a fellow like
that can do a devilish lot of harm in pass-
ing
   the rajah looked every inch a euro-
pean even in his complexion his father
had married an english girl and the rajah
had his mothers skin but in the whites
of his eyes there was a smoky tint it was
very slight it hardly existed outside of
ones imagination but once it had been seen
one could not see anything else do you
understand
   yes she said and shivered a little
she could not tell why this picture of the
rajah thrilled her so but the smoky eyes
and the wise smile were vivid to the life
   the rajah went on francis camp-
bell was a jolly good fellow he kept me
well entertained for the better part of an
hour and then he drifted around to the
serious purpose of his visit
  by what approaches he managed it i
cant remember it was delicately done i
assure you and he was able to let me
know that he understood i was penniless
owing a great deal of money and apt at
any time to be exposed to shame if some
of my friends and creditors awoke to the
fact that i had become simply a sponger
without the means of paying back what i
had borrowed from my hosts here and there
   and that in fact was exactly what i
had done it sounds devilish bad but at
the time-well i had simply drifted ahead
and taken the easiest way-
   oh said olivetta  i can understand
that

argosy-allstory weekly
  and she found in the darkness his arm
and dropped her hand lightly upon it
   thank you said he  its fine of you
to say that
  he paused a moment and then he went
ahead more lightly  i was man enough to
shudder when the rajahs words made me
reflect a bit i saw exactly what i had
done strange how it clears ones mind
when one reflects what the world will say
in judging ones actions at least i was
brought up short i was in a cold sweat
and then he made his first proposi-
tion to me
   it was magnificent it was worthy of
a king instead of a half ruler over a miser-
able little square quarter of an inch on
the map of the himalayas what he sug-
gested was that i come up into his moun-
tains with him and become his official hun-
ter he himself he declared liked to go
hunting but since an ugly accident a year
or two before his nerve had been shaken
he made the confession with a shrug of the
shoulders and a perfect good grace i
should have suspected him then no real
man would have been able to confess cow-
ardice as easily as he at any rate he
went on with his kingly suggestion that he
be allowed to pay me enough salary in ad-
vance for me to clear off my debts then
i should come up into his hill country with
him and if i liked the place and the work
stay until i reached a green old age but
if i did not like the country and the work
i could leave as soon as i pleased and
simply owe him the salary which i had not
earned
   what could be more generous than that
on the face of it
   oh said olivetta  it was too gener-
ous you must have known that there was
something wrong behind it
   sitting here a dozen years later said
francis campbell alias john hodge  sit-
ting here a dozen years later in a dark
room with those twelve wasted years be-
hind me-why i can look back and see that
i was then a young fool but at the time
it seemed a not impossible offer i was
newly out of college i was newly out of
the habit of thinking in hundreds of thou-
sands and besides i believed in the ro-
mance which must exist somewhere in the
world
   when a boy is under twenty-five yes
or even under thirty he keeps feeling that
he is just around the corner from great hap-
piness he keeps expecting to find himself
plunged in a fairy story of one kind or an-
other at the next turning of the page and
that was the way with me
    for the sake of dignity i told the rajah
that i must have a day to think things over
and arrange my ideas on the subject but
at the end of twenty-four hours when i
called on him i was hot with eagerness to
take him up for that morning i had re-
ceived a dun for money a very stiff little
note such as an angry man can write
   the offer of the rajah seemed on re-
flection so impossible that i hardly dared
broach the subject to him when i saw him
but he opened the talk himself and reiter-
ated all that he had said the day before
and i accepted at once
   so there i was in a fortnight headed
for the mountains in his train he had
insisted that there was no need for hurry
he had advanced me even more than his
promise and urged me to do some entertain-
ing on my own part before i started for the
hills
   of course i was very glad to have the
means of doing that i repaid some of the
debts of hospitality which i had been pil-
ing up and then we went up into the
mountains together
   the rajahs country was like the rest
of india under english rule but here the
english rule was a very mild yoke for the
simple reason that the rajahs country was
hardly worth governing his people were
a horn- handed lot of hunters a wild thrift-
less gang and nothing in the world could
have extracted taxes from them except a
superstitious awe for their ancient ruling
house which was now represented by the
rajah
   i looked about the country for a time
and then i dropped in on the rajah i had
been there for two weeks and he had said
not a word about a hunting party when i
called on him i brought with me an offer to
resign at once
   he asked me what was wrong and i
the stranger at the gate

told him that it was a very good joke but
a joke which i could not exactly appreciate
if he wanted hunters he only needed to
pick at random from among his mature male
subjects any random choice he made was
almost sure to be an expert as good as i
   the rajah listened politely until i was
ended and then he shrugged his shoulders
no european can shrug shoulders with the
expressiveness of a hindoo and then he
admitted that when he brought me into the
hills he had no desire to make a hunter of
wild beasts out of me what he wanted
was a hunter of men
  l he was just as blunt as that but after
he had given me the first shock he went
on to explain more at length and with in-
finite smoothness
   it seemed that his revenues were falling
short of their old fullness and the reason
was that there was another pretender to
the throne that pretender was a half
brother-suppose i call him randar ran-
dar had set himself up in the hills and an-
nounced that he had been robbed of his
birthright and while he never had been
able to seriously threaten the throne of
pundar yet he caused such a disturbance
in the minds of the mountaineers that they
decided that they would pay no tribute to
either of the claimants until the dispute
were settled
   because they said if pundar were the
true lord over that section of the mountains
he should be able to prove it by wiping
out randar instantly with the aid of justice
and the divine power which was vested in
him neither would they pay their old
measure of tribute to pundar nor would
they whole-heartedly assist him in chasing
randar and running him to the ground
for who could tell the man they hunted
down might after all be the rightful claim-
ant to the throne
   so that pundar found himself with an
income cut in two and the hard added bur-
den of the necessity of supporting a little
army of a hundred or so men to defend his
capital in case randar and his handful of
miscreants should attempt to sweep down
on him from the higher mountains where
they took refuge
   rajah pundar for once forgot to smile
as he told me this yarn he even went
out and had the army mustered for my in-
spection and they were a ratty looking
crew if ever i saw one most of them
were imported because as he had just ex-
plained he could not trust his own subjects
to fight against a man who for all they
knew might be their rightful ruler they
were too apt to step to one side and let the
two brothers settle the matter subject to
the arbitration of god alone
   but pundar was not inclined to sub-
mit to such a test as i have said he was
a little slender man and his half brother
the false randar was a gangling fellow up-
ward of six feet in height and with little
short of two hundred pounds of brawn in
his favor so pundar had brought in these
half starved mercenaries who being mor-
tally despised by the inhabitants of the
country brought pundar into still further
disfavor with his subjects
   yet he could not dispense with his
army and his army dared not move outside
the royal presence so to speak for fear it
would be mobbed by non-combatants
   and in the meantime cunning randar
hung in the upper mountains and swooped
down like an eagle time and again to carry
off plunder from the valleys and to carry
off a few new adherents each time for
every descent he made unscathed helped
to convince the natives that randar must
indeed be of the right blood royal and
the true heir to the throne
   now what pundar wanted was a white
man in command a daring adventurer who
would in the first place improve the morale
of his  army  and in the second place
who would be willing to risk his life among
the upper crags of the mountains in the
chase of randar
   i listened until he was through and
then i asked him why he didnt appeal the
case to the english but he explained that
the english were easy to call in but hard
as the devil to send out i asked him to
go over the main points of dispute and
he proved to me clearly enough that ran-
dar was a rank impostor after that i
had no doubts i decided that i would do
my best for him i knew that pundar was
a rascal but even a rascal can be in the

argosy-allstory weekly
right now and then and besides this rascal
had treated me with the most princely gen-
erosity from the very first so i determined
to fight his fight for him
chapter xxxl
the fight on the mountain
 first of all i looked over the army
gathered together in a flock they
numbered about a hundred and fifty
men and they seemed a crew of wrecks and
derelicts but when i went over them one
by one i found some hardy fellows in the
lot i weeded out forty men as hard as
nails all handy with weapons and reck-
less enough to suit the prince of evil i
added to the lot a dozen men about the
palace who were so stanchly attached to
pundar that they would fight for him that
gave me only around fifty fighters for the
army while randar was reported to have
close to a hundred followers but if his
hundred were at all like pundars original
hundred and fifty i had no care for the
numbers three cowards mixed with ten
brave men will start the ten brave men
running when it comes to a pinch panic
is like fever its catching and it spreads
as fast as a bullet travels
  well i had my army boiled down and
ready for training then i managed to
get them into a uniform a cheap contrap-
tion in red and blue cotton cloth the
bright colors would make them perfect tar-
gets but the bright colors were worth while
on account of the effect they had on the
spirits of the men my men felt braver in
red and blue than they would have felt in
drab in three days i had them rivaling
one another in the care they took of their
uniforms and inside the same three days
i had come to know them well enough to
pick out their natural leaders i had half
a dozen of the hardiest raised in rank
which meant giving them better pay and
brighter colors to wear they were gau-
dier than rear admirals on dress parade
those corporals of mine and after they
had been  made i had no troubles about
discipline i simply held each corporal
accountable for his eight or ten men and
if one of the men overstepped the bounds
he was beaten to a bloody pulp by his su-
perior officer and after that my next
step was to double the pay
   that sounds extravagant but i could
have quadrupled the pay and still it would
have been less than a decent wage how-
ever the raise in pay brought a wail from
the treasurer that made even the rajah sit
up and prick his ears
   he called me in to interview him and
pointed out very politely that to reduce
the size of an army was commendable if
one thought it still large enough to do the
work but that to double the pay was ob-
viously doing away with the good work i
had already done
   i heard the little rascal to the finish
and then i informed him that his former
army had done their fighting entirely
through talk but that i intended to get my
boys out and work them
   and i lived up to my word for two
weeks i drilled them i didnt make them
fall into formations that wasnt what i
wanted formations werent worth a con-
tinental on the sides of mountains where
the best trained company of kings guards
in the world couldnt have held a straight
line my training consisted of marching
them straight across country and back
again by the hardest routes i could find
and i hung up prizes for the men who
made the trips in the best time and best
condition taking packs on their shoulders
as they went
   the result was that at the end of two
weeks i had worked them into good condi-
tion their cheeks were thin and drawn
their muscles were hard the outer coat-
ing of fat was gone they began to jar
and wrangle with one another in short
they were in good fighting condition like
a pack of half-starved dogs
   i had been drilling into their heads a
fey commands such as common words for
a charge an advance at slow pace seeking
for cover as they worked forward and such
things including the knack of simulating
a retreat-running like the very devil for
a ways and then suddenly whirling about
dropping on their bellies and blazing away
at an imaginary line of foes
the stranger at the gate

   at the end of the two weeks my boys
were in splendid shape i was almost afraid
to trust myself among them and when
i had them in that condition i started out
to find randar
   in the meantime randar as i learned
through a spy i had sent out on big pay
had been worried by the reports he heard
about activities in the camp of his dear
brother his way of meeting the danger
was to recruit every man he could lay
hands upon those who were not willing
to fight for him he pressed into the service
anyway the means did not matter with
randar any more than they did with pun-
dar the ends were what he had his eye
fixed upon the one great difference was
that randar himself was a good two-fisted
fighter and able to set a wholesome ex-
ample for his army
   he had gathered for the emergency
close to two hundred men all equipped with
firearms of varying centuries and so pre-
pared the brave fellow retreated to his
highest mountains and waited
   i came after him in a leisurely way
i didnt want to wear out my boys without
necessity for it and i managed it so that
they got within striking distance of ran-
dar while still in the very pink of condi-
tion
  	we started the battle in the approved
indian fashion at a distance of half a
mile randars men began shooting hundred
weights of lead into the rocks in our general
direction i kept a half dozen expert rifle-
men skirting along onto the highest and
most commanding points from which as
we advanced they potted a few rounds at
randars army the result was that we
kept randars men ducking for close cover
and hardly daring to show their heads
while we worked up that murdering hillside
among the bowlders my sharpshooters
were picking off randars men one by
one and randars volleying were carv-
ing the air to bits and splashing on the
rocks so that my total casualty list in
the climb consisted of one slightly wound-
ed in the head and in a red fighting rage
because of his hurt
   however my boys had held their fire
so long that they were ravenous for action
that long slow careful approach under
fire had taught them to heartily despise
the marksmanship of their enemies every
step in reality was convincing them of the
righteousness of the cause of pundar
otherwise god would have sent the bullets
on a straighter line against them finally
i had them bulwarked behind rocks a short
hundred and fifty yards from randars
boys
   the blockhead had simply posted his
men in a massed line without attempt to
use intelligently the immense opportunities
which those rocks offered all i had to do
was to place a dozen of my boys on high
points in order to establish a plunging fire
that dropped them by the half dozen
   randars lines were sweating blood
and a loud yell and a charge would prob-
ably have carried his position already
some of his boys were sneaking away in
twos and threes but i didnt want to
charge that line of rocks lose seven or eight
of my own boys and only scatter the evil
of the enemy over the mountain country
   i may sound bloodthirsty to you but
i wanted to wipe out that gang of thieves
and robbers you see i was very young
and i was seeing a beautiful chance for a
career among those cold peaks i saw my-
self as a sort of grand vizier with the reins
of government dropped into my hands by
the trusting pundar i would send him
away to paris to enjoy his fat income in
the meantime i would stay at home and
start improving things
   if i could introduce a trickle of ameri-
can gold with an investment of a few hun-
dred thousand a solid burst of income
would be the result and i knew whom to
speak to to bring in the investors but
first of all i must make the country safe
to live in and the best way to go about it
was to wipe out the murderers who were
living now under the head of randar
   so i waited until randars men had
delivered another desperate blind shaky
volley and then i gave my signal to simu-
late a retreat
   my boys did it wonderfully it was
just the sort of game they could appreciate
they leaped up from behind the rocks
randars men had just fired and their old

argosy-allstory weekly
muskets hadnt been reloaded therefore
a bit of self-exposure was harmless my
boys therefore jumped up waved their
arms yelled and brandished their repeat-
ing rifles by way of showing their terror
and then sprinted away shrieking among
the rocks as though a panic had taken hold
on them and they were pursued by a legion
of devils
   that was enough for randars cut-
throats they had already suffered pretty
heavily at the hands of my sharpshooters
now they went out for revenge they
didnt wait to reload their old-fashioned
guns they threw them away by the score
and whipped out their knives their natural
weapons and came with their eyes rolling
and their teeth showing
   they dashed across the clear space be-
fore their lines they raced around the
ledge of rocks behind which my boys had
lain and there they stopped
   for they got the contents of fifty re-
peating rifles in their faces my fine lads
had run a little way according to their
training and then they dropped to their
bellies tucked the rifle butts into the hol-
lows of their shoulders saw that the maga-
zines were full and waited
   when randars outfit tore through the
rocks they were salted away in crowds
randar himself went down with ten bullets
through his head and breast and that
charging line of his men stopped staggered
and turned to run
   but they didnt run far i had set
apart ten of my best men to the right flank
when randars men charged they had
moved down and occupied randars old
lines only a handful mind you but all
expert shots all with good modern guns
and oceans of ammunition and the ten
were ample to stop the return of randars
rascals they came swarming back met
that counter fire in their faces staggered
again and then were caught by another
blast of murder from the rear where my
main body had moved up again to a closer
range
   and then the remnant-the wretched
remnant of randars boys-ran down the
mountainside throwing away even their
knives and shrieking for the help of kindly
deities how many got away i cant say
some of my boys when they came wearily
back from the chase that evening declared
that they had run down every mothers son
of them-that the enemy was utterly an-
nihilated but i imagine that their en-
thusiasm had run away with them at
least when i sat down on a rock and
looked at the burned palm of my left hand
-burned by the heat of the rifle barrel you
understand-i knew that i had done a good
job for clever pundar i was very much
satisfied with myself i was very much
satisfied with the intelligence he had shown
in picking me out for this nasty job and
then i went to examine the camp of the
enemy and collect the plunder
chapter xxxii
a mystery explained
he paused for such a time that she
stared curiously at him through the
darkness and made out that he had
dropped his chin upon a supporting fist
while he stared into blank distance straight
before him
  at length he continued in a changed
voice with the exultation gone out of it
   that camp was simply a mess of
course there was only one decent habita-
tion along the whole lines and that was the
cave which randar himself had occupied
before the battle with a pair of his wives
it was quite habitable and among other
things i found the treasury a big iron
bound chest which had held the cash of
randar it was absolutely empty with
the cash had disappeared everything worth
having in the rest of the cave a few of my
handy lads had preceded me
   i had them caught and i threatened to
hang them up by the thumbs unless they
instantly confessed they finally confessed
-that they had taken the money to keep it
for me until we should come down from
the campaign and return to the palace of
the rajah i took every cent from them
but i simply redistributed the money giv-
ing every man in the army an equal share
the treasure furnished them-there were
forty-five left alive-with nearly a hun-
the stranger at the gate

dred dollars apiece and they considered
themselves rich
   i watched them start celebrating and
then i went back into randars cave and
looked about among the wreckage there
was nothing worth examining except the
old treasure chest and as the night came
on with a stiff wind from the snow of the
upper summits i called in some of the lads
and told them to smash up the box for fire-
wood
   they set to work on it but it was
a hard job there was an interlacing of
steel laths they had to be battered apart
and finally they had stripped away the
steel netting and thrown the wooden parts
on the fire
   it was such a cleverly reenforced chest
that i looked over the skeleton and not
until then i noticed a little steel section
which was more of a small box than a
section of the lathing and when i ex-
amined it more closely i found that it was
in reality what had been a secret com-
partment buried in the wood of the bottom
part of the box i chiseled it away from
the rest and then i started to work on
the little lock but i could not open it
except by cutting through the steel
   my men were scattered about the fire
outside the little cave and in the cave it-
self i was at work until midnight before
i got the box open and found on the inside
bedded in a wad of green soft silk the
pearl which logan called the sheik-this
pearl which i now have in my hand
  she saw the shadow of his raised hand
through the darkness his voice quivered
with triumph
   i knew little about pearls he went on
 but i knew enough to tell the sheik is
worth a fortune and i stayed awake an-
other hour dreaming about the uses i would
make of the money after the sale then i
went to sleep
   i woke up in the early dawn and the
first thing i did was to reach for the pearl
i had put it in a sock and then drawn the
sock on and wrapped up in my blankets
but i found that the sock was empty
   some clever thief had unfolded the
blankets at my feet cut the stocking with
a razor or a razor sharp knife so that i
felt nothing and removed the pearl and
he had been cool enough to wrap the blan-
ket softly around my feet afterward so that
the cold might not waken me
   the first thing i did was to call the
roll and i found that my most trusted
lieutenant he who had led the flanking
force which afterward occupied the aban-
doned lines of randars men and drove
them down the hill to annihilation was
gone he was a very intelligent half-breed
his name was louis kern 
  the one armed man cried olivetta
   he had two good arms at that time
and he knew how to use both of them i
didnt wait to get back to the palace of
pundar it was a good thing that i didnt
i learned afterward that he was so much
disturbed by the loyalty of the army to me
that when i returned he planned to give
me a cup of wine after drinking which
i should fall into a sleep from which there
would be no waking but what i did was
to take two of my most faithful soldiers
and start with them on the trail of louis
kern
   it was a strange trail and a wild trail
it brought us down to the sea eventually
and there louis kern-i am telling you
what i found out partly then and partly
afterward-was in turn robbed of the
sheik the men who robbed him took to
the open sea in a small sloop and the
sloop was wrecked off the shore of ceylon
you heard that from samuel logan though
of course the yarn which he told about
the diver who brought up the pearl on his
last dive as he was about to retire-that
was simply nonsense
   i had met logan while i was on the
trail of louis kern i met him under pe-
culiar circumstances so complicated that it
would take a long story to explain it to you
but the fact wras that logan thought he
had rescued me from punishment for a mur-
der i was entirely innocent-in fact the
calcutta police last year discovered the
real criminal but logan was convinced
of my guilt and yet he did what he could
for me and i in turn thought at first that
he was an extremely good natured fellow
the result was that i told him exactly what
had happened to me

argosy-allstory weekly
   i left logan at the same point where i
lost track of the thief and the sloop which
now carried the sheik
   you can see the situation which held
then logan and i and louis kern knew
about the pearl and there was also the
crew on the sloop who knew about it but
when they went down it was logan who
first discovered the fact and logan again
who took out the tug and the diving appa-
ratus and went to search the bottom of the
sea for the sheik
   i had wind of what he was about and
wanted to go with him but he now dis-
claimed me and tried to betray me to the
indian police on account of that murder
of which i was at that time accused i had
to hide from the police and at the same
time track logan and see what he was able
to recover from the sea
   another person was doing the same
thing and that was louis kern there fol-
lowed the adventure on commodore das-
coms yacht the incidents of that i sup-
pose were very much as logan told but
he was a monumental liar and it is possible
he may have falsified some of the details
   after that there was nothing for me
to do but wait and hope louis kern and
logan were doing the same thing you can
imagine the situation logan was a dis-
credited thief sponger and liar known to
a thousand men for what he was louis
kern was a villainous half-breed and i
could not appeal to the law because the
law was waiting to string me up by the
neck for the murder of a poor old man in
calcutta
  you observe that commodore dascom
was in control and so long as he lived
he continued to be in control in the
meantime louis kern had joined the
household of the commodore had been
thrown out of it again under the peculiar
circumstances to which logan alluded and
he and logan had joined forces
   i in the meantime lay in the offing
i had made one secret trip back to india
in the hope of securing sufficient evidence
to clear myself of that horrible murder
charge but i nearly put my neck in the
noose and escaped by a scant inch
   after that there was nothing i could
do but wait i had to pick up a living as
i could i did all sorts of things i be-
came a guide and hunter in africa for sev-
eral years i toured here and there and
i had some years fn the russian army but
at last i found myself in hawaii keeping
an eye upon logan and louis kern when
the news of the death of commodore das-
com arrived
   the next day after that news appeared
in the papers they were on the high seas
i followed them to san francisco there
i learned that they had gone on to new
york and i followed again
   in fact it was an easy matter to put
two and two together and know what the
story must be the moment they heard of
the death of the commodore the moment
they saw as i had seen that no mention
of the great pearl was made in the published
will of dascom they had gone on to see
what they could do and that fitted in with
what i had already suspected louis kern
had learned something about the permanent
hiding place of the sheik but he had al-
ready suffered so terribly from the anger
of the old commodore that he dared not
tell his secret to a soul he was waiting for
the death of dascom and samuel logan
in the meantime supported kern in the
hope of securing a share from him when
the pearl was taken
   now that they were heading for new
york i knew that they would be making
an attempt on the house of the commodore
and i determined to be there before them
and rob them of the spoils i consid-
ered myself the rightful owner of the pearl
randar in the first place had owned the
pearl and had kept it in reserve to be sold
as a last resource to win back the country
which pundar ruled pundar had expressly
declared that any plunder taken from ran-
dars army was to be my personal property
and therefore the pearl was mine i can-
not imagine a better right  had fought
for it and won it squarely
   you know how i appeared at dascom
house and when louis kern and logan
saw me on the lawn you were unable to
read the rage in their faces but i could
   that night i saw logan busy at the
globe and i knew that the globe must have
the stranger at the gate

something to do with the pearl so i came
down myself to take a look at it later on
i could make nothing of it and while i
studied it i heard a noise at the window
and knew that logan was spying on me i
went wild at that i ran out into the gar-
den but the clever devil had faded into the
night air-
   it was i and not logan
   you
   yes
   good gad but i understand at any
rate i went back upstairs to my room
naturally i could not sleep i had to keep
awake and on watch to see what logan or
kern accomplished
   i came down again and after another
walk i came in and saw the shadow move
in the hall as i told you before that
brought me to find you bound in the
closet-
   and you really hadnt put me there
yourself
 i upon my honor-
   just your word is enough but my
head swims
   let me tell you what had actually hap-
pened i have guessed at it i think louis
kern went down to the steel globe to steal
a march on logan-they must have agreed
to open it in each others presence but
he found that the globe was already opened
and you olivetta dascom were bending
over the globe
   he attacked you as you came out held
you down and searched you while i walked
past you down the darkened hall and then
he gagged and tied you and put you in the
hall closet while he went to find logan
and get an explanation from him
   you went back to your room after id
let you out and then logan decided that
what he had done was not enough he
played pig and tried to scoop in your em-
erald because he had heard the talk about
it that night
  but the shooting of logan cried
olivetta unable to contain her impatient
excitement  oh how-
   dont you see he said  that there
would have been no point in my doing it
 but- she began
   i dont blame you for doubting said
he  after that shooting the jewels were
stolen
  but he seemed to be sure that what
he had to say about you-
   exactly said francis campbell  he
did not know that the real murderer of old
henry tanfaran in calcutta had confessed
last year he thought that a word from
him would throw me into the arms of the
police that was what he was about to
tell to the crowd when the bullet struck
him and stopped his speech
   and you
   of course i saw by his preliminaries
what he was leading up to and just before
he reached the crisis when he was to an-
nounce my name and my supposed crime
i slipped out of the room i wanted to
telephone to a new york paper and try to
find out from a reporter i knew if they
could verify the story of the confession con-
cerning the tanfaran affair but before
i could reach a telephone the shot came
from the man who stood at the window
and fired through if any of the people in
the room had noted the time i left it they
would have seen that i did not have the
time to go around to the outside of the
house and fire the shot
   then who did
   i dont know i can only guess but
ive been in hiding all this time playing a
game of hide and seek and trying to trap
the man i think did the shooting
   but oh sighed olivetta  i begin to
believe-why i want to sing it makes me
so happy
   god bless you he said quietly
   will you try to explain one thing more
you see im at a point when i will be-
lieve almost anything but what did it
mean when i saw you run down the hall
and knock down the detective with your
gun
   has one thing occurred to you said
he  if i had been a murderer and if
my own life was forfeit would i have
thrown my gun at that detective and tried
to knock him down with it as i luckily
did no i should have shot him through
the head and gone on with one danger re-
moved from my rear
   i know she said  ive thought of

argosy-allstory weekly
that but my iather-when i reached his
room-
   you found him wild with rage said
he  and ready to tear the world in two
to get at me and there was a perfectly
good reason for him to be angry i dont
like to tell stories out of school but heres
a case where it will do no harm im sure
at least i have to save my owti hide
   this is the truth about my attack on
your father
   when i knew that the murder was
blamed on me and by the shout that went
up after the shooting i knew it at once i
turned and bolted and got safely out of the
grounds then i came back with the de-
termination to get at the sheik i had
heard about how you were robbed by the
simple expedient of listening in on a tele-
phone and taking off some of the messages
which were passing to new york and
i guessed that it must have been some mem-
ber of your family who had exchanged
those agates for the jewels it was too pat
else
   i picked out a person with a sense of
humor plenty of coolness and ready wit
and laid the blame upon him in other
words i accused your father and went to
search his room the reason i accused
him also was because i had gathered that
he had perhaps some debts which were not
known to his family and in fact it turned
out that way
   when i reached his room i found the
whole stock of the jewels of that stock
i took only the sheik that was the only
one to which i had any claim the others
were the rightful property of your father
as heir of old commodore dascom i left
him the whole stock and went on my way
but the next day he did not say a word
about having all the jewels saving the sheik
in his hands he has sold those jewels at
underground markets and the result is
that he begins to show evident signs of
prosperity
  olivetta glanced back into her memory
of the last few days it was exactly as
francis campbell had said hugh dascom
had shown a growing recklessness so far
as the marriage of his daughter to some rich
catch was concerned and his gay spirits
had exceeded anything he had been known
to show before
   then its all true breathed olivetta
 and i may believe in you
  so help me god it is pure truth
and there was one other true thing i have
told you olivetta
  she knew what was coming but she lis-
tened with her heart beating in her throat
yes she whispered
   when we stood in the garden-all that
i did or said had my heart behind it dear 
she could not speak
   do you believe me still
   yes murmured olivetta
  his arms leaped around her but sudden-
ly she fought herself away
   no no she said  listen theyve
found us-they have found us-
  he leaned back down the hall came a
soft and regular ticking sound as of some
one walking stealthily and bringing these
creaks from the floor
chapter xxxiii
tense moments
there was no question about the
reality of the noise or what caused it
the murmurs which the sweep of
drafts had caused before might disturb a
nervous mind but there was a world of
difference between them and this concrete
fact the footfalls crept on to aplace
which must have been near the door of the
room in which they sat
  frank campbell with a silent pressure
of his hand bade her stay where she was
he himself began to rise slowly to his feet
moving so very cautiously to prevent noise
that it seemed to her a whole minute was
occupied by the maneuver but at length
he stood erect and began to steal away from
her in the direction of the door keeping
very close to the wall where there was
less danger of the floor squeaking under his
tread
  his progress in fact was utterly sound-
less now another noise caught her ear
it was a light grit of metal against metal
no louder than the very faintest whisper
but it told olivetta that the knob of the
the stranger at the gate

door was being turned then a new draft
of air passed across the floor dust was
blown into her face she knew that the
door had been opened then the draft
ceased it was shut again
  had he who opened it shut it and gone
on or did he remain inside the room
meantime her companion was dissolved in
the black wall of darkness olivetta found
herself pressing back farther and farther
against the wall behind her
  but when the silence broke it was in an
explosion of noise there was a shock
a curse in a harsh strange voice then
something crashed upon the floor rolled
on it there was a prolonged scuffling
then all was still
   have you got enough  said the voice
of francis campbell panting
   yes breathed another
   wait a minute-so now lie still if
you move ill shove the knife into you
i	mean it you dog olivetta
   yes she murmured hurrying to him
   stand back from me wait till i make
sure of this thing before you come within
striking distance of it so
  as he spoke he snapped on an electric
torch he was revealed in shadowy outline
sitting a-straddle of the body of a prostrate
man and the shaft of light from the torch
glistened on the rolling ejtes and marked
in deeper furrows the seamed face of louis
kern the left hand of campbell held the
light in his right hand was a heavy hilted
sharp-edged knife he had poised it just
over the breast of the man from the orient
   ah  said campbell  i knew that the
trap would close on something one of these
days it couldnt fail and here you are
louis after all these years here we are
again
  the lips of the other writhed over words
but no sound came he glared in a fascina-
tion of terror into the face of his captor
  campbell arose from his victim and
stepped back
   stand up he said
  louis kern obeyed
   now notice went on francis camp-
bell  that that door is closed that your
only escape is through that door that
if you try to bolt for it before you can
get that door open i shall certainly be able
to drive this knife into your back and i
shall assuredly do my best to do it do
you understand
  louis kern bowed but when he bowed
he kept his eye fixed upon the knife in
the hand of campbell
   but dont forget said campbell  id
hesitate more about killing a dog kern
than about ridding the world of you and
thered be no penalty you understand
what i know of your life there was only
one good day in your life and that was
the time you fought for me in the hima-
layas but good gad louis why should
the bravest soldier i ever saw be a rascal
as well 
  his voice had lowered as he spoke the
last sentence there was a gentleness
which was almost a caress in his manner
and his accent and louis kern was ap-
parently moved his sallow face flushed
his eyes widened and darkened with emo-
tion
  suddenly his head bowed in shame and
remorse and he stared at the floor and
that mute contrition took quick effect upon
francis campbell
   come come  he said  i dont mean
to turn you over to the police i want you
to say only enough to clear me and then
before i turn your confession in to them
ill give you time and money enough to
get you clear of this country will you do
that does that sound generous enough
louis kern jerked up his head
   how can  run away he said
  he pointed to the missing arm  theyll
know me by that he said gloomily
   you can get a false arm and wear it in
a sling-there are a dozen ways of cover-
ing up a missing arm said the captor
 ill see that youre provided but the
main thing is will you sign a confession
before will you talk and tell the truth
louis kern looked at the white man with
an indescribable expression
   i can do nothing else he said
throughout his english was flawless he
spoke in a low unemphatic voice  is
there paper
   yes and a pen i have all that you
need will you tell everything louis

argosy-allstory weekly
  again there was a touch of hesitation
  	for the sake of the clay in the moun-
tains said louis yes i remember
how you led us
   for the sake of that day then echoed
the white man greatly moved  and i re-
member how you fought-i shall never for-
get it and yet louis if you had acted the
part of an honest man on the evening of
that day i should not have been a vaga-
bond for ten years yes youve cost me
ten years of the best of my life youve
made me throw away that much
   were all the years thrown away said
louis in his soft voice and he looked full
at olivetta so that she shrank and blushed
 drop that exclaimed campbell
harshly  you yourself louis i should
have looked after you
   yes said louis bitterly  i might
have been your valet and you would have
told how i fought for you on the mountain
-you would have told that after i had
brought in the wine
  his lip lifted in a sneer of contempt
   show me the paper and the pen  he
said suddenly  and lets be done with it
i can write by that torch
   very well said francis campbell and
reached into his pocket for the paper
  he had half turned as he did so a ring-
ing cry from olivetta made him spring
back louis kern had whipped out another
knife and was leaping straight at his throat
chapter xxxiv
a shriek in the night
wt was here said the chauffeur i
 followed her right down here and seen
her take a turn around the block
the sergeant of detectives listened with-
out emotion it was the fourth time that
he himself had been called out to trace to
the ground stories of people who declared
that they had seen olivetta dascom that
evening he had been from the battery to
new rochelle and the sergeant was weary
in soul and spirit
  you could not be mistaken in her
said hugh dascom who made the third in
the party
  it was the first excursion which he had
made since he came in from long island-
his first attempt to find the lost trail
   mistaken about her  grinned the
chauffeur  no sir i got twelve pic-
tures of her on the wall of my room i got
pictures of her from every angle i couldnt
of been so sure of my own mother
   and you think said the sergeant with
a trifle more interest as he looked down
the blank faced line of houses  you think
that she was following a man
   im kind of sure of that too said the
chauffeur  of course i kept an eye on
her all the time she was in the car i seen
that she kept leaning forward and looking
away past me as though there was a street
fight beginning about a block ahead she
kept that look all the time and she got
more nervous every time the traffic jammed
in between and buried a big orange colored
taxi ahead of us pretty soon i was wise
to that and i laid in pretty smooth behind
the big orange boy then miss dascom
took it easy she sat back in the seat and
stopped worrying
   pretty soon we passed the orange fel-
low pulled up beside the street and at
the next corner she told me to stop paid
the bill and gave me an extra dollar be-
sides the tip and then went off down the
street so fast that i couldnt stop her to
give back the dollar
   but i shoved my car up against the
curb and climbed out and hiked after her
with the dollar in my fist but when i
turned the corner i seen her walking along
about a half block behind a big tall bird
and keeping about that distance back
seemed to me that she might be shadowing
him and i forgot about the dollar and
began to watch
   well i walked down here to this block
of houses as i was saying i seen the tall
gent go up a flight of steps and disappear
inside the door and miss dascom walked
right on and went around the far corner
after that i turned around and went back
i didnt have no time to spare and it wasnt
up to me to give her advice but when i
seen the papers-about her not showing up
where she was expected at her friends
house- good god whats that
the stranger at the gate

  a faint shriek had reached them a hoarse
scream such as comes from a man in a
throe of terror or agony even the sergeant
looked aghast then he pointed to a house
ahead of them and to the right
   it came out of that he said  come
along with me mr dascom you got a
gun get ready to limber it up
  he jerked the last words at them over his
shoulder as he started to sprint ahead but
in a stride hugh dascom was beside had
even passed him up the steps they rushed
shoulder to shoulder the front door re-
buffed their attack the sergeant shattered
the lock with a forty-five caliber slug and
they tumbled into a deadly dark hall until
the light from the sergeants electric torch
split the blackness in two
  then an hysterical cry from a woman
turned them sharply to the left and the
three smashed the door wide open and
plunged into a room where louis kern lay
on his back on the floor with his one arm
thrown above his head
  over him leaned that much sought after
form of  john hodge  himself
  hodge cried the sergeant hands
up
   im too busy said hodge  stand
close youre my witness 
the
    olivetta called her father
   but olivetta held him off with a raised
hand
    wait she whispered
  and then hugh dascom saw that the
hand of john hodge which was pressed
across the breast of the half-breed was
endeavoring in vain to check the welling
blood which was draining the life of kern
and john hodge himself was slashed with
a shallow cut across the side of the head
   he paid no heed to that
    kern  he was crying  for gods
sake before you go do me right youre
done but it will save me from hell on
earth if you speak one word kern will
you do it
   the half-breed opened his eyes and smiled
 in quiet disdain up at the face of the white
 man
    oh cried olivetta and falling on her
 knees she stretched out her hands to the
 dying man  you can free him from dan-
 ger and if you free him you will free me
 in the name of mercy tell what you know
   louis kern closed his eyes opened them
suddenly and looked at the ceiling
    gentlemen he said  i killed logan
 i killed him before he could name my
 name

the song of the city
 h he whom i once have held in my thrall
      in my crowded street
 i hold him for aye i weave me a snare
    for his hastening feet
 he travels east and he travels west
    but he finds the track-
 with joy or with grief he finds the way
    that leads him back
 he may think-the fool-that he hates my noise
    my clatter and din
 and the pulse and throb of life in my veins
    and the moods i am in
 but he reckons wrong for wherever he goes
    like a magnet i draw
 till he finds himself back in my grasp again
    and my will is his law
a eastman elmn
by a d temple
it was late summer afternoon in coon-
burg in the shade trees the cicadas
were humming their hot weather chant
a katydid now and then swelling the chorus
as the evening shadows grew darker an
escaped vagrant pig grunted interrogatively
as he paused in front of mcgoogles with
eyes and keen nose scouting for banana
peels overripe tomatoes or other porcine
tidbits link browns two coon hounds
range and sport outstretched lazily on the
curb in their character of guardians of the
street half raised their heads as they
growled a sleepy warning at the disturber
of their slumbers some luscious cabbage
leaves were close to ranges nose the pig
advanced toward them only halting a mo-
ment as range with a menacing deep
growl bared his teeth savagely the porker
replying with a supercilious whoof then
seizing the dainty morsel a second later
one hundred and fifty pounds of live pork
and about an equal weight of coon hounds
formed the center of a cloud of dust in mid
street
  the jazzlike symphony that erupted
from the cloud drowned the soothing songs
of katydid and cicada causing as well a
hasty informal adjournment of a meeting
of the coonburg sportsmans club that
was being held in the back of the store the
entire membership of the club rushing out
en masse to view the fray from the front
porch
  josh stebbins was the last to see the
rumpus as in his haste to be first he in
rising had collided with the freshly opened
keg of salt mackerel stumbling over it as
       	 a
josh stebbixs prospector

it rolled and in a badly calculated effort
to keep his equilibrium caromed on a full
basket of fresh eggs to their almost total
destruction then falling over a sack of po-
tatoes he joined the interested crowd of
spectators on the porch
  hey there hey there link he
shouted as with egg besmeared hands he
pushed his way through the crowd and rec-
ognized one of the combatants  call off
yer dogs theyre killin my pet hog i
dunno how he got loose but i wouldnt lose
him fer a pretty
  link sounded a sharp whistle twice re-
peated at which the hounds slowly and
regretfully released the pig coming to their
masters side with drooping ears and guilty
wagging tails the pig emitting a stream of
indignant grunts and squeals fled down the
street
   that your hog josh inquired link
with a grin
   sure he is thet ar hog cost me forty
dollars
   dont look to me as if he was very well
bred ive got some berkshires and poland
chinas in my pen a heap better lookin

   i aint advisin you ter go thar jed

down in nothern soth ameriky
   ye see me an my partner barney
murchensen shipped on a two masted
schooner outa nyorleans fer a tradin
vyge to the orinoky river thet was what
the skipper told us when we signed on but
we found out different before wed made the
round trip forrud o the galley was a
hog pen with four hogs in it they was gini-
wine scissorbills from arkansaw they
wasnt ez well bred ez my hog spoo-
pendyke but all the same they was good
ones built fer speed an not fer bacon
the skipper stored on em a heap an had
em named high low jack game an
they answered to their names all right when
he called em to their chow i axed the
skipper ef he was goin inter the circus
business in soth ameriky an he sez
 you jest wait till we git there an youll
see what youll see aft in the cabin
messin with the skipper an the mate was a
feller wearin blue specs with turtle shell
frames he claimed to be the supercargo
o the schooner but fer a fack later we
found out he was one o them rock sharps
lookin fer gold mines
   right now in my own mind i aint sure
whether them hogs or the rock sharp was
the big noise aboard the hooker they
both got a heap more attention from the
skipper an mate than we thought they had
cornin to em
   we made a quick run an when we got
to the mouth of the river we landed an
squared ourselves with the custom house
an then sailed on up the river thet was ten
miles wide at the mouth they told us to
look out fer the cannibal injuns thet was
on the warpath up above but didnt say a
word about the wild varmints wed be likely
to run across they left us that to find out
for ourselves and we did
   it was a free menagerie an circus ez
we sailed along they was long tailed an
josh stebbins prospector

short tailed monkeys skippin through the
tree tops grinnin an chatterin at us when
we made a tack close inshore with  jag-
gers what they call them spotted tigers o
soth ameriky sneakin through the brush
below em lookin fer a chance to jump a
wild turkey or a deer or a man fer thet mat-
ter ef they could find one asleep specially
them black tigers thet  jump a man quick-
ern a deer an eat him too theyre sav-
age brutes  seen one in the new york
zoo the last time i was up there then
alongshore alligators an crockodiles reglar
man eaters ez long ez saw logs was lay in
on the beach by dozens overhead parrots
of all sizes was flyin round an squawkin
till it sounded like a womans political meet-
in electin delegates some o them par-
rots wasnt biggern a sparrow an pure
green while others hed a tail three foot
long an was green red an yaller with a
voice thet sounded like a saw-filin shop in
full blast
   in every cove an backwater they was
pelicans cranes an plume birds by the
hunderds an heaps o wild ducks in one
cove was the biggest water lilies i ever laid
my eyes on-the leaves was moren twelve
foot across an the flowers was six foot wide
or more
   we didnt navigate at night but al-
ways run into some bay or backwater an
anchored one evenin we headed in fer a
cove about a hunderd an fifty yards wide
at its mouth calkalatin to lay up fer the
night but ez we got closer we seen they
was a log boom stretched right across it
it was made outa mighty queer lookin logs
with scaly shinin bark wed never seen
nothin exactly like it so the skipper sent
me an barney in the dory to take a look
at it an find a passage when we got a
close up an seen what we seen we rowed
back a-whoopin
   what was it you saw josh asked
mcgoogle
   why pat ye see it was gittin dark
so we run the bow o the dory right onto
the boom before we see what we was up
agenst the dumed thing moved an
squirmed when we struck it an we seen
it was a snake thet hed six fathoms of its
tail round a coconut tree on one side o the
cove with as much more of its neck an
head belayed around a tree trunk on the
other side he give a hiss loudern a harbor
tug blowin off her bilers the minit we
teched him an we backed water an lit out
fer the schooner but not till wed seen thet
the dumed varmint hed about a hunderd al-
ligators corraled in the bay an was holdin

anybody unless hes an agent o the asso-
ciated press you kaint shake my repy-
tation with insinooations
    mr stebbins interrupted the school-
master who was an absorbed listener  i
wish that my class in natural history could
hear your account of the marvels of nature
as yet unrecorded in the annals of scientific
research that you encountered in the unex-
plored wilderness on the shores of the ori-
noco river
    purfessor its a giniwine pleasure ter
hev a liberal minded well read man say
thet one thet knows thet half the wonders
o the world aint been put in print an
ken apreciate a man thet has risked his life
an repytation for voracity in spreadin re-
liable scientific knowledge fer the good o
the stay-at-homes like link sittin over
thar an grinnin at me
    josh twasnt you i was grinning at it
was that hooch hound from new york that
come out here and camped at mike finni-
gans applejack factory at the crossroads
till he got the d ts and come runnin up
the road yelling that a red green blue an
yellow snake was after him that was forty
rods long and had a mouth wide enough
to swallow a cow without choking i
thought mebbe hed been down in south

america too and had seen one of those
snakes youve just told us about

pure cussedness of human nacher stickin
out on ye because yeve been plantin spuds
an drivin mules all yer life an was jeal-
ous of me thet hez sailed the seven seas an
seen the world a hull lot
  the ensuing deep silence was broken by
the schoolmasters inquiry  was the dis-
covery of the existence of those huge ser-
pents the only important addition to our
knowledge of natural history that you made
while in south america mr stebbins
   youre jest a-shoutin it warnt-not in
comparison with what we found farther up
the river thet i was goin to tell ye about
when link butted in an interrupted me
   never mind me josh said link  go
on with your rat killing were all listen-
ing
   what i cant see is what good was they
in exportin scissorbillhogs to south amer-
iky aint they got no decent breed of hogs
down there asked jeff tate
   wal we found that the skipper was
countin on the hogs an capn bunkum
the rock sharp to make the vyge a payin
proposition an they did-part o the hogs
did anyhow ye see them big snakes made
us fight shy o thet part o the country so
we kept goin up stream till it got so shaller
that we grounded on a sandbar an found
there was a forty foot fall a mile farther
up the river we pulled her off the bar an
anchored close to the bank makin a camp
under some coconut trees we could see the
tops of snow covered mountains off to the
west thet i reckon must a been the andes
while all around us was heavy jungle with
some cricks runnin through it under the
brush
  we hednt fairly got settled before
them cannibal injuns wed been told about
come out of the woods ter make us a visit
the chief was all dressed up in a plug hat
an a stand-up collar with a gee string
round his waist an a pair o spurs on his
heels thet was always ketchin in the brush
an trippin him up i guess he only wore
em on state occasions outside of what
ive mentioned he was clothed in his na-
tive innercence an dignity the rest of
his bunch jest wore a gee string an a coat
of red green an blue paint in stripes like
a barber pole
   were these untutored children of na-
ture actual cannibals who reveled in feast-
ing on human flesh asked the school-
master
   wal no not ez a reglar everyday dish
it was a kinda extra jest like we hev roast
turkey on thanksgivin an christmas or
on a birthday or christenin after id give
the chief a lookin glass a waterbury
watch an a plug o terbaccy we got quite
chummy an held a long powwow he sed
they lived on monkeys fish an wild tur-
keys mostly ez they was easiest to ketch
an more digestible than some o the hu-
mans thet hed tasted once he told me
they killed a hull gang of prospectors an
hed a big barbacue an invited all their
neighbors to the spread an after it was
over he lost five outa seven of his mothers-
in-law an the two survivors had had
chronic dyspepsy ever since he said they
was done to a turn but was so soaked up
with rum an tobaccer thet they was very
indigestible an his medicine man got
plumb worn out curin the sick the week
arter the barbacue since then theyd only
got three or four missionaries thet was fat
an tender an made good eatin i seen
him sizin up the rock sharp an got leery
thet he took him for a missionary on ac-
count of his horn specs an thought he
might go good stuffed with green bananas
an roasted in a hole in the ground with hot
stones like in these new-fangled fireless
cookers i knowed thet barney an me
was in no danger our bad habits bein ez
good ez a paid-up life insurance policy but
i wouldnt cared to hev stood in capn
bunkums shoes-not in thet neck o
the woods
   arter the skipper hed made a treaty
with the injuns an clinched it by givin
em a lot of lookin glasses beads butcher
knives an sech he started us out prospec-
tin fer gold he give us a prospectin pan
an a hog apiece to me an barney an two
hogs to capn bunkum he bein supposed
to know more about gold huntin than we
did bein a college bred man with a dy-
josh stebbins prospector

plomy ez mining engineer in the deal i
drawed the hog named  high an barney
drew  low while capn bunkum hed
 jack  an  game
   the skipper told us them hogs was
broke to hunt an root fer gold in the brush
jest ez hard ez any wall street curb op-
erator an they sure was ez well broke ez
bird dogs we told em to go an hunt fer
it along a crik back in the timber they
hednt worked very long before low give
a squeal trottin up to barney with a fifty-
dollar nugget in his jaws an dropped it
at his feet business picked up right away
for in a little high rooted out a two-ounce
nugget an brought it to me then we
started panning the crik an by sundown
hed more dust an nuggets than we could
pack we cached most of it takin jest
enough back with us to show wed found
pay diggins
   capn bunkum went with his two hogs
across the river to the west an come in
arter sunset feelin fine both of his hogs
hed bloody noses an he sed theyd blood-
ied em rootin at a ledge of white hard
quartz thet hed a vein of solid gold in it
two inches wide he was ez proud ez a
hound pup with his tail painted sky blue
an hed the skipper all worked up tellin
him how with a twenty stamp mill an some
burleigh air drills he could turn out a mil-
lyun dollars a week an wanted to start
right off fer new york fer to organize a
stock company with seven millyuns capital
   bamey an me said nothin much but
jest laid low fellers our placer claim was
payin big a full pan o the gravel was
too heavy to lift it was so full o gold in
dust an nuggets we tied up our hogs
sos they wouldnt wander off an find an-
other pay streak before this one was cleaned
up one day they did git loose while we
was so busy washin gravel we didnt know
it till we heard em squealin ez ef they
was bein killed way up the crik on ground
we hadnt prospected we dropped our
pans an went on the run to see what hed
happened we met em cornin through
the brush hellity split with a big yaller
eel eight or ten feet long hangin on
their tails what got my goat was thet
the hogs was pure black when we tied em
up an now they was a golden yaller i
grabbed one o the eels by the tail ez they
come by an before my hand slipped off i
got a shock thet knocked me end over end
agin a stump when i picked myself up
an rubbed the dirt outa my eyes there
was barney doin the same
    what hit us barney i sez
     it was them travelin storage batteries
thet had a hold o the hogs tails aint
you never heard of the electric eels they is
in soth ameriky he sez
     no i haint i sez
    thats them he sez rubbin a lump
on the back of his head where hed hit a
rock ez he fell  this crik is full of em
i reckon
   by the time wed finished comparin
notes on our bumps an scratches them eels
hed let go their holt on the hogs an slipped
inter the crik agen while them educated
pigs after havin hed the first big scare o
their young an joyous life was restin up
in the shade we went to take a look at
em an boys jest ez sure ez thet the lord
made little green sour apples them hogs
was gold plated the yaller wed noticed on
em bein pure gold plate
   we quit work right there an went up
the crik to find out what kind of a gold-
platin plant them hogs hed fallen into
up the crik a half mile or so we come to
its head waters where it bust out of a ledge
of rotten white quartz an we seen ihet
was the bonanza thet was makin us
millyunares ye see the freshets hed
washed out the gold dust an nuggets car-
rvin em down to where we was pannin
em out but a lot of chloride of gold thet
will dissolve in water was still in the rock
an every time it rained good an hard the
crik was full of chloride thet hed soaked
out of the ledge so nacherly the big
hole at the foot o the ledge was nothin
but a tank of chloride of gold in solution
an besides was full o the dumed electric
eels when the hogs found the place it
was purty hot an they laid down in the
tank to cool off the eels seein their tails
wigglin took em for fish-worms an bit
ez the hogs felt em an give a jump an
squeal the eels let loose a charge of elec-
tricity outa their storage batteries thet pre-

argosy-allstory weekly
cipitated the chloride in the shape of pure
gold on the hogs electroplatin em ez good
ez ef it hed been done in a reglar shop
   it looks like you an your partners had
got high low jack game an had the
world by the tail with a down hill pull
remarked jeff fisher
    thets what we thought jeff but the
good book sez  man purposes but the lord
disposes so ye never ken tell we set
down an lit our pipes in the shade of a big
tree by the side o the tank i sez to bar-

hard cash an thats no fool of a job an
besides you an me ain built right to live
like millyunares i tried it once when id

way an when the waiter come to show
thet i was no piker i ordered ten dollars
woth o ham an eggs five dollars worth
o stewed tripe with biled spuds an a
dozen bottles o champagne he looked
at me wild eyed an called up the police
over the phone tellin em they was a
crazy man in the house thet oughta be in
bellevue
   ez he was talkin i looked over to the
soth where a big black cloud showed up
the lower pint of it was touchin the tree
tops and up above it spread out wide till
it looked like a black toadstool an was
whirlin round an round like one o them
whirlin dervishes thet travel with the cir-
cuses dancin on his head i could hear
a roarin sound in the air an the monkeys
in the trees was screamin with the bull al-
ligators in the river bellerin an spotted
tigers roarin frightened like a couple of
black tigers passed close to us on the run
payin no attention to us  looka there
barney i sez interruptin him  fer the
luvva mike whats thet black cloud goin

    it hit us with a roar loudern a thou-
sand cannon yankin the tree up by the
roots thet we was holdin onto i was
scared stiff an knowed nothin after we
went sailin up in the air till i come to the
next mornin we was adrift in the tree top
outa sight o land with three o them howl-
er monkeys an a spotted tiger for ship-
mates they was so scared thet they was
ez harmless ez guinea pigs never even
showing their teeth at us
   the tree we was adrift on happened
ter be a wild fig tree with plenty of fruit
an the water though we was outa sight o
land was only a leetle brackish ez we was
off the mouth o the orinoky whose sweet
water freshens up the salt water fifty miles
out at sea jest like the amazon river does
    after driftin for three days a coaster
bound fer pernambuco sighted us an took
us aboard also the monkeys they shot the
tiger an took his hide to pay our passage

mighty leery of the orinoco country
by maxwell smith
     druffs thoughts were far
 from hurley and that long distant
 y day when hurley had killed not
that he could ever completely forget hurley
and the score which remained unsettled
no but it was all so long ago the likeli-
hood of ever again encountering hurley was
so remote that the killer had become only
a dim figure on a page which might as well
be counted closed like woodruffs rude
boyhood in the carolina mountains when
the future had held for him no more than a
scraping toiling grubby fruitless existence
the memory of hurley belonging to that
same period had become misted and almost
to the same extent outgrown
 the years had brought a different sort
of life to woodruff coming out of the
mountains to run down and kill hurley
for having killed he had failed in that pur-
pose but he had found emancipation from
the narrow sordidness into which he had
been bom and in which but for that vain
quest for hurley he would have passed all
his years sunken into that state of dumb
resignation which the back country inevi-
tably bred in its sons the cities to which
he had wandered in his aimless man hunt
had shown him his benightedness and
roused some latent ambition within him
  when the red blaze of his vengeance cry
had spent its first fury realization of the
vastness of the land in which he had pre-
sumed to search for hurley had brought also
realization of the hopelessness of his mis-
sion contact with the people of this outer
world whom he had been taught to dis-
trust as all strangers to the mountains were
to be distrusted had then opened up an
amazing and unsuspected horizon and wid-
ened his eyes to the poverty of the life to
which but for the ruthless murder of his
kin he had been foredoomed still youth-
ful enough to retain a thread of stifled
vision he had applied himself to learn the
ways of the city and grasp its opportunities
rather than return to the murky barrenness
of the hills in whose confines he had been


argosy-allstory weekly
circumscribed by his own ignorance so
the old life had faded slowly at first and
then more quickly as the strangeness of the
new wore off and he won success in it and
with the old life had faded the memory of
hurley and the hope that some time some-
where he would at length come up with his
lost quarry the world was too big its
people too many
  thus hurley was far from his thoughts
when with an unexpectedness that was vio-
lent an abruptness that was disconcerting
the killer stood before him the span of
seventeen years was rolled back swept pas-
sionately away as though it never had been
hurley was within his reach-a step away
he had but to put out his hand and hurley
was his within an instant of time he could
exact payment for the two lives which hur-
ley had taken a shot and the utmost that
hurley had to give would be extorted-the
life he had saved by flight seventeen years
ago
  the veneer of the city of civilization
dropped from woodruff like a cloak the
hatred and purpose which had lain dormant
throughout the softening years flamed high
again the picture of his dead rose stark
and commanding-the bodies of his only
near kin his brother and his brothers bride
of a week lying by the roadside shot from
ambush with never a chance for their lives
hurley had done that in mad fury over
having been bested in love and beaten too
with the fists of his rival for having ir his
rancorous jealousy offered insult to the girl
hurley skulking behind a clump of rocks
had waited for them to pass that way their
vigilance relaxed in the happiness they had
found in each other-hurley who now at
last was delivered to him
  blood surging he reverted to the primi-
tive became again the mountaineer who be-
lieved it his right and his duty to avenge
the killing and uphold the honor of his
house it was for him alone to demand and
receive the penalty the law had had its
chance but had failed the law of the courts
which the hill folk tolerated when its in-
trusion could not be avoided but which
they would not recognize as the last word
a quarrel of any kind was a mans own
business it should rest with him to balance
his own ledger when blood was spilled
and life taken it was his right to spill blood
and take life in return seventeen years
ago woodruff would have shot on sight
time had not altered his claim to ven-
geance to-day was as seventeen years
ago his hand slipped to the pistol on his
hip
  but as his fingers closed on the weapon
some one jostled him and so recalled him
to consciousness of his surroundings be-
neath his feet was the ceaseless murmur of
the subway from which he had just
emerged an endless stream of automobiles
was rolling by honking hurrying more
people it seemed were about him rubbing
elbows with him than populated the whole
of his native mountains this wasnt the
hills where feudal law was the rule and
found sympathy this was broadway and
one hundred and forty-fifth street new
york city
  woodruffs hand left his pistol as his
thoughts jarred back to where they had
been when hurley crossed his vision he
had been thinking of those who awaited his
coming in the cozy apartment four blocks
farther up broadway of the wife and two
children who made for him a home such as
he never dreamed of when the thirst for
vengeance drew him out of the monotonous
drudgery and soul-killing darkness that had
been his lot into this fairer environment to
which he had raised himself and found all
to his liking he had been thinking of
home and in happy conjunction of the
stroke of business he had completed to-
night  of how the generous commission just
earned would bring him and his nearer to
their goal-a real home of their own in the
suburbs with a bit of land big enough for a
real garden and a handful of fruit trees
he had been dwelling so buoyantly on how
good life was to him when-hurley
  hurley had not yet seen him standing
at the curb the killer was giving all his at-
tention to the passing automobiles appar-
ently on the lookout for some one there
was an air of impatience about him a re-
flection almost of nervousness in the quick
puffing of his cigarette and the darting mo-
tions of the hand with which he repeatedly
raised it to his lips when two policemen
ox broadway

paused on the corner he turned and saun-
tered away from them toward one hundred
and forty-sixth street
  a couple of paces behind woodruff fell
into step while he struggled with his prob-
lem under the mountain code he was in
duty bound to kill hurley he was not
afraid to do that not afraid of such con-
sequences as might affect himself but an-
other duty confronted him others would
be affected he was in new york now
where only the law of the courts prevailed
if he were to kill hurley as hurley should
be killed like a dog he would go to the
death chair no one here would understand
or admit that his deed was dictated by right
and justice it would make no difference
that hurley had but paid the penalty for his
own act in the eyes of the law he-
woodruff-would be no better than the
hired gunman who from some dark lurking
place shoots his victim in the back they
would brand him murderer though in truth
he had but served as executioner they
would electrocute him and-
  what then of his wife and children
should they be outweighed by the dead
where lay his foremost duty to keep
faith with the dead or with the living
to carry out the vow made over the bodies
of his murdered kin or that other vow to
cherish and protect above all else the woman
whose life was joined with his
  woodruff hung back irresolutely shrink-
ing into a doorway when hurley halted and
resumed watching the passing cars the
temptation was strong to go his way forget-
ting this glimpse of hurley convincing him-
self that he had been for the moment mis-
led by a fancied resemblance the killing
had been done so long ago-long and
hurley had been acquitted-that had to be
considered too the law had pronounced
him not guilty perhaps he hadnt-
  woodruff moistened his dry lips and
swore softly that line of thought was
cowardly it was amply trying to find a
way out making excuses for evading a duty
which could not honorably be evaded he
was not mistaken in his identification that
was hurley over there just across the side-
walk harder of face and bearing himself
now as a creature of the city but unmis-
takably hurley the killer whom fate had
given seventeen years of life to which he
had not been entitled for hurley was un-
deniably guilty he had been acquitted-
yes but on a lying alibi and by a jury of
his friends without any real effort to con-
vict being made by a prosecutor who owed
favor to the hurley clan his flight alone
had been a confession of guilt he had
been afraid to stay and face the righteous
vengeance of the last of the woodruffs
afraid to stay and shoot it out man to man
  between the living and the dead wood-
ruff knew that he must choose and quickly
he must know his mind before hurley
moved on again lest he yield momentarily
to the temptation to let him go and later
regret
  but it was hard keeping faith with
the dead would mean breaking faith with
the living if by killing hurley he con-
demned himself to the electric chair he
would be abandoning the woman he had
sworn to guard and shelter as surely as
though he had walked out of her life with-
out a word he would be abandoning her
and their children bringing them heart-
ache and shame and robbing them of a fu-
ture which was now alight with happiness
  and what if he should break faith with
the dead who then would suffer no-
body none but himself in his secret heart
when roweled by the memory of how he
had failed in a sacred duty how he had
foresworn the vengeance that was due to
his dead he couldnt cheat his dead like
that for always he would know that in do-
ing so he had been actuated by selfish mo-
tive he would know that coupled with
his concern for his wife and children had
been his own desire to live on he did
not want to die to throw his life away
yet he could see no way out there stood
the man who had murdered a woodruff
and that woodruffs bride that mans
death was seventeen years overdue he
must die-now
  still within the doorway his movements
unnoticed by the people constantly passing
by woodruff drew his gun folding his
arms he concealed it in the crook of an el-
bow and waited for the sidewalk to show
clear between him and hurley he had no

argosy-allstory weekly
fear of missing his hand was steady
his eye sure
  minutes dragged but always there was
somebody within his line of fire then
when a fair and unobstructed target pre-
sented itself his finger refused to come down
on the trigger while be tried to force
himself to shoot treacherously unseen as
hurley had shot and killed the opportunity
was lost as the passers-by again intervened
he didnt wait for another opening even
a cur was entitled to a show hed give
hurley his chance besides he wanted
hurley to know where death was coming
from to know what vengeance had over-
taken him
  putting his pistol in his coat pocket
woodruff stepped over and touched the
killer on the shoulder
   hurley jumped whirled the cigarette fly-
ing from his hand as his arm snapped down-
ward with tensing muscles
   im giving you an even break hurley
said woodruffquietly grab for your
gun im going after mine quick
  hurley sucked in his breath audibly and
his eyes dilated he was startled-but he
kept his head his recognition of wood-
ruff was instant and knowing his man
he played the surest way of prolonging his
life instead of obeying the command to
go after a gun he brought his hands up be-
fore him letting them hang limp at the level
of his waist
   ive got no gun he returned also
quietly gambling to the limit that woodruff
wouldnt shoot unless certain that he was
armed the woodruffs always had been
foolish thataway which was the main rea-
son that their line had all but died out
while others less worthy and less scrupulous
survived
   im give you ten seconds said wood-
ruff stonily
  youre wasting em hurleys sur-
prise was over and while shaken and fear-
ful he had a hold on his nerve he had to
keep that to bluff this out
  his narrowed eyes were on woodruffs
hands alert for the slightest move toward
a gun in anticipation of that he poised
ready to leap sidewise and interpose some
hapless pedestrian as a barrier-while he
went after his own gun but fervently he
hoped that wouldnt be necessary that he
could back out of the jam without a violent
clash he couldnt afford to get tangled
up right now he had-a date
    ive got no gun he repeated his hands
still dangling  go ahead and shoot if
youre going to before folks get to noticing
that youre sticking me up you gone
crazy jim-or -what he smiled thinly as
the other made no move  this aint back
home folks dont go running around
broadway making gunplay
  woodruff studied him coldly noting the
crafty malevolence in the slitted wary eyes
he didnt believe that his enemy was un-
armed in the old days even as a boy
hurley had been hard shiftless bad a
gun toter ever ready to draw-when the ad-
vantage was with him he was harder
now with a shifty tightness about his face
flat colorless complexion and a fidgety
bravo twitch to his shoulders his voice
added to the furtive effect coming toneless
from thin close moving lips he was well
enough dressed but in a drab way which
somehow did not bespeak prosperity in
places where shone the full light of day
what had he been doing all these years
woodruff wondered the state of pennsyl-
vania could have explained his occupation
during four years that he had been its guest
on account of a matter of highway robbery
    youll be gathering a crowd in a minute
sticking me up like this gibed hurley
emboldened by woodruffs inactivity and
silence if youre going to start some-
thing go to it and get it over with 
   im not sticking you up im giving
you a chance to draw-and im getting tired
waiting
   ive got nothing to draw-
   im waiting repeated woodruff dis-
passionately  better think again youve
got a gun hurley go after it
  a spasm of fear drove hurley close to
panic his fingers contracted itching to
pull his gun in a desperate effort to gain
the advantage but he controlled himself
that would be suicidal whether he got
woodruff or woodruff got him even if he
were to dart into the traffic and escape being
shot he was scheduled to come to grief
on broadway

some one would be sure to grab him as a
principal in the commotion there were al-
ways half a dozen cops scattered around
this comer with a gun on him and a
prison record hed go up the river for all the
time that could possibly be hung on him
he couldnt let himself get snarled up that
way not if he could help it he had to
find a middle course carry on his bluff and
break away without a blow-off and he
must get away soon he had that date to
keep
   well go round the corner said wood-
ruff  where well be less likely to hit any-
body else while we walk you can make up
your mind whether youre going to get
your gun or have me shoot you -his voice
lashed for the moment as he sought to goad
hurley to action- like a skunk-you
dirty murdering skunk
  hurley was watching his step too care-
fully to be led into any disastrous motion
he decided that his only play was to bank
heavily on the belief that so long as he
did not draw a gun woodruff would not
shoot
   sure he jeered  sure im going to
walk along nice and tame till we get to a
nice quiet place where you can plug me and
be on your way sure i will-like hell
say let me tell you something theres
two cops coming up right behind you all
ive got to do is yell and-
   dont
  -theyll take you before you can turn
around finished hurley grinning with in-
spiration as the taxi he had been waiting
for slid to a stop six feet away with a
glance at the driver he went on rapidly to
woodruff  maybe you dont know it but
theres a law up here against toting guns
just for having one on you they can shove
you away for about five years thats you
with them cops stepping on your heels i
can take a chance and yell and whether you
plug me or not theyll get you and you
go up he emphasized  just for having
the gun on you me-theres nothing on
me but theyll tack on some more years
for you when they hear how you stuck me
up and threatened to kill me
  with that and before woodruff could re-
ply hurley made his big flourish raising
himself to his full height he cocked his head
and spoke over woodruffs shoulder-to the
policeman
   oh officer have you got the right
time
  glancing sidewise woodruff found the
two officers hesitating at his side while one
of them looked at his watch
   ten forty said the cop
   thanks said hurley-and the direc-
tion of his voice made woodruff swing back
to face him
  hurley was no longer where he had been
he was stepping into the taxi the driver
with motor already running was slipping
in his clutch hurley muttered an order
and the car crawled
   officer he called again
  the policeman a bare step beyond
woodruff halted inquiringly
  hurley leaned out of the cab a hand out-
stretched
   a cigar he smiled
   thanks nodded the cop taking the
folded dollar bill as the car slid past
  his right hand darting to his gun wood-
ruff took a quick step reaching out his left
hand to haul himself aboard the taxi
   so-long jim said hurley with an ap-
parently friendly wave as he perched on
the edge of the seat ready to drop to the
floor at first sight of the avenging gun
 see you later jim take good care of
yourself
  out of the tail of his eye woodruff ob-
served the policeman still standing by prac-
tically at his elbow-watching him he
thought the hand on his gun stiffened as
he realized that they probably would fell
him before he could draw it would be
madness to try for hurley now the best
he could attempt would be a shot from his
pocket-and the chances against register-
ing with that were a hundred to one there
was no chance at all that it would find a
fatal spot
  checking his stride he stood watching
hurleys taunting grin showing cautiously
through the rear window as the taxi rushed
into speed and crowded into the tide of
northbound traffic
  a blinding rage misted woodruffs eyes
the fury of self-condemnation rage over his

argosy-allstory weekly
failure and the selfish weakness which he
told himself had been responsible for it
he had broken faith with his murdered dead
because he had been afraid to sacrifice his
own softened existence he had thrown
away his honor besmirched the honor of his
clan not one of whom had ever before failed
to fight his fight or exact whatever justice
demanded the blood of his kin had called
to him and he had been found wanting
  what mattered it that this was broad-
way new york and not the mountains
where a man was expected to uphold his
own hurley had been armed that was
sure why then hadnt he drawn on hur-
ley and forced him to defend himself or die
like the dog he was seventeen years ago
he would have done that why hadnt he
done it to-night because now he was but
a putty man with the guts taken out of
him by the ease and comforts of the city
because a woman and two children were
waiting for him a couple of hundred yards
up street because he wanted to be with
them and not in a cell that was the be-
ginning of the road to the death house at
sing sing
  he flayed himself back in the moun-
tains would he have stopped to consider a
wife and children when blood cried for ven-
geance he would not have found it neces-
sary to consider them they-a mountain
wife and mountain children-would have
been first to urge him to his duty and first
to despise him for such a failure as he had
written down to-night
  a putty man with a putty wife and putty
children
  no-that was unfair he snapped up
his thoughts cleared the mist from his eyes
his wife and children had nothing to do
with his-cowardice cowardice-he called
it that they were not of the mountains
they couldnt understand-couldnt be ex-
pected to understand
  and yet-what would his wife say if he
were to tell her that he had let the mur-
derer of his brother and sister-in-law get
away from him unscathed mocking if he
were to tell her that when at last it had
come within his power to keep the pledge
to his dead brother he had vacillated and
dodged so that it remained unfulfilled
  what would she say would she preach
that it was not for him to take the law
into his own hands that he must respect
the verdict of the lying jury which on lying
testimony had declared hurley not guilty
or would she despise him as would a wife
from among his own people-the hill people
from whom he had grown so very far apart
she might-might-
  in mental turmoil he walked on up
broadway past the apartment for which he
had been so eagerly bound when he emerged
from the subway and ran into hurley he
didnt want to talk with any one just now
he wanted to be alone with his self-loathing
he had let hurley escape for the second
time after it had taken seventeen years to
come up with him hurley would put such
distance between them that they would not
meet again in seven and seventy years
ii
   that said hurley recapturing his
breath as he let down the front window of
the cab and addressed the driver  was
what i call one hell of a tight hole the
goat i was talking with there mike was all
steamed up to plug me for good and keeps
 yeah commented mike listlessly
bucking his car into a space which seemed
inadequate between two others
   yeh went on hurley  and i guess
hedve done it and busted our party all to
nothing if them cops hadnt happened along
he hadnt another thought in his head but
turn a couple of somersets mike and daz-
zle him maybe hes chugging along in an-
other bus shove over to amsterdam
  as mike proceeded to turn a couple of
 somersets  by cutting over one hun-
dred and forty-seventh street to amster-
dam avenue he spoke out of his wisdom
 ony a cuckoo d go slingin a cannon
in the middle of broadway he was kiddin
you steve whats his peeve anyhow
looking backward as they spurted
through the long block to the avenue and
seeing that there was no pursuit hurley
chuckled
   the middle of broadway dont mean a
thing to him mike hes had his mind
made up for so long hed just as soon do
on broadway

his stuff on me in the middle of times
square at noontime shove down amster-
dam mike and turn around a couple of
times and then hit up broadway again
dont step too hard-theres nobody trail-
ing
   whats his peeve anyhow inquired
mike again
   he lost a brother one time laughed
hurley  and thinks maybe it was me mis-
laid him idve mislaid this damn fool the
same way he snarled  only i couldnt
seem to get a shot at him let me out a
couple of blocks from the job mike then
you shove on and get set right
   yeah said mike  youll make it
snappy huh im gettin leary of this bus
i thought surely wed be all through by
now
  pretty soon promised hurley
 whered you lift it down town
   uh-huh
   we got all night hurley disposed of
the danger of being caught with the stolen
car  aint there five-ten thousand like it
in town
iii
  walking aimlessly head bent with his
scalding thoughts woodruff went on down
the gloomy stretch where broadway dips
through trinity cemetery he wasnt
looking where he was going-didnt care
all he craved was another chance at hur-
ley given it he wouldnt fumble he
wouldnt indulge in any maudlin chivalry
another time-wouldnt place the killer on
equal footing by warning him to draw
hed shoot on sight-and if he didnt
shoot straight hurley then would have his
chance
  another time he grimaced scornfully
over his valiant decision atiat good was
that now he should have reached it half
an hour ago when he had hurley at his
mercy what hope was there of ever again
seeing hurley
  passing one hundred and fifty-sixth
street just beyond the cemetery his steps
turned toward the quiet unpopulated upper
reaches of riverside drive which there
loops almost into broadway without re-
gard to traffic he stepped off the curb
   say you dumb-bell wheren ell dyou
think yre headin
  the harsh query mingling with a grind-
ing of brakes and followed by a string of
oaths made him look at the taxi which had
so precipitously halted a foot behind him
  heedless of the drivers abuse he was
going on when something which he had not
consciously registered flashed in his brain
the license number on this car was the
number of the one that had borne hurley
jeering away from him he didnt know
how he knew this-had no recollection of
having noted the simple three-figure num-
ber-but he knew this was the car here
was the man who could give him trace of
hurley
  he was staring grasping the fact con-
vincing himself of its verity when the driver
broke out cursing him afresh
   you gonna get tell outa the way or
have i gotta ride over you get on the
walk you bum outa me way im in a rush
-see
  woodruff returned to the sidewalk but
though the taxi came to rest finally only
twenty feet farther on he did not inquire
about hurley the feeling was on him
that hurley was near by hurley had not
picked up this taxi at random when he made
his escape it had been there to meet him
at one hundred and forty-sixth street
and here it was waiting again-for hur-
ley
  thirty feet past the cab at the corner
of one hundred and fifty-seventh street
was a subway kiosk cold and deadly one-
minded now woodruff sought its shelter
watching with his hand on his gun he
was irrevocably committed to his task the
mountain code ruled him to the exclusion
of thought for his wife and children they
wouldnt be penniless there was seven
thousand dollars the money had been laid
away to buy the house in the suburbs he
steeled himself to the loss of them to forget
them he must keep that faith which he
had once broken with his dead
  as the seconds ticked by each age-long
he gauged the possibilities of getting away
hed do that of course if he could without
using his gun on any one else morally
the law had no claim on him he had the

argosy-allstory weekly
right to kill hurley the law itself would
have taken hurleys life if he had been
properly prosecuted and the jury had not
been virtually of his own selection his
death would be merely the accomplishment
of what the law had failed to do it would
be simple justice
  after killing hurley he would try to get
away yes-but since he would not use his
gun on those who might stop him the odds
were all against him there were few
people on the streets at that hour past
eleven oclock but enough to herd him in
most probably the policeman idling across
the street would stop him with a bullet
that-yes-would be better than going to
the chair he would strike a course that
would carry him up against the policemans
gun
  his attention was taken by the taxi
driver leaning far out of his seat to look
backward toward one hundred and fifty-
sixth street settling back into his place
the driver draped his hands over the steering
wheel with a casualness which to woodruffs
interested gaze seemed studied and not quite
natural although at that distance the
mans eyes could not be seen the watcher
sensed that they were flickeringly alive to
both the occasional pedestrians on one side
of him and the machines passing on the
other and-his engine was running
  then hurley appeared walking briskly
from one hundred and fifty-sixth street
halfway down the short block close to the
buildings as he was he stood out as a good
target against the lighted windows of a
lunch room
  woodruff started to ease the gun from
his pocket a few more steps and hurley
would cut across the sidewalk to the wait-
ing cab it was just as well to let him
come these few steps nearer this was to
be just such a killing as hurley had done-
merciless the shorter the range the surer
would be the result
  adjoining the lunch room was a cigar
store more brightly illuminated the taxi
was just abreast of it hurley should turn
to the left now across the broad sidewalk
heading for the cab
  in the shadow of the kiosk woodruff
pulled his gun hiding it again in the crook
of his elbow he noted thankfully that
except for hurley the sidewalk was de-
serted in a moment hed have hurley at
thirty feet he couldnt miss
  raising the gun he steadied it in the hol-
low of his left arm another instant and
hurley-
  but hurley did not turn toward the cab
he entered the cigar store-which his driver
and partner had signaled him was empty of
customers
  the clerk making up his cash register
preparatory to closing turned to look into
two guns leveled at him across the counter
   back commanded hurley jerking his
guns menacingly  into the cubby-hole
there -indicating the stockroom the door
of which stood open at the rear of the store
 keep your hands still-and step
  silent white-faced his eyes on the guns
the clerk retreated on the outside of the
counter hurley kept pace
   inside ordered hurley unnecessarily
the clerk already was in
  pocketing one of the guns and taking off
his hat he rounded the end of the counter
   keep still and stay put he warned
 for you havent the damnedest idea how
long i might stay be good and be careful
and youll come out o k make a break
and-
  terminating the speech with a motion of
his gun he shut the door and went to the
cash register he chuckled over a stack of
bills which the clerk already had counted
and encircled with a paper wrapper-chuck-
led largely because the wrapper bore the
penciled inscription  three hundred and
twenty-seven dollars stuffing the roll into
an inside pocket he started to scoop out the
loose bills and silver still in the drawer
  came an interruption as a man entered
with an eye on the stockroom door which
was held only by a flimsy latch he served
the customer with cigarettes and gossiped
with him a minute
  left to himself again he hastily collected
the balance of the money and tiptoed to
the stockroom opening the door a crack
he inserted the muzzle of a gun without
showing himself
   im still around buddy he remarked
 still around and likely to be fer quite a
on broadway

while im in no hurry get that under
your hat sit pretty and smile and maybe
ill let you out when i lock up the store
ill let you know
  clicking the door shut he was putting
on his hat and going outside the counter
when another customer came in hurley
no more than succeeded in concealing the
gun inside his hat as he stepped back to
tend store to look more regular he laid
the hat-and perforce the gun-on a pack-
ing case inside the counter he didnt figure
that he was taking any chance he had
another gun
  that was where he made his second mis-
take the packing case was within a foot
of the stockroom door
  the first mistake was made in issuing
that last injunction to the clerk for that
young man took it as an indication that the
hold-up was over he regarded it as the
usual threat by which the bandit seeks to
delay pursuit
  wherefore it was not exceptional bravery
which led him to open the door and peer
out he had no great hankering to lie killed
in defense of three hundred odd dollars be-
longing to a half billion dollar corporation
not for a minute
  but peering he saw the muzzle of a
gun nosing from under the bandits hat
within easy reach of his hand and he saw
also that the bandit was engaged in sup-
plying the wants of a customer at the front
end of the counter and being ordinarily
though not exceptionally courageous he
wondered if he couldnt advance himself in
the esteem and service of the corporation
by talcing a shot at the hold-up man he
had learned to handle a pistol in the army
and while he never had got close enough
to the enemy to make practice on a human
being he knew that he never had any diffi-
culty running up a fair score on a white-
washed target
  snatching the gun he made the effort
  the roar of the shot was echoed by the
clattering of plate glass unaccountably
he had found shooting at another man some-
what different from blazing away at a tar-
get perhaps that was because he was very
careful not to hit the customer all he had
done was shatter the display case on the
counter-and bring hurley wheeling on him
with gun smoking
  the clerk let go one more shot before
he doubled up with a bullet in his insides
but that also was wild gagging and
squirming he dropped the gun and clutched
at his middle through a haze he saw hur-
ley smash his gun into the face of the dum-
founded and frightened customer and vault
the counter
  with shooting under way hurley was
wasting neither time nor lead he gathered
himself to sprint for the get-away car
  from the street came shouts voiced by
half a dozen people who were stampeding
back into the subway from which they had
only a minute ago issued shouts and
running footsteps-the shrilling of a police
whistle and the rapping of a nightstick on
the pavement a shot which crashed the
window on the left side of the store en-
trance
  cursing but nevertheless with a certain
degree of satisfaction hurley marked the
direction of that shot which evidently had
been fired to delay his exit from the store
it served the purpose for an instant but
also it informed him which way to look for
attack as he made his dash
  the shooter a policeman taking scant
cover behind a pole between the store and
one hundred and fifty-sixth street sent
another shot with the hope of either driving
the bandit deeper into the store or drawing
him out in desperate sally
  hurley crouched to run for it intending
to sweep the waiting marksman with a burst
of fire as he went
  before he could get under way another
report sounded and cracks rattled through
the window on the other side of the en-
trance caught between two fires the angle
of this shot showing that it had come from
the one hundred and fifty-seventh street
side he hung back when he should have
kept moving
  that was woodruff joining in with his
gun-and a prayer that hurley would be
saved for him only extraneously did he
comprehend that a hold-up was taking
place his mind was all on the possibility
of hurley being killed by other than his
hand that must not happen hurley be-

argosy-allstory weekly
longed to him to square himself for hav-
ing let hurley escape earlier in the night
and seventeen years ago he alone must kill
him
  woodruff advanced to get his man
  this while hurley hesitated during pre-
cious seconds weighing his chances he
cursed himself for not having observed
whether there was a rear way out of the
store through the stockroom he didnt be-
lieve there was-but he wasnt sure he
considered running back to see but was
afraid of being penned up in the back of
the place
  while he debated his glance traveled
from the wounded clerk lying moaning to
the customer he had felled the latter was
sitting in a corner where he had fallen
nursing his lacerated face and blubbering
  realizing that he had no choice but to
make a rush for the cab daring the guns
to right and left of him hurley dragged
the blubbering customer to his feet be-
fore running the gauntlet he could at least
create a diversion
  stand up he commanded viciously
 im going to let you go get that get
out of here
  he shoved the man reeling through the
front door
  the policeman behind the pole fired im-
mediately but woodruff then within ten
feet of the door saw that it wasnt hurley
and held his fire
  the man collapsed on the sidewalk un-
touched by the bullet but in weakness
from sheer terror the policeman came
running
  hurley plunged out-and found himself
facing double disaster the get-away cab
still was at the curb with engine running
but the driver was gone and as he halted
cornered not knowing whither to run he
saw woodruff raising his gun at point-blank
range
   hurley s gun flashed up its report blend-
ing with that of woodruffs that was all
hurley was done having been sht through
the head
  gun drooping at his side woodruff stood
looking at the fruit of his vengeance his
task was complete now-
    and that  be about all said the po-
liceman rising from brief examination of
hurley
   all nodded woodruff he held out
his gun
  the policeman looked at him question-
ingly
   whats that for
   you want it dont you and me
   for what say aint you a copper
  woodruff shook his head
   well it dont matter anyhow the
officer approved  you made one swell job
of this bird hey you he shooed the peo-
ple who were gathering close now that the
danger was over  get back a bit chase
em back a bit chase em back he hand-
ed his nightstick to woodruff  while i
talk with the station house and get an am-
bulance
  the arrival of another policeman re-
lieved woodruff of the duty of handling the
growing crowd
   happened along in time didnt you
remarked this officer assuming from the
stick in woodruffs hand that he also was a
policeman  where are vou working out
of
   im not said woodruff  im just-
a citizen
   oh  the cop lost interest in him un-
til his partner came back from telephoning
and told that it was woodruff who had
got the bandit then he whistled thought-
fully
   i dont suppose theyll tax you for it
he said  but somebodys going to ask how
come youre carrying a gun maybe it d
be a good scheme for you to fade out and let
ed here stand for the killing huh ed
   but said woodruff with dawning un-
derstanding  i have a permit i always
carrv a gun in my business-selling jewelry
why-
   oh that fixes everything say ed
lets mop up just stick around mister
will you
  woodruff smiled and stuck around he
had found a middle course after all hur-
ley the killer had made it possible for him
to keep his faith with the living and still
not break faith with the dead
   im going inside he said  to phone
