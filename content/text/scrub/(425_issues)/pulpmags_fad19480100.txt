a confidential chat with the edtor

you already know the good news for this
month if youve taken a good look at the
cover youre right were talking about don
wilcox and his new short novel secret of the
serpent this is one of those typically wilcox
stories if you get what we mean and that ought
to be plenty judging from dons popularity at
any rate this yarn will take you to a world
where nature seemed to have gone mad you
know the old phrase- aint got no body-well
on this particular planet a man never could be
sure he did have one at least thp type of body
he was used to its a humdinger of a story
and all you wilcox fans will love it  and
while were talking about the cover story lets
not forget the cover itself bob jones who in
our humble it says here opinion is the best
cover man in the fantasy field today-or any
day has turned out another beautiful job youd
be surprised at the number of requests we get
every month for jones originals or maybe you
wouldnt as many of you who are reading this
right now have written in yourself anyway wed
like to say in answer to all these requests that
we only wish we could supply you with some of
bobs fine work but all of our covers are held
for future use in over-seas editions of fa and
we know you wouldnt want to deprive the
fantasy fans over there of the same pleasure   

we pulled a fast one on our big sister maga-
zine amazing stories this month
knowing how much you readers like robert
moore williams stories we just couldnt resist the
temptation to steal one of them for this issue of
fa you might say that the yarn is not strictly a
fantasy but it does have all the well-known
ingredients that bob is famous for putting into
his stories so when you get to page  and start
reading youll find some first class science-fiction
with enough of a fantastic background to satisfy
everyone

titere presenting another story by the

	 de courcy writing team this month we feel
safe in saying that evensong is a fine story
of mood with a very neat fantasy pitch the
de courcys did a good job-we think let us
know what you think after you read it

vtours and our old pal bill mcgivern is back
again too this issue with what we think is a



really nice fantasy yam orders for willie
weston is a story about a young soldier who
never saw the real part of a war-but wanted
to join a famous combat outfit so when his
orders came through transferring him to a top-
notch combat division he was very happy-until
he found out that this division had been dis-
banded but this didnt stop willie because he
-whoa we nearly spilled it you take up the
story and find out yourself

hb hickey returns with a long novelette
entitled the drums of murd this is
one of those yarns that take you out of the
twentieth century and into the fascinating pages
of history but not exactly the history of our
earth as we know it more like the history of
another world say murd    what is murd
where is it well youll find that out when you
start reading on page  fair enough

vxith the fire trail by oge-make we pre-

	 sent something extremely unusual there are
several reasons why it is unusual one its true
two its written by a navaho indian three
its a sincere warning from the indian to the
white man four scientists all over the world
agree with the principles set forth in the indian
warning to elaborate the fire trail is a navaho
ceremony which is very ancient and very mystic
in it a man in a trance leaves his body travels
through space and time last summer oge-
make did walk the fire trail he went to ask
a question vital to the existence of the navaho
people he met with disappointment but he
did bring back a message-to the white man i
thus every word in the fire trail is truth and
the message has been passed on to the white
man in the only way found possible through
this magazines pages it was passed on to us
by l taylor hansen noted scientist who along
with many other scientists whose opinions we
have gives great credence to the danger out-
lined in this mystic warning from the red man
from out of the dim past and the far reaches
of space so read the story and think i we
believe it and when youve read it read the
message following it and do something about
that the navaho indians have done all they
can to warn us passing on the most sacred cere-
mony of their tribe lets return the favor so
desperately needed-wlh

           my jaws clamped around the struggling body of the pygmy as he screamed

                                                s
bob garrison had forgotten everything
about his former life - but in his new life

as a serpent he had a great deal to learn

i strained to keep my head out
of the water as i floundered around
in the blackness trying to find a
way out the warm air smelled of
blossoms and i think i should have
been lulled back to sleep if it hadnt
been for the water that kept rising

around me sleep-how long had i
been sleeping how long had this com-
plete blackness engulfed me how did
i happen to be here where did i come
from who was i what was my
name

  a sickening feeling ran through the


fantastic adventures

length of my long coiled body i didnt
even know my own name i had for-
gotten everything-everything that i
was supposed to know in order to carry
out my desperate purpose what pur-
pose

 what purpose

  i screamed within my mind like a
woman falling to her death there had
been a purpose an urgent purpose-
something far more important than the
life or death of any one man

  but how could i have a purpose re-
lating to the life or death of any man
when i was only a coiling writhing mass
of flesh lost in some underground black-
ness with an awful sleepiness engulfing
me and black water rising around me
and blossom-scented air lulling me into
sickening illusions of nothingness

  i tried to fight the water back with
my arms-i had no arms-i had no
legs-and my efforts resulted in the
random thrashing of my long snake-
like body

   was a serpent

  i had been a man and i had fallen
through the dense purple clouds as a
man-i was beginning to remember
now i had come to this ghastly space
island where the outcasts of the many
planets were sent-to live or to die-
and at the very minute that i had been
sure i would land safely i had sud-
denly fallen

  to die no to sink into a mire of
blindness deep in a crevice where no
sun-like eye of the heavens could pene-
trate and there in the slimy waters
of a greenish black river i had fought
to keep my grip on those last few pre-
cious minutes of life broken bones
crushed skull lifes blood ebbing away
pain pain such burning pain such
child-like terror of the unknown that
is death-and then-merciful sleep 

  but now my consciousness was re-
turning sharp and sensitive and my

new snake-like body was finding ways
to swim

  i swam cautiously holding my ser-
pent head about a foot and a half above
the surface of the water presently a
light broke through the deadly black-
ness-a streak of green which skipped
along the surface of the inky waters

  the ripples of green expanded the
cavern walls gradually changed from
coal-black to rock-brown and i lifted
my head to look up through hundreds
of feet of vertical surfaces the plan-
ets outer surface would be up there
somewhere perhaps two or three miles
above the waters of this deep-cut
stream i was a prisoner-yes twice a
prisoner a prisoner of the deep cre-
vasse and a prisoner of some ghastly
trick of nature that had given me this
serpents body

t looked back now and studied the
forty-foot length of purple and green
body that was now my dwelling place
it was frightening and revolting and
sickening and i hated the sight of my-
self and immediately i wished-

  oh what a wish what an awful
thing to wish at the very moment i
was hating myself so intensely

  i wished that i could frighten some-
one else i wished to see someone else
revolted and sickened by the flash of my
green and purple tail through these
black waters

  i woidd find someone

  it was a hideous purpose but i was
a serpent and it was my purpose i
was no longer an honored emissary from
the earth who had come to this far-off
space island with the purpose of find-
ing-

 what was my purpose

  for a moment it had almost flashed
back to me but now it was gone again
and only the snake in which i dwelt
could dominate my actions i wanted
secret of the serpent



to frighten someone and so i swam
through the twisting sharp-edged pas-
sage

  here the walls were only five feet
apart and as i tried my luck at climb-
ing i discovered the strength of my
coils in the dim light i saw for the
first time that hundreds of folds that
gave form and design to my yellowish-
green belly the walls sharp edges
prodded me with only trifling jabs of
discomfort it wasnt bad this busi-
ness of crawling it came easy i
was beginning to like it

  if youre a snake i said to myself
you dont actually mind being a
snake-

  i was speaking half aloud and my
breathy hiss fascinated me i tried it
again

  if youre a snake-snake-s-s-s-
snake-s-s-s-s-sss i

  my hiss echoed up through the walls
and there came an answer 
look out down there

  it was a human voice and it rang
down through the walls like a fire alarm

  look out it cried theres a
monster

  up through the hundreds of feet of
jagged brown walls i caught sight of
seven or eight tiny figures of human be-
ings who were working at the upper end
of a long rope then i saw as my eye
followed downward to the near end of
the line the object of their warning
cries two little men clad in loin
cloths had been lowered to a shelf of
rock not fifty feet away from my pres-
ent position

  i say two little men for they looked
to me to be not more than two and a
half or three feet tall

pygmies i said aloud then with
another satisfying hiss pygmiessssss 
the two little fellows were wild with
fear at the sight of me they clambered
along the perilous ledge trying to get

back to the rope by which they had been
lowered i could see that they had
been working with ropes and nets of
their own evidently trying to fish some-
thing out of the river

  things happened fast then for my
serpent instincts worked more power-
fully than my human intelligence

  one of the pygmies slipped and fell

  he struck the surface of the water
with a splash i could see him there
in the deep green shadows a black
form bobbing up at the edge of the rock
wall

  i slithered down to him he screamed
and struggled but i caught him in the
coils of my body and crushed him
then my jaws opened wide and i took
him in

  one quick painful swallow and i
got him down

  the men above were firing at me now
so i swam hard back into the darkness
where their rays couldnt touch me
my belly was full and i was comfort-
able and secure in my warm black
waters except for the dull torture of
my human conscience i was happy to
be a serpent

chapter ii

rthe first animal i met other than
the little human animals i had en-
countered in the river walls was an-
other monster who like myself was
not quite at home in his hideous form

the very sight of him gave me a great
deal of mental trouble

  if i had had no more mind than an
ordinary serpent i might not have suf-
fered any agony whatever i might
have attacked him and either he would
have killed me or i him

  but that bothersome streak of human
intelligence which i still possessed-the
remnant of my previous existence


fantastic adventures

which was still haunting me-made me
know something very important about
this new monster

  it made me know that he too was
a person who had been transformed

  i met him on the very rim of the
crevasse on the morning that i found
my way to the top i had climbed
through the long long night by the
light of six different moons-or neigh-
boring planets i couldnt be sure which
these heavenly bodies had crossed over
the deep gash that had imprisoned me
for so many hours and each time i
caught sight of one sailing slowly across
my thin line of sky i felt compelled
to climb faster and faster

  each time one passed on out of
sight i felt weak and exhausted from
my effort and wished that i were again
at the surface of the water i belonged
in the water i was safe there no
there was another moon sliding into
sight-i must climb up toward it-
faster faster

  when the star-eye which this far-
off planet called its sun at last began to
gray the sky with morning i was sure
that the night had lasted for scores and
scores of earth hours and i knew that
there would also be a very long day
ahead it wouldnt be wise for me to
start back through the deep descent un-
til i had at least found some nourish-
ment somewhere there must be more
pygmies i kept my eyes sharpened
for the sight of any movement along the
surface of the rocky ledge and there
in the pink light of dawn i saw it

  it was large for a cat-large enough
to be a draft horse or a small elephant
-but that wasnt what made it such
a weird and formidable sight to my
eyes it had two heads and its four
eyes always turned in the same direc-
tion were casting their baleful greenish-
yellow glare glow at me as i ascended

  the cat-like body hardly moved i

might have expected it to bound away
in fear but it stood its ground my
coils carried me up through the last
twenty feet of ascent and i worked my
way as limber as any earthworm along
the edge

  the double-headed cat-monster
watched me with its four steady eyes
when my flipping tail struck a loose
stone and sent it clattering down
through the crevasse the cat-monster
didnt wink an eye but simply went
on staring at me the hair began to
rise on its back its claws emerged
thin white lines that spoke a warning

  i stopped holding my head about
four feet above the surface of the boul-
der upon which my chest-if it could
be called a chest-had crawled to a
stop i drew my head back a few inches
and slowly opened my jaws

  the cat-monsters shoulders hunched
dangerously and the beast showed his
sabre teeth

just then the slight rustle of feet
sounded from a heap of rocks to
my left and i turned in time to see the
first shot fired the tongues of red
flame darted out from the muzzles of
three guns

  pygmies again

  they were shooting at the cat-mon-
ster  one blast-two-three deadly
rays of zeego fire i had seen enough
of it on the earth i should know who-
ever the pygmies were they possessed
zeego ray guns that had certainly come
from the earth

  my human impulse was to leap over
the rocks and pounce upon the little
men with my fists swinging but hu-
man impulses were only a handicap to
my new body it worked on principles
of its own and instantly i was crawl-
ing at high speed

  with fangs bared i pounced upon
the surprised trio three zeego guns
secret of the serpent



dropped two of the pygmies were
running down a cliff path as hard as
they could go their feet thudded with
a fancy little rhythm that reminded me
of a military drum i had heard some-
where the other sound was the scream
of the third pygmy whose voice might
have been compared to a screech of a
clarinet in high register it ended with
a gurgling choking sound as my coiling
body closed around him

  ones serpent habits take hold quick-
ly i found without debating the mat-
ter i simply gulped him down

  i would have given the other two a
hard chase then if it hadnt been for
another cry that chilled my cold blood
the monster-cat-in pain-dying i
wondered it had certainly been struck
by the rays of zeego fire i slithered
back over the rocks to the cliffs edge

  the creature had been struck across
both of its foreheads just above the
four eyes-four greenish-yellow eyes
that were wide with pain and terror

  the lids all began to close simultane-
ously for a moment i thought the cat-
monster was dying its shoulders sank
and it went down and it was shrink-
ing-

  shrinking smaller and smaller-cry-
ing with pain-crying with the voice of
a girl-

  it was transforming into something-
something more nearly human its two
heads were growing smaller its body
was losing the fur covering growing
whiter pink shoulders caught the pink
sunlight human arms were forming
clasping the breasts of its human body
and then it was running from me from
one projecting rock to another until it
had hidden somewhere in the crags

  i watched not daring to follow

  when it looked out peering cautious-
ly through the clump of bushes at the
foot of the crags i saw that its arms
and shoulders were those of a beautiful

girl its two heads had been reduced
in size to correspond with its human
body but they were not human heads
they were feline heads in every detail
and their four cat-like eyes were all
watching me with deadly suspicion

  i went back to where the three zeego
ray guns had fallen and wondered how
i could manage to pick them up and
use them

chapter iii

tt was a strange world a world in
which no new arrival could know his
rights in the first place he couldnt
be sure that he knew himself in the
second place he couldnt be sure of his
own eyes when he tried to know his
neighbors in the third place how
could he be sure that anything he did
know for sure today would be the same
tomorrow

   if it isnt being too sarcastic i must
admit that this serpent was tying him-
self in knots almost literally for many
hours to come

  when i would find a pool of water
and look in and see my new face re-
flected there for a moment i would
despise myself those evil yellowish
eyes of mine were enough to make any-
one hate and distrust me the fine
scales around my nose and jaws were
almost as sly as my eyes the way they
would catch the tints from the rocks
and trees and flowers i knew that i
could lurk in a pool where the pygmies
came to pick the brilliant orange-col-
ored water flowers-the flopetals-and
i could catch enough protective colora-
tion that a pygmy wouldnt see me until
i sprang i was sure i could and if
i ever got hungry enough i would

  but my powers as a serpent as i
have already hinted were the source of
much mental torture it was bad enough
to possess an animal instinct that would


fantastic adventures

cause me to kill and devour little human
beings it was even worse to realize
that these people must somehow be re-
lated to myself as proved by the fact
that a they were human and b
they talked english and c they used
earth-mens weapons

  probably youve never had an occa-
sion to eat a human being but if you
have you know that after your stomach
is filled and your soul is again at peace
with the world then you can feel all
sorts of remorse for your evil deed

  i was remorseful regularly about ev-
ery twelve hours but just as regularly
too i became quite hungry-and at
such times i was guilty of hoping with
all of my forty-foot being that the sup-
ply of pygmies wouldnt run out

  i hoped too that they wouldnt get
too handy with their zeego guns as a
serpent i had certain responsibilities
which needed to be carried out faith-
fully one of them was to take care
of my prisoner

  im speaking of her

  yes she was my prisoner and i was
taking care of her i was protecting
her too whenever i thought the pyg-
mies were in danger of discovering her
hiding place i found a way to warn her
that they were coming

  her two cat-like heads were always
alert to my coming it seemed when-
ever i came crawling along the cliff
path toward the cavern pool where she
lived i would hear her plunge into the
water and that was proof that she had
heard me coming then i would see
her-the two heads of her-swimming
along quietly to the narrow opening in
the wall of rock somehow it reminded
me of a corner in a well planned zoo
for it was a perfect retreat from the
passing public the public in this
case being one forty-foot purple and
green serpent

  so it was that i kept her a prisoner

and cared for her and came to think
of her more as a pair of untamed cats
joined by a whimsy of nature into a
single body either the water or the
cave would conceal her body from my
eyes as a rule and i ceased to think
of her as having human qualities

  at first i had tried a few times to
talk with her but neither of her heads
had offered any answers i lapsed into
a more frequent use of my warning
hisses consequently and began to neg-
lect my serpents efforts to talk english

vne day-which is to say many
many hours after this very strange
life had begun-something happened
which changed everything almost with
the speed of light

  a broken space ship came hurtling
down out of the sky and when it fell
within five hundred feet of the sur-
face it blew outward in dozens of pieces
like a shell exploding the pieces must
have scattered over at least a five mile
radius and there wasnt much chance
i assumed that any band of half civi-
lized pygmies would ever pick them up
and i was right

  but i was wrong in thinking that
this rain of wreckage would go un-
noticed

  from a mountain peak twenty-five
or thirty miles away a whole squadron
of planes came out to swish back and
forth across the valley and i knew that
there was someone in these parts who
was more concerned with this hail of
trouble than the pygmies fifteen
planes hummed over as slowly as a
hawk soars over a field in search of a
mouse

  they came low over the edge of the
crevasse

  i crawled back into a clump of bushes
where i wouldnt be seen i could see
the two cat heads at the mouth of the
small cave so i knew that she was
secret of the serpent



watching too

  dont let them see you i called
it was the first time i had spoken in
english for many hours she looked
at me and folded her white arms tighter
she moved deeper into the water so that
only two pink noses and four yellow
eyes remained above the surface

  a few minutes later the plane drifted
directly over the small pool by this
time i had guessed that they were look-
down upon every bit of lake or rivulet
or feeder stream that cascaded into the
deep crevasse why i would learn
later

  one of the planes circled back over
the little pool by this time she was
back in the cave and i was reasonably
sure that they hadnt seen either her or
me but they threw out a package as
they went over and it fell toward the
pool

  it burst just before it struck it burst
like a clocd of flour-or better sulphur
for it was creamy yellow in color it
struck the surface of the water and
there was a bubbling and hissing of
steam

  then i heard her cry

  i tried to interpret the wail as that of
two voices not one there was no rea-
son i thought that one of the voices
should cry and not the other yet i
somehow knew in spite of the spine-
chilling echoes of the cavern that it was
only one voice and not a feline voice
either it was the cry of a girl

  instantly i plunged into the pool it
was the first time that i had tried to
approach her since that morning when
i had seen her as a dangerous furry
monster the whirl of steam blinded
me for a moment and the fumes caught
in my lungs and seemed to burst out
through my chest-if i could call it a
chest-and thudded out like pounding
hammers at my shoulders-

  my shoulders

  the fumes stung my lungs and the
steam burned at my eyes and then sud-
denly it was over and the air was clear
and there was the pool of blue water
with my long snake-like body showing
green and purple through the waves

  i was ashamed to be there so close
then for the girl in the cave before me
thought i was being ill-mannered to in-
trude upon her

  the girl yes with the same white
arms folded tightly over her breasts
and the pink light of the sun kissing her
pink shoulders she moved down a lit-
tle deeper into the water so that only
her head-her beautiful human head
with flowing dark hair a pair of fright-
ened dark eyes and lips parted in
speechless wonderment-showed above
the surface of the water

  i knew this person i had seen her
before where when if i could only
remember how this had all come
about-

  she spoke then breathlessly

  look bob you have arms now
she said then you are bob arent
you

chapter iv

jefore i had a chance to answer
she cried hide quick theyre
coming 

  the hum of planes was on us almost
without warning i made a dart toward
the cave-her cave-and at the same
instant i caught sight of my own reflec-
tion in the water-my vicious-looking
eyes that was what turned me back
as a serpent i didnt trust myself to
invade her private refuge i whirled
about and the water splashed high
around the rocky walls

  quick get out of sight she cried

  i crawled faster than i had ever
crawled before i thought i was headed
in the right direction to make the clump


fantastic adventures

of bushes before the planes came too
close but i was wrong on both counts
with my serpents head whirling to
keep watch on their approach i missed
my direction and sped right into the
crevasse

  my human arms grabbed frantically
at the ragged edge of rock what a fu-
tile gesture my muscular forty-foot
body was racing too fast to be caught
by a thin pair of arms i rolled into the
opening

  as i fell i caught myself momen-
tarily on the first ledge my head and
neck fought to catch around the rocky
projections and my hands beat at the
walls for a hold but the bulk of my
body was already falling like the loops
of a cable and if i had tried to hold
fast i would surely have snapped my
head off

  it was a strange thought for my mind
to feed upon as i fell some boyhood
experience was coming back to me in
the fields-in the pastures-somewhere
long ago on a more friendly planet the
earth the snakes of those fields may
have been friendly but i was a boy and
a snake was a snake and i had used
to kill them by grabbing their tails and
cracking them like a whip to break
their necks

  i was falling falling down and down
through two or three miles of rocky
walls i was turning writhing twist-
ing trying to widen my coiled body to
catch like a steel spring within the nar-
rowing walls

  rip the curve of my side struck a
projection and the green and purple
pattern tore with a gash of red

  within a hundred feet of the bottom
i managed to straighten out my body
so that the loop was in a vertical plane
and the wall burns were avoided

  splasssssssh

  what an echo up and down through
the crevasse i sank under instantly

still i heard it and it seemed that the
greenish-black waters were alive with
the sounds for minutes afterward

  when my head emerged and again i
began to breathe the soft blossom-filled
air my first thought was of the girl
she had called me bob

  was i bob

  what had made her think that i was
anything more than a slimy reptile

  the thought was too much for me
burdened as i was by a water-spanked
belly and a torn side i relaxed and
failed to find the stamina i needed to
keep my consciousness from ebbing
away i fainted away in serpent sleep

chapter v

xhen i awakened the moons were
sliding slowly over my tiny streak
of sky there would be hours of night
before i should be able to see any hu-
man figures at the top of the opening
and i was hungry

  im hungry i said aloud its
good that she isnt here now

  when you speak aloud that way you
always stop and wonder whether some-
one might have heard you maybe
thats what gave me the weird feeling
that someone had heard and that i was
in the presence of company i tried not
to rustle the waves as i stretched my
neck and peered into the surrounding
darkness i listened nothing but the
low gurgle of water and an occasional
complaining murmur of my empty in-
testinal tract

  i made a disheartening discovery
then and i groaned aloud i wondered
how a mountain climber would feel if
he got almost to the top and then
skidded on the ice and slid all the way
back and had to start over

  it had taken me hours and hours of
work to get to the top the first time
and here i was back in the depths again
secret of the serpent



but that wasnt all my arms and hands
were gone

  with a commendable human impulse
to forego the pleasure of feasting on a
pygmy since none were likely to be
handy before daybreak i had decided
to try this stream for clams or fish
there must be something i thought or
the pygmies wouldnt have been down
here with nets but my inspiration was
blasted by my discovery my shoulders
had shrunken into slight lumps where
my cylindrical body enlarged below my
neck all traces of the appendages had
disappeared

  hunting clams or fish without the aid
of hands wasnt going to be easy my
serpents instinct urged me not to plow
through the water with my mouth open

  i tried to think of a way out i was
too hungry to think i needed a pygmy
i was too weak and sore to start the
journey back to the surface two or
three miles overhead i wondered   
didnt any pygmies ever get lost on
their way home from a celebration and
tumble into this place by mistake i
didnt wish them any ill luck and still-

  the thought heartened me and i be-
gan to swim slowly painfully up the
stream i feared that i might be
doomed to spend much time down here
and if so i had just as well explore the
whole weird river

  curious the sensations that accom-
panied me on that long night a few
minutes of moonlight filtered all the
way down to my bright eyes and gave
them a frightening yellow glow in the
waters reflection after the moonlight
darkness cloudy darkness and rain
thin drops that splashed over the
length of me as i raised one loop after
another of my rope-like body to the
surface the sky again again the
moon again that mystifying feeling
that someone else was present

  maybe its one of those pygmies i

ate i said aloud i listened unmov-
ing trying to determine whether my
words had been answered with an ever
so delicate sound-the amused puff of
breath from some listener back there
in the blackness

  i swam faster i stopped suddenly
and allowed the waters to swirl around
me i listened i did hear the sounds
of breathing-no whispering

tt was almost over me now it was

  retreating i waited and it was gone
i was tempted to follow a human whis-
per was a promise of food for a hungry
serpent but i was puzzled as to how
any follower could be hovering over me

  my plan formed slowly it would
depend upon finding a sharp turn in
the river to make sure that i would not
give myself away

  i plowed ahead increasing my speed
the narrow line of night sky high
above me was darkening again in a
few moments i came to a sharp turn
that would close away any sights mo-
mentarily from my pursuer swishing
through the turn i applied my muscled
coils to the wall and climbed up

  good luck-i slipped out of the wa-
ter almost silently so there was no
warning splash now-careful

  i bridged between the walls less than
twenty feet above the streams surface
the humps that would have been my
shoulders rested against one side and
the coil of my belly braced solid against
the other thus my head and neck
were free to move back and forth be-
tween the walls

  in a moment it came-a length of
rope with a weight on the lower end
i knew it my pursuer-or rather
pursuers-hung from a rope that was
being moved by some guiding force two
or three miles up at the top of the
crevasse

  the rope rubbed against my unseen


fantastic adventures

body the occupants of the swing at
the lower end coasted to a stop and
dangled like an uncertain pendulum

  whats happened one of them
whispered

  weve caught on something said
the other wed better get loose too
or hell get away he was swimming
fast

  are you sure it was he it might
be the girl you know

  if he turned serpent its more likely
to be a man here lets kick the wall
together and maybe well jar loose by
george i can see something right above
us looks like it bridges all the way
across wheres the light

  we dont dare show a light said
the first voice that beast wouldnt
know whether we were a friend or foe
and whats more he wouldnt care

  that was when i broke my long si-
lence with an ugly hissing question

  whicccch are you

  i felt the jerk of the rope as it scraped
past an injured spot on my body and
instantly pulled away from me the
two men must have had close contact
with their guides high overhead what-
ever their signal system they swung
back from me before i could dart for-
ward with my head they swung back
and up without stopping for a word of
argument

  whats the hurry i hissed

  one of them answered who are
you

  i didnt know the girl had called
me bob and the name had begun to
ring pleasantly i had caught the im-
pression that it was all right to be bob
as far as she was concerned but that
it might not be so good to be anyone
else i wondered

  bring me some food i called

  who are you the voice returned

  how do i know i said im too
hungry to know anything

  there was a short whispered con-
sultation should they flash the light
on or shouldnt they would the mon-
ster snap at them or would he give them
a chance the wisps of conversation
were reassuring and i began to know
that these two meant to be friends if i
would give them a chance

  are you bob one of them asked
presently

  who is bob i asked

hphey put their heads together
again if i didnt know who bob
was maybe i wasnt one of the party
they were seeking after all maybe i
hadnt come to the space island recent-
ly-maybe i was an old-timer here who
had simply kept myself well hidden un-
til yesterday when i had been lured to
the surface by the sight of that two-
headed cat-monster

  it was all a mystery to me but i
wasnt going to turn away any advan-
tage or miss a chance to eat

  pull me up to the surface i said
so i can find my dinner i put con-
siderable hiss in my voice as i added
otherwise ill have to eat what i find
down here

  meaning what one of the voices
asked sharply

  meaning you hsssssssh you 
the rustle from the swing was the
sound of two men making ready for
trouble with ray pistols

  all right fellow one of them said
crawl up this way and twine yourself
around the rope well take you up to
the surface no false moves though
or youll never eat another dinner

  i obeyed my long body swished qui-
etly upward between the walls and i
crossed over to the rope a moon
slipped into sight high above and the
two men below me must have had a fair
view of me as i corkscrewed upward
my sore belly was put to a cruel test
secret of the serpent



trying to hold a grip on a rope no bigger
around than your arm but presently i
was on and i gave them the signal to
take me up easy up we went

  a few minutes later i slithered over
the edge of the crevasse once more and
mentally i vowed i would never seek
those lower regions again i was be-
ginning to have some purposes of my
own

  there was first of all that big pur-
pose and all the way up through the
dark walls i had tried my best to re-
call what it was someone i must find
that was getting close i thought

  someone to find-the only someone
i knew up here was the beautiful girl
in the pool well there was the one
purpose that i could swear to i wanted
to know whether she was still there and
who she was and where i had known
her before

  bob she had called me if any
words ever echoed in a snakes ears
hers were the words if any serpent
ever felt obliged to go back to a beau-
tiful woman and find out why she had
dared to trust him as far as that girl
had trusted me i was that serpent

  and so out of these purposes half
defined and half foggy i acted with
the slyness of a snake

  i could see the outline of a small
plane on the ground in the light of the
various moons i could see that its door
was open did i dare

  the rope was still rising being wound
upward into a blimp that hovered dark-
ly over the crevasse the men had just
reached the top now they would ex-
pect to take me in charge using their
pistols to command me

  this way you if you want that
dinner-

  i didnt listen something from my
half forgotten memories told me that i
knew how to handle a plane and the
door was open it was a perfect set-up

if i could crawl in before the guns
started heading me off with red fire

  swissssh zippp i shot along over
the cool grass and i ploughed right into
the planes entrance

  there so far so good i pushed my
nose against a lever that locked me in
the men were coming all right the
lines of red fire were zeego shots the
same as the pygmies had used but
they were outside and i was safe within
crawling across the floor to the con-
trols

  could i with my serpents nose my
teeth my hammer-like head my agile
neck-could i get away with it in
another moment i would know

  if it worked then i would have the
freedom to see what this strange land
was all about and first of all i would
find that girl if they hadnt taken her
already

  the controls were locked

  not a thing responded to my touch
not a switch-

  but suddenly as i was trying one
gadget after another the lights went
on-surely not from anything i had
done

  there came a voice through the
speaker i guess were ready to take
him with us those were voices from
the blimp coming in on the intercom

  is he in another voice said

  he crawled right in without any
coaxing said one of the voices that
had come up from the depths with me
thats enough to prove that he is bob
look hes at the controls now hes
our missing pilot all right thats an-
other victory boys were getting the
party assembled gradually

  so i was bob a pilot all right if
they said so id be agreeable but i
was also a hungry serpent i wasnt a
cooperative animal i was sly and vi-
cious and all i wanted was to look out
for myself if they thought they were


fantastic adventures

going to fly me somewhere as a pris-
oner they had another think coming
i coiled around and crawled back to the
door and nosed against the lever

  it wouldnt open

  the plane was moving through the
blackness yes it was rising they
were flying it by remote control and i
was on my way somewhere whether i
liked it or not

chapter vi

      doubt about it they had set a
neat trap for me and here i was
thinking that i was the sly one they
may have had the advantage of human
looks but im darned if they hadnt
out-serpented the serpent

  we went toward the pink dawn and
landed in the early morning twilight
on a shelf of concrete in the upper level
of a valley between two huge shoulders
of mountain here was the stronghold
from which i had seen the planes come
not so many hours ago after the blow-
up of a falling space ship

  my plane landed and came to a stop
in front of a magnificent arched en-
trance the other planes and the blimp
closed in around me and a ground crew
of blue-and-orange men came out to
take over

  the door of my plane was not opened
until a glass-and-metal cage was set up
for me

  i crawled in without any undue coax-
ing their trickery was still working
they had put a pygmy in the far corner
of the cage i thought it was a pygmy
but when my jaws clamped over it i
found that it was a wax imitation i
spat it out and recoiled to strike back
at someone i didnt care whom how-
ever the door of my cage had already
slid shut and i was caught

  if i had been an honored ambassador
from the earth extending good will and

a promise of interplanetary trade to
this planet im sure my hosts would
have found it in their power to feed me
without any undue delay and i would
have eaten and a friendship would have
been sealed then and there by virtue
of the universal law of brotherhood
that springs from a full stomach

  but i was a serpent in a cage and
neither my human voice nor the growl-
ings of my lank intestines could prod
my caretakers to move any faster than
they wished to do

  is he ready for the experiment i
heard someone ask

  better take him back into the z
lab came the answer

  not bad looking scientists i thought
to myself plump and well-fed and suf-
ficiently healthy to keep a hungry ser-
pent nourished for a week what other
attributes these men may have had
didnt interest me much at the time i
had caught a fleeting glimpse of the
arched doorway a noble structure orna-
mented with polished brass large
enough for planes to enter of the
three openings under the arch i was
taken through the one that served the
automotive traffic two trucks spun
past me on their way out to one of the
mountain highways and i saw that they
were driven by pygmies

  this isnt going to be so pleasant
i told myself now how many of
those fellows will i have to account for
when they bring me up before the
judge

  i was counting back over my indis-
cretions shall we say when the tun-
neled driveway opened into a lighted
room they wheeled me past a row
of elevators on through a lobby of au-
tomotive vehicles and at last through
a door of three square green-metal
panels marked laboratory z

  the room would have been perfectly
dark if someone hadnt been meddling
secret of the serpent



with a lightning machine as soon as
the lab door closed behind me the
lightning had me i mean it would have
captured anyones attention the first
time dark-dark-dark-aa dark-
dark-dark-iasa

  after the first fifteen purplish-white
flashes you began to think youd caught
the rhythm and could tell when the next
flash was coming but that was an il-
lusion flash-flash-flash all at once
they were coming fast and you had a
premonition that they were going to
close in on you and electrocute you
you couldnt tell exactly where they
were coming from but all at once you
saw the door of your cage fly open and
no one was standing there with guns so
it was your chance

  i flashed around and darted out
through the opening my flying tail
struck the rear wall as i turned only
to add a hard push to my sudden effort
to slither out while there was a chance

  wouldnt i ever learn

  it was nothing more than a trick
of course

t realized it the moment the last
of my forty-foot body found the cool
concrete floor the very next flash
showed a derrick-like arm swinging
down from the ceiling one glimpse-
the resemblance was unmistakable-
it was a package of sulphur-colored
powders the same as those that had
descended on the girl in the pool

  floooof

  on the instant the blackness of the
room gave way to what seemed a lu-
minous dust storm my serpent-like
form writhed and whipped and scraped
and fought the deluge was over me
i coughed and choked with wild un-
speakable tortures

  it was over the air was clearing
and the steam that had stung deep in
my lungs was melting away bars of

lights came on around the room and
the first thing i saw was my own form
in a huge mirror

  i moved half crawling and half
walking toward the mirror

  if you can imagine the classical fa-
cade of an old fashioned colonial home
with two pairs of fifty-foot columns
standing white and solid on either side
of the entrance thats the sort of frame
i now approached it was the highest
mirror i ever saw a full sized giraffe
could have used it to advantage and
still had room to spare

  i move up the six wide concrete steps
with considerable pride in my bearing
you see i was watching myself in that
mirror fully aware that something had
transformed me i had two arms once
more and also a good pair of human
legs

  the arms somewhat to my dismay
were about six feet long-long enough
that i had at once begun to use them
for front legs my snake-like body was
still all there from my scaled face and
sly greenish-yellow eyes all the way
down to my brightly colored tail but
i had legs i was walking as well as
crawling

  how do you like it

  the voice came out of a speaker in
the wall

  how did you do it i replied i
looked around to see who was convers-
ing with me and i spied them-three
men in a plexiglass pill-box onthe op-
posite wall

  come over this way so we can see
you one of the men said do you
remember who you are

  of course i said im bob gar-
rison a registered space ship pilot i
came to this space island on an er-
rand-

  i checked myself after all it was
none of their concern so far as i knew
just now i was whirling with more


fantastic adventures

thoughts than i could hold but it
wouldnt do to spill any of the confiden-
tial ones i was not too sure after all
that i was among friends

  im bob garrison i repeated

  walk around the room bob garri-
son came the order

  i didnt mind obeying it paid to
know what ones body would and would
not do and if this was it-well i needed
a bit of exercise to get my balance

  all at once the hunger pangs shot
through me and i stopped immediately
below the platform where the three men
were perched and looked up at them
then the dreadful fact of my pygmy
dinners came back with a new surge of
remorseful conscience that was awful
it was hideous it was terrifying and
my serpent blood ran cold at the
thought

  there i was however caught be-
tween the human impulse to recover my
civilized feelings and my bestial in-
stincts to leap up at the platform and
devour one of those men

t leaped i leaped and struck at
the plexiglass enclosure and almost
hit it

  good action one of the men mum-
bled through the speaker i cant re-
call that weve ever had such a speci-
men as that before

  i dont understand another scien-
tist replied why he shouldnt have
transformed more completely into his
original stage he seems to have re-
gained the human memory all right
and were not going to have any trouble
bringing his arms back to normal but
hes taken a pretty deep shock some-
how to have that serpents body fixed
upon him so stubbornly how large a
dose of powders did we apply

  their discussion went on along these
lines the girl they mentioned had
come back to normal with only half as

strong an explosion as they had given
me but someone protested that she
had already been partially reconverted
by means of a shock from zeego gunfire

  why dont we try the zeego fire on
this one then

  that matter was worth a few minutes
earnest discussion and two or three
times i was sure they would decide to
do it once not so many hours ago i
had captured three zeego guns of my
own i recalled and had tried to find a
pygmy to use them on but in the end
my appetite had always won over my
scientific ambitions they eventually
suspended their discussion the boss
had better be consulted before they did
anything more to me

  hes a pretty valuable specimen
just as he stands said the chief spokes-
man we might ruin him with zeego
fire i have a hunch-

  he paused as if perhaps he should
hold back his confidences but the other
two consultants were already guessing
his thought

  yes gentlemen i have a hunch
that dr hunt will prefer to dissect this
specimen as he now stands an undam-
aged skeleton of this sort will give us
one of the finest studies in the labora-
tory

  so that was it i was to be dr
hunts undamaged skeleton was i
that was too much

  and to think that i was the man who
had come to this ghastly outpost of
space on a secret mission if you please
-to rescue the lost scientist dr emer-
son hunt

  i leaped and struck the underside of
the transparent enclosure so hard that
the floor cracked and a brace tore loose
from its wall mooring the three gen-
tlemen must have decided to take their
conference elsewhere they made a
quick exit and locked the wall door be-
hind them

chapter vii

t shall be everlastingly thankful to
the caretaker who fed me before my
visit with flora hessel i was ravenous
and i simply couldnt have maintained
any outward appearance of civilized
serpenthood if they hadnt fed me

  the cage was around me again i
didnt mind that it was just the pro-
tection i needed while i did some tall
thinking flora hessel bless her heart
came to me and helped me think with
her help it all seemed worthwhile

  we were both warned against com-
ing to this outpost in the first place
she said

  i nodded i was thinking how beau-
tiful a person she was even dressed in
one of the workmens uniforms-a
rough one-piece suit of blue and orange
and a liberal sprinkling of grease spots
her dark hair was loosely combed fall-
ing free over one shoulder her bare
legs and arms were lithe and graceful as
she settled herself comfortably in the
chair which a caretaker provided for
her outside my cage

  i remember what you said bob
she smiled when they warned you
against coming you said you had your
own good reason for coming-some-
thing more than hiring out as their pilot
i was sure but you never told me

  no ive never told anyone i said
cautiously the fact was that i had
been on the verge of telling her more
than once during our long hours of
flight together but ernest marsch had
done his very best to keep us from
becoming acquainted ernest marsch
had hired each of us for our specialized
jobs and he had intended that we
should keep our minds on our work

  we have heard tales of these strange
transformations before we came flora
went on looking dreamily off into space
dont know about you but i simply

didnt believe they could happen

  i didnt quite realize i admitted
still that was the very earliest report
that ever came from this land-you
know-after the first wave of settlers
from the earth were shipped off
mars-

  it could be found in any modern his-
tory even though each historian was
careful to word his account in such a
way that the story could be taken as a
legend rather than fact the first wave
of american and english settlers on the
earth colonies of mars had gone
through the bitter ordeal of becoming
adjusted to new climatic and gravita-
tional conditions and the awful experi-
ence had taken its toll fifty years
after the first wave of settlers the sec-
ond wave had come to mars in great
numbers they came equipped with
better means of setting up conditions
congenial to their own needs and they
made a healthy go of it

  but the second group of martian set-
tlers simply couldnt endure the first
that was the original tragedy-and this
was the fact that every writer of history
deplored the first group had become
so changed and twisted in their human
nature-shrunken in mind and body
and spirit and animal-like in their
tastes-that in a sudden act of hysteria
the second group had loaded up hun-
dreds of the first group on derelict space
ships and simply rocketed them out of
the solar system

  beyond the solar system they had
fallen to this mysterious space island
where the forces of gravitation had been
found to be much like those of the earth
the drifting planets inner heat pro-
vided conditions suitable for life and
there was life here-life in innumerable
forms since much of the interplan-
etary driftwood living and otherwise
from the solar system and three other
systems found its way to this particu-


fantastic adventures

lar catchall in the sky it was not sur-
prising that there would be many forms
of life here

  but according to the fanciful legend
which the historians handled with great
caution those varying forms of life were
the results of transformations that oc-
curred as soon as the creatures from
other planets began to eat the food and
drink the water which this space island
provided

  and according to the legend the first
outcasts from the earth colony on mars
were still living here-not their de-
scendants but the original members of
the first group if this were true they
must be men and women more than two
hundred years of age-or were they
men and women

  or were they beasts who roamed the
mountains of space island

rthe historians could only cite the

  legend and promise that in time the
scientists would have more answers

  but scientists were not too eager to
come considering the odds that a per-
sonal tragedy of some sort would strike
them before they had a chance to set
up a laboratory as few persons on
the earth realized dr hunt had come
but not of his own accord there had
been a bit of smooth interplanetary
gangsterism back of his sudden disap-
pearance from the well-known emerson
laboratories

  all of this background came welling
up into my thoughts while i talked with
flora hessel from my glass and metal
cage the recent liberation from the
awful serpent-thoughts gave me a flare
of new hope that i might still be on the
trail of my original purpose

  i am going to confide in you i said
quietly trying my best to keep the hiss
out of my voice but first you must
tell me something how did you know

when you first saw me as a serpent that
i might be bob why didnt you guess
me to be ernest marsch or pete
hogan or one of the others

  dont you know

  there were ten of us on board i
said and the explosion that struck us
as we were coming in must have either
killed or transformed all of us into
something unrecognizable i certainly
didnt recognize you when you were in
your cat-monster body not until you
began to reduce into human form and
even then my mind was too bleary to
remember who you were i only knew
that i felt friendly toward you

  that was it said flora it was
your manner-your friendliness and
your courage you remember you
rushed after those little gunmen the
minute they started shooting pete
hogan wouldnt have done that

  but ernest marsch might have
after all hes the one who employed
you to come up here and tame some of
his obstreperous workers he wouldnt
want to see you shot down after invest-
ing in you

  she smiled at the corners of her eyes
youre right if theyd killed me hed
have shaken the gold out of my teeth
to line his pocketbook

  but you knew that i was bob not
ernest marsch are you sure im not
marsch

  you were quite considerate of me
while i was cornered in that cavern
pool she said for a snake you used
remarkably nice manners marsch
wouldnt have been that decent even at
his human best you know

  i must admit that her words pleased
me and i felt that i was better ac-
quainted with her than i had been at
any time during the trip marsch had
tried to drive a wedge between the two
of us from the start he had warned
me that she was a dangerous person-
secret of the serpent



that she had once come very nearly
being a gangsters moll-that she had
been mixed up in a gang war that had
resulted in five killings one dark night
on the west side but i knew that what-
ever her past had been she had later
gained an enviable reputation in her so-
cial service work with the tough home-
less men on the west side it was said
that she could walk into a mob of quar-
reling angry men and have them sing-
ing hymns within twenty minutes

  that was why ernest marsch had
hired her for this job as i had learned
from their conversations on the ship
he was lining this planet up for some
high-powered commercial venture and
he wanted the inhabitants-the human
inhabitants-to be at least docile
enough that they wouldnt obstruct the
march of progress

jjer task wasnt going to be any
snap juding from what i had seen
of those devilish pygmies moreover
if there were many freaks like me half
animal and half human little miss hes-
sel was going to have a big handful of
trouble

  do they consider you a prisoner
here i asked

  im not sure she looked wistfully
at the window and the ridge of green
mountains beyond they seem to
think theyre going to find ernest
marsch somewhere though it beats me
how they can find any trace of lost per-
sons in such a big empty world

  and if they find marsch-
well ive told them im bound to
work for him i signed the contract
and took out life insurance before i
boarded

i wonder what he turned into
its all theory she said but one
of the men was saying they believe a
persons mood or humor at the time he
struck the planets explosive atmos-

phere is the thing that determines his
change then she laughed no it
cant be that you couldnt have been
in the mood of a serpent

  are you sure i thought the mat-
ter over privately i had certainly been
spying on ernest marsch right up
toward the moment of coming in on a
landing and i had been watching him
as suspiciously as any snake but you
couldnt have been a two-headed fe-
line

  she was amused i dont know
when i try to remember that last
moment before we exploded all i can
recall is that i was very curious-as
curious as any cat ill bet-and i was
trying to watch you and ernest marsch
at the same time-trying not to dis-
please either of you though i felt sure
that you were almost at swords
points-

  ye gods i said this theory is
getting stickier every minute maybe
you were being a two-headed feline
then if theres anything to it theyll
never find marsch it isnt easy to lo-
cate a worm you know

  it shouldnt be so hard to pick up a
wolf she said giving me a quick look
and i dont mean a harmless wolf
either if it hadnt been for your help
on the trip i think i might have forgot
my good manners and shot ernest
marsch through the heart

  really

  i didnt sign up to be his girl friend
you know that little pistol of mine
has been a friend in need more than
once

  then her edged voice softened and
she looked at me sympathetically
well have to get you out of this awful
shape theyve made a good start
anyway getting your brain back in
order but its just a start are they
going to find a way is that the confi-
dence you wanted to give me


fantastic adventures

  the confidence is this i said
ive just learned that this laboratory
is the property of dr hunt

  emerson hunt the one who was
kidnapped from the earth

  i think so im almost sure it all
points that way-these advanced ex-
periments and all you know what a
reputation he had

  and hes here-alive

  yes im on his trail

 you mean-

  that thats my secret mission ive
ome here to find him confidentially
an association of scientists has backed
me in my plan to try to rescue him
you can realize how much it will mean
to the earth-to the whole solar system
-if he can be found and taken back
oh flora was gasping oh
what a miracle that would be it
would it would be a miracle for the
whole world 

  if not a miracle at least a blessing
of course she was rather too ex-
cited over the idea to know what she
was saying and i quieted her gently to
make sure our conversation wouldnt
be overheard by any of the guards
she was at once so enthusiastic that she
was ready to break her contract with
marsch simply to help me no won-
der you were always talking about some
big purpose how did you know he
would be here

  there was much that i couldnt tell
her as yet but the one fearful fact
had to be told at once

  flora listen to me carefully im
going to need all the help i can get but
were going to be working against this
whole weird world i can tell that
already-and you can too dont you
see that theyre thriving here in this
strange scientific fortress on the genius
of dr hunt nobody here is going to
let him get away if they can help it
worst of all im already doubting

whether hell want to get away

  but why if he has a sure chance
to get back to the earth why-

  because people change when they
come to this land dr hunt has prob-
ably changed too

  but if you talk to him-if you ex-
plain-

  i laughed rather mockingly at her
extreme innocence maybe you can
talk to him but not i

  why not

  do you forget that im still a
serpent not an ordinary serpent but
a serpent with four legs and a human
mind to a scientist with the advanced
ideas of dr hunt ill be something to
be analyzed and observed not listened
to

  oh

  eventually theyll dissect me and
see how im put together ive already
heard some of the consulting scientists
mention that dr hunt will be eager to
get my skeleton for his permanent col-
lection

  six guards marched in then and
our visit came to an end abruptly when
they announced that dr hunt was
waiting to see me flora stood back of
her chair watching speechless as they
wheeled me away in my cage

chapter viii

t have had the common sensation
of chills running down my spine
many times in normal life but i must
say that i never knew any feeling like
this before when ones spine is fully
forty feet long and a series of chills
chases through from head to tail im
telling you its wild zing-zing-zing
-before one chill gets well started
anothers on the way

  there was far more to this mountain
laboratory than i had guessed at first
sight i hadnt realized that z lab
secret of the serpent



could mean just that-the last unit in a
series named after the entire alphabet
but after we had moved past six or
eight units each bearing a different
letter i began to get a new appreciation
of the extent of this place

  i was on my way to h laboratory
this had possibly become dr hunts
favorite because it bore his initial

  h laboratory opened to me auto-
matically the grilled metal doorway
slid back into the wall and a second
door-a checkerboard of silver and
gold-parted in the middle and folded
backward in two wings

  no talking now the guards
warned me i had almost forgotten that
they were with me i was so intent upon
the details of all this laboratory gran-
deur

  no talking i repeated rather in-
solently

  and no undue crawling or twitch-
ing one of the guards added

  as if i had room to crawl in this
cage i replied

  quiet he snapped

  i cant even twitch i added the
serpent instinct was working on me i
was looking for ways to be annoying
can i breathe

  all right breathe but stop talking

  hisssss-hisssss

  quiet

  im just breathing i said can i
help it if ive got a cold

  the six guards stopped me in the
middle of the doorway and put their
heads together then i knew i had
gone too far the first thing i knew
theyd start exploding more yellow pow-
ders over my head and id lose what
little freedom id gained

  one of them stalked into a small
supply room which we had just passed
and returned a moment later bearing
something that resembled a long-nosed
oil can but must have been some sort

of high-powered hypodermic needle

  i was tempted to pull some fancy
whip act and lash the fellow with my
tail before he could give me the works
something told me to take it easy-
there might be worse things in store if
i didnt at least pretend to cooperate
they gave me the shot

  the needle caught me about twelve
feet from the tapered end of my body
one sharp ice-cold jab all of those
chills that had run down my long spine
a few minutes before came chasing up
again

  chills and dizziness and then-ah
what a sensation of peace i began to
feel tame agreeable downright
happy all at once i wanted to be the
nicest kindliest serpent that ever went
visiting in a laboratory

  that ought to do it one of the
guards said

  i turned touched the brow of my
scaled face with my fingers and tried
to smile

  thank you gentlemen i feel much
better what can i do to return the
favor

  hes okay the guards agreed and
proceeded to wheel me into labora-
tory h

  i was pleasantly treated to the beau-
ties and mysteries of the most impres-
sive laboratory equipment i had ever
seen the huge glass tubes standing in
clusters above the tables some of them
twenty-five or thirty feet tall were
illuminated by a battery of colored
lights lavender light green purple
deep violet their gleaming stems were
like frozen music in one corner of the
six-cornered room a bright orange blur
of motion indicated that a governor was
spinning silently over a pyramid of
shining machinery one couldnt hear
the churning of liquids in the scores of
transparent containers which were built
into the different levels of the mysteri-


fantastic adventures

ous pyramid but the orange blur cast
its light over the whole series with each
revolution again a riot of colors
hinted of a master-minds secrets in
blending the molecules of many ele-
ments who could know what new and
rare combinations might come into
existence through these experiments

ut of the dazzle i detected one
detail which struck me as some-
thing not to be forgotten that yellow-
ish-white powder at one side of the
mixing pyramid i discovered it sifting
down slowly like sand through an hour
glass was this not the same sulphur-
like substance that had been exploded
over my head and earlier dumped
over the pool where flora hessel was
hiding

  if so i thought here was the source
of these scientists seeming magic

  the nice kindly agreeable feeling
within me shuddered for just an instant
the serpent slyness was still there
under the surface if i could steal some
of that powder what might i do for
myself was this my way back to my
human state

  the doctor will be in right away
one of the white-uniformed men said
is out patient ready to be examined
wsth pleasure i said

  the white-uniformed man shot a
quick suspicious look at me

  its all right dr winston a guard
said we just gave him a shot of
sixty-eight-j-sixty-nine 

  dr winston nodded enough to
put him to sleep

  this wasnt so easily answered dr
winston checked the slip which the
guard showed him and calculated men-
tally the quantity of the drug as com-
pared with my probable blood content
they werent too sure of their answers
for they hadnt had any specimen like
me before

  well see dr winston said nod-
ding again then he dismissed them
and i was left alone with him and this
marvelous laboratory

  so they thought i would go to sleep
did they not if i could help it still
it was an idea

  i spoke drowsily nice place you
have here friend i opened my jaws
slowly and yawned and let my eyes go
half closed nice place-ho-humm
quiet    restful

  he was watching me out of one cor-
ner of his eye i seemed to be dropping
off into a peaceful slumber

  he went to the telephone

  dr hunt    the four-legged
serpent is ready    obstreperous
far from it the attendants gave him
a shot of sixty-eight-j-sixty-nine hes
sleeping

  i allowed my arms to fold on the floor
of my cage so that my head and neck
sank to the level of my belly it wasnt
a very proud posture-and i must ad-
mit it wasnt easy to allow myself to
slump into such a dejected-looking heap
of flesh-especially in the presence of a
fine kingly looking person like dr
winston he would have looked well
in any convention of athletes-broad-
shouldered well-shaped hands keen
grey eyes and a vigorous head of fine
brown hair he stood with excellent
posture with just enough swagger and
toss to his head that it made you think
his brain must weigh considerably more
than the average mans

  i wondered whether dr hunt could
present as perfect an appearance
about all i had remembered of hunts
picture was the striking black mustache
and the sharp-pointed short black
beard

  hisssssss-hisssssss-hissssss  

  my hissing breaths were barely au-
dible i was sure that i had convinced
dr winston now if dr hunt would
secret of the serpent



just fall for my gag i would have a
chance to know what these men of
knowledge meant to do with me

  dr winston turned at the sound of
a slight squeak-squeak-squeak from
what might be considered the rear door
of laboratory h it was the boss him-
self rolling in in his luxurious chair

  anyone would have known at a
glance that here was the top man now
that i saw him again his pictures came
back to me-that extremely potent
magnetic quality that strikes out at you
from some faces-he had it more than
any person i had ever seen

  there was something about him that
i couldnt quite clarify in my reptilian
brain i ignored the troubling thought
and tried hard to watch him

  he rolled to a position within ten
feet of my cage front and i drank him
in mentally through the half-slits of
my sleeping eyes

  he hadnt looked up at me yet i
thought the squeak of his chair an-
noyed me he reached for the tele-
phone that was a part of his rolling
equipment and barked an order to be
relayed to some service department

  his physical peculiarity had struck
me rather incidentally at first but now
i saw what it was he had jour arms

  he put down the phone at the same
time he mopped the perspiration off his
wide brow-at the same time he
touched a chair control that moved him
a little closer-at the same time his
fourth and final hand was reaching into
a pocket for another pair of eye-glasses

  the rolling chair had been so well
designed to accommodate his four-
armed body that one wasnt disturbed
by the slightly spidery effect-as long
as he was sitting

xhen he arose and began to walk
around me i was more sensitive
to his freakish profusion of appendages

it was all i could do to keep from open-
ing my eyes wide i was blinking in
spite of myself but he and dr winston
were busy sizing up my length

  well have to get some measure-
ments first thing said dr hunt id
like to start dissecting as soon as pos-
sible

  you mean within a few hours
winston asked it will take a few
hours to sharpen the knives

  you understand of course why
im relying upon an early dissection

  dr winston understood and the two
of them discussed it in just enough de-
tail that i caught the drift it was dr
hunts hope that they might be able to
produce more specimens like me he
believed that an early examination of
the tissues of my body would show
traces of the transformation from old
to new these would serve as guides
for repeating the experiment

  they talked quietly

  that drugging theyd given me was
making me sleepy all right but i held
on i wanted to know how soon they
intended to start making pork chops of
me-or should i say dragon chops

  the repair man came in just then
and they dropped their talk of me in
favor of dr hunts rolling chair

  just an oiling job the repair man
asked ill have it back in five min-
utes

  dr hunt pointed to the brown and
blue checkered upholstery demonstrat-
ing its worn places with his four hands
he said there should be a new uphol-
stery job some time soon

  the repair man rolled the chair out
the front entrance and the two doctors
returned to me

  his eyes flickered said dr win-
ston i believe hes awake

  they tell me he talks said dr
hunt lets have a few words out of
him


fantastic adventures

  winston turned to me say some-
thing

  hissssss i said

  come come you can do better
than that

  hisss hiss s why should i talk
if youre going to pick my bones clean
and turn me into a laboratory skele-
ton

 all four of dr hunts elbows
bumped backward and his sharp little
beard jumped to an impertinent angle

i thought you said that they gave
him a shot of sixty-eight-j-sixty-nine
they did said dr winston he
was highly agreeable a few minutes
ago

  im highly agreeable now i said
casually rising to a more comfortable
position and straightening my front
legs beneath my scaled shoulders if
you want to start cutting me up right
away ill help you sharpen the knives
oh you will you are being agree-
able arent you said dr hunt

  these front legs of mine are pretty
handy i went on ive a good pair
of hands on them as you can see so
ill help you dissect i can begin cut-
ting off cross-sections of my tail if you
like-

  the drugs gone to his head said
winston wed better give him some-
thing else

  dr hunt was eyeing me closely not
saying a word i knew that my cut-
ting remarks had disturbed him i
had gotten under his skin

  why dont you boys get smart i
said following up my advantage

 meaning what said winston

  meaning that youre limping along
with old-fashioned methods in this
broken-down lab i said it with all the
conviction i could muster and it was
driving home dr hunts twenty fin-
gers began to twitch uneasily i went
on digging this broken-down lab

might be good enough for space island
but it wouldnt be a good give-away
back on the earth unless you could find
some scientist who is a sucker for an-
tiques

  dr hunt reddened a trifle and his
two right hands stroked through his
ruffled black hair

  what equipment do they have on
the earth he asked bluntly that ex-
cels my best

  they have a multiple x-ray at-
tached to a plastic machine so that
they could turn out a perfect copy of
my skeleton in plastic without ever
touching a knife blade to my skin

  the two doctors exchanged glances

  the drug has gone to his head
winston repeated ill get something
stronger

chapter ix

tll never know whether their sixty-
eight-j-sixty-nine accounted for my
actions two minutes later when the
zeego guns began to flash all over the
place

  they say that some men will rise to
the greatest heights of bravery or con-
geniality or oratory under the influence
of certain beverages and afterward
theyll wonder whether the achievement
was their own or whether it came out
of the bottle thats how it was with
me two minutes later when the sur-
prise attack struck laboratory h

  it was those damned pygmies who-
ever they were and wherever they had
come from they were suddenly raiding
the place with zeego guns

  flash-flash-flash-flash    

  red fire blasted through the dark
corridor quick sharp lines of it-back
and forth and across three bars of it
cut through the double doors of lab h

  dr winston dropped and i thought
he had been hit
secret of the serpent



  dr hunt spun around obviously
looking for his rolling chair but it was
gone he strode swiftly across to the
nearest laboratory table and seized a
telephone before he could speak five
of those two-and-a-half foot demons
were racing in with their guns blazing

  one of them guarded the door two
of them marched to dr winston
crouched on the floor holding his arm
as if he had been wounded the other
two were running toward dr hunt

  they didnt appear to notice me
probably because i was just a specimen
in a cage lying there inert without
showing any signs of knowing what was
going on thats what they thought

  i swung my arm down through an
opening between bars and smacked my
hand against the floor my cage rest-
ing on rollers lunged forward another
touch of my hand sent me coasting into
the path of the two pygmies who were
going for dr hunt

  they were moving fast but so was i

  the red fire splashed over the glass
sides of my prison i caught a bit of
the spray in my back it struck with
the sharpness of a hundred needles
my coiled body snapped like a spring
and my shoulder crashed into the bars
i drew back saw the opening i had
made and plunged through

  look out the monster look
out one pygmy squealed

  monster huh i snarled back as if
that word had been just one insult too
many i didnt heed their gunfire
though it was needling through my
scaled protection i dived for the two
of them with both arms swinging i
must have struck with pretty fair force
one of them sailed clear across the
room and crashed into a stack of glass
tubes while his gun flipped into the air
like something out of a catapult the
second little fellow simply dropped his
weapon and went backing away hold-

ing his hands behind him to keep them
from being snapped off

  i pivoted from one arm then and
whirled my forty-foot length like a
whip that knocked down three of
them a bit of carelessness on my
part im afraid in the final flash of
my tail dr winston had just come to
his feet and i caught him too so
that everyone was on the floor except
dr hunt and the pygmy who had
stayed to guard the door i went for
the guard the pygmy at the door i
mean he went for the corridor

  the first part of the pygmy attack
ended then and there as far as i was
concerned for dr hunt had touched
a switch and the inner door of labora-
tory h closed

  clang that was the outer door

  so there were seven of us all locked
in securely-and for a moment it was
a toss-up as to who would be masters
and who would be prisoners four
pygmies-their brown little bodies
adorned with nothing but red loin
cloths two doctors-probably the
smartest on all of space island and
one serpent-a four-legged monstrosity
powerful enough to burst out of his
cage-and he was out

  i was out and it seemed to me that
i could have scooped all of the other
persons in that room into my clutches
then and there and made them submit
to my will-or choked them

  i say it seems to me that i could
have

  but it wouldnt have worked and
i should have known better than to
think that one could defeat a scientist
in his own laboratory

t did go so far as to gather up three
of the four attackers and start
toward dr hunt with them-and you
may wonder why when dr hunt was
planning to strip the flesh from my


fantastic adventures

bones that i should trouble myself
to play the hero in his defense but
you must remember that there was
still a certain plan and purpose bor-
ing through my mind i still had the
dim hope that i might somehow lift
dr hunt out of this weird world and
take him back to the earth

  a pretty fancy ambition for a four-
legged serpent you think all right
ill admit that i had hitched to a
pretty high star but i wasnt ready
to let go

  dr hunt must have flashed the lights
off i stopped in my tracks the place
was utterly dark-no not quite that
dark after all as soon as my eyes
adjusted i could see the single flood-
ing light-dim purple light that was
almost like a shower bath of luminous
purple dust it was coming down over
me lighting my long six-foot arms and
casting a baleful glow over the three
pygmies i held

  i had stopped in my tracks and
now i knew why i had stopped the
flood of purple light had stopped me

  i couldnt move i was paralyzed i
was frozen and that ugly pygmy over
whose waist i had clamped my left
hand was quite as frozen as i the
other two who i had caught by the
feet and who hung upside down from
my uplifted right arm never twitched
or flicked an eyebrow

  we were all frozen together by some
diabolical paralysis ray it was a trifle
embarrassing my serpents jaws were
open and my head was inclined toward
the object in my left hand even in
the dim purple light i knew that the
two doctors would be able to see
plainly enough what might have
happened

  i wont say that it would have hap-
pened i only say that the instant the
room was plunged in darkness i must
have made a motion as if i were going

to eat one of the pygmies-and that
was how the paralysis had caught me

  are you all right dr winston
dr hunt called out

  im here said dr winston that
was quick action on your part dr
hunt you escaped injury didnt
you

  were you knocked down dr win-
ston i saw you falling

  the beasts tail caught me have
you got the freeze on solid

  solid said dr hunt another
minute and we can put the lights on
wed better get a report on the rest
of the units meanwhile this attack
may be widespread ive been uneasy
for days

  the mashas havent a chance
against us dont worry said dr win-
ston as stoutly as he could this little
flare-up cant last they tried before
you know

  theyve been trying for a century
and a half said dr hunt ive stud-
ied the records of this planet and ive
found that troubles like these have re-
curred every ten or fifteen years

  dr hunt got through to his vari-
ous secretaries on the telephone he
talked fast at first until the reassur-
ances calmed him the attack had come
and gone like a quick thundershower
he hung up satisfied

  he turned on the lights and opened
the laboratory doors all the while re-
porting to dr winston

  theyve captured fifteen of the
troublemakers-none of them identi-
fied as our servants there hasnt been
any general uprising among our serv-
ants im glad to say that means that
our serums are still working

  then the only trouble came from
outsiders winston asked
apparently

if it had been our servants they
might have reason to make trouble but
secret of the serpent



i cant understand why those outside
mashas who have the whole country-
side to live in and who havent been in
any way enslaved should take it in
their heads to storm our fortress

  i dont understand it either dr
hunt admitted slowly he stroked his
sharp black beard thoughtfully i
wish we had some way of finding out
they sauntered back in my direc-
tion and then as if with a single
inspiration they stopped and stared at
me they gazed at the three scared
mashas in my grasp

  i wonder dr hunt said slowly

  i was thinking the same thing
said dr winston maybe we do have
a way of finding out-a decidedly in-
genious way

  dr hunt looked me over carefully
giving particular attention to my open
jaws the mashas were doubly frozen
-once from the ray and once from
fear

  id hate like sin to let one of the
finest specimens weve ever created get
away but id risk a lot to know the
mashas from the inside yes i think it
might be worth a try said dr hunt

chapter x

you never saw such tender care ex-
ercised upon a serpent they fed
me the most wonderful foods and gave
me the most comfortable bed i could
ask for they treated my wounds with
a dozen kinds of salves and oils they
bathed and massaged me and mani-
cured me they took me out for exer-
cise allowing me to run along at my
own pace hitched to a ten-ton truck

  it was wonderful while it lasted i
was their favorite pet dog you might
say and they considered it a privi-
lege to walk me

  the only trouble with the exercise
periods was that they always occurred

at night so that i didnt have much
chance to study the countryside that
was their precaution they didnt want
the outside pygmies-that is the
mashas-to know that they were
grooming me for a special purpose

  best of all they gave me access to
an indoor swimming pool where i could
thrash around and whip the water to
my tails content

  is everything perfectly satisfac-
tory the attendants would ask me
is the water the right temperature
you dont care for a towel do you
if so dont hesitate to put in your
request

  ah-er-i think of just one thing
i said recalling those first strange hours
down in the stream in the bottom of
the crevasse i have a weakness for
blossom-scented air could you ar-
range to have some flowers brought in
and placed beside the pool

  when flora hessel came to visit me
in my room and i described all of
these luxuries to her she was not as
surprised as i had expected

  its no more than you deserve she
said after all you saved the lives
of the two most important men in this
kingdom

  i did

  oh you neednt be so modest about
it everyone has heard by this time
that little band of mashas was all set
to take over this fortress from the in-
side if they had captured laboratory
h as they planned they could have
given orders from dr hunts phones
and that would have done it thered
have been a thousand mashas pouring
in from all directions before the trick
was known

  i studied over that set-up shaking
by head slowly

  now im not trying to argue for the
sake of argument i said and if these
rumors are making the rounds i sup-


fantastic adventures

pose there must be some basis for them
but tell me this how could any pygmy
-or masha i mean-imitate dr hunt
over the phone

  people do imitate people you
know

  but a pygmy imitating dr hunt-
that would be like a mouse imitating a
lion have you heard dr hunts big
solid voice its deep its throaty its
full of chesty thunder have you heard
any of these pygmy servants speak
   all right

  flora came back to her original
point that anyway i had saved a couple
of lives-important ones too so i
swelled up my snakely chest with pride
she didnt notice she was looking out
the window at the green ridge of moun-
tains thinking her private thoughts
and i guessed that my argument about
the voices had disturbed her

  you know she said presently i
think youve got an angle maybe those
pygmies werent going to use a pygmy
to imitate dr hunt maybe they
were going to use someone here at the
fortress-one of the guards-one of the
doctors-one of dr hunts secre-
taries

  m-m-m i didnt say it with much
conviction nevertheless it was a tan-
talizing thought

  maybe this winston you told me
about was all set to step into dr hunts
shoes using the little people as his
army flora went on now looking far-
ther away than ever

  no no it couldnt be that refus-
ing to give it a thought i changed the
subject its like dr hunt says all
you have to do is consult the record to
see that the mashas have been bursting
out with an attack every ten or fifteen
years

  it was natural enough for them to try
to regain their lost power we agreed
the mashas were the original outcasts

from mars their original name mar-
tians had degenerated into the word
mashas their physical characteristics
had been warped and changed from the
original man-like stature to the small
wiry shrunken bodies they now pos-
sessed that was what their first forty
or fifty years away from the earth had
done for them mars had marshed
them as the phrase had originally given
it or later it was said to have
mashed them

phe later generations of martian
settlers had first called them ac-
cordingly not martians but mashas
and it was the new settlers who had
more or less brutally exiled them

  here they were still alive and still
rankling from the mistreatment a hun-
dred and fifty years later

  one cant help feeling sorry over
their plight flora said philosoph-
ically its all a trick of fate

  its been done and it cant be un-
done i said for all we know they
may live on another couple centuries
-or hell they may make trouble for
a thousand years who knows this
freakish planet might refuse to let them
die

  well they can die you know said
flora giving me a quick eye youve
already accounted for a few of them
i nodded a bit shamefaced then i
told her what had happened at the
end of my rescue when the attack
had been made on laboratory h i
described in all its gory details the
statue of the three pygmies caught
under my open jaws when the purple
paralysis ray shot down on us from
the ceiling and froze us in action

  that little party proved two things
to the doctors as plain as day i said
one my tough scales can withstand
a certain amount of zeego fire two my
secret of the serpent



tough stomach is good for at least a
limited quantity of pygmy steak

  i could have told them that said
flora

  well there you have it thats the
reason theyre treating me to all these
luxuries

  you mean it isnt because youre a
hero

  heroes get banquets and medals
and speeches thats because their
work is already done but these boys
are grooming me for a new job-a big
job thats never been done before
theyre virtually bribing me to do it
well i told her about it

  h-m-m-m flora hessel was more
than a little disturbed just where does
this get you in relation to your own
purpose when you get through ex-
ploring the inside of the masha world
as a favor to dr hunt is he going to
pack up and go back to the earth as
a favor to you

  i couldnt answer that in the affirm-
ative and be truthful and in floras
presence i didnt feel like being a
snake so i didnt answer

  she walked to the door and just be-
fore she walked away she gave her
own answer

 the first chance you get she said
take a walk down the spiral passage
beyond laboratory x and youll
come to the museum of dr hunts skel-
etons youll find your answer there
she seemed to be saying walk into
the trap you stupid fool though she
hadnt actually said so

  but there was one thing she had
said that deserved a little more explana-
tion and i called to her sharply

  just a minute there high-and-
mighty i said how did you hap-
pen to find your way down into the
museum of skeletons i thought you
were a prisoner here or are you a

first-class tourist or are you asking
for a job feeding the skeletons

  she tossed her dark hair over her
shoulders and flashed her dark eyes at
me i guess it wouldnt make any
difference to you if i did tell you

  ive got tough scales i think i can
take it said

  all right you asked for it i went
down there because i had a date with a
charming wolf in sheeps clothing

chapter xi

t must have been pretty desperate
to take the chance i took the very
next night i was desperate i was
boiling with an inner rage that was born
not of fear but of jealousy

  take me that way i said to the
attendant who was examining the hitch
at the end of the truck take me back
into the mountain trail that curves
over the buildings

  the attendant shrugged as if it made
no difference to him so long as i got
my exercise he went up front and
crawled in beside the driver neither
he nor the driver guessed what was
in my mind they were finding me a
cooperative pet who could be led to
water and that was all they cared

  i couldnt help wondering whether
a pygmy driver would have been as
unconcerned but the authorities had
their eye on that item too they knew
that there might be a leak of informa-
tion from this mountainside colony to
the outside mashas and if so that leak
was probably one of the trusted little
masha slaves who in spite of the doc-
tors regular doses of serum contained
enough spark to know what was going
on

  the pygmy servants were all being
watched these days for this reason if
someone on the inside should be found
guilty of helping with the recent at-


fantastic adventures

tack he would no doubt be treated to
something pretty severe more serum
perhaps well you never knew these
scientists were playing a bold game and
they would just as soon try grafting
an elephants head on a two-and-a-
half-foot masha if they thought it
would work

  there were a great many things
along that line that continually dis-
turbed my thoughts and stole my sleep
and i couldnt help wishing that i could
get dr hunt under some special secret-
revealing ray long enough to make
him expose a few facts

  but this much was beginning to take
root in my mind the mashas were
tougher than the newcomers to this
region their training period in mars
a century and a half ago had stiffened
their resistance to the capricious forces
of this planet which turned all manner
of men into all manner of freaks the
mashas had apparently already been
cooked to a turn so to speak exactly to
old mother natures taste and so they
lived on almost unchanging from year
to year

  and still the serums were able to
effect temporary differences in their
week-to-week behavior as long as
they were well doped they made ex-
cellent slaves-dull obedient dependa-
ble and as a rule non-vicious

  but on the other hand the men of
the earth and other solar planets where
earths space ships had established new
branches of earths peoples-these per-
sons who had come more recently to
space island-were arriving in many
cases transformed

  why by what agencies well let
these brilliant scientists from dr
hunts great laboratories answer such
questions if they were able for my
part i stood as a living proof that such
things did happen i had seen the re-
transformation take place completely in

the case of flora hessel-partially in
my own case and there were other
evidences 

  what of dr hunts arms i won-
dered

  had this been a trick of accidental
transformation or controlled trans-
formation

  this i knew he wanted those four
arms he had use for all of them and
they did much to increase his efficiency
if he had wanted a completely normal
body wouldnt he have applied the
yellow powders or would that have
been taking too great a risk

  what would have happened to him
if the zeego guns had struck those
arms would the very shock have
acted for a quick change in natures
delicate arrangement of his parts

  it was no wonder that i the serpent
victim of all this ungodly freak factory
was losing sleep trying to understand
there must be some underlying prin-
ciples i thought the very essence of
science dwells in principles or laws or
some sort of generalizations that can
be relied upon things happen because
a given set of forces always makes such
things happen

  and yet here i was the only human
serpent-the only four-legged serpent
with human hands and a human brain 

  in all of space island there was not
another like me they believed

jgut there were men-ever so many
normal men-like dr winston and
the attendants and guards and there
were a few women at least had all
of them come through some violent
transformation the same as flora hes-
sel

  ah there was a girl and as i now
ran along beside the truck that was
taking me out for exercise this was at
once the most hopeful and the most
disturbing thought of all floral
secret of the serpent



  who was i a serpent to try to bring
scientific order out of this weird world
of confusion all i really knew in the
final analysis were the obvious things
i knew flora-yes

  i knew that there wasnt another
person on this planet who was so much
a friend to me as flora hessel of all
the brilliant persons who had observed
me and questioned me and cared for
me she was the only one who had said
you must get out of this form you
must get yourself back to your normal
state

  and then i came back to the feverish
jealous thoughts that had caused me to
ask the attendant to take me over this
particular trail

  jealousy or was it something less
definite suspicion-that was it

  flora had had a date with a charming
wolf in sheeps clothing she had said

  that could mean only one thing i
thought ernest marsch he was still
alive he was somewhere in the imme-
diate vicinity and he had seen flora

  i didnt like it i remembered what
she had said about relying upon my
protection during our space hop other-
wise she had said she might have re-
sorted to the use of her pistol

  did she have a pistol now

  how had he found her where had
they met why had she agreed to go
with him through the spiral tunnel
beyond laboratory x to explore a mu-
seum full of bones

  before this nights exercise was over
i meant to find some of the answers for
myself i had only the vaguest idea i
must admit as to how much exercise
would be required before i got to the
bottom of things

  the truck had swung around the
wide plaza and taken a cloverleaf turn
to ascend the mountain road we were
moving at approximately ten miles an
hour i guessed

  i was using my legs to much greater
advantage than ever before you know
how it is with a child who has spent
several months crawling and suddenly
discovers it can walk i was not only
walking i was running

  the rope which they had fastened
to the harness around my neck and
shoulders was long enough that i could
run up alongside the cab to check on
my speed

  how fast i asked

  the attendant and the driver both
gave a nervous lurch whenever they
discovered me moving along beside
their window

  eight miles an hour said the at-
tendant take it easy youre not
supposed to overwork

  i feel like going faster i said i
stepped up my speed and would have
run along in front of them if they hadnt
stepped on the accelerator

  i dont think they liked the sight of
me moving along in their lights after
all i must have looked to them like the
worlds biggest snakiest lizard gallop-
ing along on a leash

  they moved past me and i caught
up again

  step on it i said i feel the need
of exercise

  they doubled their pace and i
stayed with them

  in a moment the attendant called out
to me were up to thirty-two miles an
hour thats fast enough theyll
give me hell if i let you run your legs
off

  its a perfectly comfortable speed
i said but im in the mood to race

  oh so thats it the attendant
growled something to the driver they
figured theyd take it out of me in
another five minutes

t kept an eye on the trail as we ac-
celerated again i was kicking up


fantastic adventures

my share of dust now at forty-five
miles an hour and every now and then
my tail would whip down against the
road and that you may believe was
unintentional it was a beginners
awkwardness you might say no snake
spanks himself on purpose

  i was watching the trail and here
came the curving mile i had been wait-
ing for it was a good piece of road
except that it was so full of twists and
turns you might think it would put a
permanent wave in a serpents back-
bone just below the edge of the road
the ledge dropped straight down about
sixty feet-to the roofs of the fortress

  in other words we had gained enough
elevation to switch back over the lab-
oratories

  i bounded up beside the cab and
shouted faster

  the driver moved the speedometer
up to sixty-five miles an hour hows
that he yelled

  just right i said falling back
gradually hold it right there for ten
minutes

  can you take it

   if i cant ill shout

  then i fell back gradually the
driver and the attendant kept their
spotlight on the curves ahead and let
me shift for myself that was just
what i wanted

  snap ever since we had started i
had been biting at the rope that was
fastened to my harness with one sav-
age bite i finished the job i was free

  the truck whirled on around the
bend dragging the rope behind it

  i bounded down over the embank-
ment clinging tight with all of my
crawling muscles

  four or five minutes later when the
sounds of the trucks brakes reached
my ears i was already slithering over
the glass and metal roofs of the labora-
tories i was in the mood to be free

for a change and it would take more
than six moons and a trucks spotlight
to find me among these roofs

chapter xii

t rested for a full hour lying in a
perfect hiding place a few feet from
a chimney and a ventilator i could
imagine what the driver and the at-
tendant were saying as they played
their spotlight over the rocks up and
down the mountainside and out across
the roofs looking for me they had
better practice their story well before
they went back empty handed i
thought if they were going to make it
stick

  i could just hear them trying to pass
the buck i told the driver we
shouldnt race him faster than fifteen
miles an hour or- how the hell
did i know im just the driver and if
the damned snake wanted exercise it
made no difference to me as long as
the attendant didnt kick

  but the alibis wouldnt be enough i
was sure not unless someone could
produce the serpent the crusty old
captain of the guards would be pretty
sure to get the job of running me down
and i knew that he would be the guy
who could make a thorough job of it
so i had better make hay before they
got the squads on my trail

  as soon as those flashes of light
ceased to glide over the roofs i took a
long chance and crawled quietly to the
nearest dimly lighted section of glass
roof

  a greenhouse i said to myself
now where would the laboratories be
from here

  i lumbered along at a good pace over
the metal surfaces they were still
warm from the days sun and their
rust and grime and rock dust didnt
make for comfortable crawling over
secret of the serpent



the glass roofs i took extra care for
once i struck a loose pane and it fell
through with a crash another light
came on down in that section of green-
house and a pygmy gardener came in
with a sprinkler in his hand looking
around to see what was the matter

  i tried to hold my breath when i
let go with a quiet hssssh he looked
up and saw my head through the aper-
ture he screeched bloody murder and
rolled over his sprinkler in a faint i
didnt wait to see how soon he revived
but skimmed along to a safer realm

  at least i hoped it would be a safer
realm but the direction i chose failed
to offer the solitude i needed

  eight pygmies on the roof now
what were they doing there

  the most obvious answer was they
were playing with fire i crawled up
toward them silently and looked in on
their party

  down in a four-foot depression where
the irregular roofs had been joined with
a patchwork of corrugated metal they
had lighted a few torches and were heat-
ing a branding iron

  put your initials on him while youre
at it one of them said adding a low
cackling laugh

  dont let him squeal and spoil the
fun came another masha cackle

  one of the dark little creatures
waved a restraining hand across the
firelight before we touch the iron he
might like to have one more chance
how about it kipper

  it was seven against one i crept a
little closer to study the evil faces by
the light of the torches eight little
mashas seven of them wore only the
red loin cloths the costume of the out-
sider

  the eighth wore in addition to the
red loin cloth a green neckband which
was the band of the servant and an
armband which denoted his particular

rank and function he was tied and
gagged and as completely helpless as
a mouse dying in a trap

  the leader of the seven outsiders
swung the red-hot iron in a circle
anything to say kipper wouldnt
you like to play on our side for a
change

  wug that was all he could say
choked by a cloth gag

  touch him up with the heat and
hell whistle out of his ears here give
me the iron-

t ut the leader kept the party in his
own hands he recited a little
speech which gave me the lowdown i
needed to understand the situation he
said that if kipper had been so com-
pletely drugged by the scientists se-
rums that he couldnt do anything but
stupidly obey orders it would be dif-
ferent

  but weve put you to the test kip-
per and weve found out that youre
not one of their victims youre play-
ing their servant all right but youre
also playing some game of your own
now were giving you your chance to
come back to us

  kippers eyes were stubborn slits
and his wrinkled brown cheeks were
as hard as steel and there was a de-
fiance in his little jaws that his seven
torturers werent going to break down

  all right kipper

  the leader ran the point of the red-
hot iron across his chest to burn a thin
dark line kippers elbows dug tight
at his sides

  the leader withdrew the iron so that
for the moment its light showed the
gleam of cruelty in his own round eyes
his large mouth sagged with a brutal
expression you could almost hear the
clank of chains in his thin taunting
voice this was jallan one of the plot-
ters who had engineered the recent at-


fantastic adventures

tack on the fortress

  now kipper jallan snatched the
gag out of his mouth we give you your
last chance are you willing to play
our game and help us into control
are you willing or are you going to
go on another hundred years being a
lone wolf

  i was a lone wolf on mars said
kipper coldly ive never asked a
damned thing of any of you except that
you let me go my own way

  jallan gave a flourish with the iron
he touched the point of it to the torches
that burned together in a single red
flame

  put the gag in his mouth padder-
man or should we let his scream make
music for the whole valley of mashas
thats it gag him well now ill give
him something hell carry with him for
a thousand years

  brand him with an lw-for lone
wolf  said padderman marking the
letters in the air with his gnarled fin-
ger

  ill brand a hole right through his
guts here goes

  hisssssss i breathed audibly
then forcibly hisssssssss

  the second blast from my serpent
lips upset the party and blew the fire
out

  serpent someone cried they all
saw me looming there above them
and that did it talk about bats out
of hell you never heard such a beat-
ing of feet over a tin roof clatter-
clatter-spill-clang clatter-clatter -
over and away and off into the distant
sounds of the night

  when the sounds of their disorgan-
ized retreat had died away there was
still the low hissing of my breath and
the sizzle of my spit on the red-hot
branding iron and there was still the
muffled choking gasping and coughing
of kipper as i drew the gag out of his

mouth and unfastened the cords that
bound him

  dont be afraid of me i said as
gently as any serpent could be expected
to speak under the circumstances i
had a square meal earlier in the eve-
ning ill not be dangerous

chapter xiii

tt was a strange friendship that
grew out of that meeting if i ever
met a bold and hardy spirit kipper
was it the old term lone wolf had
never meant much to me before but
here believe me was a man who filled
the bill

  a man did i say

  for the first time i was thinking of
a pygmy not in terms of the calories
he would offer for my hungry stomach
but in terms of the staunch stubborn
indomitable human will that character-
izes a man

  here was a two-and-a-half-foot hu-
man creature who had cut his own pat-
tern of life for more than two centu-
ries the rigors of severe martian win-
ters and the magic of that baffling cli-
mate had taken a toll he no longer
possessed the proud five-foot-ten stat-
ure that had been his earthly posses-
sion but shrunken and dwarfed and
wrinkled and ancient he was still a man
who possessed his own will

  before that night was an hour older
he was telling me as confidentially as
a brother how he came and went
through the halls of dr hunts scien-
tific fortress

  a servant yes im a servant im
a servant because i want to be not
because the serums force me to be

  but they do give you the serums
i asked

  as regularly as the setting of the
sun but i resist the effects dont
ask me how thats just me i resist
secret of the serpent



the effects of medicine the same as i
resist the influences of my enemies
sometimes i pay a price

  he touched the burn across his chest
the squadron from the captains
headquarters was at work by this time
moving along the mountain trail above
the buildings roofs playing their
searchlights in all directions the
scampering mashas were probably get-
ting a second scare unless they had a
very safe hiding place near the fortress

  well be safer down in the laborato-
ries kipper said or do you dare
go down theres an open skylight
over this way its my regular night
exit when i need a breath of air-and
incidentally its a favorite entrance for
the mashas who have designs on this
realm

  lead the way kipper i said
kipper led the way and i followed
for kipper it was a well-worn trail
for me it was full of hazards-openings
that were too small and glass walls that
were too fragile however twenty
minutes of twisting and turning and
feeling our way through dark passages
brought us into a deep basement de-
scent dimly illuminated with blue wall-
lights

  this said kipper spirals down
to the museum of skeletons if youre
not in a hurry-

  just a minute i said i didnt
want this to lead to anything embar-
rassing and i wasnt too sure of my
grounds it was a fact that i had orig-
inally wanted to find my way to this
very spiral descent thats where i
had set out for in taking my exercise
tour over the roofs lab x had been
my goal with its spiral passage beyond
and eventually the museum however
-i hope youll pardon me if i meet
a friend down here

  thats my expectation said kip-
per i mean im intending to meet

a friend

  huh i was growing more un-
easy my errand of jealousy wouldnt
thrive on too much congestion id
better explain myself i have a friend
-flora hessel-and an enemy ernest
marsch the less they see of each
other the better it suits me but she
told me very bluntly that she had had
a date with him here recently do you
follow

  go on said kipper

  i like the gal i said even
though im now living a snakely exist-
ence i hate to see her get mixed up
with a hard-boiled wolf like marsch
he isnt good for her believe me do
you follow

  youre jealous said kipper

  im a green-eyed serpent thats
why ive come if i find that hes
lurking down in this lost region im
going to have the pleasure of snapping
his head off before i report back to
headquarters

tzipper had stopped looking at me
with a curious expression he
cupped his ear and i thought i heard
too footsteps that could be flora
hessel coming down our way i won-
dered if i had said too much he was
beginning to smile at me strangely

  i hope im not in danger he said
  why should you be

  didnt you say she had a date with
a wolf

  yes but-

  all right i have a date with flora
hessel said kipper i must be the
wolf she referred to

  i blinked had i misjudged this
keen-eyed straight-shooting little fel-
low you-a wolf

  didnt you hear them call me a
lone wolf they were going to brand
me lw

  oh-lone wolf - thats different


fantastic adventures

did she mean you

  by that time the footsteps had ma-
terialized into flora herself she gave
a surprised gasp to see the two of us
together

  oh you know each other flora
exclaimed with a lift of delight in her
voice fine im so glad isnt he
charming bob i told you he was a
charming wolf in sheeps clothing
didnt i

  kipper cleared his throat lone
wolf if you please you mixed your
terms madam and i think youd bet-
ter apologize before your misshapen
friend gets the wrong impression
oh im sorry lone wolf of
course anyway bob hes perfectly de-
lightful and hes given me more infor-
mation about the goings-on of this place
than id get from the attendants in a
hundred years all these skeletons
down here-

  she talked on as glibly as a chatter-
ing magpie while she and kipper led
me into the opening chamber of the
museum of white bones all of my
jealous emotions were suddenly as dead
as the specimen we were examining
if i failed to catch all the interesting
facts they were giving me as they
guided me through the place it was
because i was saying to myself what
a silly serpent you were bob garrison
to get all green-eyed about nothing at
all it was all your foolish imagina-
tion

  and yet i couldnt be too severe with
myself considering how things had
turned out if i hadnt started out to
get the lowdown i wouldnt have saved
kipper from an ugly ordeal

  as it was i had two staunch friends
both of them wise and understanding
they were ready to help me through
with my purpose of recovering dr
hunt from their weird world if it was
humanly possible

  or if it wasnt humanly possible per-
haps some inhuman talents from a ser-
pent would be effective at any rate i
thought i was on the trail

  but flora i protested im still
in the dark about ernest marsch
hasnt he popped up anywhere along
the line to claim your services

  she shook her pretty head i havent
seen him since we came into the plan-
ets explosion zone she said

  kipper had stopped to listen at one
of the museum phones

  a bit of trouble back in the labora-
tories he said theyre all stirred
up over their missing serpent

  do you think we should go back
and report i asked

  that would be safest said kipper
otherwise they may punish the driver
and the attendant severely for losing
you furthermore they may send out
a general announcement to shoot you
on sight

  well go back i said i took a
quick look at the weird conglomeration
of skeletal forms all around me gleam-
ing white and chalky in the blue light
there was one pedestal that had been
placed recently with no skeleton on it
flora gave me a suspicious look and
we both guessed that it was being pre-
pared for me we hurried away with-
out speaking of it but i was filling up
with unanswered questions and one of
these times id have to get kipper in a
corner and pump him

  worried kipper asked blithely as
we made our exit

  its nothing i said just a slight
ache through my vertebrae

chapter xiv

xith kippers help flora re-
turned to the elevation of general
living quarters unnoticed he assisted
me in slipping into a corridor that
secret of the serpent



would lead to lab h-dr hunts own
stamping ground-from which i would
be able to face my own situation with
all possible advantages

  you dont jump through walls and
they know it kipper advised me be-
fore he left so youd better get some
answers ready for them but dont tell
them too much remember youre a
snake

  hissss i said agreeably

  kipper gave me a satisfied wink and
went on his way

  i knew how to put a stop to all of
the quandary over my disappearance
the easiest way i thought i would go
to the phone from which dr hunt had
made his general announcements and
i would simply say hissss when do
i get my ssssupper

  i was crossing through the six-cor-
nered room moving carefully for it
was almost completely dark and i
didnt want to welcome myself back
with a crash of any expensive glass
tubes i had got as far as dr hunts
rolling chair in the middle of the room
when i heard the sounds of low voices
from somewhere in the vicinity of the
nearest laboratory table as a serpent
whose flesh and bones were of great in-
terest to these scientists i had every
reason to be interested in low whispery
voices

  one of the voices was that of dr
winston

  how much do you think the serpent
knows winston said quietly

  i could see winstons tall courtly
figure silhouetted against the faint cir-
cle of light emanating from one of the
instruments

  the voice which answered winston
was not familiar but i knew at once
that it was not dr hunts it had a
deep-cistern quality-a hollow echo
like a voice coming through a long dark
tunnel and yet it was distinct with

sharp crackling edges to the consonant
sounds like little crackles of thunder
very close to your ear

  he knows said the deep-cistern
voice that dr hunt was forced to
come here

  then he must know said dr
winston that there is a power which
holds dr hunt in control

  he has not seen me said the deep-
cistern

  i thought winston said that you
had succeeded in influencing hunt to
have him killed at once-for his skele-
ton

  that was my intention the voice
rumbled but dr hunts own plan
rose up in his mind just when i thought
i had succeeded dr hunt has never
yet been completely subordinated   

  i was getting an earful all right i
tried to catch sight of the form that
gave out with the deep-cistern tones
but i couldnt see anyone except dr
winston i was taking an awful risk
being here this way and i was getting
nervous my tail kept twitching

  what if they should turn on a light

  what a dilemma somewhere they
were stewing about losing me the
driver and the attendant were probably
getting a verbal roasting for their care-
lessness i should go to dr hunt at
once to prove that i had come back un-
harmed

  but i couldnt-i just couldnt walk
out on an eaves-dropping set-up like
this here in one quick earful id
learned more about dr hunt and dr
winston than in all of my talks with the
scientists back on earth they had be-
lieved that if i could once find dr hunt
and provide a way for him to return
that hed jump at the chance

ow i saw as plain as day that
someone held such a club over him
that he couldnt be sure which of his


fantastic adventures

thoughts were his own it was that
power-the deep-cistern voice-which
had made hunt plan to strip me into a
skeleton it was hunts own mercy
that had schemed to postpone my dis-
section

  and what of winston winston-
my fine handsome hero with the suave
manner and the kingly appearance

  was winston also in league with this
superior agent were the two of them
keeping dr hunt in subjection

  making a turnip out of him i
muttered to myself squeezing the
blood of genius out of him for their
own stew

  yes dr hunt had delayed my dis-
section out of his own inspiration to
send me on a mission-to let me con-
front those skulking outcasts of space
who called themselves the mashas to
see whether i could learn from the in-
side what dangerous powers they pos-
sessed

  but hadnt dr winston also had the
same idea

  as i looked back upon their moment
of inspiration it seemd to me that both
doctors had caught the idea simultane-
ously it had happened under the pur-
ple light when i had stood frozen with
three pygmies beneath my open jaws i
wondered-

  swish-swish-swish - that was dr
winston now sauntering toward an-
other table in another moment he
would switch on a light

  i didnt dare creep any farther across
the room i might bump into the deep-
voiced power

  should i hide or should i face
them

  after what i had just heard they
might kill me

  the wheeled-chair it was right at
hand i crawled silently around it into
it around its back and into the under-
side of it

  no squeaks thank goodness the re-
pair man had oiled it recently i won-
dered if he had put new upholstery on
it too my scales had gathered dust
and rust from the roof would i leave
marks

  i did a tall job of coiling myself and
quite a length of tail was left over this
however i automatically coiled into a
disc of flesh wound like a clock-spring
and allowed that end of me to fold over
into the seat

  the lights went on along one wall

  i thought i caught a glimpse of the
deep-cistern voice for just an instant at
the edge of the green glow but i was
uncertain from the corner of my eye
it seemed that i was seeing a huge
model of a human skull almost as large
as a barrel it was moving back out of
my range of vision and i didnt dare
look it must have been a piece of ap-
paratus i thought or was it a mask

  the deep-cistern voice came from
that direction and now i thought of it
as a voice resounding through a large
empty skull

  i should go the voice said dr
hunt shouldnt find us here together

  hell be in soon said winston
hes holding court for the two men
who let the serpent get away as soon
as he calls ill roll his chair in for him

  the deep voice chuckled very fond
of that throne isnt he why dont you
take that honor away from him

  shuddered and the chills tried
to slide through the crooked route
from my neck to my tail

  youre tempting me said dr win-
ston i could see him standing a few
feet in front of the chair stroking his
square jaws with his white sensitive
fingers

  you might allow yourself four arms
too you know said the deep-voiced
power then youd fit into the rolling
secret of the serpent



throne quite as gracefully as he does
i can fill it winston said not sure
but what he was being taunted he was
looking at me without seeing me but
the color effect of my green and purple
scales made an impression well look
at this

  what

  new upholstery job hunts been
asking for it but i hadnt noticed-
the phone on the chair gave two
sharp rings

  thats hunt calling for me win-
ston said id just as well ride in
hell never know

  he crawled into the seat and leaned
back against the flattened coils of my
flesh

  i could imagine that the deep-voiced
power must have seen me by then but
i was wrong he spoke well how does
it feel quite important eh youd
like it winston think it over

  the phone rang again-two angry
rings

  dr winston touched the controls
the rolling chair gave a little lurch
then stopped short i must have been
weighing down on the brakes i tried
to shift just a trifle

  two more rings

  why dont you go the voice called
from the far side of the room hell

be suspicious

  im trying-

  well anyway im going think
over what i told you

  the swish-swish-swish gave me the
picture of large soft-surfaced feet be-
neath that barrel-sized skull-though i
must say it wasnt a very complete pic-
ture in my mind all i knew was that
the mysterious man-or creature-who
directed the goings-on of these labora-
tories with a sinister hand was making
a quiet exit i leaned trying to catch
one more glimpse my effort was too
much for the balance of the chair i

saw the disappearing shadow of a huge
skull with light from an outer room
gleaming through a translucent eye
then the rear door closed

  the chair was tipping backwards i
touched my hand to the floor just in
time to avoid a spill

  oooof

  dr winston jerked forward then
he sat back testing the seat he
bounced a little and was about to get
out to see what was wrong but the coils
of my tail which he had taken for new
green - and - purple upholstery moved
just a trifle-just enough to catch a
light grip on his waist

  he pushed the upholstery back
and brushed his hands muttering
sticky

  then dr hunt came striding in
looking tough enough to eat glass

  whats the matter why didnt you
come dr hunt stopped short giv-
ing winston the cold eye whats
this have you traded places with me

  somethings wrong said winston
weakly i couldnt get it to go

  get out of there ill show you
how

  im stuck in the new upholstery
said winston

 new upholstery what new-
ughl

  the doctors eyes jumped in a way
that caused winston to turn pale or
perhaps it was the fact that i had con-
sidered it time to uncurl myself having
no desire to usurp dr hunts pet
throne

  once i started i uncurled rapidly
but the curve of my tail slid into a loop
around dr winstons waist and i
drew him right over the back of the
chair when my action began he gave
a gulping sound and started to mutter
some sort of prayer under his breath
but a moment later he was saying noth-
ing for he saw me and fainted dead


fantastic adventures

away

  i dropped him on the floor and
turned to drink in dr hunts frozen
stare i glanced upward for a moment
thinking that the paralysis ray must be
on no it was simply dr hunt trying
hard to believe his own eyes

chapter xv

t gave a bow and a hiss and tried to
ease a very tense situation by laugh-
ing lightly

well what next dr hunt gasped
did they tell you i was missing i
said i came back i came into lab-
oratory h to report but there was some
kind of conference going on

  yes

  so i thought id wait by your chair
and tell you when you came in you
should know what they were saying
dr hunt mopped his forehead and
checked up on his sharp mustaches and
beard as if he thought they might be
missing then he gathered his faculties
together and began to talk heedless of
what i was about to tell him

  ive been getting you ready for a
job he said the glint in his eye told
me that he considered it important for
me to prepare quickly and indulge in no
foolishness he gave me a motion to
stand to one side i waited by the wall
while he gave winston a few slaps with
all four of his hands to bring the man
to life winston came up nodding and
blinking and sat while dr hunt gave
me his orders

  youve come back to this lab after
you were away and free-am i right
right i said

  then youll come back again he
said and im going to depend on it i
have faith that youre a straight ser-
pent see

  i didnt deter him with any hints that
i might or i might not be depending

upon his plans for turning me into a
museum-piece i knew now that if left
to his own devises dr hunt would
postpone that unpleasantness for me as
long as possible

  im going to send you on your as-
signment at once dr hunt said
come this way and ill show you the
map of the territory once more

  i looked at dr hunt and saw that
he meant business so he wasnt going
to make me account for my runaway
act instead he was going to press me
into service before i embarked on any
more monkeyshines

  i might have complied without any
hesitation and considered it an honor
-if i hadnt caught a sidelong glance
from winston sitting there watching
me with a cold eye the fellow was
still badly chilled i knew he kept
rubbing his sides where my scales had
clutched him but the real part of his
scare was because i knew too much

  this way dr hunt repeated mo-
tioning to me with three or four arms

  i stamped about folded my lower
legs under me and rose high on my
forelegs craning my neck and head up-
ward as if i meant to be heard i
caught a glimpse of myself reflected in
some of the glass utensils and my very
pose helped to inspire me for what i
needed to say

  it it high time dr hunt that you
and i cleared some atmosphere be-
tween us i said

  the doctors beard gave an impatient
twitch but he stopped cold and took
me in

  i came here from the earth for a
purpose i said i came in the guise
of a pilot for ernest marsch who is
planning some commercial enterprise
from this planet but my real reason
for coming was to get you

  dr hunt placed his fists on his hips
why should you want to get me
secret of the serpent



  because youre too useful a scientist
to desert the earth i want to take you
back your own planet and your own
solar system need you

  im doing very well here thank
you said hunt i saw him cast a
quick look at winston before he added
after all im running the best re-
search laboratory you ever saw you
havent convinced me that theres any-
thing more advanced on the earth
granted i said but maybe i
can convince you that you arent run-
ning this place you should have heard
what i just heard dr winston and
that deep-voiced fellow have just been
gloating over the way theyre duping
you dr hunt

aty words struck hard i thought
the doctors mustaches were go-
ing to spike his eyebrows all four of
his hands came up in defense i went
on

  theyre planning to turn me into a
laboratory skeleton and they forced
that plan into your mind somehowi
said you were all ready to go
through with it too youve even set
up a pedestal for my bones to rest on
but your own good scientific judgment
got the better of you and made you
wait you know that im more valu-
able alive than dead if you can ob-
serve me and watch me function and
prove my usefulness-

  the doctor was moving toward me
slowly with a wonderful light of curi-
osity in his fine face

  who did you say is duping me he
asked slowly

  dr winston and some fellow with
a voice like a deep cistern

  winston sprang to his feet dont
believe a word of it that snake is just
hissing to hear his own breath

is he dr hunt scowled deeply
ill keep right on hissing i said

ill tell you both what i overheard
while i was hiding around that chair
the deep-voiced fellow said it wouldnt
be good for the two of them to be found
here together

  very interesting said the doctor
and he tempted winston to take
over your throne

  indeed

  stop it winston cried im
your friend dr hunt and you know
it

  we all know dr hunt i went on
gesturing with my long arm that you
came here because you were forced to
come do you admit that dr hunt
hunt was too busy searching win-
stons eyes to answer me winston
was coming toward him both hands
extended and he was doing a good job
of imploring

  im your jriend dr hunt he was
saying you know im your friend
youre not going to listen to that-that
snakei

  hes a snake by an accident of
fate hunt growled but if hes lying
ill see that hes boiled in oil he
turned to me what did this deep-
voiced fellow look like

  i didnt see him i said i only
saw the shadow of a big skull

  how big was he

  i dont know it was dark and
after i hid in the chair i couldnt turn
to see even after the lights went on
but id know his voice among ten mil-
lion voices

  which way did he go

  out that door you had rung and
he said it was time for him to leave
winston began to laugh he mocked
my words so thoroughly that he almost
shook me loose from the facts i had
seen with my own eyes

  there wasnt anything more i could
do or say i had played my hand and
i was losing you see it wasnt easy


fantastic adventures

for dr hunt to place any trust in a
newcomer like me on such short ac-
quaintance i had already pulled my
share of snaky tricks and this might
be another i couldnt reach in a secret
pocket and pull out a fistful of creden-
tials that proved the earth scientists
had sent me here to bring hunt back
i didnt even have a pocket i only had
scales and a pair of deceitful looking
eyes and a monstrous form that made
men shudder to look at me

  if youll pardon me said winston
i think ill go take a bath that slimy
thing left me with the creeps

  that was all he needed to say i was
a snake any warning truths i might
offer were just so much hissing

  ill give you some pointers on the
new experiment a little later dr win-
ston dr hunt said with his usual pro-
fessional manner-and that was enough
to convince me that i hadnt dented the
confidence that existed between these
two dr hunt turned to me as for
you you may either go forth on your
assignment or return quietly to your
cage which will it be

chapter xvi

t moved along at a slow thoughtful
crawling pace through the remain-
der of the night watching the last of the
six moons slide silently through the
skies

  the air was fresh and fragrant and
i was glad to be away from the odors
of the mountain fortress a whiff of
blossom scents caused me to turn my
course toward the long jagged black
line far down the valley which i knew
to be the crevasse

  that crevasse with its river two miles
below the surface of the land had of-
fered me plenty of pain since i had
first fallen into this weird world but
it was not like the pain that i suffered

now-the pain of not being trusted
strange to say i felt a nostalgic at-
traction for the crevasse again and half
wished that i might return to its rocky
walls and bathe again in its warm
waters

  what a mood i was nursing my
injuries i was sore because dr hunt
hadnt toppled for my first invitation
to junk his set-up on space island and
come back to the earth with me

  i was sore and disillusioned because
dr winston had so quickly collapsed
from a fine wholesome hero with a
keen intellect to a sinister conniving
heel

  was he that somehow i continued
to cling to a hope that he wasnt if
that deep-cistern voice had managed
to put a malicious bug in dr hunts
brain maybe he had done the same
thing for dr winston maybe he was
duping both of the boys and making
suckers out of them

  i looked back to the road that led
to the mountain fortress why had
i come away before i had got to the
bottom of these things why hadnt
i stayed at least long enough to see
that deep-cistern voice and find out
where it lived and what it meant to do

  could it have been some sort of
animal like myself with a heavy hu-
man skull-a deep throat-soft swishy
feet

  then as i lay on the soft grass and
closed my eyes to turn my troubles
over in a half-sleeping mind my
thoughts returned to the missing ernest
marsch  i wondered  

  how long ago it seemed    i was
thinking back to our flight   

  we had been flying through space
only an hour i recalled when flora
hessel first discovered that marsch had
deceived her

  where is my female companion
flora had asked
secret of the serpent



  the incident came back clearly
through the channels of memory

  id told you thered be a female
companion to travel with you marsch
had answered sharply and ive kept
my promise now stop your silly wor-
rying

  it was flora hessels first trip away
from the earth and although i was
kept busy in the control room i could
hear snatches of their conversation
and i knew that she was uneasy i
dreaded to think that she might be
that way all the way from the solar
system to space island but she was
being reasonable and patient all she
wanted to know now that we had em-
barked from the earth was who was
her female companion and why couldnt
they meet at once and get acquainted

  ernest marsch lighted a cigar and
began to pace uneasily i saw that his
mate pete hogan was getting nervous
watching to see what marsch meant to
do i knew and hogan must have
known that there wasnt any other
lady on board the ship

  your companions name is terry
said marsch ma terry shes in
the second stateroom having a nap no
use to wake her shes a safe enough
companion for anyone she likes peo-
ple and she has a soft heart just like
you miss hessel you two ought to
get along just fine

t saw pete hogan gulp he didnt
say a word whenever ernest
marsch made a statement it stood
hogan was not one to cross him up

  marsch came toward the control
room his wide shoulders filling the
doorway for a moment he saw that
i was busy and blowing a puff of smoke
in my direction he closed the door on
me so that i wouldnt notice what hap-
pened next

  but i was curious so i set the con-

trols and opened the visor that gave me
a view of the main room

  flora hessel was getting angry and
suspicious when marsch tried to di-
vert her from her questions by putting
an arm around her she began to storm
she didnt want any of his petting all
she wanted was to see ma terry

  i opened the door a crack to hear the
conversation then

  get ma terry marsch said to ho-
gan champing angrily on his cigar

  if you say so

  i said so didnt i get her
miss hessel may be kinda disap-
pointed pete hogan said dubiously
shut up

  hogan shrugged and went to the sec-
ond stateroom and opened the door
he whistled come terry

  out came a little black-and-white
terrier dog

  shes a mamma terrier marsch
said out of curled lips we call her
ma terry for short thats your fe-
male companion i always keep my
promises shes gentle and soft hearted
just like you you two ought to get
along just fine

  flora hessel walked up to marsch
then and slapped his face he was red
and white and purple and he came at
her with a fist hogan gave a gesture
as if to stop him and gulped a scared
dont do it-dont

  but i was the guy who dashed in
and put the strongarm on the boss in
time to keep flora from getting her
teeth knocked out one solid sock to
his jaw did the trick he lay in the
corner for two hours and no one touched
him

  flora kept to her room most of the
time after that though she occasion-
ally came into the main room when
several of us were gathered there-for
lunch or a game of cards or a round
of sky-study marsch must have felt


fantastic adventures

that hed pulled a pretty crude gag
when she refused to warm up to his
advances evidently he had thought
shed fall into his arms not because he
was so handsome but because he was
the boss and was able to talk in big
terms about some nebulous commercial
venture he was getting ready to launch
from space island

  he kept his temper under control
for the most part but his savage feel-
ings were right there under the sur-
face and he saved a choice bit of dem-
onstration for flora it happened after
flora had made friends with ma ter-
ry and had got in the habit of feeding
the dog right after our lunch talking
as kindly with it as she might have
with her own sister marsch had
watched with growing jealousy and
waited for his chance

  then it came the dog got under his
feet by mistake and he gave it a kick
it whimpered and he kicked it again
flora asked him to stop and that was
all he needed in a fit of anger he
kicked ma terry to death

  after the dog was disposed of
marsch walked back and forth through
the ship eying any of us who hap-
pened to be talking as if just daring
us to criticize his action it was his
expedition and by god hed run things
as he pleased

  it was a pretty unhappy trip after
that he and i were right on the ragged
edge of a gun fight once when someone
separated us at another time i was
already to walk into him with my fists
swinging when he changed his mind
about something that had led to the
trouble

  and so it had been as we approached
space island that he and i were keep-
ing an eye on each other like two sus-
picious hawks and then as we had
slowed down and were moving through
the atmosphere for a landing a strange

and unaccountable explosion had struck
us-blammmm-and the blinding
white light had been the last thing i
had remembered   

  and the next thing had been the
water deep down in the crevasse hours
and hours later    and i had awak-
ened gradually to discover that i had
become a serpent   

  now the new day was dawning and
i curled up in the edge of a thicket
whose greenish-blue hues would give me
a color protection from the eyes of any
chance passers-by the weight of my
troubles had made me weary and i
thought i would sleep the forenoon
away and i might have if a space
ship hadnt come zooming down from
the sky

 blammmm

chapter xvii

rjphe explosive qualities of space
island were a fact to be reckoned
with explosions were space islands
official welcome it seemed for every-
thing that dropped down out of the
skies

  i had gone through it once myself
later i had seen it happen to a dead
space ship that floated in aimlessly
now i was seeing it for the third time

  this was a shapely well-knit ship
that was obviously cruising into the val-
ley for a landing the deadly invis-
ible trap caught it and suddenly the
splinters of wreckage were falling over
a range of three or four miles drifting
down like so many feathers i dis-
cerned a few human bodies among the
falling objects they were alive and
kicking transformed well not yet
at least but soon

  two of the falling men wore starchy
blue uniforms and one of these fell
within a quarter of a mile of my hiding
place i sprang to my feet and went
secret of the serpent



into a high-powered snake gallop using
my swiftest crawling muscles to give
myself an extra boost from the belly
with every leap

  within forty yards of the fallen of-
ficer i stopped hid myself and waited

  he had struck easily not like a man
falling to the earth but with the airi-
ness of a balloon he was sufficiently
stunned however that he crawled off
dizzily on his hands and knees should
i have helped him up i might have
scared the poor fellow out of his wits
i waited then slowly followed to keep
him in sight

  now it was apparent that he might
have remained in his human form but
he was crawling toward a pool of water
and as soon as he began to drink and
to bathe his face it happened

  it was a sight to watch and i dont
think id have stopped it if he had been
my own grandfather

  his clothing began to fall away from
him he was resting on his hands and
knees over the water like anyone
else he felt the need of the life-giving
fluid after the blast of heat and pain
hed gone through

  his neck and head began to take on
a beast-like shape his body shortened
and his legs contracted into the legs of
pigs

  legs feet ears snout he was a
wretched grunting hog

  he looked back at his clothes and
gave a snort of disgust then he stood
there quite as dazed as a prizefighter
who has taken a knockout with his
front feet in the edge of the pool and
his snout burrowing senselessly in the
mud he let his eyes fall closed and
went comfortably to sleep

  it had all happened within a few
minutes of the explosion what a
strange landing

  later i was to learn from kipper
more of the forces back of such events

the force that caused the explosions
was a ray which emanated from a hori-
zontal ray-gun imbedded in the moun-
tains somewhere above the scientists
fortress it and several others like it
guarded the several surrounding valleys
from the dangers of falling objects if
giant meteorites fell through space to
land here they like all other approach-
ing objects must pass through the
plane where the invisible rays would
break them into pieces and retard their
fall

  but the ray was not intended to be
deadly in its effect upon living crea-
tures and the ray did not transform
the transformations were produced by
certain natural elements-as i shall ex-
plain in a moment

  i looked beyond the sleeping pig
remembering that there were other
fallen men to be considered

  one of them i spied less than a mile
away he had come through with no
damage whatever he was walking
slowly toward the low foothills that
lay pink in the morning sun i slipped
along cautiously for many yards then
stopped abruptly his voice was he
crying for help

  he was calling i crawled closer un-
til i caught his words

  a messssage for the massshas he
was singing it out to the foothills a
messssage for the massshas

  no he wasnt out of his head he
knew exactly what he was doing he
and all the rest of this small party had
come here with the intention of mak-
ing contact with the mashas and this
was the password

  it worked right away a delegation
of twelve or fifteen pygmies came run-
ning out of the foothills to greet him

  why what was going on here
another of the newcomers also moved
toward the foothills calling the pass-

fantastic adventures

jcive low artificial earthen mounds
provided the official entrance to
masha land an underground city an
arched opening in the center mound was
just large enough for these two way-
farers from the sky to enter-on their
hands and knees the twelve or fifteen
mashas followed them in and that was
that i was left to wonder what it was
all about

  i cant say why i crawled back to
the sleeping pig at the edge of the pool
unless it was because my appetite was
rising but as i was approaching i
looked back to the fortress mountains
to see that the other part of this weird
world had also taken notice of the new
arrivals

  a squadron of fifteen planes roared
out of the mountain and began to fly
up and down the valley the show was
running true to form i thought who-
ever had come in todays windfall the
fortress meant to get in on its share of
the gleanings that was how it had
happened before the scientists had sent
out a search party to pick up the pieces
-and also to reconvert into their hu-
man forms any newly formed specimens
who werent interesting enough in their
design to deserve a place in dr hunts
museum

  on this search someone-or rather
something-was soon spotted i wished
i had got there in time to see what sort
of monstrosity it was but one of the
planes had already circled down to
fly over within a few feet of the surface
of a stream of water out went a pack-
age of yellow powders pwoof a
small explosion of dust and steam

  flora hessel should have been here
to see i thought this was exactly
the way it had happened to her

  when the cloud cleared the subject
walked out in his normal human form
-a fine looking specimen of a man

  the blimp came over then and a

basket was dropped for the fellow he
finally got in under protest i could
see that he didnt want the rescuers to
know that he had had other plans ob-
viously he had meant to find his way
into the camp of the mashas

  all of which meant that this particu-
lar party of earth men had come with
a special purpose that had something
to do with the mashas the scientists
up in the mountains had better beware

  once again i hurried back to the
sleepy grunting beast that i had left at
the edge of a pool as an officer he
wouldnt be taken over by the search
squadron too easily i thought

  but it happened that the planes didnt
spot him their pygmy enemies got to
him first they came on him with
zeego guns

  once again i thought that flora
hassel should have been here to see for
she had also been the target of zeego
fire

  flash-flash-flash

  i held back hardly breathing was
it going to work again yes it was
happening the three pygmies ap-
proached cautiously then more con-
fidently

  he was changing

  from grunting pork chops into a mut-
tering officer the transformation took
place as swiftly as grease melts in a hot
pan

  he was evidently the same officer
he had lost a share of his dignity with
the loss of his clothes but he was the
same in his mannerisms as soon as the
pygmies had offered him a wrap to
throw around his body they were
welcoming him calling him by name
asking him whether he felt okay they
found him bewildered and a trifle un-
certain of his directions he wanted
to consult a map from the clothing that
he had lost but when he examined the
scraps he found everything too nearly
secret of the serpent



demolished to be of any service he
placed his faith in the pygmies then
and they conducted him away toward
the five-mound entrance

  i drew a deep breath my serpent
cunning had permitted me to see a great
many things in the last few minutes
and i was beginning to understand
much that i hadnt understood before

   the planes had found this sleeping
hog first i knew that they would have
restored him to normal and taken him
back to the fortress just as they took
flora and would have pressed him into
service as a cook or an attendant or
a guard or a laboratory assistant-
according to his talent that was the
way their kingdom was growing   
and they might never know that he had
come here with the secret purpose of
plotting with the mashas-not until
sometime later when the mashas own
brand of hell would break loose

jyforeover i was understanding
the series of conditions at last
which appeared to underlie all of these
weird bodily changes

  and as i understood it gave me new
hope that i too might find my way back
to normal

  it was a triple punch-a game of one
two three

  the first punch was mans ingenuity
-the effects of hidden ray-guns which
the scientists had planted in the moun-
tains

  the second punch was natures own
and must have been operating for cen-
turies certain waters in this region
played their surprise tricks upon the
bodies of all comers who stunned and
fainting and thirsty partook of their
seemingly magic qualities

  the third punch-undoing natures
transformation-was something that
might be accomplished by shock

  any shock zee go fire-yes a

flare of yellow powders-yes other
explosions or concussions perhaps
as i say i was beginning to feel hope-
ful for at last i was seeing a way to
work these powders for my own pur-
pose

  if i wanted dr hunt to listen to
my pleading i should first return to
human form then i could march back
to the mountain fortress and make him
hear me

  it was a hopeful moment for me
watching the mashas lead the officer
away just beyond my fingertips were
the tracks of the pigs feet sharp-cut in
the mud

  but i couldnt be too optimistic i
had already proved too hard-crusted
for the zeego guns as for the powders
i had withstood two explosions and
each time i had been only partially
restored

  for the remainder of that day i
lolled around in the sun devising all
sorts of shock treatments for myself
in imagination i imagined throwing
myself over the side of the mountain
but the memory of my fall through the
crevasse gave me an awful shudder

  could i leap under the wheels of a
speeding truck could i start a forest
fire and leap into it could i creep
into the ranks of the guards at the
fortress and start devouring them so
that they would shoot me with bullets

  none of these plans appealed to me
as being pleasant and i had visions
that any of them might prove uncom-
fortable

  my nerves were pretty jumpy over
all of this speculation i wanted to re-
store myself to normal but i didnt
want to kill myself in the attempt
after all it was better to live as a
serpent than to die as a man

  it is better to live as a serpent i
said to myself several times than to
die as a man


fantastic adventures

  i was fond of that conclusion and
was tempted to carve it in stone at any
rate i had found some consolation i
was a serpent but at least i had my
human memory and most of my nor-
mal faculties of reasoning only lightly
adulterated by serpent instincts i had
better leave well-enough alone and not
tempt the fates to cancel what was left
of me

  its not so bad being a serpent i
told myself after you once get your
belly toughened up

  and so after crawling through a
maze of mysteries i was beginning to
find myself

  i approached the mounds quietly

chapter xviii

rthe mashas were inside their

  mounds warm and comfortable no
doubt a light rain was sprinkling
down over my forty-foot form and i
shivered with the thought that the
waters of space island might transform
me again and take away the arms and
legs   

  but no i had encountered rains be-
fore with no ill effects i was safe my
theory of transformation might be
faulty but i neednt fear the rain

  the only trouble was that these
foothills i was crossing so carefully
were structures of earth i was not
only leaving a twisted path in the mois-
tened dust i was occasionally causing
a piece of some mashas roof to fall in

  clunk

  i heard a screech of annoyed pygmy
voices below me i had probably
knocked half a ton of earth down on
their supper i scurried down into the
depression between the mounds and
threaded my way swiftly to other
places

  i came back to one of the five
mounds that provided the entrance to

this honeycomb city of all the hundred
questions that were making quick chills
of adventure play along my spine the
most tantalizing was why had these
newly arrived full-grown earth people
been welcomed here what strange
game was going on within these
mounds

  low voices were welling up through
the open ventilator of the farthest
mound as i crept up to the crest of its
earthen roof they were pygmy voices
two wizened little officials were in
conference they were sitting on the
earth floor their bronzed bodies high-
lighted by a flickering red fire

  we lost one of them to the blimp
one was admitting they will hold
him unless we invade and rescue him
marsch says there isnt time well
attack tomorrow morning

  anyway three of marschs leaders
came through if theyre as clever as
marsch claims we have a fighting
chance to win this time

  marsch ernest marsch was he
mixed up in this world i was holding
my breath for fear id gasp too loudly
over the tile ventilator shaft

  they were obviously planning to
storm the fortress again soon and these
pygmy officials were saying that the
newly arrived men were leaders who
had come at marschs request there
was some grumbling of disappointment
because one of the newcomers had been
whisked away by the blimp the same
thing someone said had happened to
the girl that marsch had brought a
few days before she had been one of
his special employees and the fortress
had got her

  we should have had her at all
costs

  well whos to blame you saw for
yourself that shed become a two-
headed cat all you had to do was turn
the zeego fire on her
secret of the serpent



  all right keep harping on it wed
have had her if that snaky monster
hadnt whirled into the picture

  so you stopped shooting

  he got one of us as it was

  you might have turned your guns
on him

  but marsch didnt want him-not
alive i mean let the scientists have
him by this time they probably have
him on a pedestal

  they ceased to grumble about lost
opportunities a moment later when a
messenger brought them the announce-
ment that marsch would hold a pre-in-
vasion assembly tonight

  pre-invasion someone said skep-
tically i have the inside information
that marsch is really planning some-
thing else those new ships hes patched
together are all set for a space hop
hes going to take the whole lot of us
to some new planet to start a new
colony

ty this time i knew there were at
least a dozen pygmy officials in
the room though my view allowed me
to see only three or four at a time
there was considerable dissention over
what marsch might be planning for
them the official report was that
bombing ships were ready and that
the masha volunteers would fly over
the fortress and win it by dropping a
few bombs

  but the rumor was spreading that
marschs real plan was to transport
them all to a brighter land

  all of which left me guessing what
was marschs commercial angle he
wasnt playing missionary to these
downtrodden outcasts one could be
sure that he had his eye on the dollar in
the bargain but so far i couldnt see
the dollar

  in fact i hadnt even seen marsch
since i had turned serpent i wasnt

sure that he had come through alive

  a few minutes later i was looking
down through the triple-tiled ventila-
tors at the other end of the row of five
mounds and there he was-ernest
marsch in person

  his cigar smoke had led me to him
through the rain-washed air the aroma
had reached me and i had moved
along through the nights darkness un-
til i had come to what was apparently
his own masha headquarters

  he was pacing smoking waiting im-
patiently around him were a few earth
men-three who had come today and
a few from the ship that i had piloted

  the girl should be here soon
marsch said glancing at his watch
we need her to put the assembly
over the whole masha gang will trust
us if shell say the right words

  they wont trust us very long
someone said not after we take off
we dont give a damn about that
marsch snorted just so we get them
aboard the ships hell as soon as
were out in space it makes no differ-
ence before they ever wake up to
whats coming well have them un-
loaded and sold as slaves

  nobody seemed surprised to hear
these words the men were all in on
a well-organized scheme that was just
about to come off they talked of lin-
ing their pockets well and marsch as-
sured them that the interplanetary mar-
ket where these slaves were to be
dumped didnt pay off in peanuts

  there was a little sentimental talk
about pete hogan who had had the
hard luck to fall over the precipice
when my ship had dropped us here
poor pete marsch said he should
have got in on this gravy he was the
best yes-man i ever had but pete
had fallen into the depressed river just
as i had done and the conclusion was
hed changed into a fish now i re-


fantastic adventures

called that several pygmies had been at
work during my first hours of con-
sciousness on this planet trying to get
something out of that deep stream
marsch had failed to recover his lost
mate-but i had got my first pygmy
dinner out of the deall

  they spoke of losing a pygmy in
their attempted rescue

  who was that devilish serpent
someone asked

  probably my pilot bob garrison
marsch said ill rest easier when i
know theyve run him through the lab
and scoured his bones he was a
trouble-maker i think he had his own
scheme in coming here he wanted to
rescue dr hunt

  from what i hear theres no chance
of that one of the newly arrived men
said

  no not as long as the white head
keeps both of the doctors under his
thumb marsch said

  there was something about the way
he intoned the words white head
instantly i thought of the shadowy
white skull i had glimpsed in my spree
of eavesdropping in the laboratories

  marsch added have no fear about
our plan as far as the white head is
concerned gentlemen as i have as-
sured you he plays both sides of the
fence i have his complete approval

rthrough the darkness i had been
hearing other voices a party was
approaching this earthen city from
somewhere down the valley within a
few minutes the footsteps were thud-
ding softly through the underground
passages and presently they came into
marschs headquarters it was a party
of pygmies-i recognized padderman
and jallan whom i had once encoun-
tered on the fortress roof-and they
brought with them flora hessel

  i told you wed succeed one of

them gloated

  marsch complimented them and dis-
missed them then he and his guests
viewed the prize that stood before
them beautiful black-haired dark-
eyed flora her face was tilted upward
in a characteristically proud pose and
i could read her fearlessness in her
firm lips

  marsch stepped up and put his hands
on her shoulders as if he possessed her

  well well so youve finally come
back to the right camp my little sweet-
heart is all dressed for a party isnt
she

  she was wearing a fragile pink and
white dress that must have been a gift
from someone at the fortress she re-
sponded to marschs approach in the
manner of a prisoner rather than a
sweetheart

  relax relax marsch said youre
among friends

  having introduced the other mem-
of his party he proceeded to go over
his plans step by step but his story
was somewhat altered for floras bene-
fit he said not a word about pressing
the mashas into slavery oh no noth-
ing like that he was going to take
them to a new planet and allow them to
start a new colony it all sounded very
beautiful

  and all that flora needed to do was
help get them in the mood to accept
his magnanimous offer

  the four space ships are all ready
and he winked with pride over his
cleverness at dawn-

  i was gathering fever over these
cross-currents of deception and was
probably uttering serpent profanity
when i was interrupted by a slight tap
on my arm i almost jumped off the
mound

  move over came a tiny whisper in
my ear i want to see too

  kipper 
secret of the serpent



  in person pleased to meet you
what are you doing here theyll
brand you

  i had to keep an eye on our lady
friend he whispered howd i know
youd already be here

  listen i said theres a devilish
plan afoot do you know about it
get an earful

  we both listened marsch was pour-
ing it on thick and i didnt know but
what flora was eating it up

  youll speak to them at the assem-
bly he was saying so they wont
doubt our promises the main thing
you have to do is look honest-and
how could you miss give them a pep
talk on running their own kingdom
tell them theyll grow into strong men
again  strong men-thats the angle
let them think theyll have a chance
to jail in love with a beautiful woman
like you

  flora answered with the edged tone
of sarcasm

  shall i promise them female com-
panions like you promised me on the
trip how is your supply of terriers
mr marsch

  ha-ha-ha-rrrhuh yes er-just a
little joke gentlemen dont mind miss
hessel gentlemen marsch said
hastily shes always clowning

chapter xix

t wanted to hug flora for what
she had just said and i might have
if i hadnt been a serpent

  under the conditions all i could
hope for was to let her know some-
how that she had friends up here on
the mud roof the simplest way to let
her know was to put my nose to the
ventilator and breathe deep

  ssssss

  whats that said one of the men
looking up sharply i knew he couldnt

see anything through the blackness
above the ventilator but marsch went
pale and moved back

  was it pygmies someone asked
wed better not be overheard

  its not pygmies said flora in a
tone that comforted me its only a
breeze from the river

  wed better get on with the assem-
bly marsch said abruptly

  we went down into the masha world
together kipper and i i think i
would have gotten lost if i had gone
alone the tunnels were endless most
of them were not lighted but the
mashas knew their way from an almost
instinctive sense of direction and kip-
per like the others had been here for
most of two centuries

  he straddled by neck and clung
tight and whispered the directions in
my ear part of the time we moved
along at a gallop part of the time i
couldnt use my legs because the ceil-
ings were so low and then we squirmed
along the earth in traditional serpent
fashion

  all foot tracks lead to the assem-
bly kipper would say whenever a
lighted room showed us the tracks of
those who had gone before

  it wont be an assembly if they see
me i said itll be a stampede
but kipper assured me that hed get
me into the underground chamber with-
out creating any undue disturbance
and he made his promise good we
crept in by way of a shelf of natural
rock about ten feet above the level of
the masha path and there we huddled
within full view of the torchlights

  several hundred little pygmies were
thronged before us looking across
the cavernous chamber toward a cubi-
cal baked-mud platform they were be-
ing swayed by marschs eloquence

  waving his arms and shouting like
a politician who is about to save the


fantastic adventures

country with promises marsch brought
his speech to a ringing conclusion

  when the sun sets tomorrow night
you mashas shall again be a proud
people the battle will be over and
you will be in possession of this land
that is rightfully yours

  the hundreds of pygmies applauded
with shouts

  no longer will you be outcasts of
space-fugitives from the earth and
from mars you will be masters of
your own destinies and as for the
scientists who have invaded this realm
they will be your servants and with
their own serums you shall make them
slaves who will do your bidding
when the applause quieted marsch
helped flora hessel to the platform
she stood looking over the multitude
of torchlighted faces and somehow i
knew she wasnt going to say what
marsch had wanted her to say

  the mashas waiting for her to
speak believed that they were about
to attack the fortress

tut flora believed that they were
going to be put aboard ships not
for battle but to seek another planet
for a new colony

  why had marsch shifted his stories
she must have wondered was there
still another plan

  even marsch doesnt know kip-
per whispered to me he thinks his
ships are going to take them off to be
sold as slaves but hes going to be
fooled

  how do you know i said isnt
he all set

  he thinks he is but hes overlooked
one important fact theres a more
powerful trickster in the game-the
white head

  flora was starting to speak it was
a breathless audience

  i have been brought all the way

from the earth to speak to you she
began slowly on the earth i have
helped many people who are trying to
regain a solid grip on life mr marsch
has told me that you consider your-
selves outcasts and he thinks that you
deserve some sort of victory to salve
your injuries from two centuries ago
yes yes half the crowd jumped
to their feet waving their arms and
shouting in a fervent affirmative

  she quieted them as i was about
to say  do not agree with mr marsch
i think you have your own good world
here and i think it is childish for you
to nurse your injuries of long ago i
think that mr marsch and your own
leaders are doing you a disfavor to stir
your old resentments-

  a volley of boos thundered through
the room-a chorus that marsch and
his associates joined they shouted
her down and she stood there facing
them she had said all she dared they
would have mobbed her if she had
said more

  but just at that moment as marsch
was moving up to the platform shaking
his fist at her someone entered from a
door just beyond and his entrance
stunned the mob into silence

  it was the white head

  he was mostly skull all right-and
that was the way i had remembered
him from before a barrel-sized white
skull growing out of a keg-shaped body

  from neck to toes he was dressed in
a skin-tight green silk costume dark
green yet shining his arms were
short blocks of muscle and his feet were
like a lions pads he gave an im-
pression of fearful power-an un-
worldly power that was a strange blend
of life and death

  as he moved closer to the platform
i thought his huge white skull was al-
most luminous its light cast a pallor
over floras face perhaps no one
secret of the serpent



noticed that she climbed down and
moved back into a corner that ghastly
white skull held everyones eye

  the rows of huge white teeth parted
and the deep hollow translucent eyes
seemed to be taking in the face of every
person in the crowd

  the white head paused beside the
cubical platform and when he extended
his arm to press against its side it
collapsed into a little cloud of dust and
was gone

  the surrounding torchlights grew
dimmer and the great skull grew
brighter until there was nothing in the
whole room except deep shadows and
a glowing white skull

  the skull tilted and turned and its
jaw moved and it spoke

  come that deep-cistern voice
filled the whole underground world
come the ships are ready the time
is now

chapter xx

t would have depended upon kip-
per in that moment but kipper was
gone what was about to happen was
more than i could conjecture but
somehow i knew that kipper was right
there was a more sinister plan on foot
than marschs scheme of converting
mashas into slaves

  the mashas were following in double
time running down through the black
tunnels to the concealed plaza where
the ships were supposed to be ready for
the take-off

  the white head had stood beside
that exit pointing the way and marsch
himself had led the procession with
him had gone the full-sized officers who
were as i knew pilots for the ships
but before half of the assemblage of
pygmies had joined the rush and dis-
appeared through the tunnel the white
head raised a hand to hold back the

rest of the crowd there would not be
room for all at this time he had said
and with that he had disappeared down
the exit after the last of the procession

  i wanted nothing more than to go to
flora and give her a safe ride back to
the fortress but would the fortress be
safe whatever the white heads
scheme might be or marschs it was a
cinch there were going to be some angry
pygmies as soon as they discovered that
this whole movement didnt lead to a
direct attack they were ready for
power and heaven help any man or god
or demon of death that might stand in
their way

  the torch lights flared up as i was
creeping down through the remaining
crowd the pygmies began to scream
it wasnt like a roomful of women
screaming it wasnt like anything but
a roomful of mashas screaming they
scattered out of my path shooting at
me and throwing stones they would
have brought the roof down on them-
selves and me if they could have done
it

  but i reached flora and the fright
faded from her face at the sight of me

  thank goodness she was already
running motioning me to follow
hurry if anyone can do anything
youre the one

  whats happening i chased after
her and in a moment we found an open-
ing up into the outdoors where are
we going do you know

  she climbed on my back slapping me
first on one side and then the other to
direct me as we snake-galloped across
the rolling mounds

  i should have known that kippers
hunch was right she sang in my ears
as we whizzed through the night breeze
see over where that tiny red light is
thats where its happening thats
where the ships are supposed to fly
out


fantastic adventures

  we were making the right kind of
progress in the right direction and a
truck would have had to go some to
keep pace i only hoped that the
mounds wouldnt cave in under my
beating feet they were frequently
breaking through with a heavy thump
as my hind feet kicked away from
them

  the ships arent flying yet i
puffed maybe therell be time
the ships wont fly flora said
thats what kipper tried to tell me
hes sure-

  why not whats the game
its the white heads game not
even marsch knows marsch be-
lieves-

  when did you see kipper i de-
manded

  when whats the difference

  are you sure kipper is kipper

  it didnt sound like i was making
sense but suddenly a cold suspicion
shot through the length of me and all
at once i was slowing up so fast that
flora had to cling to my neck for dear
life i stopped turned my head and
tried to face her in the dark

  what is the matter with you she
cried go on its white heads
crimes we want to stop hes not
putting those pygmies on ships hes
pouring them into the transformation
waters-concentrated water that will
get them for sure kipper said so
hes going to run them through the vat
and right down into the de-composing
mill that will eat their flesh right off
their bones as fast as they change into
new forms hell catch their skeletons
its a regular skeletons assembly line
i tell you why dont we go are we
going to let kipper fight it alone

  my retort must have made her too
weak to say anything more but the
wild suspicion had flared up through
me and i had to say it

  i think its kipper thats double-
crossing the whole gang of us i think
kipper is the white head

  go please go thats all flora
could say i thought she was fainting
but i obeyed with my two serpent
eyes fixed on the growing red light i
flew into top speed and raced like a
ship through space

chapter xxi

n assembly line for polished
skeletons-thats what it was

  we found our way into a lower level
by following the guides of sight and
smell and sound and feeling especially
sound i had learned to put an ear to
the ground and catch the directions of
the throbbing vibrations that beat faint-
ly through the length of my body with
sounds beating from many directions
i was soon convinced that the proces-
sion was finding its way down and
down through certain subterranean
channels that were alive with electri-
cally powered apparatus

  and now flora and i followed a dark
tunnel that promised a flare of amber
light around the corner we heard
the gentle hum of machinery we
crawled on and on flora pressing
down close over my shoulders to dodge
the arched ceiling and i dragging my
arms and legs at last the tunnel curved
into a high-ceilinged chamber whose
orange rock walls gave the amber glow
to the string of white lights beyond

  whiter and whiter the way became
and louder and louder the rumble until
presto through the open doors we saw
it with our own eyes a train of freak-
ish skeletons

  i havent the heart to describe these
strange monstrosities no two were the
same very few presented any sem-
blance of balance or symmetry a hun-
dred highly varied monsters if sliced
secret of the serpent



into several parts and reassembled with
each other by accident couldnt have
matched this weird pageant of bones

  the line was moving slowly-slowly
enough that one might count ten before
the next skeleton emerged from the
black circular opening at our left

  the pygmies-transformed flora
said in an awed tone theyre walking
into it one after another thinking
theyre on the way to the attack

  we plunged ahead up the stairs
across a balcony up another stairs
over a catwalk down a ramp-we were
like a pair of bullets ricocheting be-
tween walls in the back of my mind i
was marveling that someone or some-
thing had organized enough pygmy
slave labor in secret to construct such
an elaborate set-up yet i knew that if
my friend kipper was the white head
he had been here for long enough time
to accomplish seeming miracles

  whoever had done it that powerful
person had had the patience to wait
and to keep the secret air-tight until
the magic waters of this region had
been converted into something so po-
tent that even the mashas would fall
victim and rather than let the secret
leak out to masha land he had de-
vised a scheme for putting a large share
of the population through with one
swift stroke

  in my heart i was sick to think that
the white head must be kipper i
compared the size mentally of the two
creatures without the huge skull the
white heads body would be the size of
kippers the skull might be a mech-
anical contrivance in spite of its seem-
ingly perfect operation or it might be
the real thing-who could tell in this
land of quick changes

  as to the time that i had seen the
two creatures i could not recall any
instance of having seen both at once

  then there was kippers unusual

  versatility of manner he could easily
have several voices with a skull to aid
his resonance and he had seemed a
person of such self-confidence as if he
went his own way carried his own pur-
poses in deep concealment and feigned
an outward manner of light-hearted-
ness

  and yet they certainly would have
touched the hot brand to kipper that
night if i hadnt come along would
he have taken it or would he have
changed instantly into the white head
and bowled them over with some show
of power

  well find the white head up this
way flora said one more stair
and through that narrow copper door
kipper told me

  maybe kipper showed you 

t said it angrily spitefully some-
thing told me that if kipper knew
his way all through these mysteries he
was a part of this sinister world no
question about it

  are you angry with me because i
want to help kipper stop these atroci-
ties flora said she swung off my
back and stood there on the step glar-
ing at me my words had stung deep
the light glanced off the copper door-
way just above us and it glinted in her
eyes dangerously we were both pant-
ing and all at once i could hardly speak
for anger but i managed some savage
words

  how do you know all about this
how does kipper know-

  all right ill tell you she said
kipper is the grandson of the white
head he told me so they were
shipped from mars together the
white head was the only one who was
transformed by the waters kipper
said he was more sensitive more deli-
cate and less adapted to the conditions
of mars he was a scientist and he


fantastic adventures

  discovered that these space island
waters saturated with the strange
qualities from certain blossoms could
cause all sorts of physical miracles so
he went to work    and he became
the real power    feared and re-
spected like a god  

  youre sure i said that this is
not kipper youre talking about
something was easing in the long long
chain of tensions through my backbone

  kipper told me yes im sure and
all these years kipper has kept watch
not knowing what his grandfather was
planning being afraid to tell and
worrying because he didnt dare-

 we pushed through the narrow
copper door

  the thick sickening perfumes of
blossoms filled my serpent nostrils and
for an instant i staggered backward

  the waters were rushing through a
sluice dark green waters deeper in
color than the waters of the depressed
river thickened waters that reminded
me of the greenhouses at the fortress

  one after another the pygmies were
dropping down from an open shaft
above the sluice they fell kicking and
screaming the sluice was deep and
before they could scramble to the sur-
face they were carried on down out of
sight to one of the lower levels

  can you make the leap flora
cried to me

  she pointed to the platform on the
other side of the sluice a fight was
going on over there it was an unfair
fight and it wasnt going to last long
kipper had a steel bar in his hand
he was trying to slam the white head
over the crown one telling blow
struck the white head gave an ugly
laugh through his immense white teeth
he had only to fling his hand at kipper
kipper would fall back to his knees

  it was only a twenty foot leap over
the water and over the heads of the

  struggling mashas i caught the op-
posite side of the sluice with my good
hands and whipped my tail against the
green waters then i came up fast and
strong and ran toward the fighters

  with one hard fling of his hand white
head knocked kipper off into the
water

  i sprang to the edge of the sluice
reached a hand toward the little fellow
as he floundered my arm wouldnt
straighten i missed him i caught a
glimpse of his fighting face his gritting
teeth-he went on down then with the
other mashas

  the white head was coming at me

  the switch that was floras cry
from across the way

  as white head closed in on me i felt
one muscle after another go paralyzed
through the left side of my body but
i had caught floras shout and i saw
what she meant i whipped my long tail
at the wall and struck a row of switches
-struck them off

  the pygmies ceased to fall from
overhead i had evidently closed the
hopper now there would be a chance
for someone up there-mashas or
otherwise-to discover what had been
happening

  the waters stopped churning too
and that seemed to mean that the flow
of bodies down into the flesh-stripping
mills would stop

  it all happened in a flash and not
for one split second did i have any rest
from the white heads attack he
was putting a freeze on me but i was
walking into him with a good right arm
i flung a blow at his throat

  his mighty skull pinched down on
my hand just as i struck for an in-
stant we hovered on the edge of the
sluice as we both fought for footing
but the weight of my paralyzed side
threw us over we fell in together
kicking and striking and biting and
secret of the serpent



then as we slipped down through the
waters into some lower level i was sure
we were locked in a death struggle

chapter xxii

tm the serpent hes not the ser-
pent im the serpent i had
started to climb up over the edge of the
circular tank in which the waters were
still spinning like a merry-go-round
and as i came up i saw that kipper
wasnt following me he was running
from me he was going toward that-
that forty-foot green-and-purple ser-
pent i yelled at him he was taking
it to be me thinking it was a friend but
he was making a mistake no come
away from him im the serpent im
bob garrison-over here

  he turned his fighting face toward
me for just an instant couldnt he
understand how could anyone have
understood i hadnt realized myself
for a moment just what transforma-
tion had taken place

  but as i intoned the words bob
garrison and heard the deep rumble
of my voice echo through the huge skull
that i now possessed i realized

  in the waters we had been trans-
formed in our fight the shock treat-
ment had done its work and now-i
possessed the body of the white head

  and there in the tank lashing its
ugly tail through the green waters was
the power of these weird laboratories-
the power that had been known as the
white head-now in the guise of a
legged serpent

  kipper saw what had happened-
just too late

  my words told him and he was quick
enough to know-poor guy-but not
quick enough to escape the big jaws
of the serpent closed over his head and
snapped the life out of his body in one
hard stroke

  i shall never forget floras scream
she simply couldnt believe her eyes
on the instant i was shot through with
remorse for all the suspicious things i
had said about kipper would she ever
believe that it wasnt i who took his
life in that awful moment

  i have no pangs of remorse over
what i did very soon after the echoes
of floras scream had died away

  first making sure that no more
mashas would go through the trans-
forming waters i turned the switches
on again and allowed the serpent to go
on through i remembered that a ped-
estal had already been prepared for
him-that is for me-and i believed he
would look well upon it

  then i turned to the very weighty
responsibilities that awaited me

  it was not as difficult as you might
think the greatest advantages were
mine i soon discovered because i was
the white head and there was no one
not even a learned doctor who did not
fully respect my slightest whim if any-
thing i was going to have to be very
careful not to overplay my power and
arouse suspicion

  a word to marsch and his officers
from me convinced them that the flights
into space which they had planned
would have to be postponed until the
mashas had had more chance to work
out some plans of their own i was in-
clined to agree with flora that they
had a good world of their own right
here where their lives might go in
forever pleasantly and harmlessly but
if some of them wished to venture forth
to other planets and start a new colony
after due consideration i would see to
it that marsch and his men would make
their promises good

  my attendants at the fortress found
comfortable rooms with bars on the
doors and windows for marsch and his
officers pending the mashas decisions


fantastic adventures

the bars on the door made it pos-
sible for persons who felt sociable to
stop and say hello to earnest marsch
now and then and to bring him a cigar
if they wished and some of his visi-
tors learned in time to ask if he
wouldnt like a female companion and
couldnt they bring him a little terrier
dog for company

  it took me several hours of most
earnest talking to convince my one con-
fidante flora that i was not the white
head but was still at heart a very
friendly serpent and that i could even
remember the time when i had been
bob garrison

  you do seem to be bob garrison
she finally said as we lunched together
on one of the fortress porches and
you certainly arent acting like the
white head

  i tried to smile through my enormous
teeth and i felt that the light of my
great hollow eyes made a slightly terri-
fying effort to glow warmly

  believe me flora i am bob gar-
rison and i remember every moment
of our space-ship journey together be-
lieve me i fell in love with you on that
trip and one of these times-

  one of these times what

  after ive solved a few of the prob-
lems that only white heads power can
solve im going to dissolve myself in
the green waters and come back to nor-
mal so dont go way

  problems to solve youre the
master mind now arent you

  im taking my time i said you
see there was a rather serious split be-
tween dr hunt and dr winston and
now that ive come into this curious
power i can understand it the white
head forced his will over both men and
he set up a distrust there which was
positively vicious i cant just go to
these men and say dr hunt dr
winston is really your loyal friend 

  why not

  because if i did they would both
think that i was again forcing my will
upon them trying to create an untrue
friendship no it will take time but
theyll work it out i know they will
because ive withdrawn that wedge that
white head planted   

  we looked down over the edge of
the porch to a plaza below and there
we saw the two doctors starting off on
a stroll together

  dr hunt was speaking and we
caught a fragment of his conversation
i think i understand what you have
on your mind dr winston but it will
do us good to talk it over ive been
thinking id go back to the earth some-
time soon now that everything seems
to be smoothing out but first i hope
that you and i can reorganize our pro-
gram here  i mean reorganize it
from the ground up

  or from the river up said dr
winston with a toss of his head looking
very much like a king

  i turned to flora and nodded my
huge skull they were back on a solid
footing all right there would soon
be a constructive scientific program
rising out of the discarded skeletons of
the old

  its going to be an interesting world
around here as time goes on i said
a little less weird perhaps and a
little less human with poor kipper
gone

  much less human without kipper
flora said quietly

  and it will be pretty terrible after
you go back to the earth will you be
leaving here and going back one of
these days

  flora smiled ive been in love with
bob garrison for a long time  i
think ill stick around and see what
happens

the vanishing doctor

 if	by charles recour	

one of the most celebrated disappearances
on record and one of the most famous in
europe is that of dr ferenc boslav
european newspapers often bring it up and re-
hash it for the benefit of their sunday supple-
ment type of readers in spite of this the case
makes interesting reading the files of a number
of budapest newspapers have almost rooms de-
voted to the matter in its way it was a little
cause celebre

  dr ferenc boslav was a famous and learned
surgeon who was widely known in europe for his
superb work in elementary neurosurgery at the
turn of the century his work was discussed and
published not only in hungarian medical journals
but in those of other countries as well he was
on the staff of the austro-hungarian hospital in
budapest had numerous consultation positions in
other hospitals and in addition taught periodically
at the university of vienna he was an honored
recognized man he lived in a rather elaborate
home in one of the most fashionable suburbs of
budapest and in the social circles of his time was
regarded as a lavish entertainer a generous host
and in general a good fellow all around he
was happily married and had two children in
fact it was at the birthday party of one of
them that the incident was touched off

  it was hot and muggy in suburban budapest
on the night of july   the birthday
party for dr ferencs daughter alicia was in
full swing and the orchestra brought from vienna
for the occasion turned many a merry waltz
during the evening the guests were smoking
eating drinking and talking and of course
watching the children at the party dr boslav
circulated among his guests playing the good
host and attending to their every want

  as was the custom at such a party when the
time came for disbanding about  dr
boslavs wife sought him out in order to bid
their guests good evening at first she looked
casually but apparently the good doctor had
disappeared enlisting the help of some friends
and the servants after some time because she
was beginning to get alarmed mrs boslav
searched the house and later the relatively small
garden of which it was a part nothing was to
be seen of the man when the guests had
finally gone mrs boslav located the police
for she became worried over her husbands
absence evidently she was unaccustomed to his
sudden disappearance though at first she thought
he might have had an urgent medical call a
routine check of the hospitals and clinics proved

that such was not the case while she was
worried she was not unduly alarmed until in
spite of the police no trace of the missing man
could be found

  it is almost impossible for a citizen at any
time particularly one of dr boslavs eminence
to disappear without creating some sort of a
furor dr boslav to all intents and purposes
had vanished from the earth his wife hired
detectives sought the aid of various police groups
and other investigators and all to no avail dr
ferenc boslav was gone this state of affairs
lasted for eleven days mrs boslav turned the
city of budapest upside down in an effort to
find her husband she had begun to conclude
that he had been kidnapped and murdered and
his body hidden for what she reason she could
not imagine

  eleven days after he had disappeared dr
boslav suddenly and dramatically turned up he
was located by a policeman walking down a
street of moderate industry early in the morning
he was brought home at once for the policeman
recognized him in spite of his ragged torn and
dirty clothes his unkempt beard and lackadaisical
manner he acted as if he had had a spell of
amnesia as if he was in a fog when asked
where he had been his only answer was they
know they know

  as soon as he had recovered and been cleaned
up he was subjected to a vigorous questioning
by all concerned nothing was learned he could
not remember where he had been or he would
not recall he was in perfect physical shape
despite his dirtiness and he repeated his stock
phrase often gradually this ended and he
became perfectly normal-his old self he re-
sumed his work and all went on as before he
never referred to the matter even at his death
in 

  it is easy to say that he suffered a brief attack
of amnesia or that he had been temporarily
kidnapped or that he was out of his mind for
a while yes pat simple explanations are avail-
able but   

  this odd fact was what brought on all the dis-
cussion and speculation while still groggy for
a number of days after his return when ques-
tioned where he had been dr boslavs reply was
invariably they know they know what was
he referring to who were they what bear-
ing had that phrase on his disappearance and
why did he repeat it so often the hungarian
papers made much of this without an answer

	 


 the fire trail

i walkad up and up on a pathway of flam   


fj 	the american indian has

   u  demonstrated many times that he



   has knowledge of a strange kind
here is a true account of a weird
navaho ceremony and its result

a sincere warning

 tn the following pages you will find an
 - accurate account of what happened when
 oge-make walked the fire trail of the
 navaho in the summer of  to walk
 the fire trail is to leave your body during a
 trance and travel not only through space
 but through time many times the navaho
 have conclusively proved they have this
 weird power-but this time they were try-
 ing to prove nothing only obtain an answer
 to the grim problem that faces them this
 winter instead to their disappointment
 the walker of the fire trail brought back a
 message of vital importance only to the
 white man through our mutual friend
 scientist l taylor hansen they have
 passed the message on to us we pass it on
 to all americans-and we believe it read
 it and think 

        ou sent for me

           i looked around the circle of
 lean hawk-like copper-skinned
 faces lit fitfully by the light of the
 campfire and the thirteen pairs of dark
 eyes fastened on mine the ceremonial
 blankets over the shoulders of these
 men blended into the star-dusted black-
 ness of the night here and there a bit
 of silver or turquoise setting caught up
 the gleam of the fire i repeated my
 question in a different phrasing

word came to me through running-
deer that i was wanted by the elders


fantastic adventures

i left my classes in the university to
come to you my people what is it
that you wish of your pale son

  a man rose from the circle and waved
me to a seat on the desert sand as i
glanced at the spot i saw the lean
graceful bending figures of a navaho
sand painting i hesitated a moment
was this a navaho ceremonial the
navaho have been traditional enemies
of our tribe what could this mean
again the leader waved imperiously and
i sank to earth on the sand-painting

  then in the flickering firelight i saw
that the leader was my grandfather
looking more majestic than i had ever
remembered him looking as the cere-
monial blanket was gathered and held
like a roman senator might hold his
toga only the wind playing across the
wide expanse of fantastic desert land
about us accentuated the silence fi-
nally he began to speak

  yes my son we sent for you i am
going to reveal to you a secret of the
past the time has come when it is
necessary for you to understand i
have brought you up from babyhood in
the ways of my people i have taught
you the lore and ceremonies you have
been one of us even though you have
desired to learn of the white man in
his schools yet in the summer times
would you return to learn of us and
bring us the results of your mounting
knowledge that was good

  you have thought yourself to be the
unwanted babe of my daughter who
eloped with a white man i told you
that to keep you one of us the truth
is that the river brought you to me dur-
ing a flood i never knew your parents
i had hoped that you might be part in-
dian but it becomes evident to all that
your parents were white

  my brain whirled at this revelation
and i struggled to control my expres-
sion not my grandfather-this mag-

nificent old warrior i loved so deeply
not my people-these men to whom i
felt such an inexpressible bond of af-
fection not mine

  i searched each face behind the
mask-like expression i fancied the old
affection i was so used to seeing still
lingered undimmed yet i sensed
trouble there too those eyes were
watching mine hungrily like children
watching the eyes of a beloved leader
then i saw the navaho with their
knotted-up hair there were four of
them their eyes were curious and not
unfriendly yet they had a sort of
haunted quality about them their
blankets were ragged and their bodies
were bags of bones i swallowed as the
significance of this hit my brain hard
times must have struck these handsome
haughty silversmiths and weavers

  my grandfathers fine ascetic face
drooped slightly in the firelight not
that anyone could have suspected that
droop but me yet i knew that this
confession was not easy for him to
make i wondered why he was making
it before all these men-including the
strangers as if answering my thoughts
he continued

  terrible times are threatening us
all my son in our mutual danger old
misunderstandings are being forgotten
we are all indians first the pueblos
joined their councils seeing that always
one was in danger though not ever the
same one wassington always threat-
ened the lands of one of us by some bill
if we get enough people to stop one
bill then they pass another now our
brothers the navaho are in trouble

tlte folded his blanket around
him and sank silently upon the
earth then from his side of the fire a
pitifully thin shrunken old navaho

  the indian accent gives washington a
 hissing sound-ed
the fire trail	

arose his quavering voice spoke in
broken english and i wondered how
much of my grandfathers speech ut-
tered in melodious keresian he had un-
derstood after casting a tiny whiff of
corn pollen to the four directions and
blowing something into the fire he be-
gan

  once navaho strong people our
ho-ghans dot plains we ride for buffa-
lo never take all animals-only old
bulls or crippled cows no indian kill
for fun-only white man buffalo
strong deer people strong and navaho
strong then white man kill for skins
leave buffalo rotting on plains many
like sands rot on plains and make smell
of death navaho know he must fight
white man we have no guns like he
have we have only arrow and stone
hatchet-and great courage we fight
hard no use against guns which kill
far-off navaho rounded up in great
red canyon of death soldier kill wom-
en and shoot little children my mother
and baby brother die i hide in bushes
and pray soldiers go way but one day
find me hunting rabbit and send me on
long-walk

  i knew the old man was referring to
the exile from which one-half of the
tribe died after a pause he continued

  i will not speak of long-walk to
navaho it was time-of-greatest-sorrow
many dropped to die in desert but in
time people come back to own lands
build ho-ghans again raise sheep

   long-walk refers to the exile of the tribe
following the massacre in canyon de chelly and
canyon del muerto in - it was at this
time that general james carleton of california
column renown had begun what he had chosen
to call the reduction of the navajo he was
joined by kit carson and some  new mexican
volunteers after the massacre the tribe was
rounded up and marched  miles to the east to
ft sumner on the pecos river there smallpox
finished the nefarious business that massacre had
begun and only a pitiful remainder struggled back
to chinli and the red canyons in  after
the treaty of  had been signed-ed

catch some mountain sheep for strong
wool forget long-walk weave rugs
and white man buy make silver-work
people happy then come men from
wassington him say too much sheep
on land mebby so mebby kill few
but wassington send men to kill most
all sheep wassington kill sheep when
young men fight across waters now
no sheep no wool for blankets and
navaho hungry what can we do

  then arose the husky figure i recog-
nized as the head snake-priest of the
hopi he spoke briefly of the bill
which would have separated the hopi
from their corn fields but which was
defeated he ended with a bitter plea
for the vote

  must only indians and the insane
be considered unfit to vote why are
indians classed with the mentally de-
ficient

  his language reminded me that he
had once obtained a degree from a uni-
versity he was followed by a stranger
who introduced himself as a yee-hat
from alaska his plea was that against
sacred treaty the alaskan indians have
just been separated from all their in-
herited lands this bill was passed in
the closing days of the  congress
when debate was limited and at the
recommendation of the indian bureau
before all this had time to fully im-
press itself on my mind my own tribe
was again speaking the subject was
the old nightmare of the dam

  why must new mexico build her
dam where the water will back up and
cover the lands and sites of five
pueblos some of our people have
sworn to die in the rising waters which
will cover our farms our sacred pottery

  the bursum bill this hopi bill was attached
as a rider to a veterans pension bill alert white
indian defense club of new mexico rallied
enough letter writers by lecturing womens clubs
to defeat it-ed

fantastic adventures

mines and kilns and our dance places
which were already ancient when white
man first came to the land

  after a pause he asked the question
in english why is it always our lands
or our animals we pueblos never
made war on wassington now they
take our food by drowning our lands
these corn fields were ours before the
memories of men what can we do

  everywhere i looked eyes were ask-
ing mine the same question what can
we do i wanted to cry out to tell
them it was not my fault that i was
just as helpless as they were i wanted
to shout who am i what can i do
to stop this wicked march of greed
but my grandfather had arisen and his
voice was flowing out in the liquid tones
of my own beloved keresian pueblo
tongue

  i know your thoughts my son you
have not as yet learned to hide them
well yes we know you of yourself can
do nothing but tonight we are asking
you to intercede for us we have chosen
you because you have white blood and
know the way of the white man yet
your soul is ours we are asking you to
go to those who make your laws and
learn from their minds if there is hope
for us we ask you to do this not in
body for we do not have the money to
send you but in the indian way-in
spirit we ask that you walk the fire-
trail

t gasped at the shock of the revela-
tion the holy-of-holies reserved
for medicine men-this adventure was
to be mine i began to remember the
stories i had heard from childhood-
how one man sent his spirit to mexico
and warned his son who had gone to
trade turquoise of the approach of az-
tec slavers i remembered the far more
recent story mentioned in jungle
trails and inca ruins of the medicine

man who sent his spirit up the river to
explore for the author and who minute-
ly described the death of a chief in a
distant maloka which the author him-
self verified some two months later
when he had reached that point i
remembered the well-authenticated trip
of chief seattle who described the city
that later bore his name other cases
flashed to mind sees-the-living-bull
early in the contact of white traders
saw the passing of the buffalo and the
coming of short-haired spotted cattle-
a description which must have bewil-
dered his hearers who had never seen a
cow many other cases flashed to my
mind some had traveled in space only
others had traveled in time

  will you go my son

  i nodded as i felt my temples throb
with my rising pulse of course i
would go but   how could i be sure
again my grandfather read my
thoughts

  since you are a novice and it is your
first trip you will not be able to guide
your journey yet we must send you
because our most able guides are aliens
in this white mans world there you
are at home we have sung the songs
and said the sacred prayers for your
journey you will go forth it may
be that you will return with a message
are you ready

  i am

  the medicine men of four tribes cir-
cled me dusting me with pollen my
grandfather took a cup from one of the
main medicine men and held it aloft in
prayer then he came over and offered
it to me his mask-like face betrayed
no emotion but his eyes seemed to smile
courage into mine then returning to
his place he sank again upon the earth

  drink my son

  i tipped up the pottery goblet and
drank the stuff was not too pleasant
but i allowed no reflections of distaste
the fire trail



to cross my face

  now take the ancient peace pipe and
blow the sacred smoke

  i accepted the old red sandstone pipe
from the frail navaho and exhaled the
smoke to the four directions

  now my son stqre at the fire while
you chant with us the prayer of the
fire-trail

  the drums which had begun softly
some time before now arose to a cre-
scendo and the throbbing chant began
lord and master of all the elements
of life from whence all came and into
which everything goes guide my foot-
steps upon the trail-of-fire upon the
pathway of flames do i walk in beauty
upon the pathway of flames do i walk
in knowledge   

  at first i was aware that the fire
had been ceremonially built this
meant that it had probably been lighted
from flints struck into cedar shavings
and carefully nurtured by cedar boughs
placed in a crescent twelve at a time
in groups of four i was aware of the
pleasant odor of burning cedar mingled
with the scent of sage which drifted in
on the desert wind of the dancing
flames and the cool sense of vastness

  then my head began to throb and
the pulse of the drums began to be as
a hammer on my temples   upon the
pathway of flames do i walk in beauty
yes the flames were beautiful-like
swaying orange hands with purple nails
-like expanding veils-like corridors
-strange undulating corridors that
grew and grew    they grew until i
was walking upon their undulating
color until i was but a fragment of
smoke carried high upon the emerald
and violet veils that swept from a vol-
cano higher and higher i was carried
far below me the mountain was belch-
ing forth lava and fire over what ap-
peared to be a teeming jungle above
me the heavens were turning dark and

the stars were shining out with a bril-
liance i had never before known

tt seemed to me that my senses

  were never clearer except for that
of touch and its kindred sensations of
heat and cold i know that my mind
never functioned more clearly for i
knew that i should go to washington
yet i was supremely elated with the
spirit of adventure as i began to leave
the earth for it was quite evident to
me now that i was leaving it further-
more i seemed to be gathering speed
as the earth receded like a dwindling
ball it became also evident to me that
i was retreating from our sun and our
family of planets

  immeasurable space surrounded me
as the sun which had been my day star
retreated to the size of untold thousands
of others ahead of me a giant sun of
tremendous proportions loomed out and
expanded yet it was soon also evident
that the sun was not my destination
but a planet spinning around that sun
then just as quickly as i had gathered
speed i swung around the planet twice
with rapidly reducing rates and at last
began to flutter downward with a lazy
side to side motion like a heavy snow-
flake

  i could not at first decide whether
this was air or water through which i
finally drifted but decided it was at-
mosphere of a heavy variety since there
was no surface difference which one
would have encountered between a
layer of air and that of water yet
movements through this medium were
slow and the denizens seemed to have
a fish-like quality about them with
graceful waving veil-like tails which ap-
parently propelled them as one of
these creatures came toward me i
found myself wondering if i would be
swallowed like a bug on a leaf but ap-
parently the monster did not even see


fantastic adventures

me and lazily turned away

  then came the giant plants with their
magnificent jewel-like flowers the
foliage blended from the palest of
greens to a violet-purple the trees
were of a slender fern type waving
their fronds in the heavy air although
some huge sprawling leathery plants
were also in evidence

  this was planet one in their year


  i looked around in surprise at the
sound of this soft well-cultivated voice
it came from a tall man dressed in a
white toga with the features of an
aristotle

  i am your guide he informed me
with a smile do not fear to talk out
loud we can neither be seen nor
heard

  have they no senses of perception

  yes but not for us we belong to
another cycle let us leave the forest
area i shall show you one of their
cities

  then catching my arm he pointed
toward a clearing

  a flight car is coming in they
leave workers to gather honey from the
flowers and return in an hour or two to
pick them up again these people live
largely on honey

  as he spoke a slight drone rapidly
swelled to a roar and a great shining
cigar-shaped vehicle came to rest out
of it stepped some half-a-dozen crea-
tures who strangely resembled our ideas
of the fairy gauzy garments of ex-
treme delicacy floated from the shoul-
ders of the women giving them an al-
most transparent beauty

  how strange that these people
should so much resemble those of
earth

  yes they do and so does their
destiny however at that point the
resemblance stops these people have
already mastered not only their own

planet but all the planets of their sys-
tem all are well-run gardens for the
people of one

  he made a deprecating gesture

  of course part of their more ad-
vanced condition is due to the fact that
they discovered the value of fuels
earlier in their history and in part it
may be due to the fact that being a more
frail creature upon a larger planet than
man in proportion to his birthplace
their intelligence was more advanced
than mans when they began their con-
quest of their planet but now it is the
year  remember that date it
is the hour of their destiny

xhile i was pondering over the
meaning of these words he beck-
oned me into the airship we entered
and found it a spacious affair the en-
gine room of the ship was in the nose
and was set off from the rest by great
glass panels and many of the creatures
were crowded along these panels to
watch the working of the well-run en-
gines the rest of the salon was
equipped with shining threadlike lounge
swings and hammocks great flowers
of jewel brilliance climbed a lattice-
work i decided that at least a part of
the light which flooded the interior came
from the walls but not a small portion
of it came from the pulsing color of
these magnificent flowers

  as i turned to say something to my
companion i saw that the great sliding
doors were closing and in a moment the
ship was in the air with the forest be-
coming but a greenish blur far below us
we must have left the ground with a
tremendous rush of speed

  it is strange that we havent more
sharply felt the pull of gravity from
such a large planet

  the ship is insulated as it were
with gravity nullifiers and giant internal
springs my guide answered he
the fire trail



walked toward one of the huge windows
and i followed

  this planet was once a heavenly
place the natural balance here was
working splendidly to offset a greater
distance from its greater sun than that
occupied by earth there was a larger
amount of internal heat thus the tem-
perature was not much different from
that of mexico on earth but civiliza-
tions grow upon fuel like the people
of earth these inhabitants first used
their natural vegetable and mineral
fuels nuclear fission came some time
after their mastery of their own planet
and its use was rigidly controlled ra-
diation danger was kept at a minimum
for thousands of years there was no
disastrous releasing here such as would
have come with an atomic war but
look at the beauties of onel

  we were gliding in the heavy bluish
air through which the sun cast fantastic
wavy shadows caught by the fern for-
ests glimpsed now and then as the ship
dropped down lightly to take on or
leave off passengers

  these creatures have never been
carnivorous as i said before they live
largely on the honey of these giant
luminescent flowers the honey is
syphoned into storage tanks along a
part of the hull perhaps that partly
accounts for the fact that they have
never been too warlike-that is up to
now

  they are becoming war-like with
whom 

  but i didnt finish the ship again
zoomed into the sky but this time bare-
ly skimmed over the tops of the lacy
trees

  is something wrong

  no we are about to land at the
first city of one the first city is
theworld capital look ahead and you
will soon see something glittering in
that direction

  yes i do

  those are the massive glass domes
of first city

  why do they build their cities under
glass to preserve the heat

  no to keep out radiation and
they are not glass as we know it on
earth this is a chemical compound
of one radiation has been a growing
nightmare here for many generations
how long is a generation

  it used to be several hundred years
because life was so easy and pleasant
but it has been growing shorter
why

  radiation poisoning

  that statement had the effect of mak-
ing my very stomach do a flip-flop my
thoughts flew back to my own studies
in physics i remembered ernie who
had been on bikini atoll and what he
had told me of radiation poisoning of
how the little fish infected the larger
fish whose death passed the infection
to the algae which in turn infected the
very ship hulls of clean boats   

  stop dreaming we are landing
and you are missing the sights re-
member that you will not pass this way
again

t came to myself with a start and
stared around the space ship had
slipped through a great dome which had
closed over it from the air i imagine
it must have looked like shining lips
opened and swallowed the torpedo-like
space-craft

  as the huge sliding doors of the ship
again slid apart i found myself look-
ing upon immense cavern-like walls
that glowed with a faint green light
these walls in which we found our-
selves as we left the ship were in the
shape of a globe but almost imme-
diately a part of them rolled back re-
vealing a purple and green forest lit
almost entirely internally by the great


fantastic adventures

light-pulsing flowers and now i was
due for a new surprise for the diapha-
nous robes flowing from the shoulders
of what i had supposed to be the women
were in reality wings these creatures
had large wings of the iridescent type
such as are used by the dragon fly of
earth simultaneously i also made
the discovery as one passed close to
me that their bodies were covered with
either a tight-fitting garment or were
covered with minute scales which gave
the impression that their skins had been
dusted in silver dust whose metallic
gleams caught every refraction of the
light-pulsing flowers

  as the stream of people for i still
thought of them as people entered the
forest of flowers fountains of water
sprayed up from all through the forest
and these lovely beings spread their
wings and fluttered through the water
with every evidence of great enjoyment
the sight of them flying turning and
whirling was truly a thing of beauty for
as the flowers pulsed various colors so
the water drops and the bodies of these
beings with their glittering wings all
took on and reflected color until they
seemed like living jewels

  the rain-dance is a ritual with them
one must take it in order to enter a
city the reason is radiation water
is the best methods of removing the
poisons if recently acquired

  must that man ruin everything but
my annoyance was short-lived an-
other question was inserting itself into
my mind

  i suppose the large size of the rain-
drops is due to the small size of the
people on this planet

  right

  and these ferns then are in truth not
as tall as the woolworth building nor
the flowers as large as houses
probably not size is relative
then we are not as large as we are

on earth

  if you had remained the same size
you could not have made the trip to the
planet one and enjoyed the beauty of
first city through the eyes of its in-
habitants again i say size is relative
on earth you have the correct size for
your cycle but you are being given a
glimpse of another cycle through the
eyes of its dominating civilization

  almost nostalgically i remembered
wassington the manner in which the
indian accent distorts that word to
my surprise my guide answered my
thoughts

  you are being given a message
concentrate on what you see and hear
and smell for the time grows short and
you shall not pass this way again nor
indeed shall any man for this is the
year 

  his words had recalled to my mind
another strange fact it is true i could
hear the splashing water the hum of
wings and many voices whose drone
was not unlike the mighty notes of an
organ i could smell the damp smell
of forest plants and the lighter perfume
of flowers but i could not feel touch of
the water again my guide answered
these unspoken thoughts

  as you have been taught by the
elders of the indian people there are
only four senses sight hearing smell
and that fourth which some men call
intuition these are the senses of the
spirit the others are the senses of the
body

  as he spoke we moved rapidly
through the great forest of the splash-
ing fountains and light-pulsing flowers
to see other great doors ahead slide
back through these doors a golden
light poured in and almost immediately
the fountains died down the symphony
of a thousand voices was hushed and
the shining swarm flew toward the open-
ing as we joined them my guide said
the fire trail



  for the purposes of our visit we
have been given an understanding of
the strange language of one a debate
has been going on for many days the
arguments of both sides have been car-
ried by television to all parts of one
and even to the colonies on their other
planets we are to come in for the
finish space ships are bringing similar
throngs from all the forests for all work
is now being suspended and in a mo-
ment the flower-forests of the sixteen
entrances to first city will be filled
with the returning throngs

tvtaking our way through the
heavy air as did the others all
about us on their gauze-like wings of
dusted silver now taking on the golden
glow of the great domes we circled over
the city the buildings were massive
with hundreds of openings they
seemed to be made of mother-of-pearl
or some other opalescent material that
caught and reflected the golden glow of
the great domes the street-like can-
yons between the buildings glowed with
their own light-pulsing flowers and oc-
casional fountains

  one great central structure towering
over the others was apparently the
destination of the throngs with them
we reached one of the openings and
walked along a glowing corridor this
grotto or series of grottoes gleamed like
a blue neon sign and yet in a way i
was reminded of the corridors leading
to the football stadium on the campus
i felt an air of expectancy yet i cannot
say that it was entirely a pleasant ex-
pectancy there seemed to be a haunt-
ing dread in the back of the minds of
these people talk had died down to a
minimum murmur then we came into
the amphitheatre of one

  earth holds no possible comparison
to its immensity it must have held a
million souls one could barely see the

stage in the distance as we took our
seats with the others for many mo-
ments we waited while yet other thou-
sands took their places from some-
where music was playing tinkling
notes filled its long sweeping phrases
like the splash of the fountains of which
the people of one seemed to be so fond
phrases of the symphonic music i
noted were accompanied by color
changes in the immense dome and faint-
er whiffs of perfume did the sym-
phonies of one coordinate the pleasures
of the senses

  but the music was fading and the
hum of voices was dying to an expectant
hush the colors which had been
changing in the overhead dome began
to die down and what i had taken for
gigantic curtains above the tiny plat-
form in the distance began to glow with
the image of a speaker

  people of one this day seventy-
two of the year fifty thousand and
fifty is the moment of destiny for
days we have debated the issues before
us we know that in the early days of
nuclear fission when we were experi-
menting with the heaviest atoms much
radiation was released we also know
that subsequent generations have had
to limit space travel because of the
heavy radiation trails and even go back
to more primitive fuels for our own
planets use now the sins of our an-
cestors are coming upon us all of us
even in our generation have noted the
increasing heat of one yet the other
planets of our system with whom we
have friendly intercourse and trade are
just not suitable for our continuing
existence we have all known for some
time now that we must someday leave
one our daily lives have become a
nightmare of heavy infection we have
not gone unscathed either in a minor
way we are all infected even now with
the death of one


fantastic adventures

  our hope has been to get to another
planet where our least infected children
could survive our space fleet feels
justified in recommending planet x
of sun  the trouble is that this
planet is infested with a civilized form
of life which has the gunpowder weapon
that it uses upon its own kind to at-
tempt to reason with such individuals
would be absurd to use the fission of
the heavy atom would be equally absurd
because we would immediately sow the
seeds of radiation poison which is all
we are attempting to escape from here

  whether the people of one who
have thus far made their way without
the destruction which more savage
creatures call war is justified in now
taking a planet by force is the ques-
tion the people have voted for war

a t this point a tremendous demon-
stration of stomping and wing-
flapping was drowning out the speaker
the face faded from the screen and
another took its place

  that is not the question because
i do not believe in war i have been ac-
cused of having sympathies with these
miserable creatures of planet x who
kill their own kind obviously they are
still in a savage stage of evolution
whether they would ever develop a
civilization comparable to one if al-
lowed to go their way without interfer-
ence is a moot question but i do
object to this new weapon developed by
the military  this weapon uses for its
fuel the tremendous force of the ex-
ploding hydrogen atom i object to this
because it is dangerous-even more
dangerous than uranium radiation

  again the first face took the screen

  my opponent has brought up the
question of the new weapon merely as a
means of diverting the thoughts of the
people from this new war if we do not
take this planet then where can we go

to still more distant uncharted sys-
tems we need living space and we
need it immediately look at the
freaks developing on one among the
animals look at the new heat fissures
appearing almost daily look at the
new volcanoes when the radium was
first discovered we did not know about
these deadly radiations we did not
know that these forces had to disinte-
grate before the planet could become
habitable we did not realize that we
had unleashed a monster which would
devour us since then it is true that
our experiments have become more and
more controlled we realize now that
the core of our planet has become
heavier through thousands of years of
atomic disintegration and that in spite
of all our knowledge we cannot stop
the chain of fate we must have the
new weapon for the war then that war
will be most devastating but it will be
over in a hurry and the planet becomes
ours

  again the slim face of the second
speaker the eyes had almost a
haunted look of fear

  when i plead for you to think twice
about this new weapon i am not trying
to divert your thoughts from war i am
pleading for our planet do you realize
what makes a sun burn it is atomic
disintegration and now with the hy-
drogen atom we are stepping forth into
a new field water is composed of hy-
drogen so is our atmosphere shall
we set fire to it and if we do can we
stop it when we wish

  a roar booed him down and i realized
that he was pleading a lost cause
again he tried to speak but a roar of
jeers drowned him out then the first
face came back with the light of victory
in his eyes

  i knew that you were too practical
to listen to this prophet now for the
promised experiment none of you
the fire trail



watching me shall ever forget this mo-
ment our civilization has reached a
new peak in power with this new and
cheap fuel we can reach more distant
constellations in one-half the time now
required we shall explore for more
and more planets

  for a second the opponent came
back

  and who is to say that other civiliza-
tions have not also sought this power
and found death remember that
all begins and ends in fire then in
desperation he pleaded i beg of you-
do not do this thing we still have a
few years    remember that our
greatest leader once said that two atoms
should be sacred from experimenta-
tion-hydrogen and oxygen

  in the jeers which drowned out his
voice i heard only those fateful words
all begins and ends in fire 

  a tense hush fell now over the as-
sembly the opposition had said all it
could and failed the long-awaited ex-
periment was about to take place a
general lowering the lights added to the
sense of expectancy i knew that these
people of one had shouted down the
voice of reason because they had so
passionately wanted to believe the first
speaker yet the second really had them
worried no one could say for certain
just how this experiment would turn
out perhaps this half-cupful of water
would drive a liner across the widest
ocean but what was there to prevent
it from spilling over and exploding that
ocean i realized that in a way this
choice was forced on them by their own
desperation they saw the cancerous
spread of radiation poisoning with its
heating effect-those things when pro-
duced by nature had to die out before a
globe could become habitable

  my thoughts were interrupted by
several men on the screen bending over
what seemed to be a table and then it

happened

   terrific blinding white light on
the platform etched for the space
of a second on the screen above and
for eternity on my mind the horror in
the half-dozen faces of the men making
the experiment before they disinte-
grated into light

  for the space of another second that
gigantic amphitheatre rocked with the
screams of the doomed as the explo-
sion on the altar of science spread with
lightning swiftness in all directions
through the air then the swarming
mass of living creatures were seared to
powder as the vast domes crackled and
burned in the swiftly mounting terror

  my companion and i seemed to be
borne aloft like a particle of smoke on
the conflagration which spread with un-
believable swiftness it was as if the
planet was a picture soaked in gasoline
to which some one had touched a match
the forests writhed like souls in agony
while between the burning trees long
cracks appeared in the crust through
which poured the bubbling red plan-
etary blood of lava then even these
were blotted out in light as the flames
became higher and hotter and whiter
i knew that they must have become
hotter with the heat of a new-born sun
although i could not feel them

  nor could i even see them so well for
i was speeding away with unbelievable
rapidity the planet one which had
become a sun still circled its greater
day star and as i watched its magni-
ficent brilliance i heard my companion
say

  that was the year  on the
planet one but as for earth it was
before-long millenniums before-the
memory of man or beast

  then they were not speaking of
earth

  no earth would never have been


fantastic adventures

available for the people of one it was
not large enough we are now crossing
over from the long cycle of the past-
that past which might become the fu-
ture

 but one where is the planet
one i asked as i watched its fading
brilliance becoming smaller and smaller
with the increasing distance yet i
could not take my eyes from its white
beauty and its rainbow corona

  know you not of a small sun circling
a larger neighbor know you not of a
small sun with a heavy core such as
might be expected from millenniums of
atom-stripping

  of course sirius and its dwarf com-
panion

  from the distance i heard chanting
voices

  upon the pathway of flames do i
walk in beauty upon the pathway of
flames do i walk in knowledge

  perhaps i still had time to ask one
more question

  will planet one ever again become
habitable

  through the chanting and the tom-
tom i heard the voice of my guide as

if from an ever-increasing distance
there are some things which even i
do not know

  then the pin-prick brilliance of one
became lost in the purple-tipped
carmine of flame corridors upon whose
smoke-veils i was lowered   

  upon the pathway of flames do i
walk in knowledge

  and i found myself sitting upon the
sand-painting while medicine men were
sprinkling pollen upon my skin my
first words must have sounded very in-
dian for i merely stated

  i have returned

  yet later when i told them my story
they did not betray the great disap-
pointment which i know they must
have shared the only comment given
by my grandfather was pronounced
after due deliberation

  we sent you out my son as a white
man as a white man have you re-
turned your message is not for us it
is for that world of yours where you
walk with such confidence it is for
white man go forth my son and de-
liver to that world your message

the end

an explanation of the fire trail

t tou have just finished reading a
y true story we obtained this
account of an actual fire trail
ceremony which took place this summer
in new mexico from our good friend l
taylor hansen who is a good friend of
the navaho he considered the story
interesting material for us

  as we understand it the ceremony is
an ancient one and was attended by
several different tribes the navaho the
pueblos hopi and even a yee-hat
from alaska the man selected to
travel the fire trail was to ask an answer
to the problem of what to do about the
threatened loss of lands of crops of

food and of other rights due to several
scientific and governmental projects in
the area

  when oge make returned from his
mystic adventure he revealed that his
guide had not taken him on a trip to
washington to the great white fa-
thers to get the answer to their ques-
tion and to try to implant a correction
in the minds of the white fathers but
had instead taken him on an incredibly
fantastic trip into space and into the
far past to a world circling sirius
there he was given the message you
have just read

  your editors know it is true
plight of the navaho

during july and august of
 the navaho indians in
new mexico were deprived of
their means of livelihood by a series of
unavoidable catastrophes and face ex-
treme privation and hardship and per-
haps even starvation this winter the
government order which contributed to
this condition was for the slaughter of
the herds of sheep which form the
navahos sole support the navaho
nation up to now has been entirely
self-sustaining from its sheep-raising
rug-weaving and silverwork without
sheep they cannot obtain wool for rug-
weaving they cannot sell sheep to ob-
tain money for purchasing silver pro-
viding meat for food this winter will be
impossible

  perhaps it has been necessary to
slaughter the sheep to conserve grazing
lands from destruction as has been sug-
gested or perhaps it is true that the
action became necessary to prevent con-
tamination among both indians and
whites because of a diseased condition
directly attributable to the explosion of
the first atom bomb in the neighbor-
hood the effects of which are still being
felt along those lines we recently pub-
lished a novel by rog phillips called
so shall ye reap which suggests a
possible effect from the bombs already
detonated and pointing to a disastrous
effect if more are detonated certainly
further experiments to obtain positive
information as to just what effects the
explosion of atom bombs have on our
atmosphere soil climate etc should be
carried out before any further work is
done along destructive knes however
that is another matter already being
very hotly argued by leading scientists
right now the plight of the navaho

people is our concern

  we suggest two courses of action to
be taken by our readers in a purely
humanitarian way first please
send packages of non-per-
ishable food to the navaho
immediately and continue
to do so throughout the
coming winter to help this
honorable indian nations
people through a crisis in
their history second adopt
an indian child and pledge yourself to
support that child through the winter
really be a great white father
either of these things can be done by
addressing the following persons

  chief zhealy tso chinle district 
navaho reservation new mexico

  clyde lyzer window rock navaho
reservation new mexico

 howard gorman window rock
navaho reservation new mexico

  roger davis window rock navaho
reservation new mexico

  address your food packages to any
one of these men who will see that the
packages reach those in most immedi-
ate need of help if you care to adopt
an indian boy or girl for the winter
write to these four men who will act
as intermediary or place you in direct
contact with the child or childs family
who will benefit by your assistance

  let us as americans with a heart
show the navaho that we do not intend
to let hardship come to them no matter
what the reasons are for what has hap-
pened your editor for one has adopt-
ed the first navaho child and hereby
pledges that childs support through the
coming winter why dont you do the
same-raymond a palmer

fantastic adventures

the town of toms landing at
the edge of the big cypress
swamp in the florida ever-
glades looked like the thing it needed
most on earth was a good hurricane to
blow it to hell and gone off the planet
mark redding stood on the dilapidated
board-walk that ran down one side of
the dirt road that served as a street and
looked at the nine wooden shacks that
made up the residences in this com-
munity the only living creatures in
sight were a scattering of scrawny
chickens visible under the house across
the street a lean hound dog that looked
like he wished an alligator would catch
him and save him the trouble of starving
to death and a razorback hog redding
turned to look at the store it was a
single wooden building and it was ready
to fall apart its back end rested on
piles driven into the water the launch
that had brought him here across the
swamps was tied up at the back end of
the store and its garrulous owner was
inside the building

the faded sign on the joint said
jenkins store
groceries fishing tackle dry goods
and snuff
a second smaller sign hung under the
first one the small sign said

          u s postoffice
well this is it he thought this is the
postoffice this is the place im look-
ing for he pushed open the door of
the store

  as he entered the front door the
owner of the launch that had brought
him here came in through the back
door

  hi zack hi ned howre you
boys the launch operator sang out
to two men in the back of the store
seen any more swamp ghosts lately
the owner of the launch was kid-
ding he got a short answer for his
efforts

  shut yer mouth you danged fool
one of the two men told him theres
some things in these swamps that peo-
ple who got any sense dont talk
about

  redding stepped into the room at
the sound of his footsteps the two men
looked up quickly their unshaven
faces turned instantly blank when they
saw a stranger the behavior pattern
of the swamps is the same as the hills
keep quiet when a stranger comes
around

  the launchman recognized redding
hi he called out heres my pass-
enger i want you to meet a couple of
the boys this is zack and this is ned
theyre alligator hunters that is-
he winked broadly at redding -
they hunt gators exceptin when the
ghosts run em out of the swamp

  hello redding said the two men
nodded said nothing one of them
zack glanced sideways at the launch-
man if looks could have killed the
launch tied up at the back of the store
would have been in need of a new
owner

  the launchman was determined to
have his joke theyre a little sensi-
tive about ghosts he said winking
again at redding but theyre good
fellers and if the man youre looking for
is anywhere around these parts theyll
be able to help you out know every
hole and gator hideout in these swamps
the boys do well i gotta get that stuff
unloaded cant stay here and talk all
day

grinning the launch owner hus-
tied into the back room of the
store

  the two men eyed redding their
gaze went over his lean bronzed face
took in the sport jacket he was wearing
noted his slacks his sport shoes they
looked a long time at the beaten brown
the isle of doom



canvas bag he was carrying then
zacks eyes came back to the slack
coat searched for the bulge under the
arm that would mean this stranger was
carrying a gun

  there was no bulge under the arm
the gun was in the canvas bag

  you lookin for somebody zack
said at last

  yes redding answered

 who

  the postmaster

  oh

  either of you in charge of the post-
office

  nope zack said ab jenkins is
the man you want hes in back check-
in groceries

  ill wait for him redding said
while he waited he looked around the
store the postoffice occupied a small
corner of the room the rest of the store
was devoted to an amazing conglomera-
tion of goods there were cheap
shoes a barrel of salt pork fish nets
gig heads snuff twists of chewing to-
bacco bolts of calico galvanized iron
buckets pencils pens tablets of writing
paper blue denim overalls blue work
shirts and other items essential to the
trappers and fishermen who lived in the
swamp

  one showcase fascinated redding
it contained a collection of fish hooks
of various sizes yellow candy made to
resemble peanuts boxes of snuff sacks
of smoking tobacco a box of cheap
cigars shoe laces pocket knives-and
an expensive miniature camera with a
price of  scrawled on the tag at-
tached to it

  the camera had an imported f 
lens a light meter and range finder
were mounted on the sides

  a camera like this would cost 
in new york second-hand it could
easily cost  it was for sale in
this store for 

  looking at the camera something in-
side redding began to turn cold he
knew what it meant to be cold he had
been cold on the anzio beachhead he
had been cold in southern france he
had been cold in front of the siegfried
line when an  was zeroed in on his
platoon all during the war-and he
had seen it all-he had been cold it
was the same kind of coldness he felt
now

  a step sounded behind the counter
something i can do for you a heavy
voice said redding looked up

  ab jenkins the postmaster and store
owner was a big man a two days
growth of tobacco stained whiskers
covered his face he spat on the floor
behind the counter

  id like to look at this camera if its
for sale

  for a second jenkins hesitated his
heavy eyes studied this customer then
he shrugged took the camera out of
the showcase everything in heres
for sale

  redding took the camera turned it
over and over studied the lens and the
exposure meter he didnt give two
hoots in georgia about the lens and the
meter he wanted to see if there were
two initials scratched inside the case
but he didnt want to be in a hurry
about looking

  ill buy it he said at last he took
a five dollar bill out of his wallet while
jenkins was putting the bill into the
money drawer redding opened the
camera looked inside it

gcratched on the black enamel
on the inside of the box were the
initials j r

  they stood for jim redding mark
reddings brother

  where did you get this camera
redding asked

  a gator hunter found it on an island


fantastic adventures

out in the swamp jenkins answered
he owed me a bill and i took the cam-
era as part payment

  i see redding answered he
studied jenkins the store owners face
was impassive and revealed nothing
he might be lying he might be telling
the truth or his story of how he had
obtained the camera might be part lie
and part truth redding had no way
of knowing

  anything else i can do for you
jenkins asked

  yes youre postmaster arent
you

  a look of irritation crossed the store-
keepers face you aint another
danged inspector are you he de-
manded

  redding grinned no im look-
ing for some information on a man who
mailed a letter from this postoffice on
december  

  huh the request surprised
startled jenkins a man who mailed
a letter here in  mister thats
five years ago 

  i know it is the man is my brother
i had a letter from him in december
 and i havent heard from him
since i came down here to look for
him heres the letter

  redding took a big envelope from
his inside coat pocket opened it re-
moved a smaller envelope the post-
mark toms landing florida decem-
ber   was faded but still visible
on the small envelope redding laid
the letter on the counter

  in the back of the room the two alli-
gator hunters suddenly stopped talk-
ing

  jenkins looked at the letter but made
no move to touch it you waited five
years to come lookin for your brother
he said the tone of his voice was an
accusation

  i was in the army redding said

bitterness crept into his voice they
dont give you time off from the army
to go looking for missing brothers af-
ter i was discharged i had to spend
some time looking after my business i
got here as quickly as i could

  jenkins listened in silence he looked
at the letter found courage to pick it
up he turned it around in his fingers
studied the postmark and the address

  i wouldnt have to see the man who
mailed this letter he said he might
have come in here and dropped it in the
box without my seeing him or he
might have gave it to someone else to
mail and never came in here at all
then you dont remember my
brother being in here

  i sure dont jenkins said flatly
his gaze went regretfully to the camera
tucked under reddings arm that
camera made him a liar and he knew it
but he obviously intended to stick to
his story

  he was a member of a scientific ex-
pedition redding continued there
were two other men with him one of
them roger nash financed the trip
did you ever hear of him

  jenkins shook his head

  no redding said the third
man was sidney gulick did you ever
hear of him

  sudden rage knotted jenkins face
i never heard of any of them he
shouted and if you want my advice
youll go back where you came from
and stop asking these damned fool
questions i aint got any more time
to talk to you

  he stalked out of sight into the back
room of the store redding let him go
if jenkins wouldnt talk well there
were other people in the town of toms
landing he turned to question the
two alligator hunters

  the cane chairs where they had been
sitting were vacant the alligator
the isle of doom



hunters had cleared out the side door
redding went to the door and looked
out he didnt see them he saw
something else

  drifting in across the swamp its mo-
tor throbbing as it headed for a landing
in the vacant lot beside the store was a
helicopter coming up the bayou chan-
nel was a powerful cabin cruiser

  a ten-year old youngster attracted
by the sound of the copters motor
dashed out of a house across the street
he looked at the plane then at the
launch

  gulick he yelled back to someone
still inside the house gulick is com-
ing

  running as fast as his skinny legs
would carry him he dived into the
horseweeds across the street and disap-
peared

  the helicopter slid down to a land-
ing in the vacant lot almost before
the vanes had stopped turning redding
was at the cabin door he could see
the pilot inside the door opened

  are you sidney gulick- he be-
gan then stopped as he realized his
mistake wearing a leather helmet the
pilot had looked like a man as she
got out of the plane he saw she was an
uncommonly attractive girl

  no the girl answered she looked
curiously at redding im gerry
nash mr gulick is in the launch if
you will wait he will be here

  she walked across the lot and entered
the side door of the store

  the launch pulled up at the little
landing behind the store a heavy-set
man clad in gray flannel trousers
climbed out of it

  redding waited

chapter ii

id edding jim redding hm
gulick pressed thick lips into a

line as thin as the edge of a knife his
gaze went out across the swamp across
the cane and the occasional cypress
trees focused on a buzzard wheeling on
lazy wings in the bright blue sky some-
thing about the carrion bird seemed to
fascinate him he did not look at his
questioner you are mark redding
you say jim redding was your
brother you say

  yes redding answered the way
gulick kept repeating you say
angered him it sounded like gulick
was trying to make him out a liar he
was with you and nash on an expedi-
tion that nash financed to explore the
swamp at least thats what he wrote
me

  nash oh yes nash nash was
interested in investigating certain forms
of living creatures found in the swamp
he had the theory that life originally
emerged in swamps such as this millions
of years ago he thought the process
might be continuing still that some-
where in the swamps the processes of
creation might be working even now
and that careful investigation might re-
veal new life forms emerging ha hm
youre scarcely interested in that how-
ever jim redding you say let me
think what was the name of that
young fellow-

  his eyes were still on the buzzard
redding waited patiently a step
sounded behind him it was the girl
pilot of the helicopter gulick greeted
her effusively

  gerry my dear youre looking
fine fine indeed he slipped an arm
around her kissed her with every sign
of affection she accepted the kiss but
did not respond

  hello sid she said have a nice
trip

  very satisfactory trip

  ready to go

  yes my dear yes indeed just as


fantastic adventures

soon as you get the-ah-eggbeater
started im ready opening the door
of the plane he stood aside for her to
enter

  you havent answered my ques-
tion redding spoke

 your question for a moment
gulick looked blank oh yes you
must excuse me for neglecting you im
a little absent-minded youre looking
for-what was the name now jim
redding ah yes my dear he spoke
to the girl do you remember anybody
by the name of jim redding who was
with us in  i cant seem to place
the name

  the girl had one foot on the step that
led to the cabin of the helicopter she
seemed to freeze in place the knuckles
on the hand that grasped the handhold
turned white slowly she took her foot
from the step turned to redding

  her face was paper white her eyes
as blue as the sky overhead were alive
with sudden fear

  when she spoke her voice was calm

  redding at the moment i dont
seem to recall any one by that name
was he a friend of yours

  my brother

  oh fear deepened in the eyes

  ive got it gulick spoke suddenly
he snapped his fingers redding was
with us before the war he left us to
enter service i remember him now in
january i think it was of  he
left us to go into the army volunteered
for the air forces fine boy mighty
fine boy ive often wondered what
happened to him you havent heard
a word from him you say too bad
so many fine young fellows-

  he went into the army- redding
exploded then caught himself this
was neither the time nor the place to
reveal that jim redding had volun-
teered for service on two separate oc-
casions and had been turned down

both times because of a punctured ear-
drum and a heart murmur whatever
had happened to him he hadnt entered
the army no doctor on earth would
ever have passed him for service

  sorry i cant help you any more
gulick said helping the girl into the
copter sorry please stand back
now the vanes are rather dangerous
whats this something for me ah
thank you jenkins

rthe storekeeper had come running
up to the ship he handed an en-
velope to gulick the latter glanced
at it thrust it into his pocket without
opening it

  the ships motor roared vanes
spinning madly the eggbeater dragged
itself into the air moved slowly out
across the swamp then went straight
as an arrow toward its unknown desti-
nation

  i thought you said you didnt know
gulick redding said

  gulick did you ask me about
gulick i didnt understand you
jenkins turned and walked back into
his store he slammed the door behind
him

  a wind tangy with the odor of stag-
nant water and spanish moss and de-
cay moved across the swamp some-
where in that deep fastness of water
and cane and tangled jungle growth a
bull alligator bellowed softly the buz-
zard that gulick had watched was
wheeling in smaller circles now and was
nearer the ground a second buzzard
had joined the first one

  redding his face tense with baffled
anger stared in the direction in which
the helicopter had vanished gulick
had lied to him jenkins had lied to
him why the girl pilot had showed
sudden fear at his questions what was
she afraid of for that matter what
was jenkins and the two alligator hunt-
the isle of doom



ers afraid of

  he tried to remember what his
brother had told him about sidney
gulick it hadnt been much gulick
was a biochemist employed by nash
a sort of a hired hand who did routine
laboratory analyses nash had been the
important member of the expedition
jim redding had joined jims letters
had been full of nash redding had
gotten the picture of a benevolent
wealthy old scientist eccentric but lov-
able who poked around in swamps
looking for the origin of life if any-
body could give him information about
his brother nash would be the man
where could he find nash he was so
busy wondering where he could find the
scientist that he didnt hear the man
scream

  he did hear the sound of running
feet he turned searching for the ori-
gin of the sound zack the alligator
hunter was running down the main
street of toms landing redding had
seen men run with machine gun bullets
zipping around them he had seen the
supermen run from sherman tanks-
and that was really some running-but
he had never seen a man run any harder
than this alligator hunter zacks
tongue was hanging out his face was
contorted as he fought for breath he
was covering more than ten feet at a
single stride and his feet were tearing
up the sandy soil

  what the devil oh oh-

  floating through the air behind
zack keeping pace with him but ap-
parently not able to overtake him was
a globe of shining mist the size of a
basketball it was mist and yet it
wasnt mist it looked like a ball made
up of thousands of strands taken from
spider webs each single strand covered
with microscopic globules of dew that
glittered in the sunlight

  zack saw redding willo he

screamed run you fool

  as he screamed the warning he
tripped and fell headlong

  the misty globe dived toward him

  the hunter rolled frantically saw it
hanging in the air over him screamed
again redding had the dazed impres-
sion that the doors of several houses
had opened and as hastily slammed
again as the people in them looked out
to see what the shouting was about
one look was all they needed to slam
and bolt the doors no one came out
to help the sound of slamming win-
dows rattled the air redding raced
toward the fallen man

  zack seemed to be doing a dozen dif-
ferent things at once he was trying to
get to his feet he was trying to kick
at the ball of mist he was trying to slap
at it at the same time the ball was
following him like a hound snapping at
a cornered rabbit

  redding vehemently wished for the
gun in his bag lacking the pistol he
slapped at the ball

  a jolt of icy numbness seared all feel-
ing from his arm

ttissing like a frightened snake
the ball spun upward it had no
eyes but it looked at redding and red-
ding knew it was looking at him when
he slapped it it had seemed to melt
away from his hand to bounce like an
extremely spongy rubber ball except
for the numbing shock to his hand he
was not certain he had touched it

  it hung in the air regarding him
redding stared at it he didnt know
what to do next

  zack scrambled to his feet

  run he hissed follow me

  he dived headlong toward the near-
est shack redding learned later the
shack belonged to the hunter now it
merely seemed the nearest place of
refuge he followed the hunter the


fantastic adventures

shining ball of dancing mist darted
after them

  zack kicked the door open scrambled
inside redding was right behind him
the hunter slammed the door it was
a one-room shack with a ragged bed in
one corner a cookstove in the other a
table and several chairs between there
were two windows zack slammed them
shut his tortuous breathing was loud
in the room outside the door was a
hissing sound that resembled high pres-
sure steam escaping from a small jet

  what was that thing redding de-
manded

  willo the hunter gasped we-
we were dead monkeys or i was

  what the hell is a willo

  zack shook his head they come
out of the swamp thats all i know
you see em sometimes at night first
time i ever saw one in the daytime
first time i ever saw one here in town
come here and look he pointed out
the window

  redding looked out through the dirty
glass the willo was hanging in the air
ten feet above the ground it seemed to
be resting the microscopic points that
looked like dew glittered along the
strands of spider web that formed its
body

  were safe here they cant come
through glass or through walls watch  

  a lean razorback hog ambled be-
tween the two houses the ball of mist
tensed when the pig came into sight
like a panther it seemed to be gather-
ing itself to spring it darted down-
ward

  the hog didnt see it coming and
probably would have paid no attention
if it had seen the incredible creature in
the air above it the ball of mist settled
gently on the animal the hog stopped
dead still something had happened to
it it didnt know what nose down
ears still four feet firmly planted on

the ground it stood without moving
either it did not know what was hap-
pening or it was paralyzed the ball
of mist seemed to sink partly into the
pig slowly the hogs four feet spread
out the leg muscles seemed to relax
gradually the hog toppled over did
not move

  two three four minutes passed the
ball of mist seemed to feed on the pig
then it floated free moving with re-
newed energy it darted into the air
passed above the tree tops and was
gone

  a dead hog lay in the yard

  the fifteen or twenty inhabitants of
the town of toms landing huddled in
their houses knowing that death had
walked among them redding went
slowly out into the yard examined the
hog there was not a mark on its body
for all he could see the hog had just
laid down and died if he hadnt seen
the tragedy happen he would have
sworn it hadnt couldnt happen but
the hog was dead

  that would have been me if i
hadnt seen it coming zack spoke he
looked out across the swamp his face
was gray with fear

chapter iii

lae afternoon came slowly over
the swamp somewhere off behind
the house a catbird trilled sleepily the
bull alligator was still mumbling mo-
rosely to himself off in the fastnesses
of water and weeds

  nope zack said for the fifth or
sixth time you saved my worthless
carcass and i thank you kindly for it
but i aint takin you out in that swamp
to look for anybody not for a million
dollars you can stay here in my shack
as long as you like ill dig up vittles
for you and ill find some corn to go
along with em you can have my boat
the isle of doom



or my gun or anything else ive got
but i aint takin you out to gulicks
island or anywheres near it

  the hunter wiped the mouth of the
jug tilted it across his arm let the
liquor flow down his throat he handed
the jug to redding there was corn
whiskey in the jug redding drank
slowly

  why not he asked

  you helped me drag that hawg off
didnt you the hunter answered
then you know why not

  is that the only reason

  aint that enough reason

  but there may not be any more of
those things and anyhow we could out-
run them you said yourself it was
possible to outrun them that they
couldnt fly very fast

  not out there you cant outrun em
and if there is only one thats too
many

  okay okay redding agreed do
you know anything else about my
brother

  only what i told you he was in
here two or three times with gulick and
nash after the war started i never
saw him again i aint seen nash in a
couple of years

  how do you think jenkins got his
camera redding questioned

  mark i dont know that camera
was in the showcase for a long time i
havent the foggiest notion where he
got it jenkins and gulick have always
been pretty thick maybe gulick gave
it to him

  the hunter was willing to talk the
fact that redding had saved his hide
had opened his mouth he just didnt
know any more jenkins might be able
to tell him something but jenkins
wasnt talking gulick might know
something but he wasnt talking either
that left nash if the scientist could
be found

  i guess ill have to find the way my-
self redding decided

  you can go if you want to zack
said a little sullenly but if i was you
id go in the other direction thats
what im goin to do as soon as i can
get out of here theres plenty of other
places where i can hunt gators besides
toms landing hey whats that
a far-off drone was audible inside
the shack redding went to the window
and looked out the helicopter was
dropping down for another landing be-
side jenkins store the girl was at the
controls again she brought the un-
gainly ship to a perfect landing stopped
the vanes went into the store redding
and the hunter watched her

  id like to know where she fits into
this picture redding said

  zack shook his head i wouldnt
know this swamp is thick with
mysteries and shes just another one
that i cant figure out

  a few minutes later redding saw the
girl come out of the store she came
down the street into the yard knocked
on the front door- zack opened it

  jenkins said i could find mr red-
ding here could i speak to him
certainly redding answered for
himself what can i do for you
mr gulick sent me back for you
the girl answered he remembered
that your brother forgot some personal
belongings at the island when he left
mr gulick thought you might like to
have them

  redding took a deep breath while he
tried to grasp the meaning of this new
turn of events gulick had sent his
helicopter back for him before he
could answer zack was speaking

  dont you do it mark the hunter
said dont you go near that island
whatever your brother left there leave
it where it is you dont need it bad
enough to go after it let em bring


fantastic adventures

it in here let em bring it to you dont
you go after it

  nonsense redding answered he
turned to the girl ill be glad to go
wait until i get my bag

ignoring the hunters frightened
warning he picked up his bag fol-
lowed the girl out to the ship she
paused at the cabin door

  your friend back there gave you
some good advice she said do you
want to take it

  redding stared at her in blank aston-
ishment slowly he shook his head

  okay get in she said her voice
was bright and hard without the slight-
est trace of emotion in it only after
the ship was in the air did he see the
tears running down her cheeks

  mark redding did not know much
about girls he had been in the army
so long he scarcely remembered that
women existed the tears made him
realize that this girl had been putting
up a front she had been pretending
to be brave and competent to be strong
and fearless when underneath she was
just an extremely frightened little girl

  can i do something to help he
asked gently

  she shot a startled glance at him
out of the corner of her eyes he got
the impression that maybe this was the
first time in her life anybody had of-
fered to help her

  you could have stayed back there
at toms landing she answered
better still you could have gone back
north that would have been the sen-
sible thing to do because you cant do
anything to help down here all you
can do is get yourself- she hesitated
changed her mind about what she was
going to say

  killed redding supplied all i
can do is get myself killed is that
what you were about to say

  yes she bluntly answered
redding chuckled thanks for the
warning he said thirty minutes
after i arrived in toms landing i
realized i had come to a fine place to
get myself killed is that what hap-
pened to my brother

  like bullets out of a gun he shot the
words at her in his mind was the grim
suspicion that this girl knew more than
she was telling he hoped to startle
information out of her

  it worked

  yes she said no no no she
gasped a split second later i didnt
mean that i dont know-

  i heard you the first time red-
ding answered he leaned back in his
seat stared from unseeing eyes at the
swampy jungle below the slowly moving
ship so he had it jim was dead the
news did not exactly surprise him he
had suspected as much all along but
the confirmation of what had been only
suspicions tightened a cold knot around
his heart his brother was dead

  how did he die

  ii j

  was he murdered

 that-

  who did it

 but-

  did gulick do it

  i never-

  did nash kill him

  nash surprise showed through
the misery on her face mr redding
dont you know my name

  no i dont

  im geraldine nash roger nash is
my father he didnt kill your brother
dont you say he did dont you dare
say it dont you even think it

tth redding gulped so this girl
was the daughter of roger nash
im sorry he fumbled for words
please forgive me miss nash i
the isle of doom



didnt have any idea that nash was
your father all i knew was that you
were here and that you obviously knew
something you wouldnt tell im sorry
for the third degree technique but i
had to know

  its all right she dabbed at her
cheeks with a tiny handkerchief now
that you know you-cant help any-
do you want me to turn around and take
you back to toms landing
what

  ill take you back no one will ever
know the difference ill say you had
already gone

  thanks

  her face lightened you mean i can
take you back

  yes redding answered you can
take me back when i know how my
brother died do you want to tell me
i-i cant-

  you mean you wont he chal-
lenged

  no it isnt that she flared i
cant there are good reasons why i
cant talk to you or to anyone else ive
already told you too much

  oh perhaps the sheriff or the state
police or whoever the local authorities
are in this area would be able to find
out for me

  thats why youre here now the
girl answered to keep you from go-
ing to the authorities the note jen-
kins gave gulick said you had bought
your brothers camera and knew too
much if you hadnt bought that cam-
era you wouldnt have been able to
prove anything and you wouldnt have
been bothered dont you realize mr
redding that im taking you back to
the island to keep you from taking that
camera and your story to the authori-
ties now do you want to go on or do
you want me to turn back with you
in a dozen ways she had tried to
warn him redding knew she was try-

ing to help him she was trying to save
his neck he shrewdly suspected she
was risking her own life in trying to
help him he remembered the note
jenkins had given gulick the latter
had thrust it into his pocket without
reading it later when he read it he
had sent this girl back for redding
when jenkins had sold him the camera
he hadnt known who the purchaser
was the storekeeper must have realized
too late that redding had recognized
the camera he had promptly given
this information to gulick and gul-
ick had acted

  a hundred warning impulses told
redding he ought to do what miss nash
suggested he ought to turn back out
there in the swamp was danger up
ahead of them on the mysterious island
that was their destination was danger
if he went ahead his life was probably
not worth a plugged dime

  he shrugged if he turned back
he would never know and he had
lived so long with danger all around
him that his senses were dulled

  im going with you he said

  she seemed to sag a little at the words
but she did not reply

  i want you to know that i appre-
ciate what youve tried to do he con-
tinued ill be on guard

  she shook her head

  one other thing he added i
think youre in trouble serious trouble
i would like to help you if you will let
me and if i can

  a tiny smile danced on her face
thank you she said will you take
this

  she reached down into a compart-
ment on the left side of the pilots seat
pulled out a box about the size and
shape of a cigarette case it was made
of aluminum

  put this in your pocket and keep
it there dont let anybody see it and


fantastic adventures

dont ever move out of your room with-
out it put it in your pajama pocket
when you go to sleep at night
thanks he said what is it
its a present thats all i can tell
you and if anybody discovers you
have it and asks where you got it tell
them you found it but dont ever tell
anyone that i gave it to you

tjte accepted the strange ciga-
rette case dubiously slipped it into
his pocket ahead of them out of the
growing dusk an island was emerging
a few twinkling lights glistened among
the trees

  that long low building where you
see the lights is our living quarters
gerry nash said the big dark build-
ing off to the right is the laboratory
this is the island

  urn quite a big place redding
said he was staring at the island but
out of the corner of his eye he was
watching something that had appeared
from nowhere and was struggling des-
perately to keep up with the moving
helicopter

  it was one of the glowing basketballs
that had attacked the alligator hunter
back in the town of toms landing in
the dusk it looked like a dim will-o-
the-wisp that are occasionally seen
floating over swampy country redding
had never seen a will-o-the-wisp but
he had read about them

  redding watched it said nothing
he reached down into the bag at his
side stealthily extracted the gun and
an extra clip of cartridges from it
slipped them into his pocket

  the floating ball gave up trying to
keep up with the helicopter veered off
and then suddenly vanished into the
darkness

  under gerry nashs skillful hand-
ling the eggbeater dropped to a landing
without a jar

chapter iv

   ulick was waiting in the shadows
for the helicopter to land the
vanes had barely stopped turning be-
fore he was opening the cabin door he
glanced at redding nodded then spoke
to the girl

  gerry my dear come here i
want to talk to you

  helping her from the plane he took
her arm and led her off into the dark-
ness redding unashamedly followed
for once in his life he was grateful for
his army training it had given him the
ability to move with the stealth of an
indian many times in the past few
years his life had depended on his
ability to move without sound his
hunch was that this was another one
of those times when he stopped mov-
ing he was lying under a tree in a
clump of grass beside the path gulick
had taken he could have reached out
and touched the girl with his hand

  where are we going sid he heard
gerry nash ask

  to cuba gulick answered some-
time tonight i want the plane ready to
leave at a moments notice from cuba
were going into south america your
father is in the laboratory packing the
equipment he wants to take with him
south america surprise was in
the girls voice we cant do that
sid well need passports

  i have them i arranged every-
thing while i was away and i have
something else gerry exultation
showed in his voice a letter of credit
for almost two million dollars i suc-
ceeded in disposing of all the gold the
submarine brought got it transferred
into dollars when we clear out of
here my dear well be taking a fortune
with us think of that well be
rich 

  redding whistled silently two mil-
the isle of doom



lion dollars brought here by subma-
rine two million in gold it was a
fortune worth fighting for but where
had the gold come from why had it
been brought here reddings mind
raced madly seeking an answer to the
mysteries hidden here in the swamp
a secret laboratory a fortune in gold
a submarine an unwilling but strangely
cowed girl floating balls of mysterious
death what was going on here

  but schultz the girl protested
and wasser what about them they
claim this gold belongs to-

  i dont care what they claim gul-
ick snapped they brought the gold
here to pay us didnt they that makes
it ours doesnt it they have no right

to the gold its m-ours and i

intend to keep it

  they wont like it gerry nash
slowly said

  what do i care what they like
gulick answered theyre not going
with us

  silence redding could almost hear
gerry nash thinking

  sid does that mean- she whis-
pered

  never mind what it means  gulick
answered you go get the helicopter
ready

 but-

  do as i say the biochemist
snarled his voice harsh in the darkness
ill take the responsibility you just
do as youre told

tor an instant redding thought she
was going to slap the man silently
he prayed for her to tell gulick to go to
hell if she would only smack him tell
him off-redding silently thumbed the
safety on his gun if she would defy
gulick he would come out of hiding
and help her

  all right sid gerry nash an-
swered in a voice with tears in it but

she didnt defy gulick instead she
turned and walked back toward the
helicopter gulick went in the other
direction disappearing toward the dark
building that served as a laboratory

  redding swore silently but did not
move a dark shadow lifted itself from
the ground not ten feet from him
slipped furtively away toward the liv-
ing quarters

holy hell redding thought
somebody else was listening in too
somebody-he couldnt guess who-
had also overheard gulick and the girl

  redding slipped back toward the
plane then walked boldly up to it
gerry nash was sitting in the cabin
crying

  oh hello she said take your
bag up to the living quarters sam the
negro cook or frances his wife will
show you your room dinner will be
ready soon

  redding lifted his bag out of the ship
okay he said he glanced back at
her you coming too

  ill be along soon she answered
redding pounded on the door of the
long low building that served as living
quarters for whomsoever lived on this
mysterious swamp island was admitted
by a ponderous colored woman fol-
lowed her heavy footsteps through what
was apparently a living room into a
long narrow hall

  this be your room she said stop-
ping at a door at the end of the hall
wes fixin to eat right away you
come out soon as yous ready

  she waddled off apparently in the
direction of the kitchen leaving red-
ding to his own devices the room con-
tained a cot a washstand a chair and
a closet it was hot and stuffy in the
place redding went to the single win-
dow to open it the window was nailed
shut and a complete pane of glass was
missing there was no screen


fantastic adventures

  mosquitoes will eat me alive in
here he thought that is if i stay
alive long enough for the mosquitoes to
get a crack at me 

  he did not doubt that he was in
deadly danger danger brooded over
this lonely swamp island like fog over
the jungle somewhere in this place a
trap was set for him he knew too
much because he knew too much he
was to be swept aside as one smashes a
stinging mosquito oddly he did not
know what it was he knew that made
him dangerous of course he knew
enough to demand an investigation
gulick certainly did not want the state
police to do any poking around on this
island and yet-what was gulick do-
ing here that he did not want investi-
gated what was the secret of this
swamp island that the biochemist was
so carefully hiding what was the
source of his power over gerry nash
where did the two million dollars in
gold fit into the picture where-
what-he shook his head questions
no answers

  nor did he get any of the answers at
dinner but he did meet schultz and
wasser

  gulick greeted him when he entered
the dining room ah redding those
things that belong to your brother i
know theyre here but i havent had a
chance to find them ill look them up
tomorrow for you in the meantime i
should like to have you consider your-
self my guest

  so i am to stay tonight redding
thought and tomorrow you will be
gone

  thank you he said aloud be
glad to stay

thinner was a silent affair gulick
sat at the head of the table gerry
nash at the end schultz and wasser
sat directly across from redding of

the mysterious scientist nash there
was no sign they were served by
frances the ponderous colored woman
who had shown redding to his room

  it was one of the strangest meals
redding had ever eaten no one said
a word

  i saw a strange sight this after-
noon redding ventured at last

 um what was that gulick
asked

  redding described the incredible ball
of floating mist that had attacked the
alligator hunter in toms landing he
was curious to see how gulick and the
others would react to the story

  the reaction was even deeper silence
than had existed before even the oc-
casional scrape of silver on china faded
away as if each person in the room was
suddenly trying to eat as quietly as
possible gerry nash looked fixedly at
her plate schultz and wasser seemed
not to have heard what he had said
gulick frowned

  what do you think that thing was
redding persisted

  um gulick answered had you
been drinking

  no i hadnt been drinking red-
ding answered i saw the thing i
helped drag the dead hog away

  i have no idea what it was gulick
answered the tone of his voice indi-
cated the subject was closed before
he had finished speaking gerry nash
had abruptly risen and left the room
gulick stared at her but said nothing
two minutes later schultz and wasser
rose and excused themselves gulick
hastily gulped the rest of his food

  excuse me redding got some
work that simply has to done make
yourself right at home youll find some
excellent books in the library read
if you would like until you are ready
to turn in

  redding was left alone at the table
the isle of doom



  would you be wishin anything
more the colored maid asked enter-
ing the dining room

  no thanks redding answered he
rose from the table lit a cigarette went
out on the porch around him the
swamp was still there was no sign
of schultz wasser or gulick they
had left the building and the night had
swallowed them

  i wonder where that booby trap is
redding thought i wonder where it
is

  he found it in his room sometime
around midnight in spite of his inten-
tion to remain awake he had dozed he
awakened with the sound of high pres-
sure steam in his ears high pressure
steam escaping from a tiny jet grim
experience had taught him how to be
wide awake instantly no amount of
experience would ever teach him how to
control the flow of cold sweat that
poured over him when he heard that
high pressure hiss

  he opened his eyes a slit and saw
it a dimly luminous ball of pale light
was floating through the window the
missing pane of glass that had been
the booby trap the glass had been
deliberately removed from the window
so this thing could enter

  redding moved so fast his body was
a blur of motion in less than split
seconds he was off the cot across the
room and had the doorknob in his
hand zack had said these things
couldnt pass through walls with the
door behind him he would be safe

  the knob wouldnt turn as he twisted
it he shook it savagely realized then
that the door was locked

  somebody was making damned cer-
tain he wouldnt escape

teeling like a rat in a trap he
dropped flat on the floor as he fell
he was reaching for the gun in his

pocket he had lain down with all his
clothes on the gun was in his pocket
he yanked it free thumbed the safety
off knowing that even if bullets would
stop the creature that had come out of
the night it was already too late to use
them deep in his mind his sense of
time was telling him he ought to be
paralyzed he ought to be dead by now
he might have beaten the floating bas-
ketball to the door but when he
couldnt open the door it should have
struck him instantly

  it hadnt struck him it wasnt even
trying to strike him he gasped in
astonishment when he saw what it was
doing

  it was trying to escape from him
it was inside the room but instead of
attacking him it was dashing madly
from corner to corner seeking a way
out the hiss of its motion was shrill
with-fear

  it was afraid of him it was trying
to get away it darted back and forth
apparently so crazed with fear that it
had forgotten the window where it had
entered redding didnt move in his
mind was the thought that his life had
been saved by a miracle as he watched
the ball remembered the window darted
down to it hissed out into the night he
caught a glimpse of it burning the wind
as it lifted over the trees

  he crept silently to the window
peered out

  mr redding a faltering voice
whispered are-are you all right

  the whisper came from under his
window out there in the darkness
gerry nash was speaking to him

chapter v

xhatmakes you think i wouldnt
be all right redding said
there was savagery in his voice and he
made no attempt to conceal or control

it he was still badly scared some-
body had tried to kill him he was not
at all certain that miss gerry nash did
not have something to do with the crea-
ture that had been in his room in his
present shaken mental condition he
was not certain of anything why
wouldnt i be all right he repeated

  im so glad she answered i got
here as quickly as i could but i saw it
leave just as i arrived i didnt know
until i saw it leave-

  you didnt know what redding
interrupted he was standing at the
edge of the window taking care not to
expose himself the gun covered the
spot where her voice was coming from

  i didnt-didnt know what was go-
ing to happen to you

  but when you saw that floating
death ball leave you knew all right
y-es that is-

  then you know what that thing is
  y-es

  redding laughed a sound without
mirth in it i suppose youre going to
tell me next that you came here to save
me from it

  y-es she faltered the scorn in
his voice was stinging her that is-
you werent in any danger

  no i saw what one of those things
did to a hog you tell me theyre not
dangerous

  theyre dangerous all right she
admitted theyre a hundred times
as deadly as a rattlesnake but you
werent in any danger not from it

she watched as the grim struggle went on
for possession of the automatic weapon


fantastic adventures

  no her sureness shook him he
was being unfair and he knew it but he
was still so badly scared he couldnt
completely control his reactions

  it didnt attack you did it
  n-o

  after it got into the room it tried to
get away didnt it

  how did you know he faltered
were you watching

  no i saved you from the gas balls
this afternoon

  what

  the little aluminum box that looks
like a cigarette case the girl explained
no gas ball will even come near you
as jong as youre carrying that

  huh redding grunted until this
moment he had completely forgotten
the little aluminum box he felt hastily
in his pocket it was still there you
mean this box saved me from that
thing how the devil could it

  that box contains an ultra high-
frequency miniature radio transmitter
i have one of them sid-all of us have
them we couldnt work with the gas
balls without them occasionally the
gas balls escape one of them would
kill all of us if we didnt carry the
little radio transmitters to drive them
away

  holy hell redding breathed
they worked with the luminous balls
the monstrosities belonged here on this
island the implications back of her
words made his mind reel she was

 radio death rays-the radiations
from the miniature radio transmitters
were in effect death rays to the gas balls
the life energy of the gas balls was a
radio frequency vibration high in the
ultra frequency ranges the radiations
from the tiny transmitters disrupted the
functioning of this vital life process of
the gas balls and drove them away from
the transmitters-ed

speaking again

  listen mr redding i havent time
to explain everything i came to get
you weve got to get away from this
island and weve got to do it right
away

  you came to get me somewhere
inside of him he was aware of a warm
feeling she had come to help him
that was good in giving him the little
radio transmitter in the aluminum box
she had already saved his neck once
the good feeling grew there were
questions that went with it lots of ques-
tions but they could wait until later
for the moment at least he was con-
vinced of the honesty of gerry nashs
intentions whatever part she was play-
ing in this amazing adventure he felt
in this moment at least that she was on
his side

  wait a minute he answered

rthe lower window frame had four
panes of glass in it one was miss-
ing the door was locked the win-
dow was nailed down he snatched the
blanket from the cot stuffed part of it
out through the opening where the pane
was missing grasped the frame in the
middle pulled vigorously the break-
ing panes of glass muffled by the blan-
ket made very little noise as they fell
inward he stepped through the shat-
tered window dropped lightly to the
ground

  okay he said where do we go
now you know this place youll have
to lead the way

  well take the copter gerry
nashs suddenly soft voice answered
sid may hear it start but well be gone
before he can stop us

  she turned tugged at his hand for
him to follow her

  one question reddings voice
stopped her this evening no matter
how much you seemed to dislike it you
the isle of doom



obeyed sidney gulicks orders to-
night youre running away from him
early this evening my father was
alive she answered now hes dead
pain and hurt and fatigue were in her
voice all the pain in the world she
was suddenly a little girl a very fright-
ened little girl crying in the darkness

  im sorry redding said gently
i did not know

  for over three years gulick has
held my father prisoner on this island
i obeyed him because i knew what
would happen to my father if i didnt
obey now my father is dead and i no
longer have to obey

  oh redding said sympathy and
understanding welled up in him found
expression in the single syllable that he
spoke at last he understood why this
girl had obeyed sidney gulick the
biochemist had been holding her
father a prisoner she either did what
he told her to do or else redding had
been inside germany long enough to
know how easy it was to hold someone
prisoner and from that fact to command
the unquestioning obedience of the
prisoners relatives

  im sorry redding whispered
im very sorry i did not know did
gulick-your father-

  my father died the same way your
brother died-because somebody tam-
pered with the radio transmitter that
protected him from the gas balls
somebody

  i dont know who i only suspect
your brother objected to the use gulick
proposed to make of the gas balls my
father discovered after he objected
he died of course it could have been
an accident but-

  he died redding said thats
the important thing he died the old
savagery had crept back into his voice

  ill tell you the whole story later
gerry nash whispered but weve got

to get out of here and weve got to do
it right away or we may never get out

  desperate urgency was in her voice
she tugged at his hand redding fol-
lowed her

  sitting in the little clearing that
served as a landing field the helicopter
was a shadow that looked like a rube
goldberg invention a gas ball darted
over them as they approached it veered
down then fled away as the radiations
from the miniature radio transmitters
repelled it

  some time i want you to tell me all
about those things redding said in-
voluntarily ducking

 later gerry nash answered
hastily she opened the door of the ship
slid into the pilots seat redding
slipped into the seat beside her

  the starter ground and ground
and ground

  the motor refused to start

  somethings wrong the girl whis-
pered ill look

  jerking a flashlight from its holder
beside the seat she lifted the cover off
the motor the flashlight beam poked
into the mechanism

  the distributor arm is gone gerry
nash said

  gone redding echoed

somebody removed it somebody
who didnt want this ship to take off

  rising above the fatal words red-
ding heard the sound of running feet
coming up the path from the laboratory

  he swung himself out of the cabin
dropped to the ground beside the plane
rolled in the other direction

  a flashlight beam stabbed through
the darkness clearly revealed gerry
nash as she stood up beside the motor

chapter vi

yrats going on here sidney
gulick demanded his flashlight


fantastic adventures

covered gerry nash redding lying
flat on the ground could see the gun
glinting behind it gulick was inter-
ested in the girl redding began to
crawl

  sid gerry gasped where did
you come from

  i heard someone trying to start the
helicopter-

  ill take the gun redding said
with the muzzle of his own pistol he
jabbed gulick so hard in the back that
the bones creaked reaching around
him he jerked the pistol from the bio-
chemists grasp stepped back a gun in
each hand

  if you move before i tell you to i
guarantee your guts will be so full of
holes in thirty seconds that they will
leak forever just stand still sid
thats all you have to do

  over his shoulder redding called
gerry come and get his light
gulick appeared dazed as she took
the flashlight from his shaking fingers

  surprised to see me redding said
you thought i was dead didnt you
aint it too damned bad im not
where - where did you come
from gulick stuttered

  thats the sixty-four dollar ques-
tion sid where did i come from
and heres the  question sid
where is that distributor arm

 wh-what

  dont stall id like nothing bet-
ter than to save the state the expense
of hanging you produce that dis-
tributor arm miss nash and i are
clearing out of here of course now
that youve come along well take you
with us- but not to cuba sid not
to cuba tonight something tells me
that if you ever get to cuba it will be
in the spirit world where is that dis-
tributor arm

  i- i dont know what youre talk-
ing about

  the hell you dont you fixed the
ship so nobody would leave here with-
out you a little insurance to protect
you if anything went wrong eh sid
where is that arm ill give-

  sock

  something hit redding from behind
descending with crushing force

  men who live through battles often
find they have developed a sense of
danger a feeling that they had better
duck at the right time redding had
lived through many battles but he
didnt need his keenly developed sense
of danger here the sound of a steal-
thy step behind him told him the blow
was coming he rolled with it the
club knocked him head over heels
splintered his vision with thousands of
shooting stars dazed him but did not
knock him out he rolled like a ten-
pin hit by a bowling ball and he did not
get to his feet but when he stopped
rolling and sat up he was shooting

  the shadow that had hit him ducked
gerry nash screamed and threw the
flashlight at it it ducked again red-
ding took a second snap shot at it
the shadow hit the ground

  gulick ran like a fool the second
after the first shot split the night he
was gone-toward the laboratory

  redding shot at the ground where the
shadow had fallen he had seen too
many men hug the ground when bul-
lets were coming at them hit the dirt
when they werent hit to believe that
his dazed aim shaky from the blow
on the head he had scored a hit he
shot again

  over in the dark shadow of the trees
at the edge of the little landing field a
ijiachine pistol let go the air around
redding sounded like it was being torn
as the slugs ripped through it

d edding threw himself flat on the
ground he got a mouthful of
the isle of doom



dirt as a bullet hit the sandy soil inches
in front of his face he fired at the
flash of the machine pistol

  the pistol abruptly was silent he
couldnt tell whether or not he had hit
the man who held it all he knew was
that it was silent

  gerry he whispered

  yes she answered from somewhere
in front of him

  crawl back along the path he
ordered ill cover for you

  he heard the rustle of her body as
she slid along the ground redding
waited far off in the swamps a bull
alligator was bellowing the night
wind sighed through the scrub pines
beside the clearing the helicopter
was still a rube goldberg invention in
the night

  redding slipped a fresh clip of cart-
ridges into his pistol somewhere in
the clearing he could hear a man crawl-
ing stealthily the man was going
farther away redding began to edge
along the ground following the girl he
did not dare risk giving that machine
pistol another chance at him he had
seen one of those pistols cut a man in
two with the murderous stream of bul-
lets it threw

  gerry he whispered

  yes she answered

  you all right

  im alive but my nervous sys-
tem will never recover

  who the devil was it that hit me
with the club and who was using
that machine pistol

  schultz she answered i caught
a glimpse of him as he hit you that
was wasser with the pistol

  holy hell he muttered they
were trying to help gulick

  i dont think so gerry nash said
i think they know that gulick in-
tended to leave them here with you
and my dad i think theyre the ones

who removed the distributor arm ro
nobody could use the helicopter with-
out them

  i still dont get it he frowned
who are they scientists who were
helping your father

  hardly she answered i dont
question their technical ability but they
werent helping dad theyre a couple
of agents sent over by the nazis to
buy the gas balls from gulick using
someone in south america he got in
touch with the germans told them
what he had offered to sell schultz
and wasser came over by submarine to
investigate they saw the gas balls
would be an extremely powerful weap-
on-thousands of those things sprung
in a surprise attack would demoralize
an opposing army-but the war ended
before they could return to germany
with their information schultz and
wasser are still here

  hell on earth redding whistled
a couple of nazis and i thought i
had heard and seen everything
thats where the gold came from that
gulick has

  yes they paid off in gold but he
has had a lot of trouble getting it
changed into more negotiable currency
the government asks questions if you
try to turn gold in at a bank these days
gulick would have been gone long ago
if he could have managed to convert
the gold into money he could use
but- she seemed mildly perplexed
-how did you know about the gold
i eavesdropped he answered he
told her how he had listened to her con-
versation with gulick when she first
brought him to the island and there
was someone else listening too he add-
ed suddenly remembering something
that had risen from the ground

  probably schultz or wasser ger-
ry nash said thats how they knew
gulick was planning to leave tonight


fantastic adventures

  hm can either of them fly that
helicopter

  no theyre tricky things to han-
dle im the only pilot here

  then it stacks up like this red-
ding said slowly theyve got the dis-
tributor arm but they cant fly the ship
weve got the pilot but we havent
got the missing distributor arm so we
cant fly its a stalemate gulick cant
take a hand in the game because he has
neither the pilot nor the missing part
were all marooned here and were all
just begging for the chance to cut each
others throat what a fine setting for
murder

  the night wind went whispering
through the scrub pines

  what about a boat redding
asked if there is a boat around we
could use it to get away

  theres a launch gerry nash an-
swered hope suddenly sounded in her
voice we might-if we dont get
lost in these blasted swamps-
lead me to the launch he said
ill take a chance on getting lost
the launch is tied up at the little
dock on the other side of the labora-
tory gerry said come on

nphe laboratory was a dark shadow
huddled close to the ground they
moved silently toward it as they drew
near a luminous ball of light suddenly
appeared over the building

  redding dived for the ground then
sheepishly got to his feet

  sorry my reflexes are working a
little too good tonight when i see
danger i hit the dirt first and think
afterwards i keep forgetting those
things cant harm us hello theres
another one i wont duck this time
a second gas ball had leaped up over
the building it gyrated dancing like
some monstrous hound exulting because
it has been freed from the leash

  behind it came a third one then
a fourth a fifth the air was full of
the things redding stared at them he
could smell danger what the hell-
sid has turned them loose gerry
nash swiftly said theyre bred there
in the laboratory theres hundreds
of them in there and hes turned them
all loose i wonder why

  uneasiness had crept into her voice
they cant hurt us they cant touch
us they wont come near us- sud-
denly her voice was frantic

  check your radio generator is it
working all right here let me have
it

  she jerked the cover from the little
aluminum box held it to her ear its
dead the batteries are worn out
mark mark weve got to get under
cover those things-

  how about your generator he de-
manded

  she fumbled inside her dress for it
pulled it out jerked the cover off

  her voice was hollow with fear
its dead too mark this isnt an
accident gulick did this he changed
batteries on every miniature transmit-
ter on the island he planned to turn
the gas balls loose and kill us all he
was going to kill all of us toifight in-
cluding me

  back inside the living quarters
redding snarled back while we have
the chance

chapter vii

tefore they reached the clearing
that served as a landing field for
the helicopter a gas ball came up the
path behind them they ducked into
the brush it did not see them red-
ding watched it float on up the path at
the clearing it zoomed high in the air
hung poised there like a hawk watching
a rabbit on the ground below then
the isle of doom



again like a hawk it dived straight
down a flaming streak splitting the
darkness

  the night was suddenly hideous with
the sound of a man screaming

  it got someone redding whis-
pered

  schultz or wasser gerry an-
swered their radio transmitters
arent working either but they didnt
know it-until now

  the screams stopped as suddenly as
they had begun

  we-we should have warned them
gerry whispered

  i should warn a nazi hes going
to die redding grunted i spent
too long killing them trying to keep
them from killing me to care if the
gas balls get every damned nazi on
earth come on weve got to get
under cover

  over the laboratory the darkness was
bright with the floating gas balls they
had gone into a sort of a dance the
darting spinning whirling luminous
balls would have been beautiful if they
had not been so monstrous

  can he get those things back in the
cage after hes turned them loose
redding asked as they slipped silently
toward the house

  sometimes they come back more
often they dont once theyre turned
loose they do what they please
well all i can say is with those
things loose times are going to be
mighty tough in this swamp there
will be dead hunters dead trappers
dead fishermen from here to miami
when those things start running up in
the resorts there will be the damnedest
stampede north this country ever saw 
they wont live long gerry nash
answered the first hard thunder-
storm will kill them thats something
gulick never told the nazis you can
bet when they came here to see what

he had he took their money all right
but he didnt tell schultz and wasser
that the violent electromagnetic dis-
turbances-static you call it in your
radio-resulting from lightning tears
the gas balls to pieces lightning af-
fects them the same way the little radio
transmitters do radiations from the
little transmitters merely drive them
away lightning being much stronger
kills them the first hard thunder-
storm that comes along will clear them
out of the swamp

  then all we have to do is pray for
rain redding said looking up over-
head a million stars sparkled in the
black vault of heaven there was not
a cloud in sight

  heres the house well go in
through the kitchen and wake up sam
and frances and warn them

  in the kitchen they discovered they
would never warn the negro cook and
his fat wife both were stretched cold
and lifeless on the floor a swift ex-
amination disclosed what had hap-
pened the protective miniature radio
transmitters each carried were dead

  if i needed anything to prove gul-
ick planned to kill us all this does it
gerry nash said slowly the bat-
teries in these little sets will last thir-
ty-six hours there were two sets of
transmitters for everyone we got a
fresh transmitter every evening at 
oclock daddy changed the batteries
every afternoon and brought the sets
up here for us to pick up every morn-
ing he took the old sets back to the lab-
oratory all gulick had to do was to
put worn-out batteries in the sets then
turn the gas balls loose we would
never know we didnt have any protec-
tion-until we were dead

o edding carefully closed the
kitchen door well were here
the gas balls cant get in gulick is


fantastic adventures

down at the laboratory ill bet the bat-
teries in his protective transmitter are
all right somewhere outside there is
one dead nazi and one live nazi who
probably has a machine pistol we
cant go outside gulick cant come
inside not while i have a gun the
gas balls cant come in either is there
food and water in here

  plenty of both gerry said

  then all we have to do is stay in-
side until the next thunderstorm kills
off the gas balls after theyre gone
i can go outside and give sidney gulick
a leon in stalking oh no too bad
you cant come in but the windows and
doors are closed

  he was speaking to the gas ball that
had come up to the window it hung
in the darkness outside the panes of
glass like a cat at a rat hole

  sure ill admit im a rat redding
murmured but even rats like to stay
alive

  spang off in the night a rifle barked
before he heard the sound of the gun
redding heard something more horrible
-the tinkle of broken glass

  the bullet hit the opposite wall red-
ding ignored it in front of his eyes a
window pane had exploded the gas
ball was already moving toward the
opening left by the broken glass

  redding grabbed gerry nash jerked
her through the door that led into the
butlers pantry from the pantry a sec-
ond door opened into the dining room
they stood in the hot stuffy darkness
scarcely daring to breathe through
the closed kitchen door they could hear
the hiss of high pressure steam escap-
ing the gas ball had entered the
kitchen

  off in the darkness the rifle barked
again again the explosion was followed
by the rattle of breaking glass

  its gulick redding breathed he

knows were in here hes shooting out

the windows so the gas balls can come
in and get us

  gerry nashs frightened breathing
was the only sound

  again the rifle spoke

  why i didnt kill him when i had
the chance ill never know redding
whispered he stays out there and
shoots the windows out and we stay
in here and wait sooner or later hes
bound to knock the window out of this
pantry-

  he didnt want to think what would
happen after that

  will a bullet stop those gas balls
he questioned

  he felt rather than saw the shake of
her head

  will anything stop them he con-
tinued

  nothing on earth except radio fre-
quency radiations

  redding sighed he could feel sweat
running down his face he could feel it
running down his chest

  he opened the door to the kitchen a
crack peeped through hastily slammed
it shut

  its still out there he said

  i know gerry answered i can
hear it

  gerry what are those things where
did they come from maybe if you
tell me all about them i can think of
something

  they are or their remote ancestors
were will-o-the-wisps gerry nash
said my father-i guess you dont
know about him-was a scientist one
of the greatest of them all he was a
biologist who spent his life investigating
life forms it was his hope his dream
that new life forms were still evolving
here on earth somewhere in some
swamp he thought he could find a place
where life was coming into existence
where inert atoms were building up into
live molecules the molecules in turn
the isle of doum



building up into complex living sub-
stance thats all life is-a subtle elec-
tro-chemical reaction im talking of
the mechanics of living matter now not
the spirit he didnt find what he was
seeking but he did discover the will-o-
the-wisps

rjhe rifle barked again talking of
exploding violence in the darkness
the tinkle of falling glass answered the
report of the gun

  go on redding urged as long as
she talked she wouldnt be thinking

  will-o-the-wisps have been seen
around swamps for centuries supersti-
tious people thought they were ghosts
another explanation was that they were
balls of marsh gas my father found
a few of them here and began to study
them he discovered the things were
alive

  the devil redding said

  theyre really not gas at all gerry
nash continued theyre charged elec-
tric fields and theyre true parasites in
that they draw the source of their en-
ergy from living creatures they kill
by sucking every tiny bit of electrical
energy out of living bodies my father
spent years studying them by careful
breeding he managed to develop a new
strain much more agile and more dead-
ly than the original will-o-the-wisps
he wasnt trying to create a deadly kill-
er he was just trying to find out how
the things worked they can move
against gravity he wanted to know how
they did that they are intelligent in
some weird way he wanted to know
how their intelligence worked it was
his dream that by studying the will-o-
the-wisps he could make a great and
lasting contribution to human prog-
ress

  she sounded very sad something of
her fathers dream was in her outside
in the night every crack of gulicks ri-

fle was bringing closer the time when
her fathers life work would destroy her
roger nash had never dreamed of that

  im sprry redding said softly i
see now why jim thought your father
was a wonderful man i wish i could
have known him

  you would have loved him

  the rifle cracked again gulick had
moved around to the other side of the
house and was breaking the windows
there he didnt know in what room
they were hiding he only knew they
were somewhere inside the building if
he broke all the windows he couldnt
miss

  ive been thinking redding said
theres a table here why cant i use
it to board up the window then when
he breaks it our little friends wont
come boiling through will that help us
any do you think

  mark why didnt i think of that
instead of sitting here like a ninny
of course it will help they cant go
through any solid substance

  working frantically he tore the top
from the table fitted it against the win-
dow boards from the cupboard plugged
up the openings at the sides and the
top

  they settled down in the darkness to
wait even if the gas balls couldnt get
into the room redding knew their fate
was only a question of time

  crack the window in the pantry
tinkled as a bullet hit it gulick had
moved back to their side of the house
they could hear the soft hiss of the
gas balls outside could catch vague
glimpses of them in the cracks around
the window but the hideous monstrosi-
ties could not get into the room

  redding sighed he began to hope
they would see the sun rise again

  the rifle was silent now and then
they could hear gulick moving around
outside they kept as quiet as mice


fantastic adventures

then redding smelled smoke

  ive been thinking gerry nash
said sam always kept a flashlight
here in the pantry

  redding wasnt listening he sniffed
again there was no mistaking the
odor now he could hear the faint
crackle of flames

  gerry he whispered gulick has
set the building on fire were not only
rats in a trap but the trap is going to
turn into a furnace

viii

the odor of smoke was strong in the
  room now

im going out there redding said
i can outrun those gas balls or dodge
them long enough to get gulick-
wait a minute the girl protested
we dont have many minutes left
he answered

  let me see dad used tiny little
cells no bigger than a lead pencil he
used two of them in each set they
furnished three volts-

  redding rose to his feet were go-
ing out he said

  we cant go out not without protec-
tion from the gas balls

  we cant stay here not without as-
bestos suits he grimly answered
but i tell you sam-

  there were shelves on each side of
the pantry she was rummaging through
them

  light a match she whispered
quick

  redding lit the match gerry
snatched at the flashlight the flickering
flame revealed squealed with joy
mark give me your miniature trans-
mitter there isnt a second to lose
quick give it to me

  she snatched it from his fingers tore
her fingernails prying the cover off
light another match keep on light-

ing them find a piece of paper and
light it ive got to see

  there was a magazine lying on the
shelf over the cabinets redding
snatched a page from it rolled it into a
tube lit the end by the tiny light from
this flickering torch he watched what
gerry nash was doing

  from clips inside the miniature trans-
mitter she gently removed two little
dry cells each about as big as a pencil
and about half an inch in length then
she screwed the end from the flashlight
slid the cells out of it and redding real-
ized what she was trying to do

  gerry was trying to substitute the
good cells from the flashlight for the
dead cells in the protective radio trans-
mitter

  good girl redding whispered if
that will only work but how are you
going to fit those flashlight batteries
into the transmitter theyre three
times as big as the little cells that came
out too big to fit inside the case

  im going to tape them on the out-
side of the case and run wires from
them to the terminals on the inside
tape i havent any tape  she glanced
frantically around the room ive got
to have something- mark give me
your shirt ill tear strips from it here
ill hold the light

  redding probably bettered the
worlds record in getting his coat and
shirt off she snatched it from his hands
ripped inch-wide strips from it

  smoke was flowing through the
cracks in the door that led to the kitch-
en gulick had set the fire at the back
end of the house through the cracks
at the window redding was beginning
to catch glimpses of the trees outside
the air in the pantry was getting
hot and heavy with smoke redding
coughed rolled another page of paper
into a tube lit the end gerry nash
worked
the isle of doom



  this girl was a first-class technician
she didnt have any tools except a
bobby pin and a knife that redding
supplied but she knew her way around
inside the miniature transmitter red-
ding realized she must have had a first-
class technical education in addition
she had unquestionably helped her fa-
ther with his experiments

  she needed wire six inches of wire
was enough but there was no wire in
the pantry she got the wire she needed
from her own protective transmitter
hey redding protested

che didnt answer taping two of
the flashlight cells to the back of the
little aluminum case she tied the con-
tacts into place held the device to her
ear a soft almost out of hearing hum
was dimly audible her eyes glinted
it works she said

  slipping the cover into place she
bound it into position with another
strip of cloth then handed the gener-
ator to redding

  here she said

  redding stared at her what about
your generator he demanded what
about fixing it up too

  there are only enough batteries for
one anyhow i had to use wire out of
mine to fix this one you take it it
will protect you ill try to slip out-
not this century redding explod-
ed i go out and save my neck and
you stay here and burn to death 

  ill be all right mark i feel i let
you get into this-

  you let me get into this

  yes i didnt have to bring you out
here i could have come back and said
i couldnt find you

  gerry redding said softly re-
mind me sometime to tell you what i
think of you right now all i can say
is youre talking nonsense were in
this together together you under-

stand will this generator protect both
of us

  yes but-

  but what

  well have to stay within two or
three feet of each other well be tied
together ill be like a ball and chain
around you you cant move without
me-

  i cant imagine anything i would
like better come on

  but gulick is out there youll have
to move freely

  so gulick is out there redding an-
swered and he has a gun there
was a thoughtful note in his voice he
reached for his coat took out of the
pocket the gun he had taken from gu-
lick at the helicopter here you take
this gun you take the generator if i
get shot    no dont try to argue
me out of it the generator ties us to-
gether if i get shot you run youll
have a chance this way

  he pressed the protective transmit-
ter into one hand the gun into the other
she took the pistol readily enough but
she didnt want to take the generator
redding pushed open the door that led
to the dining room a gas ball swirled
toward him

  he faced the luminous monstrosity
there was no point in trying to evade
it if the hastily improvised transmitter
wouldnt protect them they might as
well die now

  the ball darted at them then as it
felt the subtle radiations from the little
transmitter it shot up to the ceiling
pulled back from them

  redding sighed were over that
hurdle he whispered come on
they went out the front door of the
building flames leaping high over the
kitchen threw grotesque dancing shad-
ows on the ground a gas ball saw them
darted at them drew back before the
radiations from the transmitter fol-


fantastic adventures

lowed along above them trying to keep
in the shadow from the burning build-
ing they raced for the trees running
hand in hand if gulick saw them he
did not chance a shot in their direction

  they reached the trees dived out of
sight among them

  gerry redding exulted weve
made it were out of the furnace and
weve got protection from the gas
balls

   alten  a harsh voice said near
them dont move a machine pistol
covering you i have got 

  schultz gerry nash gasped

  the nazi agent was invisible in the
darkness but redding did not doubt the
machine pistol was trained on them

  hah the nazi grunted those
guns drop

  redding hesitated

  i shoot

jedding let his pistol slide from
his hand he heard gerrys gun
thud softly on the ground

  hah waiting i have been for gu-
lick to roast you two out of there you
geraldine you i want you can fly the
plane

  schultz gerry nash gasped i
thought-

  you thought i was dead no was-
ser is dead when i saw him die i real-
ized something was wrong only a min-
ute was needed to detect what it was
then naturally i substituted flashlight
batteries the dead cells for

  the german was no fool he too
had discovered that his protection was
gone and had taken steps to remedy
that defect

  now we must go schultz contin-
ued but first geraldine stand aside
for one moment

  what

  stand aside

  what for

  he wants you to stand aside so he
can shoot me redding said he
doesnt want the helicopter overbur-
dened well-

  crack

  off in the darkness gulicks rifle
spoke again

  the bullet pinged within feet of them

  schultz let go with the machine pis-
tol firing at the flash of gulicks rifle
the rifle bullet had startled him auto-
matically without stopping to think he
answered the shot

  like a leaping cat redding dived at
him the flash of the pistol revealed
where schultz was hiding aiming at
the hand that held the gun he struck
downward with all the strength in his
arms

  he hit the nazis wrist knocked the
gun from his hand

  donneir-

  redding was behind him one arm
around his throat yanking him back-
ward they fell heavily

  the miracle was that the fall did not
break schultz neck it didnt it didnt
break reddings hold either it enabled
him to jerk his elbow up under the ger-
mans chin lock his hands together in
the terrible strangle hold that is either
broken quickly or has only one ending

  schultz arched his back tried to leap
upward he tried to kick backward he
clawed fiercely at redding pulled his
hair tried to find an eye to gouge his
breath was coming in great gasping
sobs redding held grimly on his bi-
ceps muscle was directly across the
others windpipe he tightened his
grip schultz stopped breathing then
a little by little he stopped struggling
and lay still redding held on only
when the others body was dead weight
in his arms did he release his grip

  gerry

  yes

  stay here with this monkey if he
the isle of doom



revives crack him on the head with
your gun

 redding was already searching
through the nazis clothes for the pro-
tective transmitter he found it flash-
light batteries were wired across the
back he searched for the gun he had
dropped found it

  remember if he moves bop him
let him have it hard he said

  ill keep him quiet she promised

  redding disappeared into the dark-
ness

  good luck her whisper followed
him

  there redding thought is a woman
she didnt ask him any questions she
didnt try to hold him back she said
good luck and let him go and she
knew where he was going

hphe whole back end of the living
quarters was on fire now the crack-
ling flames curling upward in long
tongues of yellow blaze the gas balls
seemed to be attracted to the fire they
were circulating over the entire area
globes of light revealed them drifting
above the trees slipping along a foot
above the ground but always they came
back to the burning house as though
fascinated by the heat or the light they
never entered the flames but occasion-
ally one would dart upward with a
tongue of blaze they seemed to think
the flames were alive and possibly prey

  redding watched the weird dance
around the house he shivered then
turned resolutely away somewhere
within a circle not over two hundred
yards in diameter was gulick if he
was looking for gulick gulick was also
looking for him

 in a hard school redding had
learned to crawl silently keeping flat
on the ground he slipped away from
the burning house he wanted to get
out into the darkness and look in to-

ward the blaze then when the bio-
chemist moved his body would be sil-
houetted against the flame an easy tar-
get once he had located the biochem-
ist the stalk could begin

  fallen logs wiry grass brush barred
his way he crawled over or around
the logs the grass he crawled through
the brush he went around always he
used his fingers to feel the way ahead
of him they were sensitive antennae
revealing obstructions enabling him to
move in absolute silence

  under an old pine tree his probing
fingers revealed a six-inch in diameter
fallen limb ahead of him a split sec-
ond before the limb moved he knew
this limb hadnt fallen from any tree
it wasnt a limb it was a mans leg

  gulick had been sitting with his back
against the pine tree quietly waiting for
his enemy to reveal himself outlined
against the light of the burning house
redding had crawled directly into him
before either realized the others pres-
ence

  reddings pistol flashed upward

  gulick kicked him in the face

  redding dropped the pistol he dived
at gulicks legs the rifle thundered
over his shoulder as he hit his arms
went around the biochemists middle

  gulick grunted he tried to strike
downward with the rifle barrel but red-
dings head was buried in his chest too
close to use the barrel he used the
butt stars exploded inside reddings
head he held on shoved forward

  gulick tripped fell redding landed
on top of him the gun flew out of
gulicks hands his fingers reached
for reddings eyes reddings fingers
closed around his throat

cor a man with fat on him gulick
had amazing strength he grabbed
reddings wrists broke the grip on his
throat threshing on the ground they


fantastic adventures

struggled in the darkness each knew
that no quarter would be asked and
none given redding could hear gulick
breathing heavily the biochemist
rolled redding ended up on the bot-
tom gulick tried to jerk loose he
managed to get to his feet redding
realized the biochemist was trying to
get away he grabbed him around the
legs threw him heavily

  gulick grunted redding grabbed
him around the middle in the side
pocket of gulicks coat he could feel a
hard flat object like a cigarette case

  gulick never did know what hap-
pened to him it seemed that he was
able to wrench free from the arms that
were holding him freedom was what
he was seeking he had lost his rifle
but there was another rifle in the lab-
oratory he knew he didnt have a
chance in a rough and tumble fight
against the iron-hard man who fought
so silently and with such ferocious
strength if he could get away and get
the rifle-

  when he managed to wrench himself
free he ran stumbling through the
darkness suddenly shots sounded be-
hind him heavy slugs drilled the air
around him thudded into trees
screamed as they bounced off he knew
redding had found a gun and was
shooting at him he ran faster

  the gas ball came down from over
the trees and dropped on him he
screamed and screamed again

amazed incredulous terror was in those
screams the gas ball fastened on to
him seeped into his body-

  redding lowered the smoking pistol
he listened to the screams he saw a
second gas ball follow the first a third
follow the second then they came in
droves diving downward like hawks
screaming after their prey

  the screams sobbed into sudden
silence

  redding stood without moving he
looked down at the little flat cigarette
case in his hand it was a protective
radio transmitter he had stolen it
from gulicks pocket while they were
struggling

  he never knew i had it he whis-
pered he never knew i had his pro-
tection  i wonder if he ever knew
he got exactly what was coming to
him-

  flames from the burning house
leaped higher into the sky most of the
gas balls had left the flames now they
were all clustered around a certain spot
off at the edge of the darkness redding
watched in silence then turned and
walked back to where gerry nash wait-
ed he walked erect making no effort
to move quietly she was still waiting
  

  later when the helicopter lifted from
the swamp island the flames from the
burned house had died down off to-
ward the east another brighter fire was
burning-the rising sun

catching the akuaku

	by fran ferris	

easter island in its early existence
shared the luck of most all polynesia in be-
ing completely free from most diseases can-
nibalism had given them a fairly good knowledge
of their inner anatomy and their treatment of
wounds received in battle was quite effective be-
sides injuries they had little to worry about ex-

cept indigestion the result of poor eating habits
like all other polynesians they had no resistance
against disease brought by the white man small-
pox practically obliterated them then came social
diseases and tuberculosis to help fill their burial
cairns they were without adequate medical at-
tention till recently when they stocked a few
catching the akuaku



staple remedies but they were shy about tak-
ing white mans medicine and were worse off
psychologically than when they were depending
solely on a sorcerer to fight off death and disease
which they thought was traceable to one common
influence the akuakus or evil spirits

  the soothsayers agreed that the best way to get
rid of the akuaku was to lure him into a hole
and catch him in a net if they got him out of
the house the patient was able to survive but if
the patient died they knew they had failed to trap
the akuaku other sorcerers had a little different
technique which usually had better results they
didnt believe in catching the akuaku in a hole
away from the house of the patient because it
gave him too much chance to get away from
even the most skillful soothsayer so their idea
was to remove the patient from his house to a
shelter previously arranged or if the weather
permitted into the open air then after much
hocus-pocus they would hang nets over the en-

trance to the house and burn it down very few
akuakus ever survived the patient would most
always get better for being moved into the sun-
shine or into a clean shelter

  feasting was a principal part in celebrating the
dead as it was in all other religious activities of
the island after all the food was eaten the
body was wrapped in bark cloth and braided
grass and carried to a ahu or burial cairn and
laid on a temporary table of sticks members of
the family took up positions on each side of the
ahu to watch night and day over the remains
this precaution was practical as well as cere-
monious as sometimes a skull might be stolen
and used for minor sorcery after a few days
of this the distant relatives went home and only
the immediate family kept watch night and day
till the body had dried and fallen apart the
bones were then gathered up and thrown into a
cairn and the period of mourning was officially
over

the tunnel of love

	by h r stanton

two hundred and sixty-five years have
passed since the death of nell gwyn
toast of the london stage and mistress to
king charles ii still every now and then some-
thing happens to bring back her memory such
was the case when recently a workman who was
loosening bomb-blasted stones at windsor guild-
hall poked his pneumatic drill into an unknown
secret of the romantic couple the drill plunged
into space hurling the workman to the ground
it seems that he had broken into a tunnel that
led from the kings castle to nell gwyns home
when the tunnel was cleared of debris it exposed
an archway of spanish marble with walls of the
 foot passage built of tooled limestone the
tunnel was four feet wide and seven feet high
at the other end was another marble archway
fifteen feet under the site of another demolished
house this was the second tunnel known to
have been used by the romantic king to make
his visits to the beautiful first lady of the stage
the other was discovered during the war in the
chelsea section it connected two other mansions
that were occupied by the king and nell from
time to time one end of the chelsea tunnel
starts at sanford manor house where nell gwyn
supported her mother until  when the old
lady intoxicated accidentally drowned herself the
other end of the tunnel is under the turf of the
horticultural ground of royal hospital once the
site of one of king charless castles this passage
was also revealed by a nazi bomb king charles
was the playboy of his day and he made sure
that he would never be cut off from his sweet

nell no matter where the affairs of state called
him

  nell gwyn could not read or write she was
bom in an alley leading off drury lane and
neighbors took the mother and babe in nell
became what we might call a cigarette girl only
she sold oranges at the drury lane theatre
she was enticingly beautiful and soon became
a favorite with the night crowds she was offered
a role in the theatre and made good she was
courted by nobles four times her age before she
was sixteen then when king charles attended
a command performance she stole his heart she
was always true to him although he could never
marry her because she was a commoner she
kept her good temper and charming smile and
apparently was satisfied with her lot-the privi-
lege of a girl born in a gutter rising to become
the kings favorite she bore him two sons
which he took care of in style on his death
bed king charles asked his brother to take care
of nell and the boys king james kept his
promise and paid nells debts from the secret
service funds and educated her sons

  historians describe nell as the most beloved
of the kings many favorites and say that she
never tried to influence the prime ministers but
that she did induce charles to create a founda-
tion for todays chelsea hospital

  nell died at the age of  she was buried
in the churchyard of st martin-in-the-fields
the archbishop of canterbury who preached her
sermon had much to say in her favor

by john and dorothy de courcy

he skyline unmarred by barrage balloons

the sounds of birds and breeze and insects

untainted by the undertone of aircraft en-
gines all were balm to cliff chamberlains soul

its good to sit in a park that isnt criss-crossed
with slit trenches cliff thought

cliff had had enough of war the flight surgeon
had thought so too and so after five years cliff sat in
the park a dexter eagle stitched to the breast of his
uniform his body was unscarred cliffs scars
were invisible to be sure they could be seen when
you noticed the tremor of his hands or the slightly
dazed opacity of his eyes his was the face of a
man who had too often joked about death in an
attempt to minimize his fear

once cliff had been a violinist but now a rosined
bow would feel alien in his hands he hadnt played


fantastic adventures

since the night he and peggy had parted

  if shed only written me one let-
ter cliff muttered she doesnt
care about me ive got to forget
her ive got to start all over again
living seems so senseless so futile
they had been happy together until
that night five years ago then for no
reason it had all ended cliff couldnt
even remember what they had quar-
reled about she just left the house
and he waited two days for her to re-
turn when she didnt cliff joined the
army

  he had just come from the house
peggy had been there recently it was
just as he had left it anyone could
have cleaned it but somehow cliff
knew peg had done it the only thing
that had been taken from the house was
the concerto 

 why not cliff shrugged i
wrote it for peg

  he had left the house hurriedly after
staying only a few minutes he was
afraid to see peggy now maybe some-
day when his fingers stopped trem-
bling-- cliff tried to think of other

things the thoughts of peggy and his
former happiness hurt too much

  the sun was low on the horizon and
the air was losing its pleasant warmth
cliff stood up and stretched he lit a
cigarette and started walking out of
the park

  exit cliff chamberlain the virtu-
oso enter cliff chamberlain the
mechanic the plumber the grocery
clerk he snorted

  cliff turned suddenly he must be
wrong no he heard it again  a
violin playing softly some melody
strange to him he stifled the twinge
in his breast cliff was tempted to
leave the park as quickly as he could
but he didnt slowly hesitantly he
walked toward the source of the music
the violin broke off abruptly but be-

gan the same strain again familiar yet
unfamiliar like a name almost but not
quite remembered

  it reminded cliff of the way peggy
used to hum when she was working
around the house he wrenched his
thoughts away from peggy almost
viciously he ground out his cigarette
under his heel he stood silently try-
ing to concentrate on the music striv-
ing to shut out the image of peggys
face but her memory came back as
persistently as did the few bars played
on the violin he could feel the soft-
ness of her hair against his cheek
hear her asking again whats bother-
ing my little genius

  stop it stop it he growled

gain he forced his mind to the
theme sought to label it but it
was no use resolutely cliff strode
down the path toward the music he
rounded a turn and saw an elderly man
on a bench fingering his violin in medi-
tation beside him was an open port-
folio filled with scoring paper

  i hope youll pardon me for intrud-
ing cliff began but i cant seem to
place that melody

  the elderly man looked up

  cliff started slightly and exclaimed
jacob sari

  a quick flash of recognition illumi-
nated jacob saris face veil veil
veil clifford chamberlain and in
the army too

  was in the army cliff corrected
ive been out for three days

  dats fine my boy said jacob
sari extending his hand my but
youre looking good i guess it is dat
army food yah you are looking like
an athlete rather dan a musician
cliff released the old mans hand
smiling i feel more like an athlete
too he admitted oh by the way
what was that you were playing
evensong

ilf

  oh dat dat is a new composition
dat i hope to play next month at my
final concert it is not yet complete
but you like it

  very much cliff replied earnestly
i come to vat you call the turning
point vat i need now is a truly in-
spired theme then i can complete it
maybe you like to hear de last part
yah it is not long

  would you play it please cliff
asked

  gladly gladly jacob sari replied
his face wreathed in smiles dis is de
andante he added unnecessarily

  delicately the old mans fingers be-
gan to extract music great music from
his instrument cliff was swept back
into his old life he lived and breathed
with the music he listened with an
appreciation that only a musician can
possess then jarringly he fell back
to the world where he was cliff cham-
berlain the washed out pilot the man
who hadnt played for years

  suddenly jacob sari stopped in
here it is dat i should insert de great
theme then i would play vat you just

unwritten theme and build it up and
elaborate on it until it reaches de cres-
endo the old man paused and
laughed heartily all dat i need now

theme yah

  cliff frowned what should the
theme express

  just people jacob sari answered
dats vat it is all written about
people people being born people
vorking people playing people grow-
ing old and people dying i thought
maybe de theme would express sort of
de eternal hope or maybe de striving
for someting better you tink dats a
good idea yah

  i dont think the average person
has too much to hope for cliff said

dejectedly and unhappily

jacob sari shook his head dats
a defeatist attitude dere is al-
ways hope look even at me i am
an old man but i still have hope you
are young and have a brilliant career
ahead of you you have a wife and
maybe even a little clifford by now
cliffs face was white margaret
and i arent together anymore we-
separated-when-i joined the army
jacob sari was pained oh i am
sorry i did not know or i would haf
said nothing please forgive me i am
getting old and sometimes i talk too
much

  -its not your fault cliff sighed
you couldnt possibly have known
i see now why you tink dere is no
hope left in de world but maybe you
get along anyway i vas very sad once
ven i vas young but i vas able to find
comfort in my music maybe dats
why i became a violinist

  cliff laughed harshly im afraid
youve got me even there he ex-
tended his hands to jacob sari look
at these the shaking was pro-
nounced now i couldnt even hold
a violin

  for a moment the air seemed thick
then jacob sari stirred

  i admit you haf a problem dere but
would you not be worse off if you vere
deaf like beethoven

  could i be worse off

  i am not a doctor i would not
know sari argued i only know
vat my ears tell me he picked up his
violin plucked the strings tentatively
and placed it in cliffs lap you
play he commanded den maybe i
agree with you

  cliffs face would have been no dif-
ferent had jacob sari put a snake in his
lap i cant he began it would
be terrible im not like a beginner


fantastic adventures

i know how i should playl and i
know i cant look at my hands
automatic vibrato

  no arguments play the older
man said sternly

  but i havent any music cliff pro-
tested and i dont remember a thing
honestly i dont

  silently jacob sari handed to cliff
his folio of music paper cliff
shrugged and opened it at random he
tucked the violin under his chin and
withdrew it shaking his head

  no jacob its no use im just
not a violinist anymore

  prove it sari insisted i dont
believe you until you prove it all
dis talk means nothing to jacob saris
ears

  cliff raised the bow and touched it
to the strings gingerly he began to
play

  a moment later jacob sari waved
his hand stop dat is terrible
well i warned you cliff sighed
you warned me of nothing you
can play but you are thinking about
your fingers could a centipede walk
if he thought about his legs

  i cant help it i just cant play
anymore 

  dats nonsense jacob sari re-
torted angrily you have written
good music play something of your
own vat it is i dont care

  i cant remember any of the things
ive written only a few opening bars
of my concerto

  dats enough play dose maybe
den you remember morel

  cliff shrugged again haltingly at
first he started to play his concerto
peggys concerto he made a mistake

  stop looking at me jacob sari
ordered look out dere at de sunset

liff turned and looked again
he began the concerto gradually

he forget his fingers this was peggys
concerto he felt almost sacreligious
the music with the memories it re-
called brought her back to him he
played to her from his heart

  without realizing it cliff was play-
ing music he hadnt thought of for five
years music he didnt think he would
ever remember

  largo he thought slow and
stately

  it was sad his whole being was
crying out through the violin for peg-
gy the feeling the soul of the music
was almost tangible

  sari leaned forward on the bench
his lips parted his eyes bright with
excitement wunderbar he whis-
pered to himself like any musician
his own mind was filling in the or-
chestral accompaniment

  swiftly cliffs fingers were losing the
stiffness imposed on them by time
behind jacob sari others were gather-
ing onlookers passers by captivated
by the magic this tall soldier was creat-
ing the music swelled it tugged at
peoples hearts it brought back mem-
ories of youthful courtship it painted
a picture of a beautiful world some of
the listeners were musicians some
were not but all were caught by the
spell cliffs music lived it laughed
it cried

  jacob saris eyes were closed now
this was a thing apart from ordinary
music

  it was almost dark when cliff
stopped at the end of the second move-
ment

  jacob saris eyes opened gott
he murmured i would give my life
to play dat concerto at my concert

  cliffs eyes clouded i-i-dont
have the music he stammered it
-it-would-take too long to re-
orchestrate it

  never mind dat now jacob sari
evensong



almost shouted play de finale i
vill not move until i haf heard de
rest

  again cliff played the spectators
didnt move the magnificence of the
finale outshadowed the preceding
movements but it brought pain to
cliffs heart in this movement he
had expressed his love for peg his
eyes were wet and a tear trickled down
his cheek this music wasnt to peg
he thought it was peg

  the last traces of bitterness and re-
sentment were washed away in their
places was left an emptiness that could
only be filled by peggy

  ill find her wherever she is cliff
decided ill crawl on my hands and
knees and tell her what a blind stupid
fool ive been

  he smiled and joyous happiness was
reflected in the music then it was
over

  jacob sari opened his eyes dat
music dat music i haf got to haf
it i postpone my concert any-
ting

  cliff stood for a moment still facing
the darkened horizon savoring his
peace and happiness he was startled
by a rustle of applause he turned
and saw his audience for the first time
even as cliff watched the small group
of onlookers melted away all but one
she came forward cliff struggled to
find his voice even in the semi-dark-
ness he knew her

  peggy he said hoarsely

  hesitantly peggy held forth a
leather folio i-i-came-back-
to return-your concerto i just hap-
pened-

  cliff ignored the portfolio and
gathered her into his arms her body
was rigid for an instant then desper-
ately she clung to him

  jacob sari paid no attention to them
he picked up the fallen concerto and

held it under one arm as though it
might escape he sat down on the
bench again running his fingers up and
down the seam of the folio

  by golly if he can play like dat
maybe it is a good ting dis is my last
concert 

  reluctantly he lay the concerto down
and replaced his violin in the case the
wind rustled the leaves of his own com-
position which lay beside him he dis-
gustedly closed the cover and dropped
it into his briefcase his nose wrinkling
as though the paper emitted an un-
pleasant odor he glanced over his
shoulder at cliff and peggy dimly re-
vealed against the starlit sky

  i give dem another ve minutes
he mumbled den we go eat even
geniuses got to eat

coon the park was deserted except
for two beings they had been be-
side cliff ever since his arrival at the
park cliff had not seen them nor had
anyone else once cliff had even
walked through the space occupied by
the smaller of the two the larger
lanis am finally spoke it was not
speech as men understand the term
but a voiceless soundless communica-
tion

  do you understand why i have
caused all this to come to pass

  the other concentrated for a mo-
ment not completely my teacher
i know that behind this lies a greater
purpose but that purpose is not yet
clear

  in time you would understand
lanis explained but to make this
illustration more clear i shall tell you
now soon a man will listen to the
concerto and be swayed by it through
it he will begin to understand the
principal of love this man now plans
to murder his best friend he will
change his mind and his best friend will

the

shrinking human
	heads 

by june lurie

the shrinking of a head is a ritualistic proc-
ess after the warrior has killed his victim
he cuts the head off as close to the body as
possible brings it back to his witch doctor the
witch doctor protects him from the ghost of the
victim by squirting tobacco up each nostril but
this is only a temporary precaution

   the following day the making of the tsantsa or
shrunken head begins just the warriors the old
man of the tribe and the witch doctors are allowed
to take part in this process an old pot is used
one that is cracked and chipped and three stones
from the river bed are heated in the pot till they
are colored in the meantime the muka or head
has been cut from the apex of the skull downward
to the neck the scalp is then drawn off the skull
till it is only attached to the face then this is
carefully cut away then the neck opening is sewed
to a ring the head is then boiled in water for
hours this shrinks the head a bit and also keeps
it from spoiling then the three stones are brought
into use as soon as the head is dried one of the
hot stones is taken from the pot and dropped into
the skull and rolled around to melt out the fat as
soon as one stone cools another is used then hot
sand is used to complete the job after taking the
sand out each time the witch doctor scrapes away
the tissue in the rapidly shrinking head this goes
on till it is about the size of an orange palm pegs
which were stuck through the lips so that the dead
man could not utter curses are then removed and
replaced by cords the tsantsa is now ready for
the final celebration and victory feast during the
entire time of shrinking the warrior has been in a
process of purification he has been chaste and
taken only liquid foods after a feast of pork and
monkey drums are sounded and the dancing be-
gins the warrior has a new tsantsa to hang about
his waist and the spirit of the dead man to serve
him forever

 will then devote his resources to help-
 ing humanity rather than destroying it
 now do you understand why we have
 done all this tonight

   the smaller figure seemed ashamed
 as he answered i see that i still have
 much to learn

   not too much now lanis encour-
 aged look back and see how far you
 have come remember at one time
 you were the emperor nero

feast of the
	lanterns 

by pete bogg

 in japan the souls of the dead return to their
 former home once a year and a festival called
 the feast of the lanterns is held to welcome
 them they come during the evening of the thir-
 teenth day of the seventh month of the old cal-
 endar which is toward the end of august as they
 come at night it is necessary to light their way
 so they fasten brightly colored lanterns over the
 tombs in the burying grounds there are so many
 that the hills are lighted for miles around lights
 of many hues and also candles are lit and set along
 the streets and in front of houses fires are started
 in the streets so that the whole city is bathed in
 light as soon as the sun sets all the families go
 out to meet their dead when they come to the
 place where they think the dead souls have asssem-
 bled they welcome them and ask them to rest
 after their long journey and to have something to
 eat after giving them time to eat and rest they
 escort them home talking happily with them all
 the way a banquet is laid out and places are set
 for the dead who are supposed to absorb the
 ethereal essence of the food after the meal the
 living go from house to house visiting the souls of
 their dead friends this running about town lasts
 for three days and then the times comes for the
 souls to return to their graves fires are again built
 in the streets and the people again take them back
 to the place where they met them three days be-
 fore in some places the people send lanterns and
 provisions out to sea in small boats for the spirits
 who have a long way to go

    there is always the fear that some poor souls
 have lagged behind or have hidden away so as not
 to be made to leave the place of their former life
 and those they love these reluctant spirits have
 to be hunted out and sent on their way to do
 this the people throw stones on their roofs and go
 through all the rooms with clubs which they swing
 savagely to chase away the lingering spirits
bellerophon and pegasus

	by leslie phelps	

the story of the winged horse pegasus
and his master bellerophon has furnished
the basic theme for a number of interest-
ing stories of fantasy not long ago in this
magazine the novelette mr beller and the
winged horse appeared-an excellent take-off
on the story of the mythical horse but there
was little connection between mr beller and his
early greek counterpart bellerophon the orig-
inal story from greek mythology is a fascinating
tale in itself-and remember-the greeks were no
slouches at contriving fantasies of the first order
even today our speech is punctuated with allu-
sions to that mythology

  bellerophon was supposedly the son of a
corinthian king who for undescribed reasons
committed an impulsive unpremeditated murder
in order to avoid punishment he fled his fathers
court to the court of king proteus who purified
him of his crime but proteus wife antea a
lovely young thing fell in love with bellerophon
a love which he did not return naturally she
slandered him to proteus

  proteus liked him so well however that he
could not bring himself to kill bellerophon per-
sonally so he sent him to a friends court the
court of iobates with a sealed cryptic letter tell-
ing that the bearer should be killed but beller-
ophon was favored of the gods iobates got to
like him also

  after a while iobates read the tablet but
having come to like and know bellerophon de-
cided that he couldnt do the job himself either
he sought for a way out he sent him to per-
form tasks which would undoubtedly result in
his death

  bellerophon prayed to the gods though in-
voking their protection and before setting out
to kill the chimaera a monster of three parts-
lion goat and dragon-received a magic bridle
which was to enable him to capture pegasus the
immortal winged horse quickly bellerophon
caught his flying steed and without difficulty rose
into the air and slew the chimaera the battle
was a furious affair because the lion-section of
the monster breathed fire yet such was the
speed of pegasus that bellerophon was enabled
to avoid the flames

  when he returned to iobates court beller-
ophon was sent on another mission the defeat
of a fierce tribe of warriors with pegasus
he vanquished them next on his list of tasks
came the battle with the amazons whom beller-
ophon also beat thoroughly

  finally iobates realized that bellerophon was

protected by the gods and that it was useless to
try to kill him bellerophon married iobates
daughter and shared in the rule of the land

  but owning pegasus was too much for beller-
ophon it was something like owning a super-
charged high-speed racing car bellerophon
became swollen with pride and vanity all this
time he had led a more than charmed life and
had escaped the dangers of a thousand lifetimes
his head got considerably bigger and he thought
he could do no wrong he decided to try to ride
to heaven on pegasus to see out of idle curiosity
just what the gods were like zeus observed all
this and in spite of his liking for the now rather
obnoxious youth became offended at his audacity
and decided to do something about it beller-
ophon was riding high on pegasus when a gad-
fly sent by zeus stung the winged horse who
bucked and threw his rider bellerophon plum-
meted to earth still his life was charmed and
he landed unhurt though pegasus was gone
forever

  in their anger with him the gods decided that
bellerophon who till now had been their favor-
ite should be suitably punished what better
way to make the youths life miserable than
sending him to the loneliest places on earth but
even this wasnt necessary bellerophon was
evidently a good guy at heart for he became
seized with remorse and regret at the way he
had lived he was so moved by the thoughts of
how blessed his life had been and how foolishly
he had thrown away his gifts that he was seized
with a terrible melancholy-probably mythol-
ogys first first-class manic-depressive the upshot
of it all was that he followed of his own accord
the intention of the punitive gods for he
wandered the rest of his life in the most desolate
and barren spots of the world

  so goes the original greek legend of beller-
ophon and pegasus but on a number of occa-
sions this has been changed and expanded among
the innumerable legends that are associated with
alexander the great is the one that he was
bellerophon in disguise in fact it is said that he
believed himself to be the greek hero in his less
rational moments of which he is reputed to have
had many

  the city of corinth erected an altar to beller-
ophon over the grave of poseidon god of the
sea and the crumbled remains are to be seen
today pegasus is recalled a thousand times today
and in a thousand ways-from the names of air-
craft to the bric-a-brac statuary that dominates
some cheap stores

orders for
willie weston

   by william p mcgivern

                                            tsfesp

when private first class
willie weston realized that
the grenade was going off in a
matter of seconds he thought with
classic detachment that it had been a
most peculiar sort of day

first there had been that business of
the orders   

he had been told that morning he was
being transferred to another outfit the
first sergeant instructed him to report
to the orderly room for his orders

willie had gone to the orderly room
as instructed and told the charge of
quarters what he wanted the cq was
a corporal with nine months of service
which made him quite an old cam-
paigner in this new army he picked
a copy of willies orders from a basket

old soldiers never die-their
reward comes on the parade ground-

but willie weston wasnt quite sure

                                              



fantastic adventures

and glanced at them perfunctorily

  you leave at eleven this morning
he said youre going to b company
third regiment-

  he stopped talking and looked at the
orders with new interest finally he
looked up frowning these orders are
snafued hold it a minute and ill check
with the captain

  he came from behind his desk and
went into the captains office willie
heard him talking then the captains
voice sounded weston come in here
willie walked nervously into the cap-
tains presence came to attention and
saluted

  at ease weston the captain said
returning the salute casually he was a
muscular graying man of about forty
he had a copy of willies orders in one
hand and he rubbed his chin with the
other

  these orders arent right he said
according to this youre being trans-
ferred to the th infantry youd
have a helluva job finding that outfit
i know sir willie said the
th was deactivated at munich in
forty-five they fought from africa
all the way to berlin and   willie
floundered and was silent

  the captain glanced curiously at
willie howd you remember all that
i-i used to read about it sir the
war i mean it was like a hobby
hmmn well carry on weston ill
get this straightened out at head-
quarters he glanced again at the or-
ders and smiled the th might
as well try to send you to the old rain-
bow division well he paused still
looking at the orders would you like
a copy of this as a souvenir

  yes sir very much

  its probably as close as youll ever
get to a combat division thats all
weston

  willie took the mimeographed sheet

  from the captain saluted and went out
to find the battery they were on the
parade ground listening to a lecture on
booby traps and grenades the men
were squatted in a semi-circle listening
to a lieutenant who was trying vainly to
keep them interested

  willie found a seat in the front row
and squatted down he tried to listen
but it was impossible his thoughts
strayed to the orders in his pocket

  the th infantry  one of the
real glory outfits willie had followed
their exploits for three years he had
been a kid then fourteen years old
and the war had been a fascinating
parade which he would have given his
soul to join but it had ended when he
was seventeen and he could still recall
his half-guilty feeling of disappoint-
ment

yrhen he was eighteen he had been
drafted into the peacetime army
which wasnt the same thing at all
there were no heroes no romance no
boom of guns to counterpoint the ca-
dence of marching men there was just
gray routine and other lonely kids of
high school age

  that was about when the business
with the grenade happened willie was
too lost in his thoughts to remember
just how it happened but he heard
everyone yelling suddenly and then they
were scrambling away from him in
every direction he heard a lieutenant
yell hit the ground and then he
saw the grenade

  it was right in front of him a pecu-
liar looking thing with a handle on it
quite different from the other grenades
hed seen in the army he stared in
fascination too surprised to move

  he was conscious of the hot sun on
his neck and the baked dusty ground
he heard shouts and running feet and he
heard a horrible little ticking sound
orders for willie weston



coming from the strange looking gre-
nade

  that was when he realized it was
going off any second

  there was no time to run there was
hardly time to feel fear he stood up
and threw himself toward the grenade
without any precise idea of what might
happen

  he heard a noise then that was so
vast his ears had trouble assimilating it
it was all around him like fog and it
seemed to come through his body his
pores and his lungs as well as his ears
there was pain for a moment but it was
too great to hurt very much

  that was all there was to it the
sound and the pain and then the dark-
ness   

  he didnt know what to expect when
he opened his eyes the pain was gone
and it was quiet now he was standing
in what appeared to be an orderly room
there was a youthful second lieutenant
sitting behind a desk glancing at some
papers

  willie was very surprised by this deal

  the young lieutenant who had unruly
blond hair and clean blue eyes finally
looked at him and grinned

  hello he said

  hello willie said blankly

  then he remembered a number of
things chief of which was the courtesy
he should accord the lieutenants gold
bars he snapped to attention and
saluted

  the lieutenant smiled good naturedly
and came around the desk relax
soldier he said we dont use that
stuff here my names pete he stuck
out a hand

  willie brought his hand down from
his forehead and shook hands gingerly
with the lieutenant

  im a little mixed up sir he said

  never mind the sir whats on your

mind

  well a grenade went off and i was
pretty close to it willie said he
looked around the neat orderly room as
if expecting to find the walls sagging
from blast its all very funny he
went on

  youll get used to it the lieutenant
named pete said i got mine with a
mortar took me a while to get oriented
when i got here

  well where am i

  this is b company th infan-
try the lieutenant said

  but you were all killed willie
gasped

  the lieutenant chuckled brother
say that again i guess we got ex-
pended faster than any outfit in the
war set a record for casualties i
think he seemed quite proud of this
fact

  then im- willie couldnt finish
the sentence

  thats right the lieutenant said
youre kaput dont worry about it
the big thing is that youre in the wrong
outfit now do you have your orders
with you

  orders willie shook his head he
fumbled automatically through his
pockets and his fingers touched the
mimeographed sheet his captain had
given him as a souvenir

ou got em pete said he
reached over and plucked the
papers from willies pocket ill see
where youre supposed to go and get
you started on your way i dont see
how you got here in the first place

  he opened the paper and glanced at
the orders

  you see he said were a deac-
tivated outfit we dont take any re-
cruits

  i see willie said feeling strangely
inadequate


fantastic adventures

  you should probably have gone
to-

  he stopped and rubbed his forehead
with the back of his hand holy
smoke something is really fouled up
these orders are made out for us he
stuck the paper in front of willies eyes
and pointed unbelievingly at the typed
instructions see that b company
th infantry plain as the nose on
your face what dya know

its a mistake i guess willie said
why sure it is boy what a mess 
i was going to be transferred
willie said they cut the wrong or-
ders i had em with me when the gre-
nade went off

  the lieutenant frowned thoughtfully
yeah thats the deal you had the
orders on you when you got it so head-
quarters sent you over here probably
didnt bother checking it he said
gloomily stupid so-and-sos

  willie gulped does headquarters
up here get things fouled up too
the lieutenant shook his head de-
spairingly brother they make more
mistakes here than anywhere else he
grinned suddenly but it gives us
something to gripe about and by the
way i wouldnt say up here when
youre referring to this place

  willie looked at him in horror is it
down here

  the lieutenant looked around cau-
tiously then leaned closer to willie
its hard to say he said confident-
ially sometimes im not sure just
play it safe say here

  all right willie said weakly
now the lieutenant said ill get
this thing straightened out meantime
you might as well have chow with us
i am hungry willie said

  well well take good care of you
ill find one of the boys to show you
around sometime this afternoon ill
probably have the dope on these orders

and ill look you up you should be
with your regular outfit by this eve-
ning

  thanks a lot sir willie said

  now watch that the lieutenant
said warningly im easy going and i
dont mind that sir business but
some officers up here are pretty chicken
and theyll raise hell if you dont sir
em

  ill watch it willie said feeling
light headed

  the lieutenant led him out to the
company street willie looked about
in awe this wasnt a gi company
street there was a wide expanse of
bright green grass that looked cool and
fresh flanking this wide avenue were
barracks but they werent gfl either
the barracks were made of glass brick
that caught the soft sun in thousands
of sparkling lights

  outside the orderly room door a
lanky wide-shouldered sergeant was
lying in the sun he had an arm
flung over his face and was snoring
peacefully

  hey mac the lieutenant called
wake up a minute

  the sergeant woke slowly he took
his arm away from his face and blinked
his eyes and then rolled on his side

  whats up pete he asked lazily

  the lieutenant nodded at willie
this guy got sent to us by mistake
how about taking care of him until i
get it straightened out

  mac got to his feet and grinned at
willie sure he said he stuck
out a big hard hand glad to know
you my names mac

  im willie weston willie said

  he swallowed hard when he saw the
decorations mac was wearing on the
left breast of his khaki shirt there
was an eto ribbon with seven battle
stars a purple heart the bright red
and white of a silver star a dsc with
orders for willie weston



an oak leaf cluster above these was
a blue ribbon with seven small stars
arranged in a double triangle forma-
tion the medal of honor

  mac was homely he had a red
angular face and twinkling gray eyes
his hair was black and rumpled and
he needed a shave he didnt stand
the way a soldier should willie
thought his shoulders slumped one
leg was bent at the knee and there were
two buttons off his shirt but there
was something relaxed and quiet about
him that gave the impression that he
could move in a hurry if he cared to

  ill take you over to the barracks
willie mac said you can meet
some of the guys and get in a little
sacktime if you want to

  pete the lieutenant smiled at willie
then slapped him on the shoulder

  ill get you straightened out on
orders he said

  thanks willie said he hesitated
awkwardly then said i couldnt just
stay here i suppose

  im afraid not soldier pete said
in a kind voice you see this is a
combat outfit

  i-i see willie said

tlte smiled uncertainly at pete
then followed mac across the
company street to the first barracks

  howd you happen to get here any-
way mac said

  well it was sort of a mistake
willie explained they made a mis-
take on the orders in my outfit but
i got-well i got it before the orders
could be changed	a

  well dont worry about it mac
said youll get assigned to a train-
ing company thats a snap up here
no hikes no inspections two or three
day passes every week quite a deal
willie stole a sidelong glance at
macs decorations these training

outfits are made up of guys like me
arent they

  howd you mean

  well guys who never were in com-
bat

  thats right

  willie sighed and his heart felt
heavy he shot another look at macs
ribbons he wanted to know about
how those had been earned but he
had enough sense not to ask

  mac led him into a large barracks
where a dozen men were sprawled
about on comfortable cots mac put
his hand on willies shoulder and said
this here is a new arrival men hes
just come over from that new army
there was a good natured laugh
from the men

  but hes going to be with us for a
while until he gets assigned to his regu-
lar outfit his name is willie weston
the men said hello and some of them
came over and shook willies hand
he saw more silver stars more dscs
and two more medals of honor also
some of the men wore shoulder loops
from belgium holland and france

  mac took him then to a bunk at the
end of the barracks you can use this
today he said mines right next to
it so if you want anything ill be
handy

  he looked willie over carefully and
then shook his head

  one thing were having an inspec-
tion in about ten minutes so you
better get fixed up

  gosh willie said he didnt need
a shave he knew he never did but
he knew he wasnt in shape for an
inspection he looked down the bar-
racks and saw that most of the men
needed shaves and were wearing uni-
forms that were clean but wrinkled
and frayed there were cigarette butts
on the floor and magazines scattered
around carelessly


fantastic adventures

  what should i do he asked mac

  first better take off that tie mac
said then pull your trousers out of
them boots and let em sort of hang
around your ankles you could muss
your hair up a little but that aint
strictly necessary

  willie stared hard at mac to see if
he was kidding but macs long angu-
lar face was quite earnest

  what kind of an inspection is it
willie said flabbergasted

  regular saturday morning inspec-
tion he smiled then at willies ex-
pression but its a little different
you see

  i guess it is willie said weakly

  he took off his tie and pulled his
neatly creased trousers free from the
top of his boots then he unbuttoned
the top buttons of his shirts and the
buttons on his shirt pockets

  thats a lot better mac said ap-
provingly

  a few minutes later pete the lieu-
tenant willie had met in the orderly
room came into the barracks he
talked to a few men and then came
down to willie

  ill have you straightened out by
tonight he said everything going
okay

  yes everythings going fine wil-
lie said

  pete chatted with him for a while
and then left the barracks after prom-
ising to get in touch as soon as anything
definite developed on the orders

  you can put your tie back on
mac grinned that is if it makes you
more comfortable

  was that the inspection willie
cried

  well its not really an inspection
mac said we just like to clown
around that way sort of remind us
how lucky we are now some of the
guys go for days without shaving just

to look like hell for the saturday morn-
ing inspection makes em feel real
good i guess

  chow call sounded a little later mac
took him to the mess hall which was
unlike anything willie had seen in the
army there was no standing in line
no waiting they went into a com-
fortable room with small tables and at
down to eat music came from some-
where and the tunes were things like
the artillery song and the beer barrel
polka

  after eating they went back to the
barracks and stretched out on their
cots mac lit a cigarette and blew
smoke toward the ceiling

  this is really the nice time of day
here he said

  through the windows willie saw it
was getting darker from somewhere
came the faint music of to the colors
and a cannon boomed far away willie
noticed that the men in the barracks
were quiet now they smoked cigar-
ettes and listened to the retreat music
with little smiles on their lips

  when the echoes of the cannon faded
into the swiftly darkening night mac
grinned sideways at him this is how
we stand retreat he said its just
as respectful i guess as any other way
and it seems more peaceful

  when it was dark the men strolled
out to the back of the barracks

  mac looked at willie want to go
outside its nice out there now

y illie went out with mac into
the moon-lighted area behind the
barracks someone had built a small
fire men squatted about the fire talk-
ing an occasional cigarette flared in
the darkness above the moon was
peaceful in a black sky beyond was
a fringe of trees silhouetted vaguely
against the shadowy horizon a soft
cool wind was blowing and it was just
orders for willie weston



enough to make the fire comfortable

  mac sat down at the edge of the
group and willie squatted beside him
the men were talking now their voices
a quiet murmuring against the crackle
of the fire

  willie looked around at their faces
highlighted in pale relief by the leap-
ing flames the faces were wistful
the conversation was running to battles
that had been fought long ago they
were old soldiers now squatting about
an immemorial campfire reliving cam-
paigns that existed only in their mem-
ories

  the talk swung to kasserine pass
a man who had seen his regiments
colors captured by germans told the
story half in bitterness half in amuse-
ment there was a quiet chuckle from
a boyish looking soldier on his right
the young soldier wore decorations
that many three star generals would
envy he looked about nineteen

  he mentioned anzio

  we dug in remember he said

  there was a general murmur of re-
membrance that had in it a note of
weary scorn

  we took three days to dig in the
youngster said smiling a little now
nobody knew jerry was sitting up
on the hills watching us had every
square foot of the beach zeroed in with
eighty-eights when we got set nice
and snug with latrines dug fox holes
all set and supply troops coming in to
look for souvenirs then jerry let go
those gunners didnt have much of a
job all they had to do was pull the
lanyards and re-load he chuckled
a little some time

  there was a footnote to salerno
another to omaha beach the code
name for the yank beach at cherbourg

  how about that colonel some-
body laughed he said dont stand
around here on the beach and die go

in a few miles-then die

  willie listened to their stories and
he felt something stirring in him he
felt sad but it was such a big sadness
that it just didnt get absorbed but
it hung around him coming from tired
mocking voices from sudden grins
from the crackling fire and the moon
above in the black sky

  he heard the story of the break-
through at st lo there was a com-
mentary on avranches another on
paris-before paris became a rest cen-
ter these stories werent like the ones
hed read in the states there was no
glamor no romance no thrilling pulse-
quickening lift in these stories of war
told in hard tired voices

  these werent the stories the war
correspondents wrote or the people at
home read

  gi joe was a hero in those stories
he was a funny little guy who was
fighting for hot dogs and baseball he
didnt mind the cold and the danger as
long as there was a hot dog waiting
for him when he got home he was a
hero who wasnt afraid of nazi artil-
lery

  that rotten eighty-eight some-
body said with a bitter laugh i ran
into a battery of them during the
bulge i remember asking my platoon
commander what we were supposed to
be doing out on a road where we
couldnt turn around while those
eighty-eights picked us off he said
dont you want to be a hero i said
hell no and he said neither do i
and the reason were here getting our
heads shot off is that i cant think of
anything better to do

  i remember another voice said
when our captain told us we were
going to get von rundstedt he said
we were trying to find him so we could
offer him a raise and get him on our
side


fantastic adventures

  mac said unexpectedly hell it
wasnt that bad and you guys know
it

  maybe not the boyish looking
soldier said grinning anyway it
doesnt look so bad now i guess the
thing to do is forget it its over and
nobody knows what all the shouting
was about

  youre wrong there soldier a
curiously mild voice beside willie said
the voice was soft but it carried a
ring in it that sent a little chill down
willies spine he looked at the speak-
er but he was squatting in the shadow
he could see only a long tired face and
thinning gray hair

hphe thing is not to forget it the
speaker said and his voice was
firm and the men about the fire looked
at him in silence its over its true
and some people claim it was a waste
they claim we fought the wrong
people that it wasnt our business
anyway when a man talks that way
i wonder what theatre he served in
during the war peculiarly enough it
generally develops that he hasnt
served at all the shouting you men-
tion soldier started and got loud be-
cause somebody was getting pushed
around they didnt do the hollering
they werent in a position to we did
the hollering because were funny
people that way we just dont like
to see people pushed around so we
went to war and because we like to do
things right we did a helluva lot of
pushing around ourselves now its
over the thing to remember is that
we did a necessary job and we did it
damn well and were ready to do it
again if we have to

  the man stopped talking then and
there was silence he smiled then and
said i didnt mean to monopolize
your bull session

  someone said thats all right in
a quiet voice

  the man stood up and the firelight
flickered over his face and uniform
im going to turn in he said smiling
good night boys

  willie looked at him revealed in the
firelight and there was a lump in his
throat as big as a billiard ball

  the man was tall and strong looking
there were four rows of ribbons above
the left breast pocket of his ike jacket
and when he put on his burnished
helmet willie saw four silver stars
gleaming across its front

  he nodded to the men and walked
away into the night and willie saw
the firelight flick across his polished
boots and on the handles of- pearl
handled revolvers which hung at his
waist

  thats the boss mac said to wil-
lie pretty good guy

  why thats-

  sure it is mac grinned he runs
the whole show he can still raise a
little hell too he said thoughtfully

  willie felt a tug at his sleeve it
was pete the lieutenant from the or-
derly room i got you all set he
said come on along

  mac looked at him and said ill
come along with you willie

  they walked across the company
street in silence willies sadness was
getting little enough now to feel he
didnt want to leave here this wasnt
what he thought the old soldiers wene
like but it was what he wanted he
knew he had no right in this company
and he tried to straighten his shoulders
and swallow the lump in his throat

  inside the orderly room a light was
burning pete picked up a mimeo-
graphed order from his desk youre
all set now you report from here to
the thirtieth basic training battalion
willie nodded and looked miserably
orders for willie weston



at mac t-thanks a lot for showing
me around he said

  mac was leaning against the door
his long angular face was thoughtful
he pushed a strand of black hair from
his eyes and said you like it here
with us dont you kid

  gosh yes willie cried

  mac looked at pete couldnt we
do something about that seems like
we need a recruit whats an outfit
without a recruit

  pete shook his head the orders
are pretty definite mac theres just
no way around it

  well mac said stubbornly
couldnt we have an inquiry or some-
thing maybe we could get the orders
changed the kid likes it here i
dont see why he cant stay

  ill do anything you want willie
said desperately

  pete said thats not the point
youre not a combat man thats
nothing against you but this just isnt
your place

  howd you get it mac demanded
of willie

  a grenade got me it was at a
lecture willie said

  you see pete said at a lecture
there might be some technicality we
could use but getting killed at a lecture
is like being run over by a truck on
the way to a draft board

  well it was a grenade mac said
defensively thats how you got it
yourself

  mine was mortar shrapnel pete
said anyway it happened at salerno
which makes a little difference

vjltillie felt grateful to mac but
he knew there was no chance
the sadness in him was deeper dont
worry about me he said and he tried
to smile i know i dont belong here
i guess i wouldnt have been killed at

all if i hadnt been day-dreaming dur-
ing the lecture the grenade just rolled
over in front of me and was too sur-
prised to do anything i thought about
grabbing the handle and throwing it
away but there wasnt time i got
excited and jumped on top of it it
was all my fault he concluded honest-
ly-

  you see pete said again theres
just no hope

  but mac snapped his fingers lis-
ten kid you say you were going to
pick up the grenade by the handle
what the hell kind of a grenade was
it

  i dont know willie said but
it was like a tin can with a handle on
it

  a potato masher mac said

  no it was a real grenade i know
because it went off

  a potato masher is what we called
german grenades mac said patiently
he looked at pete how about that
he got it from a german grenade
thats the way a lot of guys here got it
and he was trying to save his buddies
hell theres a good case

  pete looked at willies orders again
and frowned maybe you got some-
thing ill have to send these back
headquarters here is so snafued that
itll take months to get em straightened
out again probably itll turn out all
right he grinned suddenly at willie
well give it a whirl

  mac grabbed willie by the arm
well what do you say now he
laughed

  willie was too delirious to say any-
thing he just gulped and he felt the
sadness leaving him finally he laughed
and then mac slapped him on the
shoulder and dragged him out of the
orderly room

  they walked back toward the group
at the campfire ahead the moon was


fantastic adventures

rising against a black sky the wind
was sharper now and the fire looked
warm and inviting
from somewhere a long way off a
clear bugle sounded taps mournfully
the

it was always a sad thing for willie
to hear but now as he walked beside
mac to the soldiers at the fire he felt
different about it it didnt sound sad
at all

comets and meteors

	by frances yerxa	

from the beginning of time superstitious
people have always regarded comets as pre-
ludes to disaster in  many chinese
people shot off fireworks in hopes of driving
haleys comet away in the united states many
people believed that the comet of  foretold
the war and that donetis comet in s brought
on the civil war the ancients didnt understand
the nature of a comet at all aristotle thought of
them as some sort of exhalations coming out of
the earth and becoming inflamed as they reached
the upper atmosphere some early astronomers
thought comets were living creatures possessed of
wills and purpose swimming about in outer space
like a fish in the ocean some described comets as
being blood-red and taking the form of a hand
with a flaming sword

  before the invention of the telescope only the
very largest comets could be seen only about 
comets were recorded before  since then the
number of comets has increased since the telescopes
have become more powerful about  comets
have been recorded since  there are about
five a year now except in  there were eleven

  when a comet is first picked up with a telescope
it is only a star-like spot of light with a fuzzy
appearance as it comes closer a tail begins to
develop the tail increases in length as the comet
approaches the sun the tail always points away
from the sun so that when the comet goes back
the tail streams out in front of it

the head of the comet is made up of two
parts a small bright center called the
nucleus and around this a hazy mass called the
coma the diameter of the coma will range any-
where from  to  miles while the
nucleus is seldom more than  miles in diameter
the tail may be from  to 
miles in length but while the amount of space
covered by the comet is great the amount of mat-
ter making up the comet is relatively small as-
tronomers are sure that the nucleus of the comet is
a mixture of dust particles and gases perhaps con-
taining some pebbles and rocks the coma is com-
posed of a thin gaseous material and dust particles

so fine that stars can be seen shining through it
the tail consists of a gaseous material driven out
of the head of the comet by the rays of the sun
the light of a comet is believed to be reflected sun-
light and some sort of phosphorescence due to the
influence of sunlight it was once thought that
comets entered our solar system from outer stellar
space but now it is believed that they belong to
our system they may be composed of matter
erupted from the sun or from the major planets
soon after the solar system came into existence or
they might be bits of matter picked up by our sys-
tem  years ago our solar system con-
tains about  comets most comets move
in such large orbits that they come into our view
about once in a thousand years but the ones that
move in smaller orbits are seen quite frequently
the most famous of these is haileys comet this
brilliant comet appeared in  hailey calculated
that the bright comets of the past coincided with
the orbits of the comet of  and also the ones
of  and  from that he concluded that
they were the same comet returning approximately
every  years he predicted its return for 
but died before his prediction proved true it has
since returned in  and  and is due again
in 

  shooting stars as we call them are not really
stars at all but small bits of matter most are no
larger than a grain of sand but some weigh tons
they have been called cosmic rubbish they may
be material that was left over when planets were
created if the idea that the planets were formed
from material pulled out of the sun is correct then
this material was probably pulled out of the sun
at the same time these bits of material are not
visible until its path crosses that of the earth as
it enters the earths atmosphere the friction causes
it to melt and it vaporizes and disappears shoot-
ing stars are known to astronomers as meteors

occasionally a large meteor comes into
the earths atmosphere and a piece of it falls
to the earth this piece is called a meteorite
meteorites are important because they are the only
tangible connection with outer space it can be
comets and meteors



handled and put through a chemical analysis
sometimes just one piece fallk and again there
will be a number of fragments in  about

	meteorites fell at pultusk most of them
were very small the largest meteorite was found
in greenland by admiral peary it weighed 
tons some meteorites are composed of crystalline
rock and some are made up mostly of iron and
then some are a mixture of iron and dark heavy
rock in the arizona desert there is a crater about

	feet in dameter the walls of the crater
rise iso feet above the desert and it sinks several
hundred feet below the level of the desert
thousands of meteors have been found near this
crater and within the walls astronomers think
that it is the result of a group of meteorites or
perhaps just one enormous one which struck the
earth a thousand years ago the largest known
meteoric fall was the siberian fall in  it was
in northern siberia where news travels slowly

     history of the
     vampire ustrels

	by jon barry 

  a n ustrel is a christian child that is born
on saturday and dies before he can be
-i - baptized on the ninth day after burial
he digs his way out of the grave and attacks the
cattle sucking their blood all night and returning
to the grave at daybreak to rest from his nights
labors the bulgarians have claimed that their
herds have suffered much from raids of these
ustrels after about ten nights of these blood-
sucking attacks he becomes so well fortified his
body can stand longer journeys and he joins huge
herds of cattle and sheep and no longer returns
to the grave for rest during the day he rides
between the horns of a cow or ram the ustrel
starts with the fattest cow of the herd and works
his way down perhaps sucking the blood from
at least five cows a night it is very important
for the peasants to protect their herds against
the ravages of these vampires this is the method
used on saturday morning the village drummer
gives the signal to put out all the fires in the
village then all the animals are driven out into
the open the men of the village march in front
of the herds they go into the woods and gather
wood to make two bon-fires one on each side of
a road that they know is frequented by wolves
the herds are driven between these two fires the
vampire is supposed to become frightened and
fall off by the fires no one goes near these black-
ened remains for several days for the ustrel might
get up and follow them back to the village if he
is left alone for several days a wolf is sure to come
along and eat him and the herdsmen can see the
ground soaked with his slimy blood

and it wasnt until  that the information
found its way into the russian cities and aroused
some interest then the world war began and
no one had time for such rumors but in 
the soviet sent an expedition to investigate the
findings were terrifying they found that a group
of meteorites had struck the ground making over
 depressions some were  feet in diameter
the ground for fifteen miles around was charred
as though it had been worked on with an enor-
mous blow torch and for  miles around the
trees were uprooted and their limbs were all point-
ing away from the central area this was probably
caused by the terrific force of air as it rushed out
from the center of impact the meteorites were
estimated at  tons if one of these meteor-
ites were to drop on one of our large cities it
would without a doubt destroy every single in-
habitant

  

forecast of
tomorrows breakfast

	by j r marks 

tomorrows breakfast can be prepared
in a jiffy without once bothering to open
the refrigerator and heres just a sample
menu to give you an idea of what youll be get-
ting up to eat not too far from now

   supposing you like oranges-well there are two
and a half cases of oranges concentrated in that
gallon jar on the shelf just water added from
the tap will give you the amount of liquid you
want and your oranges will be kept as fresh and
full of vitamins as if they were just recently pur-
chased from the corner grocer theyll keep for
weeks and with no refrigeration

   the toast is baked inside out with electric cur-
rents and bacon strips are protected by plastic
wrappings which keep in the flavor and prevent
spoilage if you want the eggs to go with that
bacon just dip a spoon into a can of yellow pow-
der mix with water and milk and theres the
scrambled eggs

  a cake the size of a candy bar when mixed
with hot or cold water will give you your break-
fast cereal without adding any sugar or cream-
theyre included already

   if you like tea for breakfast just add a lozenge
to a cup of hot water and the coffee youll be
drinking will probably be wheat or barley or rye
instead of coffee as the furfuryl mercaptan which
scientists find is what gives coffee its flavor will
be added into the cereal you use for coffee

  many of these dehydrated products are already
on sale and the rest are just around the corner
of the market in fact tomorrows breakfast
might very well be had today
  the drums of murd

by h b

tv r rogers his secretary
  said there is a call for
- you-

she hesitated and mr rogers nerv-
ously rubbed the bald spot on his head
as she left the sentence hanging in mid-
air he had an idea who the call was
from and it gave him a sinking feel-

hickey

ing in his stomach

its mrs brooks in the rosmond
towers the girl finished

the rosmond towers was one of the
great apartment buildings that thrust
itself into the sky along chicagos lake
front it had been managed by the firm
of rogers and stone for some years
    lane magruder heard the drums beat
their slow pulsating rhythm - and jjien
suddenly the world grew dark around him

at first with pleasure and lately with
the feelings entertained by a father
whose wife has just presented him with
a two-headed baby

 put her on mr rogers said
glumly

  it was a one way conversation his
end of it consisted merely of the use of

the three letter affirmative once he
said it did and his secretary looked
at him in surprisehis glance at her said
plaintively how could you do this to
me she knew as well as he what mrs
brooks had to say to him

  yes mrs brooks well look into
it again he closed wearily


fantastic adventures

  he set the phone back on its cradle
and stared at it balefully lately it
had got so that when it rang he had an
impulse to run and hide in the mens
room enough was enough there was
going to be an end to this rosmond
towers affair

 stone

  a dozen stenographers lost a year of
their lives each as mr rogers bellow
resounded through the room mr bol-
ton gulped and reached for a chalk
tablet these sudden shocks were def-
initely bad for his ulcers and mr
stone shot from his desk at the other
end of the big room and ran as though
rogers had lit a fire under him he
came up puffing

  good grief rogers you cant do
things like that youve thrown the
office into a panic

  fine rogers told his junior part-
ner now theyll know how i feel
about calls from that building

  oh come now theres no reason-
there isnt then why are the
calls always shunted to me why dont
you take them

  why it just happens-

  it just happens youve let the girl
at the switchboard understand that the
rosmond towers is my headache
well let me tell you a few things-
he told him the entire office staff
settled back to listen with quiet satis-
faction about time stone with his
tailored elegance and condescending
manner was no favorite he had in-
herited the partnership from his father
but he had inherited no desire for work

  and finally but not least mr
rogers concluded you were supposed
to rent that penthouse apartment why
havent you dne it

  if theres one thing i have tried to
do its that stone said in an offended
tone but every time the building
superintendent is showing the pent-

house to a prospective tenant mrs
brooks herself comes up to queer
things

  i could throttle that woman rog-
ers muttered

  still it must be terrible on the
womans nerves to live directly below
that awful thing

  its ruining mine and i dont live
there rogers admitted but that
doesnt let you out what are you do-
ing about it

  today stone told him grimly i
have advertised that penthouse at a
rental which is so low well be losing a
fortune on it

  behind them a voice said thats
the only way i could afford it

che was tall for a girl with long
naturally wavy ash-blonde hair and
a complexion that did not come from a
make-up kit her neatly tailored suit
did nothing to accentuate her figure
but neither did it detract she had a
sweetly firm chin and a pair of cool
gray eyes that did things to mr stone

  that gentleman opened his mouth
and produced a gulp the situation
was left for his senior partner to save
mr rogers rose with a courtly bow

  i am mr rogers may we be of
any assistance

  im carol dorne the girl ex-
tended a hand which mr rogers was
tempted out of gratitude and sudden
chivalry to kiss

  im interested in the apartment
which you and this gentleman were dis-
cussing at least i think thats the
one

  she produced a clipping from the
want-ad section of the morning paper
and laid it on the desk mr stone
took one look at the clipping and
nodded

  thats it all right

  fine if you can draw up a lease
the drums of murd



right now ill sign it while im here
stones face lit up and he was off
like a shot mr rogers called him
back

  just a minute its only fair to
warn miss dorne

  her smile made rogers wish he were
thirty years younger

  that really is sweet of you but
im not a child i realize that such a
ridiculously low rental means some-
thing is wrong with the apartment
oh its quite beautiful stone pro-
tested

  shut up rogers snapped he
turned to the girl

  are you a sound sleeper miss
dorne

  i sleep like a log

  her eyes were suddenly wide like a
child who has been told there is no
santa claus and then finds her fond-
est dream wrapped up in red ribbon
under the christmas tree

  you mean its haunted oh that
would be too wonderful

  oh would it mr rogers grunted
i take it you dont believe in ghosts
im not sure but im not afraid of
them

  good nevertheless well insert a
clause in the lease which will allow you
to vacate without giving us notice
youre more than kind but i dont
think that will be necessary all my
life ive dreamed of the time when i
could come to the big city and live in
a penthouse i wont be frightened away
very easily

  within ten minutes a regular lease
had been drawn up carol dorne
signed her name in clear feminine hand-
writing handed over two months rent
and the apartment was hers

  and now if youd like mr rogers
said well drive you over and show
you the place

  im sorry but i dont have the time

ive got to rush to morning rehearsal
if you can give me the keys or see
that theyre sent to the theater ill have
my things moved in this afternoon and
i can move in this evening right after
the performance

  youre an actress mr stone
breathed he had come to life again

  uhuh the ingenue in tantrum
at the gelwyn

  she bent and scribbled something on
a card which she had taken from her
purse they could see her sign her name
at the end with a smile she handed the
card to mr rogers

  id like you to be my guest at to-
nights performance

  his blush went clear up to the roots
of his white hair

  i should be delighted and i would
like my wife to see you act

  i knew you would the pass is for
two

mr rogers was still beaming
when he and his wife were ush-
ered to a pair of the best seats in the
house then the curtain went up and
he settled back to watch the perform-
ance

  the play had little to commend it in
the way of good writing but the act-
ing was superb and the girls per-
formance brought a glow of almost pa-
ternal pride to mr rogers face she
was no polished actress but what she
lacked in finish she more than made up
with the honesty of her presentation
her personality was projected clearly
across the footlights and the audience
loved her

  isnt she wonderful mr rogers
nudged his wife i wish we had a
daughter like that

  youre an old romantic sam the
white haired lady at his side smiled
and a dear do you think we could
go backstage to meet her


fantastic adventures

  im sure we could and i hope
those roses i sent came in time

  you are a dear now come along
they made their way through the
crowd that eddied behind the stage and
through the wings to the dressing
rooms ouside carol domes door
bouquets were banked against the wall
and when they were admitted to the
room they saw that those outside had
been only the overflow but on her
dressing table there was a single vase
of long stemmed roses

  mr rogers was touched he saw
that there were tears in the girls eyes
when he presented her to his wife and
he felt quietly happy when he saw
that his wife took the girl to her heart

  i guess ill always be small town
carol told them the orchids and the
camellias are exciting and so are all
the men who send them and who want
to take me out but today was the first
time i really felt at home here

  its because of you mr rogers
first you were so concerned about me
taking the penthouse even though you
wanted to rent it and now the roses
its nothing really miss dorne
i- he was embarrassed and happy
when a change of subject came quickly
to mind

  oh about the penthouse im still
concerned about you living there we
were so flustered about renting it that
we didnt explain quite fully

  i dont want you to explain im
really not afraid-of whatever it is
youre worried about

  oh it hasnt harmed anyone i ad-
mit that but this afternoon a fellow
came in to see about renting it he
was upset when i told him someone had
taken it and he was quite insistent
offered fabulous sums if youd sub-let
it to him

  not interested carol dorne told
him i dont care how much he of-

fered

  thats how i thought youd feel i
told him so but he said hed call again
tomorrow anyway in case you changed
your mind i was glad to get rid of him
odd sort of chap all bundled up de-
spite the heat and he kept his hat
pulled low over his eyes might have
been a gangster

  now you are trying to frighten miss
dorne his wife accused

  i guess so dont suppose he was a
gangster but he did give me an odd
feeling i will say that

  carol dorne was staring at him
there was an apprehensive feeling in
the pit of her stomach something was
wrong and she didnt know what it was
on the other hand it hadnt harmed
anyone as mr rogers had said and
he wouldnt have let her take it if there
were any real danger

  just what does go on there she
asked

  noises

  you mean clanking chains and that
sort of thing

  a sort of drumming very disturb-
ing weve had it looked into but we
cant locate the cause in the structure
probably

  what happened to the last tenant
they moved to new york the
drumming started before we could rent
it again it isnt constant at night
mostly and not even every night
well i can always stuff cotton in
my ears

  nevertheless i wish i hadnt rented
it to you i- he sat down and stared
blankly at the wall he didnt know
himself why he was so concerned but
he was

  how would it be if mrs rogers
stayed with you the first night he
asked hopefully

  id be glad to do it his wife said
  of course not its very kind of you
the drums of murd



to offer but i couldnt let you and i
promise ill be all right in fact ill call
you first thing in the morning hows
that

  it will have to do i suppose mr
rogers said glumly

  oh were just a couple of old fools
his wife told him worrying the poor
child wed better be going sam its
past our bedtime

cjie rubbed her cheek where mrs

   rogers had kissed her affection-
ately they were nice old people and
they hadnt meant to worry her by be-
ing overly solicitous after all there
must be a thousand other people who
were living at the rosmond towers
suddenly the uncertainty was gone and
she was eager to see the penthouse she
had rented

  dressing quickly carol dabbed some
powder on her nose slung her purse
over her shoulder and was ready to go
outside the theater the doorman whis-
tled for a cab held the door open for
her

  where to lady the driver asked

  the rosmond towers

  she settled back caught him giving
her an appreciative once-over in the
rear view mirror that helped too it
was such an every-day occurrence
turning off randolph street and into
michigan boulevard the cab driver
waved to a big blue-shirted policeman
the policeman waved back things
were normal again

  but at the rosmond towers the
doorman bowed as he held open the
big door and looking over his shoulder
carol felt the uneasiness return

  a man had come around the corner
and the wind on the drive had blown
his hat upward so that he had to grab
for it for an instant his forehead was
exposed and carol dorne had the
queerest feeling that there was a hole

in his forehead and that she could see
all the way through

  youre miss dorne

  she whirled it was only the elevator
man friendly smiling with a bridge
of freckles across his nose

  yes yes i am

  she was breathless her heart was
pounding strangely as she looked back
at the door the man was going past
without even looking in

  mr rogers called the elevator
man was saying he told me to watch
for you said i should go up with you
and see that everything was all right

  how kind

  sure hes really nice that mr
rogers hes always-

  his voice went on friendly steady-
ing that was better just a nice
everyday voice preoccupation with
unnatural things could make anyone
nervous she thought a man with a
hole all the way through his forehead
how could she even have imagined such
a thing

  she was laughing at herself when she
gave the elevator man the keys so he
could open the door for her he found
the light switch at once and the apart-
ment was flooded with light

  it was more beautiful than she had
dared hope richly furnished every
room was different and there were
only four of them easy to take
care of

  the elevator man went ahead of her
searching every nook and cranny he
dug into the closets peered under the
bed and she felt foolish

  that isnt necessaryshe smiled

  mr rogers said i should do it
he told her

  he opened the big glass doors that
faced the lake and went out on the
terrace and prowled about but there
was nothing a man could have hidden
behind he was shaking his head when


fantastic adventures

he came in

  all clear

  he hesitated grinned at her

  if that mrs brooks comes up to
bother you dont pay any attention to
her i think shes got drums in her
head you know- his finger de-
scribed a circle at his temple

  he handed back the keys and carol
watched him go then she shot the
bolt behind him and turned to look
at her penthouse again she felt like
a queen in the midst of that luxury
it was just perfect just what shed
dreamed of

  but it was a bit warm and even a
little musty probably hadnt been oc-
cupied in months she went to the
windows on the south and threw them
open then crossed the room and swung
wide the doors to the terrace lake
michigan stretched out far below and
the breeze that swept over it was cool

  suddenly the premonition was with
her again it clutched at her heart and
the wind was no longer cool but chill
what seemed so strange about that
breeze she wondered it blew not
steadily but in measured gusts no
that wasnt the wind it was the room
which throbbed

  the drums began to beat

chapter ii

t ane magruder settled him-
self back in his chair lifted his
feet and made a space for them on the
littered laboratory desk by kicking
aside that mornings paper hed al-
ready gone through that from the front
page headlines to the last want-ad

  except for the scientific apparatus
which was scattered everywhere about
the room the lanky six-footer was sur-
rounded by reading material and he
seemed to read everything a n
whiteheads latest book on the philo-

sophical implications of the new me-
chanics leaned against warren browns
story of the chicago cubs korzybskis
tome on general semantics sprawled
open atop a copy of mezzrows really
the blues

  at the moment magruder was im-
mersed in schrodingers account of the
physicial structure of the genes ten
minutes later he would be reading
dirac magruder groaned with so
much reading to do hed never get down
to writing his own book

  the phone rang several times before
he lifted it from the hook who could
be calling him at seven-thirty in the
morning it was the police commis-
sioner

  magruder something here i want
you to handle that was stearns all
right straight to the point

  fields basement magruder said

  cut out the horseplay i know its
you and this is right down your
alley

  the word is appropriate i seem
to be your clean-up man

  im dead serious magruder and
so he was and a little frightened too-
magruder realized from the tone of
his voice but stearns was still talking

  this is not something my own men
have botched its sheerly beyond
them

  all right magruder grunted see
you at your office

  no go straight to the rosmond
towers delaneys there and he knows
you ive already told him to back
you up in anything you do

  there was more but magruder had
already hung up if delaney himself
was on the job it meant something big
magruder threw on a fresh shirt and
was off luckily his short hair did
not have to be combed

  he kicked the plymouth coupe into
life and spurted from the curb in front
the drums of murd



of his apartment building although
hed never been inside the rosmond
towers he knew where it was the
coupe hurtled down the outer drive

  captain delaney was waiting for
him in the penthouse a big iron-gray
irishman with a lot of ability and a
sense of humor at the moment he
was not smiling

  stearns told me he called you i
sure hope the answer to this things
ir one of your books lane

  a couple of helpless looking detec-
tives grunted disdainfully and the uni-
formed policeman at the broken door
shook his head there were a half dozen
other people in the room all of them
looked bewildered

  well see captain magruder
smiled

  his keen dark eyes swept the room
probed the people there i see youve
given the place a thorough going over

  weve been working since one
oclock this morning delaney told
him and weve got nowhere im be-
ginning to think everybodys dreaming
and the whole thing never happened at
all

  maybe youve been working too
hard that can throw you off some-
times how about giving me the dope

  for you itll be simple one of the
detectives cut in sarcastically de-
laney let him finish about midnight
a girl entered this apartment five
minutes later shed disappeared thats
all

  youve got it narrowed down to five
minutes magruder asked

  delaney nodded and called over a
a tired looking young man with red
hair and a bridge of freckles across his
nose the young fellow still wore his
uniform

  tell your story to mr magruder
delaney said kindly the elevator man
wet his lips

  well sir there isnt much to tell
i took miss dorne up here only a
minute or two after twelve i left her
in the apartment with the door locked
on the way down i noticed one of
her gloves on the floor of the elevator
so i came up again the door was still
locked but she didnt answer so i
called the night super and we broke
down the door she was gone

  youre sure of the length of time
you were gone

  how long could it take me the
man said helplessly

  all right im not doubting you
magruder turned lets see that
door

  he noted that the door had given
way at the hinges that it had been
bolted from the inside carefully he
set it back in place it fitted so tightly
that it could not conceivably have been
opened from outside

  any other doors he asked de-
laney

  no

atagruder shook his head this
was getting interesting but if
the girl had not gone out the door then
there must be some other way he
crossed the room and stuck his head
out of the window there was a sheer
drop of thirty floors to the street this
side of the apartment was flush with
the wall of the building

  he went to the other side and opened
the terrace door the sour faced
detective was grinning scornfully
magruder noticed they always hate
to admit that someone else might be
smarter he thought

  the terrace ran to the other edge
of the building roof and ended in a low
wall there were a couple of deck
chairs and a table some potted plants
nothing else

  now ill give you the rest of it


fantastic adventures

delaney said when magruder came
back into the living room those ter-
race doors were open and so was that
window

  maybe she jumped magruder
said hopefully he was beginning not
to like this

  without leaving a trace on the
ground delaney snorted you know
better than that lane beside we
were here within ten minutes and it
was the first thing we checked

  the walls the floors magruder
probed

  solid weve tapped every inch
and used needles besides

  could she have let herself down
with a rope

  listen lane delaney was red in
the face i know my business any-
thing she could have attached a rope
or chain to has been microscopically
examined and she hadnt the time
even at that we closed all the exits
and checked every apartment in the
building

  he picked up a professional photo-
graph from a table and handed it to
magruder

  this is what she looked like in
case youre interested

  magruder studied the picture pursed
his lips in appreciation carol dorne
looked like the kind of girl hed always
wanted to know but had never been
lucky enough to meet

  worth finding he grinned

  and dont think were not trying
delaney grunted were combing the
city

  all right then magruder nodded
she vanished into thin air but there
must be a clue somewhere

yeah one and it isnt much
he led magruder to the long couch
were the elevator man sat with the
other five magruders keen eyes sized
up immediately the white haired gentle-

man and the woman next to him as
carol domes parents the woman
was crying

  there was a doorman a thin nerv-
ous woman and a husky man who was
plainly the building superintendent
the superintendent started to speak
without being asked he did it
mechanically something hed gone
through many times that night

  when we got to the door there was
a drumming sound inside it disap-
peared by the time we got in

  evil thats what it is the nervous
woman blurted i always knew it and
i warned mr rogers

  this is mrs brooks delaney ex-
plained she lives downstairs

  for months she continued with-
out a break its been going on

h id better tell it the white
haired man said wearily he liked
the looks of this young fellow well-
set-up sort of chap and intelligent
looking

  im rogers my firm manages this
building a couple of months ago mrs
brooks began to complain of a drum-
ming sound that seemed to emanate
from this penthouse we looked into
it had our engineers and architects
go over the place

  and you found what magruder
asked

  nothing sir nothing

  mrs rogers was crying bitterly i
just know something dreadful has hap-
pened to that sweet girl her husband
put his arms around her shoulders

  as far as the architect could figure
out it was caused by the normal build-
ing sway in a wind

  plausible magruder admitted
the engineer thought it could be
caused by the heating system

  also plausible magruder nodded
  bosh mrs brooks snorted i
the drums of murd



heard the noise when there was no wind
at all and i also heard it at times when
the heat was shut off

  so there goes that magruder
smiled he studied her any special
kind of drumming was it

  no she said hesitantly just like
a deep drum usually it came through
the ceiling of my place sometimes it
almost seemed to be my own apart-
ment it would start slow and end in
a sort of frenzy

  sort of a ghostly gene krupa
magruder grinned mrs brooks burst
into tears

  im frightened im terribly fright-
ened

  please dont be well have the
building guarded night and day until
this is cleared up

  he looked at delaney and the cap-
tain nodded affirmation mrs brooks
stopped crying but she still looked
scared

  so am i a little magruder admitted
to himself delaney was too thorough
a man to be doubted the girl had
been locked in this apartment all by
herself and she had vanished into
thin air

  the hair on the back of magruders
neck rose and there was a chill down
the length of his spine science didnt
know everything he was thinking
maybe- but maybe not

  is there anything you can think of
he asked the group in general which
might have some bearing on this even
if it seems remote

  yes rogers told him miss
dorne rented the apartment only yes-
terday-

  wait magruder snapped his fin-
gers i remember the advertisement
it was priced at about a fifth of its
value you must have been flooded
with applicants

  we were but she was the first so

she got it however one of the later
ones was very insistent fellow with
a pasty complexion and his hat over
his eyes offered any price if wed get
her to give it up said hed call back
today

  good delaney have the wires
tapped in case he does

  i already arranged for that de-
laney grunted the sour faced detective
was sneering but magruder paid no
attention to him

  anything else

  yes it was the doorman about
one minute before she disappeared a
fellow peeked in the door downstairs
he beat it when he saw me but the
light fell on his face he-he-

  he what magruder asked the
doorman was befuddled

  i know it sounds crazy sir but it
looked to me like he had a hole in his
forehead right above his eyes and
for just a second i thought i was look-
ing straight through it

  you got a hole in your head the
mean detective said

  let magruder handle this de-
laney told him

  lane magruder was shaking his
head the doorman was not crazy
that was evident maybe it had been
an illusion maybe not this case
was queer enough it could not be ap-
proached from a realistic angle illu-
sion or not even five minutes wouldnt
have been long enough for the strange
man to climb thirty-seven floors unless
he had wings he said as much and
seriously

  are you crazy delaney wanted
to know the detectives were laugh-
ing

  not at all magruder was calm
he went on with cold logic

  lets face it delaney weve estab-
lished that the girl was here locked
in you yourself have proved she did


fantastic adventures

not leave at all she could not have
left through any human agency but
shes gone have you a rational ex-
planation and what about those
drums

  even the detectives looked fright-
ened delaney was biting his lip his
eyes suddenly wary delaney had faced
gunmen without flinching but gunmen
were real their bullets solid they
could be fought with guns with clever-
ness

  this is what delaneys afraid of
magruder thought its one of those
things like dogs that bark in the night
when someone has died or like two
people who are a thousand miles apart
thinking the same thought at the same
time you call it coincidence or deny
it altogether but you know its true

nphe room was suddenly chilly
everyone in it apprehensive de-
laney rubbed the back of his neck
nervously his face gone white the
detectives looked over their shoulders
mr rogers wiped his face with a hand-
kerchief

  you people better leave delaney
said kindly well let you know if
we want you again

  when they had gone he stared wanly
at magruder well

  something got her magruder said
something that can go through walls
and locked doors or that flies like a
bird something that leaves no trace

  something that beats like a drum
delaney whispered or that maybe
goes around with a hole through its
head

  he was actually shaking now

  lane youve got to clear it up if
you dont-and it keeps on- lets
go outside i dont want to talk in
here

  this isnt in any of my books
magruder told him when they were out

in the hall

  he saw that delaney had unbuttoned
his collar and was fingering something
inside his shirt it hung on a thin chain

  yeah maybe wed better pray
magruder said and he meant it

  listen delaney he went on i
dont know any more than you do
were in the same boat its something
that cant be explained only felt and
we feel it with that part of us that
remembers when the world was young
and weird things walked

  im not yellow magruder de-
laney whispered but so help me im
afraid

  i dont think theres anything im-
mediate to fear captain whatever it
is seems to be associated with the
drumming and that comes only at
night

  id rather face tigers barehanded
than be here at night delaney said

  thats fine because i want to
handle this alone i think one man
can do more than a thousand in this
case you can station all the cops
you want around mrs brooks but tell
them to stay away from here unless
i call for help ive got a hunch ill
hear that drumming tonight

  if thats the way you want it de-
laney agreed but youre a braver
man than i am

  not braver lane magruder was
smiling now a boyish smile that lit
up his dark features

  not braver just more curious de-
laney ive always had a thirst for the
unknown

lte was tense with the waiting in
the lonely apartment in the night
the lights were on that was some-
thing to be thankful for delaney had
said theyd been on last night

  down below the lake sparkled in
bright moonlight and from one edge
the drums of murd



of the terrace magruder could see the
lights of randolph street and the loop
but those things were far away carol
dorne had seen them too before shed
vanished but she had been alone up
here

  as he was alone

  he whirled a sound surely that
was a noise hed heard his feet made
a soft thudding in the thick carpet
as he ran for the door it swung open
on its new hinges and he was in the
hall

  the hall was empty

  nerves that was all just nerves
magruder went back into the big liv-
ing room and shot the bolt behind him
nothing could get through that locked
door but it had hadnt it it had
got carol dorne

  there was that noise again and it
was in the hall outside the door this
time he went on tiptoe slid the bolt
back without the faintest scratch
flung open the door

  and the hall was empty

  his breathing was thick and labored
the scientific mind he thought grimly
when its faced with something that
cant be expressed in an equation it
goes to pieces like any other mind

  no that wasnt so it doesnt go
to pieces it faces the unknown
bravely and seeks to know it the
thought steadied him what he had
heard he had heard not in his mind
but with his ears

  from the hall magruder could not
doubt it would not let himself doubt
it this time he was certain but
from where the hall was empty
it was small the elevator doors were
closed the cage down below some-
where but beyond the shaft was a
dark niche tiny but big enough

  come out of there magruder said

  his voice was high and shrill in his
own ears

  all right i am coming

ut of the darkness it came it

    it was a man magruder saw a
man like any other man but magruder
was lying to himself and he knew it
for the skin was a dull white and the
hat was not pulled low enough he
could see the hole in the forehead

  the hole went all the way through

  no stay where you are magruder
whispered frantically

  he was sweating a cold sweat that
plastered his shirt to his back pull
yourself together magruder his mind
said fortunately for him the thing
stopped he had a chance to think

  whatever it was it could not go
through locked doors otherwise it
would have entered the apartment
that was a comforting thought and
magruder felt stronger

  how did you get up here

  i walked up there is a stairway
and a door in that niche nobody
was looking

  the voice was liquid but thick a
liquid metal like mercury magruder
thought he was calmer now

  you got carol dome last night

  no not i

  suddenly the voice changed it was
entreating pleading

  let me go in the room

  magruder launched himself in a sur-
prise attack but the other was quick
as lightning and strong magruders
hands were ripped from skin that was
strangely cold and his own punch to
the mouth was countered with a shove
that sent him sprawling in the door-
way

  he started up and stopped for he
had split the creatures lip and in-
stead of blood a thick white liquid
flowed magruder felt sick but he
stood his ground

  you got carol dorne he whis-


fantastic adventures

pered accusingly again

  no not i

  but you know where she is

  yes please let me in the room
i will send her back to you

  from where

  murd

  never heard of it magruder
grunted and why should i trust
you 

  he felt faint again raising a hand
to brush sweat from his face he found
a white powder on his knuckles and
where his fist had landed on the other
he could see that there was blood-red
skin only the hole in the forehead
was really white and shiny like bone

  you must trust me the liquid
voice said please quickly now the
drums are starting

  it was true behind magruder the
room was throbbing with a slow muffled
beat he wet his lips a shrill whistle
and delaneys men would pour up from
the floor below they must have heard
the drums

  but that wouldnt bring back carol
dorne magruder remembered her
face on the picture

  if you take me with you he whis-
pered

  no

  then you dont get in and i call
the police

  all right then but quickly

  they went in together the win-
dow was open and the terrace doors a
cool wind was blowing through the
room and the room itself was a great
drum that throbbed the rhythm
caught at magruder

  rhythm he thought the most
primitive thing of all it filled the
room filled him every nerve every
muscle every single cell in his body
throbbed with the rhythm of the
drums the beat came faster and
faster and magruder was sweating

  dont be afraid he felt an icy
hand on his

  but he was afraid his whole body
was pulsating now faster and faster
the room was fading out and there was
nothing but blackness in its place he
tried to wet his lips tried to get his
tongue against his teeth he had no
tongue he had no teeth

  only a pulse only a throb only a
beat the beat of the drums of murd

chapter iii

ut of the blackness he swam
slowly into a world of gray which
grew lighter and lighter the beat of
the drums slowed until finally it was
gone

  they were standing in a cleft between
two vertical walls of some quartz-like
substance which shimmered in the day-
light under their feet the ground was
hard and silvery like metal rather
than earth just ahead of them both
walled and ground ended abruptly and
as magruders eyes returned to nor-
mal focus he saw that they were al-
most at the edge of a precipice

  so this is murd he said half
aloud

  yes

  the voice reminded him that he had
not come alone and he turned to his
companion in daylight the other was
not a frightening creature at all ex-
cept for the hole above his eyes and
the color of his skin which now
showed clearly through the coating of
white powder he was much the same
as magruder

  yes this is murd the liquid voice
went on you wanted to come i hope
you wont be sorry

  it wont be your fault if i am
magruder told him i insisted on com-
ing along but there are a few things
i would like to know
the drums of murd



  later right now we had better get
out of here if we value our lives

  as though suddenly mindful of a
grave danger he took magruders hand
and began to pull him along away from
the edge of the precipice only a few
yards from where they had stood the
cleft widened into a canyon which ran
steeply downward here the walls were
covered solidly with a mass of vines
which trailed their orange tentacles
across the floor of the canyon

  magruder was running swiftly now
keeping close on the heels of the man
ahead where the danger might be he
could not imagine for there seemed
not a living thing in the canyon far
more likely that he would trip over a
trailer and break his neck magruder
thought

  for the most part he ran with his
eyes on the ground there was no real
path only what seemed a natural part
in the orange foliage then there was
a short stretch of fairly clear space and
he was able to look up his eyes wid-
ened in horror

  the walls of the canyon had come
to life the vines writhed and undu-
lated like a mass of orange reptiles
and already the motion was being
transmitted to the trailers on the can-
yon floor

  magruder hurdled a tentacle which
thrust itself suddenly up in his path
there was another to be cleared and
then still another more of them were
beginning to move

  ahead of him his companion tripped
and with a leap forward magruder
grabbed him already a waving ten-
tacle had twined itself about his leg
magruder slipped past him and helped
him pull free with a yank on his arm

  how much further he gasped as
they got started again

  not far but we are almost out of
time

  the words lent speed to lane ma-
gruders long legs and fast as he ran
he heard the others footsteps always
close on his heels would there be
enough time the demoniac plants
were in a fury of motion and each
slithering movement brought them
closer together the narrow path was
almost obliterated

  then suddenly the walls of the
canyon had ended and directly ahead
magruder saw a small pool which com-
pletely blocked the entrance from the
outside but ten feet still remained
to be covered and the reptilian plants
were thickest there

jyjagruder left his feet in a
headlong dive clutching vines
brushed against the underside of his
body and then he was cleaving the
clear cold water of the pool holding
his breath until he could hold it no
more

  on the surface he treaded water and
turned to see what had happened to his
companion he was just in time to see
the others heels disappear beneath the
surface an instant later they were
both on top fighting for breath

  they had made it with not a moment
to spare looking back into the can-
yon magruder saw that the serpentine
growth completely covered the floor
the vines intertwined in a writhing
slithering mass the sight sickened
him and he turned his head then swung
about and headed for the opposite
shore of the pool stretched out for a
moments rest on a bit of grass he
turned to the other

  what was that magruders voice
was trembling

  the valley of lura the orange
death and the drums of the ancients
we are probably the only men who
have ever traversed that canyon

  magruders eyes went wide with hor-


fantastic adventures

ror as a thought struck him

  but the girl carol dorne she
must have tried to go through you
said she was here too

  im sorry i had no time to tell
you

  magruder lay back it was a sicken-
ing thought carol dorne trapped by
those slithering things enveloped over-
come

  what would happen to her he
hated to ask the question but curiosity
was stronger than nausea

  need you ask it would not be
pleasant

  no it would not better to think
of other things he was here now
whether he had a reason or not and
there was a great deal he wanted to
know about this land of murd

  just where are we

  his companion pondered the ques-
tion apparently it was not an easy
one to answer

  on murd just as before we were
on earth

  yes but-

  in relation to earth you mean i
simply do not know the drums trans-
ported us but whether through space
or time or something else i cant say
he leaned oi his elbow and smiled
i think we are going to be together
for a while we should know each
others names i am vergor

  im lane magruder he put out
his hand and felt again vergors icy
one

  heres a question i hope you can
answer vergor if murd is not on
earth how is it you speak english

  i dont nor do you speak my
language you may have noticed that
most of the time im talking my lips
dont move what each of us gets is
the mental image beneath the others
words then we translate it into our
own tongues

  that makes sense we hear with
our minds as much as with our ears
but id sure like to know the
mechanism

  my advice is to try to leave before
you find out too much about murd
that sounds bad but you were
anxious to get back here

  i left murd through no fault of my
own i was running away from some-
one and in a desperate attempt to
escape i ran into the valley of lura
i was between the drums when they
began to beat

  and the next thing you knew you
were on earth

  yes i was in that apartment
some men had been working there
decorating one of them came back
for something he had forgotten and i
hid behind a door and saw how different
he was from me i used some white
powder from a can in the room to dis-
guise my color then i stole some
clothes they had left hanging and ran
out since then i have been trying
to get back

  but how could you be sure youd
land in murd

  i wasnt sure but i had a reason
for wanting to return there was a
woman in my case too

  i never saw carol dorne ma-
gruder told him just her picture im
an amateur criminologist who works
with the police occasionally but the
point is how do the drums work can
i be sure theyll take me back to
earth

  i dont know

  does anybody on murd know
perhaps the hadri it will be better
if you never meet them

 why

  because-

  vergor never finished what he was
about to say his wide almost color-
less eyes were filled with fear as he
the drums of murd



scrambled to his feet magruder
leaped up beside him

  whats the matter

  i thought i heard something wed
better get out of here

tt was too late men poured from
a behind a mass of foliage a few yards
to their left and their expressions
showed they were not friendly

  vergors fist clubbed down the first
man to reach him beside him ma-
gruder went into action without think-
ing he swept aside a pair of hands
that reached for his throat drove a
punch home to his opponents jaw
the man went down

  magruder felt better there was
nothing like action to take a mans
mind off his worries his fists pumped
furiously whatever these men were
they had only two hands each they
could be hurt and beside him vergor
was proving that he knew how to fight

  but for every man who went down
there was another to take his place
vergor and lane were back to back
completely hemmed in they drove
back one attack only to face another
then the wave of blood-red icy bodies
swept over them engulfed them

  when they were hauled to their feet
again their hands were securely bound
behind them magruder found himself
surrounded by men in short tunics who
poked at him curiously and ran their
fingers over his skin to see if it would
rub off he looked at vergor and saw
a bitter smile on the murdans face

  some of your questions about murd
will soon be answered vergor told
him

  magruder didnt like the way he
said it

  they were shoved down a trail that
was hard packed from long use on
both sides were stranger flowers and
trees which grew in queer distorted

shapes magruder would have liked to
tarry but he was pushed rudely along

  at the bottom of a long incline the
trail ended and they were in flatter
country tilled fields took the place
of the disorderly growth and only a
mile or so ahead was a city

  magruder gasped every color of the
spectrum glistened from the glassy
walls of the city and the walls rose
to form a dome which completely en-
closed it

  in the fields thousands of the red
skinned men were working dressed in
the same sort of tunics their captors
wore the only difference was in color
the men who surrounded vergor and
magruder wore garments of rich blue
those of the fields wore dull gray
and none of the workers raised his
head to look at the men who passed

  magruder was puzzled plainly
murd was in many ways a backward
land it was obvious that the men in
the fields were little more than slaves
and they worked the ground with
pointed sticks then too there were
those who had captured him and ver-
gor not one carried a weapon of any
sort

  yet the murdans had also built the
city which was now drawing close and
it was a miracle of engineering which
magruder could hardly accept on the
evidence of his eyes for as he came
nearer he saw the entire dome was
constructed of a single piece

  they entered the city through an
opening in the glassy wall and in-
side the picture was different people
thronged the wide avenues all of them
wearing blue tunics and here the men
were armed each of them with some
pistol-like weapon at his belt the
women wore bands of jewelled metal
across their foreheads magruder could
not help admiring the grace with which
they moved


fantastic adventures

  he soon saw where he and vergor
were being taken in the center of the
city a great building rose towering
over all the rest at the entrance armed
men swarmed apparently a guard of
some sort they parted to let through
the party with vergor and magruder

tnside there was nothing but a great

  hall its sides banked with comfort-
able seats on which blue-robed mur-
dans lolled thousands of eyes fast-
ened with interest on magruder as he
and vergor were marched toward the
dais at the end of the hall

  three men sat on that dais and they
were very old their red skins were
wrinkled their arms thin and withered
and their old cruel eyes were intent on
a gray robed man who was being held
on his knees below them by a pair of
armed men

  the trial if it was a trial was over
quickly apparently no consultation
between the old ones was necessary
all three nodded with a single motion

  destroy him

  the ones in the seats were leaning
forward each apparently afraid that he
might not be able to see well this was
execution chamber as well as court
magruder realized he saw one of the
guards draw the weapon from his belt
and point it at the kneeling man

  there was a quick drumming sound
a sound that rose in pitch and intensity
the body of the man on the floor began
to quiver and he staggered to his feet
he turned slowly unable to control his
quivering his face contorted in agony

  magruder flushed with anger this
was torture around him the hall was
filled with laughter at the antics of the
agonized victim and above the laugh-
ter rose a shriek that went higher and
higher until it choked off

magruder stumbled forward as a
hand hit his back beside him vergor

too was being roughly pushed toward
the dais both of them were forced to
their knees

  these are the hadri vergor whis-
pered there was fear in his voice
magruder had already guessed as
much

  this one the leader of their cap-
tors said pointing to vergor escaped
a long time ago we found him today
near the valley of the lura with him
was this strange one

  malevolent eyes drilled into mag-
ruder the eyes asked questions and
suddenly he knew that without his con-
sent they could not have the answer
for they could know his thoughts only
when he himself was trying to com-
municate them

  where are you from the ques-
tion was shot at him

  from earth

  you lie you have been sent by the
green ones

  never heard of them magruder
grunted unless the hadri adopted
other tactics they were going to get
little out of him

  again you lie you cannot deceive
the hadri

  suddenly magruder was fed up he
was sick of the cruelty he had seen
and he had a pretty good idea by now
of the way things were run in murd

  i dont have to deceive you youre
just three old fools who are no better
than anyone else

  the great hall was filled with the
horrified gasps of the murdans who
lined the walls magruder himself
found he was holding his breath wait-
ing for the order he knew was coming
the old eyes glared down at him
destroy him slowly

  magruder saw the deadly weapon
slide out of the guards belt it came
up and he saw a finger tighten on the
trigger this was it
the drums of murd



behind them there was a commotion

chapter iv

rthey have caught another white
    one someone shouted

  down the length of the great hall
heads were turning toward the entrance
the weapon which was pointed at
magruder wavered then was holstered
at a command from the hadri the
old men were looking over his head and
magruder turned to see what was
going on

  a group of men all of them armed
came hurrying down the aisle and be-
tween them they carried a struggling
captive they were almost on him be-
fore magruder saw the ash-blonde hair

  carol dorne he gasped

  at the sound of her name the girl
stopped struggling she let the guards
set her on her feet her clothes were
torn and dirty her face scratched but
to magruder she looked as good as her
photograph she gaped at him as
though unable to believe her eyes

  a human being oh im so glad
i-

  she tottered and would have fallen
had magruder not braced her with his
body he could easily imagine what
she had been through that she was
still alive was miracle enough

  youll be all right he told her
nothing to worry about

  he wished he could believe his own
words he tried to now that he had
found carol dorne he discovered that
he was anxious to live

  i wish i could believe that she
echoed his thoughts since yesterday
ive been lost in this horrible place
like a nightmare

  then the men about them were push-
ing them both to their knees slowly
the excitement in the great hall faded
the buzzing of conversation ceased the

hadri looked down on the two

  it is plain you are not a murd
even the green ones have the per-
foration in their foreheads never have
we seen any like you from where do
you come

  from earth magruder said for
the second time

  this you told us before but wher
is it

  magruder shrugged a little while
ago he had been hoping the hadri
could answer that now he knew they
were as much in the dark as he

  you cannot answer that the hadri
said which proves you lie if there
were such a place you could tell us its
location how did you get here

  the drums brought us magruder
said

  there was a shocked silence which
told him more than words he should
never have mentioned the drums if
what vergor said was true that they
were the only ones who had ever been
between the drums then nobody would
believe him

not only do you lie to us but you
dare to tell us this the hadri said
no man sees the drums and lives
then believe what you want
magruder bristled

  we believe you are lying and we
have ways of finding out the truth you
were not alone when you were found
this slave was with you

  a tall broad-shouldered man came
out of the crowd and made his way
down the aisle he wore a blue tunic
and carried a weapon with a jewelled
handle

  the slave vergor was mine until
he ran away i claim him

  we will decide that later gren
perhaps you can cast some light on
this matter

  none except that when he es-
caped he wore the clothes of a slave


fantastic adventures

and now he is dressed as this man
we see that it proves that he is
in league with them

  not at all magruder interrupted
there was no use making things harder
for vergor than they had to be it
wouldnt help carol or him any if
vergor were killed

  we will hear what the slave has to
say about that

  nothing vergor was defiant his
head thrown back proudly

  so you defy us too very well the
next questioning will be tomorrow in
the hall of the ancients

  vergor started and magruder saw
that he was terror stricken perspira-
tion ran down his face in streams and
he was biting his lips but his head
was still high

rthe hadri were looking at vergor
as though they expected him to give
in when they saw he had no intention
of saying anything they nodded to the
guards a circle of armed men formed
about the three prisoners

  wait

  it was gren evidently he was a man
of more than a little importance for
the hadri stopped the guard with an-
other gesture and waited for gren to
speak

  i need the slave tonight is the
harvest of the serus and we have not
nearly enough men

  must it be done tonight
tomorrow it will be over-ripe i
could also use these two if they might
be put in my custody if not much
may be lost

  and what if they escape as the
slave did

  they cannot escape the serus
gardens are not like the open fields
and until tonight i will keep the three
of them locked in a dungeon

  whatever the serus was it meant

a great deal to the hadri magruder
recognized they held a hurried and
whispered conference on the dais

  you may take them gren but
see that they are here tomorrow

  the guard around the three stepped
back and its place was taken by grens
own men moving quickly they herd-
ed carol and the two men toward the
entrance gren himself led the way

  curious men and women gathered in
crowds and tried to push close to ex-
amine the two who came from another
world but grens men kept them at
a distance kept the three captives go-
ing at a fast pace

  magruder was dead tired and so
was vergor but it was on carol that
the going was hardest once she
slipped and fell one of the guards
grabbed a handful of her hair and
hauled her to her feet again her teeth
bit into her lips but she refused to
scream

  magruder felt a surge of admiration
for her and at the same time his dis-
gust and hatred for the murdans rose
to a new height he had a pretty good
idea by now of their barbarity

  with a twist of his body he flung
himself about so he faced the guard
magruders foot shot out and cracked
against the murdans shin there was
a howl of pain and rage and for a sec-
ond time magruder had one of the
pistols pointed at him

  grens own hand struck down the
gun

  he will die soon enough but first
he must enjoy the harvest of the serus
-to the full

  magruder was under no delusion that
gren meant him a kindness maybe it
would have been better for him and
carol to die in the valley of the lura
compared to what was probably in
store for them that would have been
a pleasant death
the drums of murd



at the very edge of the city was
grens palace a sprawling edifice
only slightly smaller than the palace
of the hadri gates of the quartz-like
material swung wide and then shut be-
hind the party

  slaves were everywhere in the palace
the grey-tuniced men and women kept
their eyes down as the three captives
were marched down long corridors
apparently the women slaves did little
work and magruder noted that in fig-
ure and grace they were more than the
equals of their mistresses

  he noticed too that vergor was star-
ing at one of the women slaves in par-
ticular she stood at the end of the
corridor down which they marched a
beautifully formed young girl whose
eyes flashed as she saw vergor then
her head was bowed again sadly

  there was a door at the end of the
corridor and beyond it a flight of stairs
which led down into the bowels of the
palace the air was musty here and in
the half-light magruder saw a row of
heavy doors one of the doors was
open and the party paused before it

  in here gren ordered

  wait magruder said as one of the
guards shoved him into the cell if
you want us to do any work tonight
youd better untie our hands

  gren hesitated yet what magruder
had said was right the three had
been too conscientiously bound by
night their arms and hands would be
so numb that it would take hours to
restore circulation

  very well they cannot escape

  the sinister guns covered the three
as their bonds were cut from them a
moment later the heavy door had shut
behind them and they were alone in
the tiny cell

  as soon as he was sure the guards
were gone magruder got to work using
his knuckles he tapped and found it

locked from the outside in a manner
which prevented its being picked and
all the air in the cell came from a tiny
vent far upon the wall

  i guess were stuck here until gren
comes for us magruder shrugged he
turned to the girl

  im lane magruder i was help-
ing the police look for you after you
vanished and this is vergor a native
of murd

  you keep calling this murd but
what is it and where one minute i
was in that penthouse and the next min-
ute i was standing at the edge of a
cliff i was so frightened i started to
run then those awful things began
crawling for me in that canyon by
the time i got out i was so terror strick-
en i couldnt think i just wandered
around until i was picked up

  i know how you felt magruder
said sympathetically i went through
it myself and as for answering your
questions im certainly going to try
they cannot be answered vergor
was bitter i thought the hadri knew
but even they dont they are as
afraid of the drums as any murdan
what about those guns

  yes they know how to use them
but the power comes from the drums
of the ancients

  and who were the ancients
no one knows they lived on
murd eons ago it is said that in those
days there were no masters and no
slaves even the green ones were
peaceful the ancients built this city
i thought so magruder grunted
it would take a high order of civiliza-
tion to do the job and so far ive seen
no indication of any machinery which
would show the presence of such a civil-
ization

  no all that is left is the evil pow-
er of the drums nothing which was
good remained


fantastic adventures

 but if nobody knows how the
drums work how will we ever get back
to earth carol asked plaintively

  i think ive got the glimmer of an
idea lane told her at least what
the principle is its based on the new
theories of matter that matter is noth-
ing more than a pulsation of energy
which comes and goes at the rate of bil-
lions of times a minute

  im afraid im not very scientific
carol smiled i know what a pulse is
but not much about energy or matter
thats enough for our purpose
which is after all theoretical a pulse
comes and goes throbs so does ener-
gy and if it goes it must go some-
where murd is the other end of the
beat at a certain point the drums
have the power to attune us to that beat
who knows if the ancients are not
really our ancestors and if they didnt
use the drums to migrate to earth mil-
lions of years ago

  it must be so vergor cried excit-
edly we have a legend which says
that there will come a day when the
drums will beat as they did in those
days then the children of the an-
cients will return to restore our free-
dom

  well we have returned magruder
grinned but we arent doing so well
the nice little feudal system youve got
seems likely to outlive us

  carol dorne had been leaning against
a wall but she now came to magruders
side and put her hand on his arm she
had cheered up considerably

  at any rate i feel more hopeful
since ive met you lane anyone who
can smile in a spot like this is far from
licked

  good thats the way i want you
to feel at least we know were going
to be let out tonight there might be
a chance to escape

  there is no place where we can go

vergor said glumly

  you got away didnt you

  i was fortunate i was working in
the fields when gren came by and saw
me talking with my sweetheart he
liked her and started to drag her away
and i struck him his men were on
my heels but i reached the valley of
the lura just as they parted for a few
moments past that valley there is
nothing but rocks and sand a man
would die in a few days

  do you mean that all the habitable
land in murd is just the few miles
around the city

  exactly

  then what about the green ones
whoever are they

t the mention of the green ones
vergor trembled as cruel and
vicious as the murdan nobility was it
seemed the green ones must have it all
over them here vergor stood on the
brink of torture and death and yet he
feared them

  no one knows they are devils
once in several months they raid the
fields but they come in things which
fly through the air such as i saw when
i was on earth and never has a cap-
tive taken by them returned

  so they have planes magruder
mused that means theyre quite ad-
vanced devils or not then why dont
they take the city

  they cannot penetrate the dome
vergor explained and they have no
defense against the vibro-guns you
have not yet seen what the big ones
can do

  and the poor slaves are always in
the middle between their own masters
and the raids of the green ones ma-
gruder muttered very reminiscent
of a period in the earths history but
it didnt last forever

  it will here there is no hope the
the drums of murd



slaves work and the hadri and nobles
take their produce and their women for
their own purposes

  by the way carol interrupted
did you know that slave girl upstairs
she started when she saw you

  that was gelda my sweetheart
gren is keeping her for the feast of
the serus

  magruder was pacing the floor there
were so many things he wanted to know
and so little time to learn them not
only his life but carols too might de-
pend on a knowledge of some small
fact

  whats the significance of the se-
rus

  its a plant which blooms only one
night in the year from it a certain
drink is made which the nobles use
at the feast and also another sub-
stance which the hadri use and which
gives them longer life

  but why did gren insist that we be
turned over to him for tonight
because all who harvest the serus
must die apparently he hasnt enough
slaves to spare and since the serus
gardens are his the hadri had to give
in to him he is the most powerful of
the nobles

  and tomorrow what happens in
the hall of the ancients

  i have seen only one who was ques-
tioned there he was dead the had-
ri made the slaves bury him so that we
should be frightened blood oozed
from every pore and his face was so
contorted that we could not recognize
him

  carol started to shudder and ma-
gruder put his arm around her shoul-
der he kept it there even after she
stopped shaking but she didnt seem to
mind

  i guess its tonight or not at all
then he said well make a break
for it the first chance we get

  vergor shook his head sadly

  im sorry to dash your hopes but
escape wont be possible the gardens
will be surrounded by armed men

  then well at least die fighting
magruder told him

  his eyes met carols and she smiled
bravely it was too bad he thought
that dreams had to end this way so
often he had followed a face on a
photograph and found that the girl the
face belonged to was just what hed
thought shed be

  its all my fault she said if it
werent for me youd be safe now

  if i had it to do over again ma-
gruder told her id do exactly what i
did

chapter v

tt was several hours before gren
came to get them and when mggru-
der saw the number of armed men the
noble led his heart fell gren was tak-
ing no chances

  the three were marched quickly up
the stairs and out of the palace into a
moonlit night overhead the dome
glistened and the streets were almost
as bright as day

  the gardens were just outside the
walls but separated from the field by
a low wall already there were slaves
at work and on the wall stood armed
men at short intervals those who had
escorted carol and vergor and magru-
der took up similar positions

  white blossoms covered the ground
so thickly that they seemed like a blan-
ket of snow each flower was the size
of a rose in full bloom and their com-
bined scent was sickeningly sweet and
overpowering

  vergor picked up a short curved
knife from a pile of them which lay
inside the wall magruder and carol
followed his example followed him as


fantastic adventures

he took a basket from a nest of them
vergor needed no instructions all
that had to be done was to imitate other
slaves

  no attempt was made to separate the
three working side by side they bent
to cut the serus blossoms alongside
them other slaves were busy doing the
same busy filling their baskets but
the movements of these others were
robot-like they knew they were
doomed and already the life seemed
gone from them

  near the low wall one of the slaves
suddenly dropped his knife and bas-
ket and straightened up whether he
meant to run or was merely resting for
a moment magruder never found out
for instantly a vibro-gun was pointed
at the man this slave died slowly
his scream going on and on above the
drumming of the gun it was a warn-
ing to the others

  weve got to work our way close
to the wall lane muttered to vergor

  yes our only chance would be to
attack them before they can turn their
guns on us vergor agreed and we
have our knives for weapons

  but the plan was frustrated before
it was fully started as the three be-
gan drifting from the row in which they
worked magruder felt the guns turn
with them one of the guards barked
a loud command

  stay where you are one step more
and you die

  magruders insides were tied in a
knot and he felt the knife slip against
his sweating palm it was no use the
guards were too wary turning his
head lane saw that carols face wore a
mask of hopelessness vergor was go-
ing back to work and now his move-
ments were dull like those of the oth-
er automatons and already their row
was almost finished the end of the
harvest was close

  as silently as hawks the green ships
swooped down on the field the guards
were caught completely by surprise a
dozen of them swept from the wall as
a ship came in low for a landing

  by the time magruder got his head
up hatches were swinging open green-
skinned men poured out in waves
spreading swiftly to scoop up slaves
who were paralyzed by fright others
of the green ones carried weapons
which sent a hail of pellets toward the
guards on the walls

tut cruel as the nobles of murd
might be they were not cowards
for only an instant did surprise hold
them the drumming of the vibro-guns
filled the air as they swung into action

  disregarding the stupefied slaves
grens men left the walls and raced over
the fields toward the green ships now
the guns were pitched high and green
men were beginning to fall fully a
third were cut down before they could
take a backward step

  near magruder one of the green
ones halted apparently a leader the
green man waved his comrades back
toward the ship they had come from
but he was too late from three sides
the murdans converged on him and his
crew

  take them alive someone shouted

  the green men were confused those
who carried weapons were given no
chance to use them the rest were
trapped magruder felt carol domes
hand on his

  now is our chance lets run for
it

  his mind raced by the time they
could get past the walls the fight would
be over pursuit would come too quick-
ly for them to get away and yet to
stay meant torture and death there
was only one other possibility

  follow me he told the girl you
the drums of murd



too vergor and dont be afraid to
use your knife

  the murdan guards were already
past them before they were aware of
the danger from behind magruder and
vergor were on them two knives
rose as one and sank into blue-tuniced
backs

  startled a murdan whirled and
aimed his gun at magruder but
lanes foot shot out to hit his thigh
and throw him off balance before
the murdan could get his hand up again
magruder had scooped up a dead mans
gun the man from earth shot from
the hip the gun vibrating against the
heel of his palm

  beside him vergor had picked up a
vibro-gun and was using it on the mur-
dans two of them went down then
another as magruder cut loose again
the rest of the murdans came around
to meet the unexpected attack

  but now the green men went into ac-
tion quickly taking advantage of the
chance magruder and vergor had giv-
en them the murdans were caught
from two sides at once their line shat-
tered and before it could re-form the
green men broke through

  magruder grabbed carols hand and
dragged her along with him as he and
vergor ran with the green ones toward
their ship before anyone could stop
them he had lifted her through an open
hatch and was beside her behind
them came vergor and then a flood of
green-skinned men the hatch swung
out and at a shouted command the
slender ship lifted

  other green ships were taking to the
air with them out of a porthole ma-
gruder saw them long and cigar shaped
of some strange metal he also saw
something else below something that
froze his blood

  directly above the palace of the
hadri the great dome was opening

and from the roof of the palace rose a
battery of giant guns ahead of ma-
gruder the green skinned commander
yanked back a control stick and the
ship shot straight up like an arrow

  a great drumming sound filled the
air penetrated into the ship itself to
the left a green ship was caught by the
giant vibro-guns and magruder saw it
shudder then it went out of control
twisting end over end shaken from
stem to stern

  it broke into fragments that fell to
the ground like a green snow and
mixed with falling bits of metal were
the bodies of slaves and green men the
great drumming grew louder

nd ther own ship began to tremble

    they would never be able to get
out of that deadly beam of vibration
magruder knew for the ship contin-
ued straight up without any attempt to
evade it

  he leaped for the control stick swept
the commander out of the way before
anyone could stop him lane had thrown
the stick forward then to the side the
ship went into a screaming dive to the
side men shouted as they were thrown
in all directions

  magruder clung to the stick with
all his strength as they rocketed down-
ward directly for the dome he head-
ed then at the last possible moment
yanked upward again frantically the
men who manned the guns tried to
keep him in their sights

  again he threw the ship into a side-
slip by the time the guns had swung
downward again he was levelling off
the shuddering of the green ship grew
less and was gone and they were
hurtling low above a desert bathed in
moonlight

 now that it was over magruder
found that he was sweating profusely
his arms gone suddenly weak it had


fantastic adventures

been a close call as close as any he
had ever experienced the green man
he had pushed from the control stick
was at his side and magruder motioned
him to take over

  im sorry i had to be so rough-
there was no time for politeness
the commander dismissed the apology

  he was a tall man powerfully built
with a proud bearing and direct eyes
of a luminous green with no trace of
nervousness he took the stick and
changed course slightly then turned to
scrutinize magruder

  i am beral commander of the green
fleet twice tonight you saved my
life and the lives of my men yet you
are not of murd why did you do it
to save our own lives lane admit-
ted frankly i didnt know for sure
what we were getting into but i knew
well enough what we were getting out
of

  were you a slave

  no you guessed it when you said
the girl and i were not of murd it
would be hard to explain who we are
and how we got here

  from a man who saved my life i
do not demand explanations yet i
admit astonishment at the way you han-
dled this ship never have i seen such
a thing

  i commanded a squadron of flying
ships in my own countrys air fleet
during a war magruder explained
will you teach us how

  be glad to do it

  good it will save many lives in
the future and we have none to spare
berals eyes appraised magruder
apparently the commander liked what
he saw for he nodded and turned his at-
tention to carol his stare was frank-
ly curious but respectful and when she
smiled at him he responded with a
friendly smile of his own

  other green men clustered about her

examining her gravely one of them
reached out a tentative finger and carol
let him touch her arm he grunted
with surprise

  it is warm

  dont frighten her beral snapped

  the men stepped away and the com-
mander turned his attention to vergor
magruder knew vergor was inwardly
frightened yet he showed no fear beral
nodded again

  your tunic shows you to be a slave
but you hold your head up like a man
and you were not afraid to fight

  i too fought for my own life ver-
gor told him stoutly

  as every man should berals tone
became one of wonder but for a
murdan not to fear the green ones
not to fear the green devils who eat
human flesh

tut is men broke into shouts of laugh-
ter and beral himself chuckled
vergor stared at them in astonishment

  then it isnt so

  of course not

  then why are you always raiding
our city and taking off slaves vergor
was frankly skeptical

  so that the green race should not
die out we have five men to every
woman you will find that almost all
the slaves weve taken have been
women

  but where do you take them ver-
gor wanted to know he was gaining
confidence there is nothing but des-
ert on all of murd

  yes beral said bitterly only
one fertile spot and one city which
our own ancestors helped to build and
we are denied the right to live there
when the ancients left we were driven
into the desert by the red ones and
they call us barbarians

  he jammed the stick forward angri-
ly and the nose of the ship tilted down-
the drums of murd



ward below them magryder saw only
white sands and a little way ahead rose
the face of a barren cliff the other
ships of the fleet were slanting down
as if for a landing but where

  he had his answer in a moment as
they drew close to the base of the cliff
a black spot appeared the spot grew
larger until it became the yawning
mouth of a huge cavern without hes-
itation beral guided his ship into the
great hole behind him the others fol-
lowed

  deep into the bowels of the mountain
they burrowed with no relief from the
blackness then gradually it began to
lighten and magruder could see ahead
they were approaching some sort of
landing field

  men came running to greet them the
first to reach berals ship was an older
man tall and straight and with an air
of authority his face was lined with
years of worry and responsibility while
others cheered as ships unloaded fresh
slaves his first words to beral were de-
spondent

  youve lost a ship

  and we were fortunate at that har-
as beral said if not for these three
here my own ship would never have left
the ground and this one he pointed
to magruder saved us even after we
were aloft

  beral introduced the older man as
haras chief of the council past the
landing field magruder saw a city
spread on the floor of the immense cav-
ern apparently it was governed in
some sort of democratic fashion his
inference was proved correct as haras
took his hand

  i extend to you the gratitude of all
our people the older man said we
can ill afford to lose a ship

  vergor was staring about him in as-
tonishment and haras and beral gave
their attention to the muraan

  what is it

  i see former slaves walking about
without guards as free as any of the
nobles of our city

  there are no slaves here haras
told him each man is his own mas-
ter and has an equal voice in choosing
his leaders and as long as our city
of kuna shall stand it will remain so

  but there was a sadness in the proud
voice which made magruder look at
haras with narrowed eyes even beral
who seemed the sort that did not dis-
courage easily was downcast he saw
too that the rejoicing among the green
men had died down as they realized
one of the ships had failed to return

  after all you did make a pretty fair
haul magruder said to beral

  beral shook his head the price
was far too high you will learn why
later

they went along toward the city
haras who sensed magruders
curiosity pointed out the interesting
features of the great cavern and tried
to explain them the light which ev-
enly illuminated the vast expanse came
from the rock itself in reply to lanes
question about a small lichen which
grew everywhere on the ground haras
was more explicit

  the merta it is our only source
of food after centuries our people
have found a variety of ways in which
to prepare it fortunately it contains
all the food substances necessary to
sustain life

  and water

  we have a few springs also a cer-
tain porous rock which burns easily
and out of those things and some metals
which are to be found here we have
built this city and managed to remain
alive

  youve done more than that lane
protested those airships are marvels


fantastic adventures

of engineering

  not at all they are constructed
from a metal which is lighter than air
it also has certain magnetic properties
which furnish the driving power of the
ships

  what about the weapons i saw in
use

  you must also have seen how in-
effectual they were they use the pow-
er of coiled springs to shoot metal
balls

  magruder nodded he could see that
the green men had done very well with
the materials they had at hand but
against the vibro-guns of the red mur-
dans they were powerless

  nevertheless youve managed to
more than hold your own he said

  yes haras admitted but that
will be true no longer the supply of
metal for the airships is exhausted we
face an insoluble problem on the one
hand we must make raids or the race
will die out yet each raid brings us
closer to the end of our air fleet and
when that is gone-

  he did not have to finish when
that was gone it would mean the pass-
ing of a brave people magruder felt
anger rise within him the fields of
the red murdans were fertile enough
to support both races but they sup-
ported only the nobles of one

  given the opportunity and the mate-
rials these green men could have built
a flourishing civilization the others
had only one scientific device and that
was an evil one but with that they
could doom the green race to exter-
mination

  and how about himself and carol
dorne their immediate plight was
far from desperate but they too were
doomed to remain on murd and that
was a prospect magruder did not relish
he had a few ideas though and the
sooner he got to work on them the

better

  if it isnt too presumptuous he
said to haras i should like to offer
a suggestion its based on my own
personal experience with war and on a
study of many campaigns

  we shall welcome any suggestions
you might make the older man as-
sured him

  good the basic facts are clear
youre nearing the end of your re-
sources yet every raid further depletes
them and weakens you more the rest
is simply logic all the strength you
can muster will have to be thrown into
an all-out attack with the intention of
taking the city and the longer you
wait the less chance youll have
your reasoning cannot be denied
haras told him the council was
forced to the same conclusion at its
last meeting

  but there is one thing youve for-
gotten beral cut in we havent a
chance of breaking into the city and we
have no defense against the vibro-guns
they would wipe us out before we
reached the gates

chapter vi

atagruder had not forgotten
that for the moment his mind
was busy with other details there
was a chance which both beral and
haras overlooked patterns of action
had been developed in the green men
which they themselves could not break
an outsider might see possibilities
which had not occurred to them it was
vergor who broke the gloomy silence
which had developed

  i have it the plan youve been
discussing is bound to fail but there
is a way to take the city

  how beral and haras were both
skeptical

  by attacking simultaneously from
the drums of murd



both inside and out the slaves are so
submissive that the nobles dont fear
them and many of them come into
the city at night what if the slaves
revolted at the moment you attacked
that would be perfect beral
agreed but they wont revolt
they would if they have someone to
lead them im positive i could do it

  haras and beral were looking at
each other their eyes suddenly hope-
ful they could not help being affected
by vergors enthusiasm but haras
thought of a difficulty

  the idea is excellent and we could
land you even tonight within an hours
walk of the city but you too are
under sentence of death if you were
caught the whole plan would fail

  he doesnt have to be caught
carol interrupted

  they stared at her in astonishment
until now they had completely for-
gotten about her she had her purse
open and was excitedly rummaging
through the contents while they
watched she brought out a slender
cylinder

  my lipstick she announced proud-
ly its almost exactly the color of
vergors skin i know enough about
make-up to disguise him so hell never
be recognized

  it isnt necessary to do anything
now haras told her the plan seems
good but first there must be a meeting
of the council

  then call it now vergor said
one week from tonight is the feast of
the serus that will be the ideal time
to strike and even without disguise
im sure i could manage the thing
men with toil worn hands and wise
eyes sat around the council table of
kuna but no amount of wisdom could
solve this problem it was the most
crucial one they would ever be called
on to decide yet it all depended on a

gamble

  they listened carefully as vergor
outlined his plan of action his belief
in himself was so complete that it could
not help but sway them in a corner of
the council room magruder whispered
to beral and haras and when the chief
of the council returned to the table he
seemed convinced

  i speak only for myself he said
but i think it should be done and
since there is no time to lose we had
better vote on it now

  if there had been doubt in the coun-
cils mind before haras spoke there was
none now the vote was by a show of
hands and the council was unanimous
in its approval

  then while they watched carol
went to work on vergor deftly she
applied the lipstick to his mouth to the
corners of his eyes when she was done
with his eyes and his mouth had grown
smaller faint wrinkles were filled in
so that he seemed younger with an
eyebrow pencil she changed the appear-
ance of his teeth

jyurmurs of astonishment rose
from about the table the change
in vergor was so great that it was un-
believable one council member a for-
mer murdan himself swore he could
not tell where nature ended and art
began

  beral cut short any further inspec-
tion of carols handiwork

  wed better get started now not
many hours of darkness remain
magruder shook vergors hand
good luck well see you exactly one
week from tonight

  and at this same hour vergor told
him the feast will have just passed its
height and the nobles will be confused
by drink i promise you the slaves will
rise at exactly the moment you land
they watched berals ship until it


fantastic adventures

disappeared into the blackness of the
tunnel to the outside carols eyes were
moist when magruder turned to face
her

  it takes real bravery to do what
vergors doing she said

  real bravery he echoed grimly

  haras was impatient all the while
berals ship had been preparing to take
off he had watched glumly now he
was eager to get away from the landing
field

  you had many things you wanted
to do he reminded magruder

  i havent forgotten lane assured
him but before we go any further
id like you to give this some more
thought youre staking a great deal
on me and you never laid eyes on me
until tonight

  no haras admitted i can only
trust whatever insight my years have
given me into the character of men i
dont think you will fail us

  he chuckled and shook his head ad-
miringly

  after all until today you did not
dream murd existed and still you
saw something which we had never
realized that on some of our raids our
enemies must have captured one or two
of our men alive then too you saw
the significance of other things which
had escaped us entirely

  there are a good many things im
interested in including human psychol-
ogy magruder admitted some of
those things should help solve the tech-
nical problems ahead of us

  he was still carrying in his belt the
vibro-gun he had taken from the dead
murdan now he removed it bent to
scoop up a handful of sand and began
to rub it briskly on the stock of the gun
carol and haras watched him

  whats that for she wanted to
know

  just testing to see if my reasoning

was correct he told her he showed
them the scratches the sand had made
on the shiny stock

  but what does that prove
merely that the vibro-guns do wear
out in time

  magruder was keyed to a high pitch
he hoped the other ideas he had about
the deadly guns were equally correct
if they were there might be a surprise
in store for the hadri and the murdan
nobles but first he had to get some
details out of the way

  about those two ships you said were
damaged in previous raids he said to
haras youre sure theyll be ready a
week from tonight

  they are almost ready now haras
assured him the building in which
they are being repaired is at the other
end of the city but i can take you
there if you wish

  that wont be necessary what i
want now is a place where i can work
and some capable assistants later i
may need the help of every artisan in
kuna

  all our resources are at your com-
mand as for help you will find that
every citizen of kuna is a skillful
worker in order that you should
know exactly how much to expect i
had better show you our workshops
good idea magruder agreed
and right now is the time

co occupied with his plans had he
been that he had almost forgotten
carol turning to her now lane saw
how tired she looked

  do you mind if i dont go along
she asked i feel as though i hadnt
slept in weeks

  you can stay at my own house
haras suggested my wife will see
that you are made comfortable well
go there first and then proceed to the
shops
the drums of murd



  whatever the green men of kuna
lack in raw materials magruder
learned quickly they made up in intel-
ligence and energy primitive forges
used bellows cunningly contrived from
impregnated cloth tools were simple
but well made

  he picked up a tiny saw which lay
on the bench of a worker who was
patiently hammering a lump of metal
into a thin sheet the worker did not
pause and lane had to tap him on the
shoulder

  how strong is this saw magruder
asked

  it will cut metal if you have
enough patience

  good he laid the vibro-gun on
the bench i want you to saw this gun
in half lengthwise but see that noth-
ing inside is damaged

  the metal worker picked up the gun
and examined it with the saw he test-
ed the stock and then the barrel he
looked up smiling

  it will take almost no time at all
working slowly at first he cut a fine
groove all the way around once the
guide line was exact his movements be-
came swift his hand drew the tiny
saw back and forth in a smooth and
tireless rhythm quickly and surely
the groove deepened as he turned the
gun in his hand there was a pause
for examination and then he tapped the
gun on the edge of the bench it split
evenly exactly down the center

  excitedly lane examined the maze
of wires and tiny tubes which lay ex-
posed in a casing of the quartz-like
material of which the city of murd was
constructed pressing the two halves
of the gun together again he pointed it
toward the ground and pulled the trig-
ger there was a very faint hum
good just what i thought

  do you mean you understand how
it works haras asked in amazement

  at least the principle of the thing
the hook-up is different from any ive
ever seen or read about and this shiny
stuff has certain strange properties
then how will you duplicate it
haras drooped with disappointment

  i dont intend to but if i can make
a generator and an interrupter well
still be able to hand the hadri a sur-
prise

  what are those things

  we use them on earth but theyd
be hard to explain if youve got a bit
of the metal you make the airships
from i can see quickly enough whether
i can make them or not

t ane slept little that day the light
metal was hard and difficult to
work hours passed before a small
horseshoe was made of some and
many more hours were needed to draw
a few yards of wire by hand

  the finished product was crude but
it worked magruder knew how fara-
day must have felt as he watched the
spark leap from one lead-off wire to the
other

  it was a beginning but it was just
the beginning to construct the thing
on a large scale was merely a repetition
of what they had done once and the
workers sailed into the job

  the trouble came with the other
equipment magruder needed with
nothing but a knowledge of principles
and an excellent memory for diagrams
he had once perused he went to work
almost everything had to be done
twice

  carol saw him for a few minutes each
day and then he was almost too tired to
speak to her already he was hoarse
from the constant stream of instruc-
tions he issued to the workers for-
tunately they were quick to learn and
when it came to willingness to work he
had never seen their equals


fantastic adventures

  on the sixth day the job was done
all that remained was the installation
when that was finished magruder had
only one desire to sleep tension had
mounted to the breaking point

  are you certain it will work beral
asked

  no how can i be certain lane
shrugged wearily ive tested a model
but theres no way to test the big one
i shouldnt have asked beral
smiled theres no turning back now
but i suppose there isnt one of us who
isnt worried what if it doesnit work
magruder nodded slowly that was
the sixty-four dollar question

chapter vii

tt was still the question as the fleet
of slender green ships hovered over
the gleaming city but now was no
time to think of it

  vergor must have seen us by now
beral was saying he threw the stick
forward and slanted the ship toward
the gates then turned to lane and
carol

  its a pretty complicated plan i
hope it works

  thats all we can do is hope
magruder smiled if it doesnt-well
i couldnt ask to die in better company
the ground was rushing up at them
and there was no more time for talk
men gathered around the hatches
some holding bulky spring-powered
guns all wore swords under their
tunics

  the gates were open they could see
that even before they landed beral
cut speed sharply flattened out and
they landed with hardly a jar less than
twenty feet from the gates

  many raids had made them adept at
these tactics by the time lane swung
the first hatch open the other ships
were alongside waves of green men

poured out formed quickly into tight
squads directly ahead was the broad
avenue

  there was no one to oppose their
entrance into the city of murd as
he came through the gates with the
first squad magruder could see down
the entire length of the wide street
and directly in front of the palace of
the hadri was a milling shouting
throng of slaves and nobles

  just as you said it would be beral
grunted to magruder

  the fleet commander turned in time
to see the last of the green men come
through the gates weapons were com-
ing up to shoulders as they ran down
the street until now not a single cry
of alarm had been raised

  and then so quickly that they had
no defense they were surrounded
from every building came murdan
nobles to block the way ahead to cut
off retreat to prevent the green men
from fanning out hundreds of vibro-
guns made a circle of death around
the invaders

  the ambush had been perfect there
was no more throng in front of the
palace it had dissolved into separate
groups of nobles and slaves more
murdans with blue tunics were coming
up

  cruel eyes were fastened on the
green men fingers were taut on trig-
gers there was a moment of silence
then the ranks of the nobles parted
and two men came through one of
them was gren and the other was
vergor

  his disguise was gone and gone
too was the gray tunic of the murdan
slave the blue garment vergor wore
was of the finest cloth the gun in
his hand glittered with jewels a tri-
umphant smile played on his lips

  so thats the way it is magruder
said
the drums of murd



  exactly vergor grinned you
see me now in my true colors vergor
brother of gren and greatest  noble
of murd

  he made a mocking bow to carol
my own disguise was not bad was
it nor my acting

  but i dont understand she said
bewildered you mean that the whole
thing was planned for the purpose of
trapping us all

  that should be obvious of course
there was much i had to improvise i
hadnt planned on bringing guests to
murd when i returned from earth
once you were here i thought it ad-
visable to wait and see how i could
use you and as slave i could gain
your confidence

  but you couldnt have planned on
the raid last week

  no and i pride myself especially
that i was so quick to see the opportuni-
ty and seize it that was a stroke of
genius if i may say so

  i dont believe that carol told
him you didnt have a chance to
speak to anyone since you and lane
got here

  our methods of communication with
each other are more highly developed
than i led you to believe vergor told
her it wasnt necessary for me to
speak to anyone

  carols eyes were still doubtful she
looked at magruder and beral then
back at vergor

  how did you know youd have a
chance to get back here

  we knew the situation in kuna
there are ways to get information
from prisoners i proposed the scheme
myself if you remember

  you were right all the way beral
said admiringly to magruder

  carol stared at them in astonish-
ment she had missed much in the last
week vergors eyes widened

  so you thought of that he mur-
mured i suspected you were of a
high intelligence well be able to make
use of you

  i still dont understand carol
insisted why was the whole thing
necessary

  because we needed the airships
vergor told her and this was the
only way i could see of getting them
undamaged

  but why do you need them at all

yergor smiled and shrugged
perhaps magruder can answer
that question

  it happens i can lane told him
they were all that was necessary for
the murdan invasion of earth

  vergors eyes shot up in astonish-
ment apparently he had been saving
that announcement as a triumph for
himself

  there were a few things wrong with
your act magruder went on only
a man with the greatest self-confidence
and ability could have remained on
earth as long as you without being
noticed and those are not the marks
of a slave

  pretty good vergor admitted
furthermore the murdan knowl-
edge of how the drums operate was
plainly greater than you said it was
you went to earth knowing you could
come back and you went as an ad-
vance scout the murdans were look-
ing for a fresh world to conquer
then why did you come back to
murd with me vergor asked

  i didnt know all that until after i
got here shall i go on

  vergor hesitated but lane was not
waiting for a reply he was anxious
to keep talking

  in the vibro-guns you had a weapon
which could have won the earth ex-
cept for one thing air power you


fantastic adventures

soon found out that there was no de-
fense against bombing from the air
except with planes and the green
ones could supply those

  how could you be sure vergor
demanded

  that was easy magruder smiled
i tested the vibro-gun i had with me
and found it showed wear quickly yet
it was new and so were all the others
id seen here that meant you knew
how to manufacture them

  vergors manner had grown wary it
was plain that his mind was busy with
the implications of what magruder had
said

  if you know all that why did you
let me come back here

  i had a few tricks up my own sleeve
if you were kept in kuna how could
carol and i get back to earth on a
direct attack we probably couldnt get
into this city and even if we did
there was a good chance that the mech-
anism of the drums would be damaged
this was the only way i could think of
getting in without a fight

  too bad you failed vergor said
in mock consolation

  we havent yet look up
vergors eyes went upward up
above the dome above the palace of
the hadri a green ship hovered and
from the stern of the ship an antenna
dangled vergor laughed

  now see what happens

  the dome was opening and from the
roof of the palace a battery of big guns
swung upward there was a drumming
and the green ship began to shudder
magruder held his breath this was it

  the drumming grew louder but
now there was a new note the beats
seemed to be coming closer and closer
together until they blended into a single
note

  the green ship stopped shuddering it
sank quickly so quickly that the dome

could not close in time and as it
touched the roof of the palace green
men swarmed from it to overrun the
men who manned the guns

  how do you like that magruder
asked

  he took a step toward vergor and
the murdan noble retreated the vibro-
gun in vergors hand came up and he
pressed the trigger nothing happened

  how- he gasped unbelievingly

  your guns are turned against them-
selves lane said

  he took another step forward and
vergor retreated again magruder
kept talking

  it was simple once i got the idea
all i had to do was construct a set
that picked up the waves from your
guns and sent them right back except
that it sends them back off beat so
the hollows of the waves are filled in
and theres no drumming only a sus-
tained sound which does no harm

  he took another step and vergor
threw his gun away looked wildly
around at swords point his men were
being forced to surrender

  ive been talking just to give the
men in the palace time to take over
magruder told him the hadri are
already captured its too late to dam-
age the drums

  not yet vergor breathed

  he flung himself around and was
running before anyone could lay a hand
on him the move caught magruder
by surprise by the time he got going
vergor was yards away and heading
straight for the palace

nphe murdan noble could run ma-
gruders flying feet ate up ground
at a prodigious rate but he gained only
inches at the palace entrance he
skidded to a stop swung in vergor
was half way down the great hall

  their footsteps echoing hollowly in
the drums of murd



the empty palace the two men raced
toward the dais somewhere above
them magruder heard the sound of
running men but the hadri were
gone their three identical thrones va-
cant

  vergor leaped upon the dais and ma-
gruder thought the murdan had gone
mad when he saw him rush to the cen-
ter throne but now vergor seized
both arms of the throne and was swing-
ing it so that it faced toward the back
wall a great section of the wall slid
back

  a light shone through from behind
the opening and as magruder followed
vergor he saw that the wall had con-
cealed a stairway which led down into
the bowels of the palace at break-
neck speed he piled down the stairs
after the murdan

  near the bottom the stairs curved
taking the curve at full speed ver-
gor slipped and magruder gained a
few feet when he reached the corri-
dor which opened off the stairway he
was only ten feet behind the murdan

  the corridor was short ending in a
vast room thousands of small vibro-
guns in all stages of manufacture were
scattered about and at the far end ma-
gruder saw the gleaming barrels of
guns larger than those on the palace
roof

  three men were in the great room
besides magruder and vergor they
were the hadri and they must have
got there only minutes earlier for they
were running down a long aisle as fast
as their old legs could carry them ver-
gor swung down the same aisle

  now lane could see what vergors
destination was the aisle ended in a
great control panel a gleaming single
sheet of the quartz-like material one
side of the panel was bare except for a
large switch

  the hadri turned frightened faces

                          

backward at the sound of the thudding
feet behind them at the sight of ver-
gor they brightened then were panic
stricken again as they saw magruder
so close behind

  without ceremony vergor brushed
the old men aside they were like
ancient withered dolls and his mo-
mentum bowled them over sent them
sprawling to block the way behind him

  a frantic leap carried magruder over
their heads but even that took time
already vergor was at the end of the
aisle and reaching for the switch on
the far side magruder could not pos-
sibly reach him in time to prevent him
from throwing it

  with a speed born of desperation
lanes hand darted out to sweep a fin-
ished vibro-gun from a bench and fling
it toward the panel in a single motion
it caught vergor in the side of the head
just as his hand touched the switch
knocked him off balance

  magruder was on him before he
could come around again lanes fists
hammered blows at the murdan
brought the white liquid in a stream
from his lips the advantage was ma-
gruders but vergor was not finished
yet

  even as he fell his arms went around
the taller mans legs magruders feet
shot out from under him and the back
of his head hit the floor half dazed
he saw vergor scoop up the gun he
had thrown

tlte caught the murdans wrist
held on grimly while his head
cleared but vergor had the strength
of a madman the gun turned slowly
inward magruder brought his fore-
head down sharply across the bridge
of the bardans nose and drew a scream
of pain as bone splintered

  vergors hand relaxed and before he
could recover magruder had the gun


fantastic adventures

now the tables were turned nowit
was lane who was trying to break free
as they rolled on the floor

  he had almost succeeded when veiv
gors feet caught him in the pit of the
stomach the kick drove magruder
backward and as he came to his knees
he saw vergor leaping for the switch

  lanes finger tightened on the trig-
ger and the room echoed with the drum-
ming of the vibro-gun vergors leap
was arrested in mid-air for a brief
instant his shriek rose above the drum-
ming and then his shuddering body
fell    inside the green ship beral
and haras said goodby to lane and
carol the faces of the green men were
troubled

  are you sure the drums will take
you back safely beral asked

  as sure as its possible to be ma-
gruder told him the beat of the
drums is natural and only becomes de-
structive when it is slowed down so that
it does not completely permeate the
body

  for better or for worse haras said
this will be the last time they beat as
soon as you are gone we will throw the
switch that destroys them they have
never been used for any but evil pur-
poses and now that the hadri and the
nobles have been eliminated there will
be no need for weapons on murd

  the ship stirred slightly and brushed
against the face of the cliff where it hung
suspended carol turned from the port-
hole where she had been looking out

  its just about the time when the
drums beat every day she said

  beral nodded and swung open the
hatch there was a last handshake be-
fore carol and lane stepped out into
the cleft between the two gleaming
walls then the hatch swung shut and
the ship slid away

  the beat came slowly at first and
magruder saw carols face whiten with

sudden fear but before he could speak
the tempo quickened he had just
enough time to take her hand his
whole body was pulsating now

  again the blackness came driving
away the daylight it was a black cur-
tain which fell before them behind
them enveloped them in its fold

  when the curtain parted they stood
on a terrace high above a lake which
sparkled in the moonlight far below
them was the string of lights which
marked the outer drive carol started
looked down at the hand that clasped
hers then up into lanes face

  were home he said quietly she
shuddered

  lets get out of here lane im
afraid of this place

  theres nothing to be afraid of any
more he smiled down at her after
our honeymoon well come back here to
live

  she pulled her hand free and turned
and ran the door was open and she
was in the hall when magruder caught
up with her carols face was white
as he bent to kiss her

  i can still hear those drums in my
mind she trembled and as long as
wed live here id be afraid they would
beat again

  but haras and beral promised they
would destroy the drums he reminded
her

  well never be sure

  wait listen

  the drums were beating again the
two stood tense looking into the room
but the beat was changing the
rhythm was not the same suddenly
there was a crackling ripping sound
and the room was silent again

  magruder looked down at the girl
beside him the fear was draining
from her face and she was smiling

  all right she said after our
honeymoon
egyptian festival for ares

	by kay

the egyptians were the first men to make
solemn assemblies and processions to the
temples of the gods in many scattered cities
they held many festivals each year involving sac-
rifices honoring their gods at papremis they do
sacrifice and worship for ares when the sun be-
gins to go down a great multitude of priests stand
near the entrance of the temple of ares with
wooden clubs opposite them are stationed many
thousand other men who have come to the city
to make vows they are also carrying wooden
staves the image of their god ares has been
taken from the temple the day before and now is
being returned it is pulled in a little wagon by
a few attendants and when they approach the
gateway of the temple the priests try to prevent
it from entering the thousands of men who have

bennett	

 come to the city to make their vows come to the
 assistance of their god and strike the priests who
 in turn try to defend themselves there is ajways
 a terrible fight with staves and they break one
 anothers heads and many die

   this solemn but bloody custom of worship was
 established for this reason the mother of ares
 used to dwell in this temple are was brought up
 away from her and when he grew up he came to
 visit his mother the attendants of his mothers
 temple had never seen him before and didnt know
 who he was so they kept him away ares found
 men to help him from a neighboring city and got
 rough with the attendants entered the temple and
 visited his mother so this exchange of blows has
 become the custom in honor of ares on his festival
 day

whats under an ant hill

	by sandy miller	

the study of the habits of ants is one of the
most interesting subjects the insect world
provides ants have many social classes
the royal caste worker caste warrior caste and
slave caste among them they have gardeners
governesses and hunters they live in ant hills
that are designed architecturally perfect and every
ant takes over at birth the task it was born to do
for the common good of the ant hill

  we never stop to think of ants till we encounter
one face to face in our picnic salad we usually
think of them as wingless as most of them are but
the royal caste have wings they are the princesses
who mate and become queens each going to a new
place and populating a new city and also the
princes who die soon after they mate the winged
females are the largest then the winged males and
then the wingless workers which are the smallest
each queen starts her own ant nest she pulls off
her wings as soon as she has mated and tunnels
under ground and lays her eggs she feeds the
larvae on food which she brings up from her own
stomach it isnt very beneficial and there isnt
enough to go around therefore the first hatch of
ants is quite small and wingless and become the
workers of the various castes the next hatch of
ants fares much better because the first hatch has
stocked the larder and enlarged the ant hill and
made hundreds of tunnels and galleries storerooms
nurseries and gardens some ants go out hunting
dead insects that are many times larger than them-
selves and drag them back down into their pan-

tries for the needs of the new babies some food
gatherers have two stomachs one for their own
needs and one for bringing in the food for the
babies others are dairy farmers who capture herds
of plant lice and keep them in their barns and
milk them regularly for the children some go out
and load up on honey till they are about to burst
then come home and suspend themselves by their
hind legs from the ceiling of the pantry any little
child ant that has a sweet tooth can come in and
tap the mouth of the living honey cask

  the gardeners gather leaves and other vegeta-
tion they ferment them and a little fungi or tiny
mushroom grows out of it which they use for food
perhaps they make a mushroom sauce to use over
their beetle steaks

  usually the workers are sexless perhaps the
larvae is underfed so that it will fail to develop
sex and wings and therefore remain in the worker
caste the best fed larvae get special food and
have elegant nurseries and are carried way to the
bottom of the ant hiu when danger is near

  some kinds of ants build huge ant hills six feet
high but most of them make their elaborate homes
under ground some species raid the homes of
smaller ants kill the soldiers and earn off the egg
cages from which will emerge young ants that will
become their slaves one kind has become so de-
pendent on slave labor that without it they would
perish they would just starve to death rather
than do a little work for themselves mankind
might find a moral there
the only pulp he reads

sirs

  i was first introduced to the ziff-davis line
with the second issue of fantastic adven-
tures the colorful cover sold me on the maga-
zine and i enjoyed it so much that i went right
out and bought an amazing stories ive
been reading every one of your pulps since then
and i might add that they are the only pulps
i read

  one of the outstanding things about the ziff-
davis line i think are the attractive covers i
think they alone bring in a lot of new readers
because they are consistently the best and most
colorful on the newsstands

  ive often wondered what happened to eando
binder his story the little people in one of
the first issues of fa was the most outstanding
yarn ever written about fairies goblins and such
and there is don wilcox who will always be
one of the best fantasy writers in my opinion
we dont see as much of him now as we used
to  i think we all mourned the loss of such
writers as david wright obrien and leroy yerxa

  im quite curious about this harold m sher-
man who wrote the up and up in mammoth
detective and a couple of novels for amaz-
ing a short while ago is he the same writer
who used to write juvenile books some years
back

  keep up the good work in all your magazines
keep bill hopson producing for mammoth
western and keep writers like robert moore
williams chester s geier richard s shaver
and william p mcgivern producing for fa

                        ray allen romer
                        po box 

                            idaho falls idaho

  we agree with you wholeheartedly that the
ziff-davis pulps are the best buy on the news-
stands why shouldnt they be-since they are
the best to eando binder hes been pretty
busy the past jew years working on comic strips
but youll be seeing him again one of these
days    and youre right about harold m
sherman he turned out over fifty juvenile novels
and incidentally his sequel to the green man
appeared in the last issue of amazing
stories but youve probably already read it
   youll also be seeing the other writers you
mentioned very frequently in the pages of the
ziff-davis pulpsed

praise for rog phillips

sirs

  i have been contemplating writing to you for
quite some time but have very inexcusably put
it off perhaps because i have never written to
a magazine and am a little timid to begin with
but having just read the story high ears by
rog phillips i immediately knew i would have
to write to you and express or rather try to
express my admiration for all the authors the
editors and everyone connected with fa-and
also for thestaff of amazing stories

  never have i encountered such terrifically writ-
ten stories they seem to captivate my whole
being from the first page to the last you see i
wouldnt think of letting a page go by without
reading it thoroughly in my estimation they are
the tastiest food for the thinker there is on the
earth rog phillips is just tops with me espe-
cially since his superb novel so shall ye reap
words cant begin to express what feeling that
story brought to the surface

  also i appreciate very much the high quality
of art work that you have in your magazine
the illustrations perfectly complete ones mental
conception of the stories

  i am anxiously looking forward to the coming
issues of fa and as

goodness sake dont be timid about writing us
again  ked

the best readers page

sirs

  i dont generally like shaver stories but
witch of the andes in the october issue was
quite fair however the art work excelled the
story and the cover was a real treasure if i
had a framable copy id be thrilled to death it
seems that the newsdealer always scribbles on it
and then too the printed words detract from the
beauty of the cover

  a knotted string by livingston was a good
yarn with a moral lesson it had quite a lot of
intelligence behind it and though the plot was
mediocre that knotted string and the object
lesson it gave the hero made it worthwhile

  st reynard did all right on his pegasus story
it was enjoyable throughout

the hesitant angel by larry sternig was
readers page



amusing and pretty i enjoyed it but wished it
could have gone on and on such a pretty tale
merits being enlarged on

  photo finish by hickey was of interest the
st clair story whenever the sun shines was
good her stories are always good

  the king of the issue was of course high
ears by rog phillips this story was a real
jewel after i read it i sat back satisfied it
was the best in many months congratulations to
phillips and get him to do some more like this

  and now about the readers page i want to
give you a few orchids other magazines let cer-
tain readers in or certain subjects until the
readers page is not functioning for more than
a few individuals or groups your magazine alone
is outstanding in its democracy amongst the
fan letters thanks from all of us who appreciate
true justice your whole magazine is tops

a shaver classic

  i have been a regular reader of your two maga-
zines fa and as for many years now and think

the works of don wilcox william p mcgivern
berkeley livingston chester s geier and of
course richard s shaver who has the distinction
of having written the best yarn i have ever read
namely an adam from the sixth truly a
classic your best artists are fuqua robert gib-
son jones maccauley and rod ruth

fine science-fantasy magazines

comments on the commentators

sirs

  in the sept issue of fa i am turning to the
readers page because i have always admired
this part of your magazine and i think that one
reason it is not bigger is that the fans dont
seem to pay enough attention to it i know its
natural to talk about the stories but id like
to make a commentary on the commentators
john h clayton

  yes i think the editors choice of stories is
decidedly wise i thought the red dwarf was a
very unusual story a real fantasy and it had a
message of sorts for those who like to consider
more than bare plot structures however i abso-
lutely disagree with you in your comments on the
toffee stories by charles myers i am neither
for or against these stories but i think they are
well written and interesting to read but in re-
gard to your statements that the author is poor
because he imitates thorne smith all i can
say is that ye eds well thought-out reply is
quite correct enough said

h	d massey

  while i was not so impressed with richard
caseys carrion crypt as you were i am glad
you liked elroy arnos secret of the yomar
it was a fine story and you can add my congratu-
lations i though that sturgeons masterpiece
largo was much more than rather nice i
cant see what that story lacked i like myers
style too and particularly i liked the very pleas-
ing passage you quoted john h clayton evidently
missed these touches in toffee takes a trip
your comments on goddess of the golden
flame and peter backs a punch were very
well put i think however you must bear in
mind that the authors of both of these stories
have turned in better work in the past more
power to your suggestion that fa continue with
more arno and casey and i would also add
chester s geier theodore sturgeon robert
moore williams richard s shaver and rog
phillips

james w ayers

  again i agree that elroy arnos secret of the
yomar was a fine yarn i disagree however in
your statement that it was the second time that
the lead novels have been beaten out by a short
because that means you didnt place shavers
the tale of the red dwarf in first place-
where it rightly belongs i try to judge a story
by its intrinsic worth not its length so i find
the following stories on my favorite list in re-
cent issues largo a short by sturgeon the
tale of the red dwarf a short novel by
shaver man of two worlds a novelette by
bob williams happiness is nowhere a novel-
ette by chet geier cult of the eagle a novel-
ette by berkeley livingston and an adam from
the sixth a short by richard s shaver
william muir cox

a very good tribute to richard s shavers
classic when you read the rest of the yarns

you probably found two more line stories in
tomorrow and tomorrow by ray bradbury
and meet my mummy by elroy arno

james l cribelar

  im afraid that leroy yerxas the emperors
eye has been thoroughly debunked by jay
williams in my opinion david wright obrien
has written better things than painting of
the prophet his two best were victory
from the void and private prune speaking
another good comment on shavers tale of the
red dwarf i was not so impressed with for-
ever is too long by chester s geier although
i recognize that it is a fine story i think his
three classics are happiness is nowhere
haunted metropolis and getaway in ye
eds reply to your letter  notice that he seems
to have a fixation on the poor phds he is
wrong agreement or disagreement with richard
shaver is not determined by a mans profession
or education

jay williams

  a very careful criticism of a story that evi-
dently needed it letters like that are valuable
to the fans i agree  to the principle of
this letter although i am not an authority on
roman times so i cannot verify it your last
paragraph is certainly an editors model ye eds
feeble attempt to squirm out of an argument
which he should have considered won by you
was not the sort of thing i like to see an editor
do it was only fair of him to say that leroy
yerxa tried to make his story accurate by doing
research work but he should not have used that
unconvincing alibi about an author sometimes
finding it necessary to deviate slightly from
the facts as we know them an author should
never find it necessary to distort history in that
amateurish way because magnificent flights of
historical fantasy can be written without mak-
ing any glaring errors in his background

miss elaine scott

  you have another good view of the tale of
the red dwarf i rated it first too also you
express my feelings about tomorrow and to-
morrow exactly and i rated it second too
the emperors eye apparently does not have
a good historical background and i also agree
with you that the magical-bit-of-glass theme
has been overdone a good description of shades
of henry morgan i agree about your phony
love interest feeling your comments on paint-
ing of the prophet and when the spirit
moves me are mine also incidentally the lat-
ter title is probably derived from a popular song
of some years ago you rather surprised me
in your comparison of meet my mummy to
raymond chandlers style but i am forced to
admit looking back on the story that you are
right nevertheless i still like it better than
many other stories in the issue but then i
like raymond chandlers style and i like ye ed
do not recognize the terms copy or imitation

  a home run with the bases loaded for rog
phillips  in my opinion his high ears ranks
well up at the head of such a select body of
stories as out of the test tube and sian
phillips explanations of scientific terms were so
clear and to the point that the whole story fitted
into a pattern which is very rare in stf authors
today and which i have found with few excep-
tions including the ones mentioned above only
in recognized novels such as those written by
jules verne and h g wells it is a refreshing
experience indeed to find such a tale within
the confines of my own fa good for phillips

  the other stories are as follows in second
place witch of the andes a fine fantasy by a
fine writer in third mr beller and the
winged horse lets have more about mr beller
in fourth a knotted string could be but i
doubt it in fifth photo finish phoo in
sixth whenever the sun shines double phoo

  this issue in the style of writing anyway
could set a big example for issues yet to come

his top ten authors

sirs

  i have just purchased the october fa and
hasten to make a bid for the beautiful front
cover in my estimation this cover is by far the
best i have ever seen on any magazine

  there are many things i like especially about
your magazine that seldom if ever get any
acknowledgment from the readers one of these
is the custom you originated of putting beside
the title of the story on the contents page the
number of words in the story never set this

custom aside also i always enjoy reading the
delightful editors page i dont have to remind
you that the size of the printing in your maga-
zine is larger than in any of the others making
easier reading and another feature i particularly
enjoy is the cartoons you run off and on

  as for your stories they are always good here
is my list of favorite writers

  	harold m sherman-his novels

  	rog phillips-all his yarns

  	don wilcox-all of his

 	edmond hamilton-star king cant be
beat

  	robert bloch-lefty feep stories

  	richard shaver-a great writer

 	william l hamling-what happened to
him

  	chester s geier-ditto

  	robert moore williams-always good

   berkeley livingston-at last a novel

  those are my ten favorite writers i have only
two favorite cover artists robert gibson jones
and h w maccauley

  malcolm smith does good on space themes
james settles on sea themes arnold kohn on
your detective magazines bob jones again on
mammoth western incidentally who did the
cover for the january  issue of mammoth
adventure my guess is malcolm smith am i
right  by the way i read and enjoy all of
your magazines but fa is my top favorite

                           burnett toskey
                           po box

  were mighty proud and glad you like our be-
hind the scenes features we think its little
touches like some of the ones you mentioned
that go into the making of a good magazine
we call it creative editing and were always
looking for something new to give our readers
of the two writers in your list of ten favorites
that you ask about the first is writing this reply
to you and the second-do you really mean you
havent seen chet geier in fa or as lately
chet has had some fine stories including novels
during the past year remember forever is
too long in fa or hidden city in as or
the golden sixgun in mw not to mention
numerous shorts and we agree with you on
our artists they are the best in the field that
cover on the january ma was not done by
smith however it was by bob jones how
did you like the cover on this issueed

sequel wanted

sirs

  this is the first fan letter i have written but
the story high ears was quite an unusual
story in my estimation you see it made me
want to read a sequel what happened after
the high ears race conquered the earth dont
tell me they didnt because a brain equal to
harveys he might have been exceptional even
for a high ears or even half his intellect could
take over this world painlessly and with benefits
that would make humans think it was their
own idea

 there were thousands of them how were
they distributed-study the problem of dps
already on earth and youll see why i ask were
some female or all male come now id like
to have the answer in a sequel

  i liked the pegasus story and then witch
of the andes the others were all right with
or above the usual standard of fa stories

  i always like the yarns as long as they recon-
cile with the facts i mean a man can come
back from the dead-as a stf reader i concede
that-but hes got to be bound by certain limita-
tions not talk if he could make a story more
thrilling by not talking pages before when he
would have given away the plot

  well while were at it a good example of a
bad story was the movie the ghost goes wild
the ghost knew something which made every
bad character step into line but the audience
was told-dont you wish you knew-just
plain laziness on the authors part not bothering
to figure out the solution he had an invisible
ghost whisper to the bad ones and left it at
that guess i better close now

the gelid fane categorically
subsumed

sirs

  as you will find this letter singularly free of
the usual chummy pap and unwarranted eulogy
that characterizes most of your readers corre-
spondence to this publication the possibilities of
its being printed are remote notwithstanding my
prescience of this papers probable bourne viz a
wastebasket i feel it to be my obligation to
make known my disapproval of the type of
story you are currently favoring

  with each succeeding issue of fantastic adven-
tures the wonderfully subtle and gelid fane of
illusion painstakingly erected by such masters as
poe blackwood merritt and collins is being
more horribly desecrated

  the sort of pap that you are trying to foist
upon your intelligent reader is unspeakably bad
i believe that the late h p lovecraft once said
that the thing making a horror story or phantasy
story successful is the possibility of its actually
happening using that axiom as a criterion by
which to judge the stories in fantastic adven-
tures i am forced to subsume all of them under
the category failures

  a noteworthy example of sheer jargon is to be
found in your magazines latest feature story
witch of the andes the author of this im-
pressive opus had one of his characters say
the body of man can be considered as a series
of cells of separate natures whose symbiotic rela-
tions are a result of long ages of interaction be-
tween their many once divergent life-forms 

  now all cells are not dissimilar they are
fundamentally alike thus biological texts are
able to print diagramatic representations of gen-
eralized cells symbiosis in cell life will have to
be explained to me as i am astute enough to
see its possibility also new cells can develop by
division only a fact which seems to negate
the worth of the whole theory

  it is my holding that several pages of ap-
propriate poetry per issue is a desideratum sev-
eral of the rival phantasy-fiction magazines have
instituted this feature already

  as it appears that a nadir in textual quality
has been reached i look forward to enjoying a
regenerated fantastic adventures

his first letter

sirs

  i am fourteen years old and have been col-
lecting science-fantasy for some years i have
saved eight stories out of all i have read half
of them are from fantastic adventures
one is the land of the big blue apples by
don wilcox this is a delightful and interesting
story and wilcox is one of my favorite authors
i always read his stories with interest another
readers page



one of my favorites is the return of circe by
nat schachner also union in gehenna by
nelson s bond who is also one of my favorites
another great story i thought was ill dream
of you by charles f myers i liked this yarn
very much and think it is by far the best of the
toffee series so far my favorite artist is
robert gibson jones i think hes great

  this is my first letter to any magazine so i
dont expect it to be printed just the same ill
be waiting for next months fa with open arms
hoping for another toffee story as good as
the first one a don wilcox story and of course
a cover by bob jones

  well there you are marie your first letter did
get printedi just make sure it isnt your last
one-well be waiting to hear from you again
incidentally how did you like the toffee story
in the november issue ed

von cosel and death

sirs

  this is my first letter to any magazine and
i have written it because of the deep interest
aroused in me by the story entitled the secret
of elenas tomb in which karl tanzler von
cosel reveals an amazing and unknown meaning
for the word death he describes it as being
in some cases a cataleptic state and if true i
think it will explain the fact that many a body
has been dug up after years of burial without
showing any signs of decay

  i believe that the true scientists the men who
do not deny the truth of a phenomenon before
it is proved untrue will find it worth more than
just one experiment

  with the hopes of hearing more of von cosels
ideas i am very truly yours

                   rua noronha santos 
                   rio de janeiro brazil

  there are a great many mysteries that science
has neglected to check up on and certainly von
cosels theory and experiment is one of them ed

an amazing phenomenon

sirs

  i have read fa and as since i was twelve
years old but this is the first time i have written
you a letter i have always found the character
of your stories to my liking and didnt bother
to give an opinion before however von cosels
story in the september issue last year the
secret of elenas tomb has caused me to do
more thinking and wondering than anything i
have ever read except the shaver mystery

  something has happened here recently that
ties up with von cosels beliefs i havent got
all the information on it but the story was
told to me by a friend of the family who is
not the type of person who tells wild tales any-

way here is the story as it was told to me
and you can investigate it and find out for your-
selves

  there is an italian family known in the neigh-
borhood of th st  th ave in brooklyn
as the brigadiers around the first of august
one of their daughters died of an extended
illness four hours after her death with a
doctor present the family and friends were
grouped in the house discussing funeral arrange-
ments with the undertaker one of them hap-
pened to glance into the adjoining room where
the dead girl was lying on a bed the deceaseds
eyes began to open slowly and her lips began to
move then she called for her mother in a low
but clear voice the shocked people rushed into
the room the girl sat up by herself and asked
is someone wouldnt get her a bottle of ginger
ale as she felt very thirsty they got her a
bottle of ginger ale and she immediately drank
it within the next four hours she drank two
more bottles of ginger ale and talked to them
she was examined thoroughly by the doctor
present but he could find no traces of life-no
heartbeat no breathing her body cold-and yet
she was sitting up talking to them and drinking

  she told her family not to grieve over her
and that she was sorry for any trouble she
had caused them she told them that she had
some bad news to tell them but not to take it
too hard she spoke then directly to one of her
sisters and told her that within two weeks she
too would die then after four hours of this
strange revived life she lay back still

  but here is the unusual thing the sister whom
she had addressed died exactly two weeks later
now i think this story is true but whether it
is or not it is worth looking into your maga-
zine has shown great courage in the past in
printing stories and articles which disagree with
some of the accepted theories of down-to-earth
scientists keep up the good work and heres
one reader you will never lose

                             brooklyn ny

  a very interesting and unusual account darrell
if the story as you have related it is indeed true
and we have no evidence at hand to disprove it
then it is certainly a piece of evidence in favor
of von cosels own experiments any readers
who have any knowledge of this particular inci-
dent are invited to write to used

nothing unusual

sirs

  the october issue of fa was nothing unusual
first was shavers witch of the andes glad
to see him again in fa mr beller and the
winged horse and whenever the sun shines
were also two good stories the hesitant
angel was readable but too short a smart
ending though i wont make any comment on
the other stories
readers page



  next issue ought to be good with livingstons
lamp of vengeance i hope so as the lead
novels havent been too good lately

  well were glad to see you liked the stories any-
way janies and we think the novels will prove
to be top-notch from now oned

first for mr beller

sirs

  i like your magazine very much in fact i
place it second only to one magazine amazing
stories i have just finished reading your
october issue naturally mr beller and the
winged horse took first place i think a sequel
for it would be in order

  next of course was high ears by rog
phillips very good but thats to be expected
of rog then i place witch of the andes third
this story was so much unlike most of shavers
stories that it was actually good    and last a
knotted string by berkeley livingston the
rest were too short and say whats happened
to toffee and am i glad to see that j w
pelkie is coming back with another toka
story

  the cover for the october issue was especially
good the interiors were fair

  youve probably already read the latest tof-
fee story in the november issue were willing to
bet that youll say its the best yarn myers has
turned out thus far and also let us know
what you thought of the new toka story which
appeared last monthed

calling mr clayton

sirs

  i have been reading fa i believe since it was
published the first time-and have always en-
joyed it very much

  like john h clayton this is my first letter
to an editor of any magazine and i probably
wouldnt be writing this one if clayton hadnt
called charles f myers toffee a cheap imita-
tion of topper takes a trip--and rotten

  i disagree very much with clayton in my
estimation toffee is a very likeable creature
and i hope mr myers will pop up with her
more often in spite of people like clayton

  the stories in fa that i havent cared for have
been so few that i wont try to remember them
fa is my favorite magazine and will continue
to be as long as it publishes stories of the same
calibre as in the past

the thing on
the moon

an impossible but true
feature   

by a morris  malcolm smith

see back cover

in  in the lunar alps a man was intent
on observing the surface of the moon this
man named schroeter saw what appeared at
first to be a light but a short time later became
what seemed to be a large shadow vaguely round
it was of an almost indefinable nature and yet
seemed to have the similar outlines that a gigantic
crow might have a crow that might have been
flying through space and its shadow from the suns
rays was somewhat cast upon the moons surface
or it might have been a planet speeding through
the void its shadow suddenly showing up on the
moon

 charles fort in his book of the damned
would seem to agree with this latter view that
the shadow was a luminous object near the moon
suddenly lost to view but then its shadow under-
neath was seen

 in  two astronomers h c russell and
g d hirst were observing the moon in the
blue mountains near sydney australia they
saw a  large part of the moon covered with a
dark shade quite as dark as the shadow of the
earth during an eclipse of the moon both men
being scientists this was as far as they would care
to go in their description but the fact remains
that they did see something something impossible
but true i and they were men who were well
versed in astronomy and who knew that what
they saw was not a part of the normal pattern of
things

  did they see an eclipse if so then it must
have been an eclipse that science knew nothing
about was it in actuality a living creature much
like a bird if so how could it have lived in the
utter cold and lifelessness of outer space

  only one thing is certain the shadow what-
ever it may have been was seen by competent
observers an impossible shadow but neverthe-
less true

free to pipe smokers

this non-condensing sanaton demonstrator pipe

just enclose c to cover postage and packing

 i could talk about this new kind of pipe until the
 cows come home but the only way i can convince
 you that it gives you the coolest sweetest cleanest
 and driest smoke you ever enjoyed is to send you
 a full-size demonstrator free

dr j c shotton

prominent cleveland ohio
dentist - inventor of dr
shottons non-condensing
sanaton pipe

 if you are a pipe smoker i know how skeptical
 you are about new pipe inventions so before ex-
 pecting you to buy one of my sanaton pipes i am
 offering you this demonstrator free my dem-
 onstrator will serve the purpose of proving to you
 that the unique sanaton non-condensing
 and easy-cleaning features give you the driest
 sweetest coolest and cleanest smoke you ever en-
 joyed from any pipe regardless of name make or
 price i am gambling that if my demonstrator does
 this you will want one of my better grades if not
 youre out nothing except the c i ask for to help
 pay the postage and handling on the demonstrator

 whot this demonstrator must prove

   dr shottons non-condensing sana ton pipe is now
  being enjoyed by nearly  pipe smokers-all of
  whom bought it after trying it some of these fellows
  have been smoking pipes for   or even  years
  some have from so to  pipes in their collections
  and they like the sanaton better than all the rest put
  together there must be a reason and here it is

   most ordinary pipes as you know are equipped with
  tubes traps filters baffles and gadgets of all kinds
  whose purpose it is to catch and hold goo however
  dr shotton knew that these gadgets actually caused
  condensation of the goo they collected-just as a cool
  pitcher of ice water in a warm room causes moisture to
  condense on the outer surface of the glass he realized
  that the real secret of a dry sweet pipe is to prevent
  goo from forming at all

   now what did dr shotton do well instead of
 placing a catch-all gadget in the sanaton pipe he placed
 a small slotted tube at the bottom of the bowl this
 tube acts as a non-condenser for as you light this
 pipe the tube warms up-and theres no cold surface on
 which goo can condense no condensation no goo
 its as simple as that

   then or shotton went a step further he extended
  the non-condenser tube through the back wall of the
  pipe and attached a tiny removable screw whenever
  you want to clean out the tar that results from tobacco
  combustion just remove the screw and run a regular
  pipe cleaner through from end to end the sanaton
  cleans like a gun

amazing free offer

as i said before i dont expect you to buy my regu-
lar sanaton until you try my demonstrator with its
non-condensing and easy-cleaning features so ill
send you a demonstrator free just send c to help
cover postage and handling then if i dont hear
from you within two weeks ill send you one of my
genuine imported briar sanatons and you can pay for it
when it arrives but-if you dont like the way my
sanaton demonstrator smokes-if you dont find it to
be the driest sweetest cleanest and coolest smoke
you ever had just tell me so and ill cancel your reser-
vation isnt that a fair and square proposition

be sure to tell me whether you want me to reserve a
regular sanaton at  deluxe sanaton at s 
or sterling sanaton at  all my sanatons are
made of genuine aged imported briar-the only dif-
ference is in the quality grain and finish be sure to
let me know whether you prefer a large medium or
small bowl only one demonstrator to a person
please
