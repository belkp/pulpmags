t eep weird tales weird this is the advice that we are constantly receiving
in letters from you the readers of this magazine to judge from the commen-
dations that pour into the editorial offices we are succeeding in doing this
this is by way of prelude to announcing one of the weirdest stories that has ever ap-
peared in any publication the horror from the hills by frank belknap long jr this
is a three-part serial story that sounds cosmic depths of weirdness a tale of a horror and
menace utterly beyond human means to combat a tale in which horror blows in chill
gusts from the outer void it is seldom that any story has aroused such vast enthusiasm in
the editorial rooms of weird tales and we want to let you know what a treat is in
store for you the horror from the hills is undoubtedly the finest work that this
brilliant and imaginative writer has yet produced

     e l mengshoel of minneapolis writes to the eyrie the last two issues of
weird tales were in my opinion the best that you have published since i began
reading your magazine especially did i enjoy the way the tide finally turned against
that typically small-brained and small-souled egotist herman fuller in another
dracula and how vividly and strikingly realistically did the author portray the ac-
tivity of the mob spirit in the graveyard scene it was a true-to-life sketch of such
human cattle too much present in any community in main street towns in particu-
lar in your august number i found a story that made tremendous appeal to my
mind namely the reprint of charles dickens a childs dream of a star it re-
called to me my boyhood days as i read it in my school books but it was in nor-
wegian the title being guttens drom om stjemen how i wept as i read it as a
ten-year-old kid those school readers did not give the names of the authors of
their pieces and though i had many times wondered who wrote that touching story
it is first in weird tales that i learnt that no less a writer than charles dickens
was the author all in all i am glad that we have a magazine that is different-
something that we do not get tired of reading like those vapid commonplace and too
often downright silly love stories about ordinary middle class parvenues and the va-
rious kinds of drivel which the majority of other magazines serve to a simple-minded
public

     wont you please give us more stories so weird that they make ones hair
stand on end requests ruth ann austin of aubumdale wisconsin in a lettet
to the eyrie i like a dying mans confession in the october issue very mudij
also the silver curse of yarlik the druids shadow and the grave at goonhilly

weird tales

continued from page 

stories with scenes reflecting the glamor of moonlight on a persian garden the
charm of romantic france the exoticism of a turkish harem or tales with a chinese
arabian or south sea locale would be greatly appreciated by us readers

    w a betikofer of washington d c writes to the eyrie i have read
weird tales without missing an issue since the  number containing the bird
of space in these four years there have been approximately a half-dozen stories
which completely overshadowed all others with the possible exception of seabury
quinns stories of jules de gran din i should enumerate them as follows the mon-
ster-god of mamurth edmond hamiltons finest the lurking fear the time-
raider the call of cthulhu and skull-face though i only know of the rats in
the walls by reprint it is fully worthy to stand in their company jules de grandin is
my favorite character followed closely by solomon kane the shadow kingdom
and its sequels nearly edge into the list of incomparables e hoffmann price in his
stories of the orient creates perhaps the most fascinating and exotic atmosphere of
any of your writers doctor kellers delightful little stories of cecil the overlord
add a finishing touch to your magazine that makes it truly unequaled writers such as
quinn price lovecraft la spina and a few others give your magazine the quality
that makes it what it is doctor keller is one of your best toksvig is fine and
adolphe de castro is acceptable but could be better as for hamilton - three
cheers and a half-dozen boos he has merited bodi in his time to swing to the
other end of the scale i should like to see such stuff as the mother goose asininity
of the land of lur eliminated that was absolutely the punkest contribution to
weird tales i have ever seen

     a letter from robert leonard russell of mt vernon illinois says fthe por-
tal to power begins perfectly and i hope the other three installments are on a par
with the first try to get another robert e howard story like skull-face his sto-
ries of solomon kane are very interesting jules de grandin is just as perfect as he
thinks he is which is saying a lot tell seabury quinn that if he ever writes any
other type of story the readers will come en masse and lynch him

    writes james gartlan of toronto canada i have been a constant reader of
weird tales since july  weird tales has given me some very interesting
evenings and also some when i was afraid to move lest the creature of seabury
quinn or h p lovecraft would come out of the shadows of my den i get a bigger
kick out of jules de grandins french slang and his method of combating the occult
demons than i get from any detective or western novel jules is a great cheery
fellow always ready to help any one who is in the clutches of the occult just one
kick-earthworms of karma started out great as did the black monarch but the
author seemed to be in too great hurry to finish i am eagerly awaiting oriental
stories and hope that it will be a worthy sister magazine to weird tales

    speaking as a reader writes clark ashton smith author of the end of the
story i should like to say that weird tales is the one magazine that gives its
writers ample imaginative leeway next to it come the three or four magazines in
which fancy can take flight under the egis of science and after these one is lost in
a boeotian desert all the others without exception from the long-established re-

the house party with which nor-
val fleetwood was celebrating the
completion of twelvetrees his
new country seat was drawing to an in-
auspicious close friday and saturday
had been successful and more than one
luckless bunny had found his way into
the game-bags and thence to the pot-pie
but with sunday morning came a let-
down which set the guests longing for
the city the theater the night clubs and
the crowded comfortable associations of
the workaday world rain lashed and
driven by a northwest wind opened the
day by midafternoon autumn gave up

     

the fight and winter took possession of
the world like a rowdy barbarian sacking
a captured city the late-november gale
raced round the house wrenching at
doors and shutters howling bawdy songs
down chimneys and wrestling savagely
with the twelve great oaks in the front
lot from which the house took its name
the guests were wearied of each other as
shipwrecked mariners might tire of their
companions faces and to make matters
more unbearable the line which fed elec-
tric current to the house went dead
beneath the bufferings of the wind-storm
and the radio ceased blaring forth its
tbonrot

the tiny savage thing died slowly writhing horribly

dancing jazz at the same instant every
light in the house winked out and the
motors of the big refrigerator in the pan-
try stopped humming

  little spurts of flame here and there
proclaimed lighted matches a few candles
were requisitioned and set alight their
feeble trembling flames doing little more
than stain the pitch-black darkness with
an indeterminate dusk and host and
guests settled down in gloomy contem-
plation of events to wait the opportunity
of a reasonable excuse to say good-night
and escape from each others company

  no one here can play dance music
grumbled one

  no piano here to play even if we had
 musician fleetwood answered gloom-

ily dodsons are infernally slow get-
ting the furniture out it seems to me
too dark to play bridge cant see
whether youre holdin spades or di-
amonds

  i shouldnt play if it werent lost
too much last night-lot more than i
could afford

  grand service the electric company
gives i dont think if i had my

way-

  oh i know what lets do mazie
noyer plump forty and unbecomingly
flirtatious suddenly cried in the high
thin voice which seems the exclusive
property of short fat women lets

it cold and dark and spooky come on

                                   


weird tales

everybody ill be the medium i can
make a dining-table take a joke any
time

  but certainly jules de grandin
whispered in my ear does she not do
so three times each day to say nothing of
the enormous sandwiches she consumes
between meals do not join them
friend trowbridge he who puts his
hands upon the table to summon spirits
risks more than burned fingers yes let
them have their foolishness bv them-
selves

  accordingly while fleetwood his
young wife and seven of their guests
trailed into the dining-hall in the wake of
mazies provocatively swishing skirts de
grandin and i remained on the leather-
upholstered settle before the blazing
logs in the hall fireplace where we could
watch the dim shapes circled round the
table yet be ourselves unobserved

  the ring was quickly formed each
member of the party placed his hands
flat upon the tables polished oak his
own thumbs touching his extended little
fingers in light contact with those of his
neighbors to left and right

  i think we ought to sing suggested
mazie madame northrop always begins
her seances with ajhymn what shall it
be for a moment there was silence
then in a high falsetto she began

       behold the innumerable host
       of angels clothed in light

        behold the spirits of the just
           whose faith is changed to sight

  she concluded the verse with a drop-
ping pleading tremolo then spoke in a
still awe-struck voice as though she half
believed her own mummery

  spirits of the departed you from
before whose eyes the separating veil has
been lifted we are assembled tonight to
commune with you if any of you be here
present a short pause then are
there any spirits with us if so signify

your presence by rapping once upon the
table

  another pause in which the crackling
of a burning knot and the hissing of an
imperfectly seasoned log sounded almost
thunderously followed her invitation

  jules de grandin snapped the flint of
his pocket lighter and set a vile-smelling
french cigarette aglow then glanced im-
patiently through the archway leading to
the room beyond insensee he whis-
pered contemptuously had she but the
sense with which the good god endowed
the most half-witted of silly geese she
would know that her greatest success
tonight would be a total failure to
evoke-

 oh how nice mazies high-pitched
exclamation cut through his muttered
observation is it fine or superfine-i
mean man or woman rap once for a
man twice for a woman please

  the little frenchmans sleek blond
head shot forward his ear turned toward
the doorway all pretense of boredom
was gone and every line of his small
sensitive face registered alert attention a
it showed in sharp silhouette against the
bright background of the firelight

  through the dim candle-lit dusk we
caught the echo of a single sharp in-
cisive knock

  a man miss noyers voice came in
an awed whisper who are-i mean
who were you where and when did
you live strike once for a twice for b
three times for c and so on

  another pause then a slow distinct
rapping as though the table had been
struck sharply with a bent knuckle seven
strokes followed by nine then twelve
another twelve then five continuing
until gilles gamier-st bonnot-in the
reign of king charles had been labo-
riously spelled on the resounding wood

  dieu de dieu gilles garnier of st
bonnot it says de grandin exclaimed
the wolf of st bonnot



in a sharp rasping whisper this is no
longer merely a matter to amuse fools
friend trowbridge we must intervene
right away immediately at once come
he rose abruptly from the couch and
took a step toward the dining-room but
paused in mid-stride his head thrown
back like a hunting dog sniffing the
breeze for quarry almost it seemed to
me the needle-sharp ends of his little
tightly waxed mustache quivered with
excitement like the whiskers of an ir-
ritable and super-alert tom-cat i too
felt a sudden chill of nervous excitement
-almost terror-run through me for
even as de grandin paused there came
from far away seemingly from the
gloomy wooded hill which lay a mile or
more across the cleared pasture-land a
faint but steadily growing sound so low
it could scarcely be dissociated from the
dismal skirling of the wind it was at
first but steadily it mounted and swelled
in tone and volume a long-drawn ulu-
lant howl rising to a shrill crescendo
sinking to a moan then rising once again
in quavering hopeless cry poignant as
the wailing of a lost soul seeking sanctu-
ary from pursuing furies and as the dis-
tant belling bay died once again amid
the whistling chorus of the wind there
came an answering call from the dark-
ened dining-room it started with a chok-
ing rasping moan as though one of the
sitters at the table had strangled and
gasped for breath then as though torn
from tortured flesh by torment too great
to be resisted it rose in answer to the dis-
tant howl ow-o-o-o-o-o-o swelling
with ever-increasing stress then repeated
once again with hopeless mourning
diminuendo ow-o-o-o-o-o-oo
strangely too the half-reluctant half-
exultant cry was so quickly voiced that it
was impossible to place its origin save to
say it emanated from the dining-room
norn dun chat no tr who makes this

business of the monkey de grandin
challenged sharply i will not have it
he burst into the dining-room eyes
ablaze face working with unbridled fury
fools betes dupes you know not what
you do to mock at them is to invite
destruction of-

  he paused fairly choking with savage
anger and as if to punctuate his tirade
the electric current came on again flood-
ing the big house with sudden brilliance
limning the scene in the dining-hall like
a tableau vivant on the stage fleetwood
and eight others sat with hands still
pressed upon the table startled rather
foolish expressions on their faces as they
blinked owlishly in the sudden deluge of
light hildegarde his six-months bride
for whom the house at twelvetrees had
been built lay cheek-down upon the
table her heavy dark-bronze hair un-
bound and cascading across the polished
flemish oak her face pale as carven
ivory her lush red lips slightly parted
displaying twin lines of little milk-white
teeth between them

  good lord our host exclaimed
shes fainted that fool joke was too
much for her he glared angrily around
the circle of startled faces who let out
that god-awful howl he demanded
fiercely

  the little frenchman cast an apprais-
ing look at the unconscious girl and a
quick venomous glance at mazie noyer
see to her friend trowbridge if you
please he ordered curtly with a nod
toward hildegarde mademoiselle this
is your work i trust you are duly proud
of it he added coldly glaring at mazie
again

  i miss noyer returned in a scan-
dalized voice why i never even
dreamed of doing such a thing i was as
surprized as any one when that inhuman
howl started-ugh right in this room
too she shook her well-upholstered

then favored de grandin with a wither-
ing look i think you forget yourself
doctor de grandin she reminded
you owe me an apolo-

  mille pardons mademoiselle he cut
in acidly whatever my debt may be
this is no time for repayment me i
think an evening of ennui would have
been preferable to your so stupid invoca-
tion of forces of which you know noth-
ing however we can but pray that no
great harm is done

  he turned his shoulder squarely on her
and bowed to the company with frigid
courtesy messieurs mesdames he an-
nounced it grows late and we all have
business in the city tomorrow i suggest
we seek our beds while this so tempera-
mental light still holds he turned on
his heel and left the room without a
single backward look at mazie noyer or
any offer of apology for his hasty accu-
sation

am bringing hildegarde to town for con-
xv sultation please see me tomorrow

fleetwood

  i passed the telegram to jules de gran-
din and grinned in spite of myself at the
sober expression on his face as he pe-
rused the terse message why so serious
i asked helping myself to a fresh serving
of griddle cakes and honey that sort
of thing has been going on ever since
adam and eve left the garden to set up
housekeeping norval and hildegarde
are excited of course but its only a bio-
logical function and-

  ah bah he cut in you annoy me
you vex me you harass me my friend
you say it is the coming of a happy
event which brings monsieur and ma-
dame fleetwood to town i hope you are
correct but i fear you are in error would
he telegraph if that were all must he
see you right away at once immediately
about a matter which can not in the

course of nature be either hurried or de-
layed i doubt it indeed i greatly doubt
that it has anything to do with this-he
tapped the telegram with his breakfast
fork-but concerns something much
more sinister yes i have worried much
concerning madame hildegarde since
that accursed night when the senseless
mademoiselle noyer played her monkey

tricks in that darkened house and-

  youre absurd i told him

  i hope so he admitted seriously
we shall eventually see who laughs in
whose face my friend

  in deference to fleetwoods message i
stayed indoors most of the following day
but dinner-time came and went without
further word from him confound it
i grumbled glancing irritably at my
watch i wish theyd come if theyre
coming king lears playing at the acad-
emy tonight and id like to see it if
theyll only hurry ill have time to get
there before the middle of the first act
and-

  eh bien be patient my old one de
grandin counseled unless i am more
mistaken than i think you shall soon see
a tragedy the like of which monsieur
shakespeare never dreamed indeed i

think the curtain is already rising--

he turned toward the consulting-room
door expectantly and as though evoked
by his words norval fleetwood entered

  hildegardes up at the passaic boule-
vard house he answered my query as we
shook hands its such a wretched night
i thought id better leave her home

and- he paused as though the

words somehow stuck in his throat then
and i thought id better see you before
you see her sir

  ah de grandins barely whispered
comment had a ring of triumph in it
and i favored him with a black lode

  fleetwood nodded shortly almost as if
in answer to the frenchman im almost
the wolf of st bonnot



wild with anxiety about her doctor he
told me you remember that fool
seance mazie noyer got up that sunday
night two weeks ago when the lights
went out at twelvetrees it started right
after that

  a-ab de grandin murmured

  what seems to be the trouble i
asked casting another withering glance
toward the little frenchman

  i-i only wish i knew sir hilde-
garde was restless as a child with fever
all that night and dull and listless as a
convalescent next day i had to come to
town and was delayed considerably get-
ting back that night and dinner should
have been over an hour when i returned
but she hadnt eaten and said she had no
appetite that was strange for her shes
always been so well and healthy you
know but-he looked at me widi the
serio-comic expression every man uses in
such circumstances-well you know
how they are sir

  this time it was my turn to register
triumph but i forbore to glance at de
grandin waiting fleetwoods next re-
mark

  it must have been something after
eleven he continued when out across
the cleared land i heard the deep long-
drawn baying of a hound some one in
the neighborhood must have a pack of
the brutes and let em run at night for
id heard em once or twice earlier in the
evening but not so near or loud as this

time doctor trowbridge-

  he paused again swallowed once or
twice convulsively and drumm d nerv-
ously on the edge of the desk with his
finger-tips averting his gaze like a shame-
faced schoolboy about to make a con-
fession

  yes i prompted as the silence
lengthened embarrassingly

  you remember that horrible inhuman
howl some one let out in my dining-

room that sunday night doctor de
grandin accused mazie noyer of it

  i nodded

it wasnt mazie it was hildegarde
nonsense i objected sharply
hildegarde had fainted it couldnt

have been-

  yes it was sir i know it because
the next night when that devilish baying
sounded under our window she began to
roll and toss restlessly in bed as though
suffering a nightmare then-he stopped
again then hurried on as though anxious
to get the statement finished-then she
threw back the bed-clothes rose to her
knees and answered it

  a-a-ah jules de grandin placed his
fingers tip to tip crossed his knees and
regarded the toe of his patent leather
evening shoe as though it were a novel
sight and then monsieur if you
please what next

  fleetwoods voice trembled almost as
if with ungovernable anger that was
only the beginning he shot back i
shook her and she seemed to wake but
for more than an hour she lay there as if
on the borderline of consciousness finger-
ing the bedclothes rolling her head on
the pillow and moaning piteously every
once in a while it must have been
almost morning before she finally went
to sleep once or twice while she lay in
that odd semi-conscious state that in-
fernal howling sounded underneath the
window and each time she shook and

trembled as if-

  of course it frightened her i in-
terrupted soothingly

  no it wasnt like that it was as if
she were all eagerness to get out there
with that devilish hound-fairly trem-
bling to go sir

  i stared at him incredulously but his
next words left me fairly breathless

  next night she went

  what i almost shouted


weird tales

  just that sir the howling started
during dinner next evening and hilde-
garde dropped her knife and fork and
almost went into hysterics i went to the
den and got out a gun to give the beast
a dose of bird-shot but when i opened
the door there was nothing to be seen 
wandered round the house several times
and once i thought i saw it over by the
wood lot-a big white shaggy brute-
but it was so far out of range i didnt
even try a shot

  i woke up a little after midnight with
a queer feeling something was wrong
and when i looked at hildegardes bed
she wasnt there i waited nearly half an
hour then went to look for her while
i was going through the library i heard
that dam dog howling again and when
i went to the window and looked out ill
be hanged if i didnt see her out on the
lawn-and a great white fuzzy-looking
beast was fawning on her and leaping at
her and licking her face yes sir there
she stood in a temperature of thirty de-
grees with nothing but her nightdress on
fondling and playing with that beast as
if it were a pet shed had all her life

  what did you do i asked

  went out after her he answered
simply the ground was pretty well
frozen and hurt my feet and i must have
looked away once or twice as i tried to
pick my way across the lawn though i
tried to keep my eyes on her for when
i reached her the dog was gone and she
was standing there alone her teeth chat-
tering with the cold i called to her and

she looked-at-me- the words

came slowly and there was a choke in
his voice

  i waited a moment then patted his
shoulder gently what was it boy i
asked softly

  she looked at me and snarled youve
seen the way a vicious cur curls back its
lips when you approach it thats the

way my wife looked at me doctor trow-
bridge and down in her throat she
made a sort of savage growling noise
like a police dog when hes ready to
spring it frightened me almost senseless
for a moment but i kept on and she
seemed normal enough when i reached
her

   my dear what are you doing out
here i asked but she just looked at me
in a dazed half-frightened sort of way
and made no answer i picked her up
and carried her into the house and put
her to bed she went to sleep immediate-
ly next morning she remembered noth-
ing and i didnt press matters you may
be sure i didnt hear the dog again that
night

  later de grandin asked softly

  yes sir next night and the next
and every night since then its howled
around the house like a banshee but
though my wife has tossed in her sleep
and risen to answer it once or twice she
hasnt gone out again-not to my knowl-
edge at any rate

  now norval i soothed all this is
very distressing but i dont think theres
anything to be really alarmed about the
other night when hildegarde fainted and
i was tending her i made a discovery-
has she told you

 you mean-

  just so boy perhaps shes not aware
of it herself yet but you have a right
to expea some one will be occupying a
crib at twelvetrees before next june
im violating no confidences when i tell
you me re than one patient ive had in
similar conditions has been as erratic in
behavior as hildegarde one lady could
not abide the smell of fish or even their
sight merely seeing a bowl of goldfish
would make her violently sick another
had an inordinate craving for dried
herring the saltier and smellier the better
and in several cases conditions were so
the wolf of st bonnot



bad they simulated real insanity yet all
came out right in the end bore normal
healthy children and became normal
healthy women again zoophilia-an ab-
normal love of animals-isnt as rare in
such circumstances as you might suppose
im sure hildegarde will be all right
son

  the young husband beamed on me
and to my surprize de grandin concurred
in my opinion it is so he assured
norval i too have seen strange things
at times like this no woman is account-
able for anything however strange it be
which she may do while she bears another
life beneath her heart assuredly friend
trowbridge is correct at present you
have little to fear but both of us will
assist you in every manner possible you
have but to call on us and i entreat you
do so the moment anything untoward
appears

hat was decent of you backing me
up that way old chap i thanked
him as the door closed on fleetwood i
was in a perfect ague for fear youd
spring some of that occult hocus-pocus of
yours and scare the poor lad so wed have
two of em to treat instead of one

  he regarded me solemnly tapping the
corner of my desk with the nail of a well-
manicured forefinger for emphasis i
played the unutterable hypocrite he
answered no word of what i said did
i believe for i am more than sure a very
evil thing has been let into the world and
that much tears-blood too perhaps-
must be shed before we drive it to its
own appointed place again all that you
said concerning the manic-depressive in-
sanity sometimes present in such condi-
tions was true my friend but the history
of this case differentiates it from those
which you recalled normal young
women may develop a morbid love for
animals-i have seen them derive the

keenest pleasure from running their fin-
gers over the smooth back of a pussy-cat
or the rugged coat of a sheep-dog--but
they do not respond to wandering beasts
howling in kind no they do not run
barefoot into the winter night to fondle
wandering brutes they do not greet their
husbands with dog-snarls these things
are different my friend but as yet i fear
we have seen but the prologue to the play
still-he shrugged his shoulders-
trouble will come soon enough-too
soon parbleu-let the poor young fleet-
wood be spared as long as possible
for-

  the shrilling of the office telephone
cut through his words

  doctor trowbridge the tortured
voice across the wire asked tremulously
this is norval-norval fleetwood i
just got home hildegardes gone nancy
the colored maid tells me a dog began
howling under the windows almost as
soon as i left the house and hildegarde
seemed to go absolutely wild-hysterical
-laughing and crying and shouting
some sort of answer at the beast then
she let out an answering bay and rushed
out into the yard shes not been back
and nancy was frightened almost white
shes no idea which way hildegarde
went what shall i do

  wait a moment i bade then re-
tailed his statement to de grandin

  mordieu so soon i had not thought
it the frenchman cried bid him wait
for us mon vieux we come to him at
once right away immediately

rrilens my friend they fish in
m troubled waters who dabble in
spiritism he remarked as we hastened
toward fleetwoods town house in passa-
ic boulevard have i not said it before
but certainly

  bosh i answered testily what has
spiritism to do with hildegardes disap-


weird tales

pearance i suppose youre referring to
the seance at twelvetrees when some
smart alec answered that hounds bay in
the dining-room that night it gave the
poor girl a dreadful shock that was all
that was needed to set her unbalanced
nervous system running wild-she prob-
ably wasnt aware of her condition and
hadnt taken any care of herself and re-
current depressive insanity has resulted
oh he asked sarcastically and
since when has depressive insanity or any
recognized state of aberration connected
with birth made the patient sit up in bed

and howl like a dog or-

  of course i broke in triumphantly
norval gave us a typical symptom when
he said she snarled at him you know as
well as i that aversion for the husband
is one of the commonest incidents of this
form of derangement shes fought it as
hard as she could poor child but its
overmastered her now shes run away
we may have to keep norval out of her

sight until-

  what of the dog-as we persist in
calling it-which follows her and whose
howls she answers in kind he insisted
do you find it convenient to ignore him
or had he slipped from your memory
rats i scoffed the countrys full

of night-prowling dogs and-

  and the city also he broke in
dogs which howl beneath ladies win-
dows the moment their husbands backs
are turned

  see here i turned on him just
what are you driving at anyway de
grandin what has the dog to do with
the case

   if it were a dog little or nothing he
replied slowly we might dismiss it as
a case of zoophilia as you suggested to

the young fleetwood but-

  but what i demanded out with
it whats your idea

  very well he nodded solemnly
here is my opinion the dog as we
have called it is no dog at all but a wolf
or rather a loup-garou what you call a
werewolf who has availed himself of the
opportunity given him by mademoiselle
noyers so detestable seance to return

and-

  i laughed aloud in spite of myself
you are fantastic i told him

  let us hope so he answered grimly
jules de grandin fancies himself most
excellently but in this case nothing
would please him more than to see him-
self proved a superstitious booby yes

xtas suh the colored maid replied
x to our hurried questions mi
hildegarde done scairt me outa seven
years growth amost mistu norval

    w t-

  lawdy no suh ah dont speak no
language ceptin english

  think mademoiselle much a very
great much depends on it can not you
say what the words sounded like even
though they conveyed no meaning to
you

  the woman rolled her eyes upward
and inhaled deeply compressing her lips
and puffing out her cheeks as though she
would force memory by the very pressure
of pent-up breath at length

  hit sounded like she said jere raven
suh she replied expelling the breath
from her packed lungs with an explosive
gasp not perzackly raven suh but
sumpin like hit dats de neares ah can
come to hit yuh see ah wuz so scairt
ah wuznt takin no proper notice ob

inquiringly to the maid

yas suh dats jes what she said like

he cast a swift triumphant glance at
me what have you now to say my
old one he demanded

  nothing only-

  tres bon say the nothing now the
only will wait till later let us first seek
madame hildegarde

  a hurry call was put in to police head-
quarters and for upward of three hours
we patrolled the cold deserted streets
but neither sight nor information of
hildegarde fleetwood could we obtain
at last cold exhausted and discouraged
we turned back dreading norvals tragic
eyes when we reported failure

  beside the front portico of the house


weird tales

we paused a moment while i spread my
lap-robe over the engine-hood for i had
not yet put on my winter radiator-front
as i turned toward the steps a feeble
whimpering moan from the copse of
dwarf spruce beside the porch attracted
my attention a moment later we had
parted the evergreens and de grandin
flashed the light of his pocket lamp into
the shadow under them

  hildegarde fleetwood crouched hud-
dled in a heap in an angle of the wall
the flimsy black-chiffon pajama negligee
she wore torn to tatters one black-satin
mule hanging to her delicate unstock-
inged foot by its heel-strap the other
only heaven knew where beneath the
rents in her diaphanous costume cancelli
of deep angry scratches showed her feet
were bruised and bleeding and stained
with red-day mud above the ankles
other patches of earth-soil were on her
knees and hands and arms and the nails
of every carefully-cared-for finger were
grimy with fresh earth and broken to the
quick earth-stains were on her face and
clotted in her hair too as though she
might have wiped her countenance and
put back the flowing veil of her long
bronze hair with clayey hands while she
performed some arduous task

  good lord i cried stooping to
gather the all but frozen girl in my arms
and bear her up the steps

  the little frenchman aided me as best
he could lighting my way with his
pocket torch leaping before me to fling
wide the storm- and vestibule-doors at
last he murmured softly at last my
friend you do assume the proper attitude
and call upon the lord we shall have
much need of his aid before we finish-
and of the aid of jules de grandin like-
wise

  we hurried restorative treatment as
much as possible a sponge bath of

chilled water followed by a rubdown
with alcohol and gentle massage with dry
flannel cloths restored her circulation
and a cup of hot beef tea administered in
spoonful doses brought some semblance
of color to her pallid cheeks we watched
for any symptoms of congestion but were
at last satisfied that hildegarde had
suffered nothing worse than shock and
so we gave a bromide sedative and left
impressing norval with the importance
of calling us immediately if any change in
her condition came

  i shook my head despondently as we
drove toward my house this case ap-
pears more serious than id thought at
first i finally admitted

 much de grandin nodded em-
phatically very much my friend very
damn much indeed yes certainly

 jyjtordieu my worst fears are all
jvjl confirmed it is devilish in-
fernal no less read my friend read
and weep then say whose diagnosis was
wrong who talked the words of the fool
concerning poor bedeviled madame
hildegarde if you please jules de
grandin cried as he perused the morning
journal next day at breakfast he thrust
the paper at me with hands which trem-
bled with excitement indicating the item
in the upper right-hand angle of the first
page

ghouls open girls grave

remove body from casket steal lily from
dead hands and leave remains uncovered

woman in black sought

called at cemetery earlier in night and
frightened sexton

  ghouls working in the silence of st roses r
c cemetery on the andover rd two miles north
of harrisonville it became known early today
dug up from a freshly made grave the body of
miss monica doyle  daughter of patrick doyle
 willow ave harrisonville who died last
wednesday and was buried yesterday morning

  from the slender hands crossed on the dead
the wolf of st bonnot



giil s breast clasping a rosary and the stem of a
white lily the ghouls stole the flower and carried
it away

  the corpse with its shroud and burial clothing
disordered and torn was thrown back face down
in the casket the lid replaced and the grave left
open

  the crime with its weird settings and the added
mystery of the visit to the cemetery earlier in the
night of a strange black-robed woman accompa-
nied by a monstrous white dog who frightened
the sexton andrew fischer was disclosed early
this morning when ronald flander  and jacob
rupert  grave-diggers going to prepare a grave
for an early morning funeral noticed the fresh
earth heaped up by the doyle girls violated grave
and going nearer discovered the unearthed casket
and corpse

  desecration of miss doyles grave forms one of
the most remarkable crimes in the annals of new
jersey since the murder of sarah humphreys 
years ago the scene of which was the golf links
of the sedgemoar country club which is slightly
more than two miles distant from the cemetery and
also abuts on the andover rd

  one theory advanced is that a person possessed
of religious fanaticism swayed by the superstition
that a lily buried with a body will thrive on the
corpse committed the deed to remove the flower

  the police are now running down scores of
clues in an effort to solve the mystery and an ar-
rest is promised within  hours

  i finished the grisly account then
stared in wide-eyed horror at de grandin
this is terrible-devilish-as you say
i admitted who-

  ah bah who asks what overset the
cream-jug when the cat emerges from the
salle a manger with whitened whiskers
he shot back come let us go there is
no time to lose

  go where

   to the cemetery of st rose of course
come quick haste my friend the
police in pursuit of the scores of clues so
glibly talked of by our journalistic friend
may have already obliterated all that
which would be useful to us nous
perrons

  dye think theyll really make an
arrest

  god forbid he answered piously
come for heavens love hurry mon
vieux i beseech you

a small egg-shaped stove crammed
with mixed soft coal and coke and
glowing dully red heated the little
cement-block office of st roses cemetery
to mid-august temperature and made
mock of the december wind whistling
about the angles of the house and wrest-
ling with the bare-limbed trees which
dotted the dismal little burial park mr
fischer a round-faced blue-eyed man in
early middle age who looked as though
he would have been more at home stand-
ing in white jacket behind a delicatessen
counter nodded us casual greeting from
behind the copy of the morgen zeitung
he was perusing with interest from the
newspapers he inquired cant tell
you nothin moren you already know
cant you fellers leave me have no peace
im busy this mornin an-

  so much is obvious de grandin cut
in with a quick smile which took the edge
from his irony but we will take but a
moment of your time meanwhile as
your minutes are precious perhaps you
would accept a small compensation for a
little information there was a flash of
green and a banknote changed hands
with the rapidity of a prestidigitators
card disappearing mr fischers slightly
bored manner gave way to one of urbane
alertness sure what can i do for you
gents he wanted to know

  the little frenchman produced his cig-
arette case proffered it to fischer and
selected a smoke for himself with in-
finite care first of all he replied we
desire to know of the mysterious lady in
black whose appearance has been com-
mented on you can tell us of her per-
haps

  sure can the other volunteered it

weird tales

locked the small gate and gotten ready to
hit th hay when i heard it flappin an
bangin in th wind it was pretty bad
last night you know i went out to see
what th matter was an darned if th
lock hadnt broken it was kind o old an
rusty anyhow but it oughtnt to have
broken in an ordinary wind-storm i
tinkered with it awhile but couldnt do
nothin with it so i went to look for a
piece o rope or wire or somethin to tie
it shut

  theres a tool shed over th other end
o th lot-other side o th consecrated
ground where suicides an unbaptized chil-
dren an th like o that is buried right
by th pauper section-an i thought most
likely id find what i was lookin for
there th men dumps everythin they
dont happen to be usin in it well sir
just as i was cuttin across to that shed
who should jump up out o nowhere but
a great long tall woman with th biggest
an ugliest brute of a dog you ever seen
standing right alongside her gott in
himmel - he dropped his idiomatic
american for the language of his father-
land-i was frightened

  the frenchman thoughtfully flicked a
half-inch of ash on the worn linoleum
rug covering the rooms cement floor
and can you describe her he asked
slowly shooting me a quick glance then
regarding the curling smoke from his
cigarette with careful scrutiny

  mr fischer considered a moment i
aint sure he replied it was so sud-
den th way she bobbed up from no-
where an i dont mind admittin i was
more anxious to run than stand there an
look at her she was pretty tall half a
head taller than th average woman id
say at a guess an-well i suppose you
could call her pretty too kind o thin
an straight with great long hair all
blowin round her face an shoulders

dressed in some sort o blade robe with
no sleeves an-an kind o-i dont
know just how to say it sir sort o devil-
-lookin you might say

  devilish how

   well she had a kind o smile on her
face like she was pleased to meet me
there but more pleased i was alone-if
you get me more of a snarl than a smile
youd call it kind o pleased an savage-
lookin at th same time

  an that dog mein gott he was
big as a calf an with a long pointed
snout an great red mouth hangin open
an long narrow eyes like a chinamans
an they was flashin in th dark like a
cats

  did they move to attack you

  no sir i cant say they did just
stood there th dog with one foot raised
like he was ready to jump on me an th
woman standin beside him with her hair
all blowin about her an one hand on
th beasts back an th both of em
growled at me so help me th beast
growled first an th woman did th same

  i didnt waste no time gettin away
from there i can tell you

  you have no idea from whence they
came

  none whatever

  nor where they went thereafter
not me i got back here as fast as i
could an locked th door an moved th
desk against it

  um and may one see the grave of
the so unfortunate mademoiselle doyle
racial antipathy flared in fischers eyes
as de grandin used the french title but
memory of recent largess was more potent
than inherited hatred sure he agreed
with markedly lessened cordiality and
slipped a stained sheepskin reefer over
his shoulders come on

  casket and earth had been replaced in
the violated sepulcher but the raw red
the wolf of st bonnot



earth showed like a bleeding wound
about the place where monica doyle lay
in everlasting slumber

  the little frenchman observed sur-
roundings carefully sank to his knees to
take a closer view of the trampled mud
about the refilled grave then rose with a
nod and now if you will be so good
as to show us where you encountered the
so strange visitants last night we shall no
longer trouble you he told the sexton

the cemetery was a small one and
obviously catered to a far from
wealthy clientele few graves were
properly mounded and more briars than
flowers evidently grew there in the sum-
mer now in bleak december it held an
air of desolation which depressed me like
a strain of melancholy music bare and
desolate as the better portions of the park
were however the section set aside for
indigents and those who died without
the pale was infinitely worse no turf
save weed crab-grass hid the bare red
clay from view the graves were fallen in
and those which sported markers were
more pathetic than those unmarked for
mere white-painted boards or stones so
crudely carved that any beggar might
scorn to own them were all the monu-
ments midway between the garden-
plots of hopelessness the superintendent
paused heres where it was he an-
nounced curtly eyeing de grandin with
no friendly glance make it snappy
im busy-cant stand here in th cold all
day

  once more de grandin surveyed the
terrain sinking to his knees he looked
minutely at the red and sticky mud where
fischer had been frightened then rose
and with a queer abbreviated stride
moved toward the lines of leafless lom-
bardy poplars which served as wind-break
by the rear fence of the graveyard

  hey i cant wait no longer the
superintendent warned got a lot o
things to do see me in my office if you
want to ask me anything else with
which announcement he turned upon his
heel and left us

  sale caboche de grandin muttered
casting a level stare of cold hatred at the
sextons retreating back no matter you
have served your turn your absence is the
best gift you can give us quick friend
trowbridge stand before me if you
please

  from his waistcoat pocket he produced
his cigarette lighter and set it flaring and
from the pocket of his topcoat he took a
length of paraffin candle i thought we
might have need of this he explained as
he proceeded to melt the grease and pour
it carefully into the imprint of a tiny
slender shoe which showed in the wet
clay

  whatever are you doing i asked
standing before him to shield him from
the wind and the glance of any curious
passers-by at once

  parbleu i do construct a brick house
in which to store your senseless ques-
tions he answered with a grin tamping
the hot paraffin daintily into the depres-
sion then waiting anxiously for it to
harden

  as soon as the impression had been
made he wrapped it carefully in two
thick sheets of paper then with his find
held tenderly as a day-old infant pro-
ceeded methodically to pace across the
graveyard carefully obliterating every
feminine footprint he could find i
doubt the police have taken casts of
these he told me but if the good cos-
tello comes into the case he may show
more intelligence than most he has asso-
ciated much with me you will recall

  when all had been accomplished to his
satisfaction he steered me toward the


weird tales

entrance merci beaucoup monsieur
v allemand-transplante he called ironi-
cally as he lifted his green-felt hat and
passed from the cemetery

  dam frog returned superintendent
fischer with which exchange of ameni-
ties we parted company

  slowly friend trowbridge drive
slowly if you please he ordered as we
left the graveyard and from his vantage-
point beside me he peered from left to
right at the scrub vegetation bordering
the road once or twice at his request i
stopped while he alighted and made
forays into the undergrowth finally
when we had consumed the better part of
an hour traversing a quarter-mile he re-
turned from an investigative trip with a
smile of satisfaction triomphe he
announced holding his find up for my
inspection it was a dainty french-heeled
black-satin bedroom mule the strap de-
signed to hold it to its wearers heel torn
loose from its stitchings at one end and
the whole smeared with sticky red-day
mud

  and now if you will be so good as
to put me down i shall be very grateful
he informed me as we reached the cen-
tral part of town

something like an hour later he
entered my consulting-room eyes
shining with elation a smile of satisfac-
tion hovering beneath the needle ends of
his diminutive tightly waxed blond
mustache doubting thomases must
have their proof he told me cest
pourquoi i bring you yours regardez

  this-he carefully unwrapped a
parcel and laid its contents on the desk-
is the impression of the so dainty foot-
print which i did take at the cemetery
this-from his overcoat pocket he
fished the satin mule he had salvaged
from the roadside-is what we found

near by the cemetery upon our homeward
trip and this-from another pocket he
produced the first satin slippers mate-
is madame hildegardes shoe which she
wore last night when we did find her all
unconscious outside her house i did buy
it from the femme de chambre whom we
interviewed last night but one little hour
ago yes now attend me

  you will observe the shoes are iden-
tical save one is broken the other whole
you will notice both are stained with
identical red mud-the mud of st roses
cemetery now you will notice each fits
the impression i took among the graves
enfin they are each others mates the
shoes of madame hildegarde which she
wore last night-into the cemetery when
she and that wolf-thing which com-
panioned her dug up the corpse of ma-
demoiselle doyle she was the so mys-
terious woman in black my friend and
-par pitie de dieu-her companion
was the revenant spirit of gilles gamier
the werewolf of st bonnot which slipped
through the door mademoiselle noyer let
open at her never-to-be-enough-repro-
bated seance that sunday night at twelve-
trees

  laugh snicker grin like a dog i
tell you it is so pliit a dieu it were
otherwise

  im not laughing i answered sober-
ly i was inclined to think you were at
your favorite game of phantom-fighting
at first but the developments in this case
have been so strange and dreadful im
willing to let you take full charge weve
seen some strange terrible things to-
gether de grandin and im not inclined

to scoff now but tell me-

  everything i can he cut in impetu-
ously holding out his hands what is
it you would know

  if hildegardes animal companion
really were a werewolf why did they un-
the wolf of st bonnot

i

earth the body of the doyle girl ive
always heard werewolves attacked the
living

  and also the dead he replied
there are different grades among them
some kill dogs and sheep but fight man-
kind only when attacked some are like
hyenas and prey upon the dead others-
the worst-lust after human flesh espe-
cially human blood and quest and kill
women children even men when weaker
game is not available in this case this
vile garnier perchance chose the help-
less dead for victim for their raid
because-

  their raid i echoed in horror
their--

  alas yes it is too true poor un-
fortunate madame hildegarde has be-
come even as her conqueror and master
gilles garnier she too is loup-garou
she too is of that multitudinous herd
not yet made fast in hell recall how she
cried out no no i will not come last
night then turning to her maid said
it is no use he has me also how she
charged the femme de chambre with a
farewell message of love for her husband
ere she ran howling from the house to
join her ghostly master remember too
how her nails were all mud-stained and
broken when we found her assuredly
she had been digging in the grave beside
that other one yes

  then why didnt they- i began

but the question stuck in my throat

why didnt they-eat- i stopped

nauseated

  because of what the dead girls dead
hands clasped he answered the lily
they could ravish away and tear to bits-
i found shreds of it embedded in the
mud beside the grave though the police
and others overlooked it-but the blessed
rosary and the body assoiled with prayer
and incense and holy water-ha pardieu

    

those defied them and they could do no
more than vent their futile baffled rage
upon the corpse and offer it gross insult
and cast it back into its coffin no

  he took a quick half-turn across the
room retraced his steps snatched a cig-
arette from his case and set it aglow with
savage energy attend me he ordered
seating himself on the corner of the desk
and fixing me with a level unwinking
stare

  you are familiar with the so-called
new psychology of freud and jung at
least you have a working knowledge of it
very well then consider you know
there is no such thing as true forgetful-
ness every gross desire-every hatred
every passion every lust the conscious
waking mind experiences is indexed and
pigeon-holed in the recesses of the sub-
liminal mind those whose conscious
recollection is free from every vestige of
envy malice hatred or lust may go to a
seance and there liberate all the repressed
-the forgotten-evil desires they have
had since early childhood without being
in anywise aware of it we know from
our study of psychology that fixed im-
mutable laws govern mental processes
there is by example the law of similar-
ity which evokes the association of ideas
there is the law of integration which
splits mental images into integral frag-
ments and the law of re-integration
which enables the subconscious mind to
rearrange these split images into one com-
pleted picture of a past event or scene as
one fits together the pieces of a jig-saw
puzzle

  very good ten or a dozen people
seat themselves in silence around a table
every condition for light hypnosis is pres-
ent-lack of external attractions of the
attention darkness a common focusing
of thought upon a single objective that
of attracting spirits in such conditions


weird tales

the sitters may be said to pool their con-
sciousness-the normal inhibitions of the
conscious mind are relieved from duty
the sentry sleeps and the fortress gates
are open conditions for invasion are
ideal

  eh bien my friend do not think the
enemy is slow to take advantage of his
opportunity by no means if there be
even one person at the seance whose sub-
consciousness locks up any unholy desires
-and who has been entirely free from
thought-dominance by one of the seven
deadly sins throughout his life-the
powers of evil have a ready-made ally
within the gates that like attracts like
is a dominant law of nature and the law
of similarity is one of the rules of psy-
chology the gateway of the psyche is
thrown open to whoever may enter in

  now who would be the easiest one
attacked madame hildegarde is not
well her blood-stream her whole sys-
tem must care for two instead of one
thereby lessening her powers of resist-
ance

  very good a sign consider what
occurred a rapping announces a man-
spirit seeking communication his name
is asked he answers eh bien i shall
say he answers he gives his real name
for there is little fear that any one pres-
ent will recognize him gilles garnier
who lived at st bonnot in the reign of
king charles he brazenly announces
himself do you know him perhaps
he paused a moment lifting his brows
interrogatively

  why no i never heard of him i
answered

  bien neither had any one there
present his name his nationality his
epoch all sounded romantic to a circle
of fat-headed fools is it not so yes
decidedly

  ha but jules de grandin knew him
as you have studied the history of medi-
cine and anesthesia and of the recurrent
plagues which have scourged the world
so i have studied the history of those
other plagues which destroyed the body
or the soul sometimes both together lis-
ten i will tell you of gilles garnier

  in  when charles ix occupied
the throne of france there dwelt at st
bonnot near the town of dole a fellow
named gilles gamier he was an ill-
favored churl and those who knew him
best knew little good of him he dwelt
alone so that the country folk called him
the hermit but the title carried with it
no attribute of sanctity quite otherwise

  midsummer came that fateful year
and with it numerous complaints to the
parliament of dole farmers living near
the city brought in accounts of sheep
stolen from the fold at dead of night of
dogs killed as they watched the flocks of
little children found dead and horribly
mangled along the roadside and beneath
the hedges three wandering minstrels
-all veterans of the wars and stout
swordsmen-were set upon as they rode
through the wood of st bonnot at night
and one of them was all but killed
though they resisted fiercely the coun-
tryside was terrorized and even men-at-
arms preferred to stay at home by night
for a loup-garou or werewolf the like of
which had never before been known had
claimed the land for his own from sunset
until dawn

  on the evening of november 
 when the fields were all but nude 
of vegetation and the last leaves re-
luctantly parting company with the trees
three laborers were hurrying to their
homes at chastenoy by a woodland short-
cut when they heard the screams of a
little girl issuing from a dense tangle of
vines and undergrowth and with the
the wolf of st bonnot



childs cries mingled the baying of a
wolf

  swinging their billhooks they cut
themselves a pathway through the wild-
wood and hastened toward the sounds
in a little clearing they beheld this ter-
rifying sight backed against a tree de-
fending herself as best she might with
her shepherds crook was a little maid of
ten already bleeding from a score of
wounds while before her crouched a
monstrous creature which never ceased its
devilish baying as it attacked her tooth
and nail

  as the peasants ran forward the thing
fled off into the forest on all fours dis-
appearing instantly in the darkness the
men would have followed but the faint-
ing sorely wounded child demanded
their attention

  he paused to light another cigarette
then in court he asked when there
is contrariety of testimony supposing all
witnesses had equal opportunity of
observation which version would be
believed

  why that supported by the greatest
number of witnesses i suppose i
answered

  very good that seems logical does
it not consider then next day when
these peasants laid their story before the
authorities one swore the childs assail-
ant had a mans body though it was
covered with hair and ran on all fours
the other two declared as positively it had
the body of a gaunt light-gray wolf but
the eyes of a man

  you will recall perhaps the amiable
monsieur fischer declared this morning
that the brute which frightened him last
night had eyes like a chinaman very
well

  november   a little boy of
eight disappeared the child had last
been seen within a crossbows range of

the city gates yet he had vanished as com-
pletely as though the earth had swallowed
him morbleu swallowed he had been
but not by the earth no

  circumstantial evidence involved this
so unsaintly hermit gilles garnier a
sergent de ville and six arquebusiers went
forth to arrest him and took him into
custody shortly after noon on november
 his trial followed quickly

  it is a curious circumstance often
commented on that those involved in
such crimes seldom needed to be put to
the question but readily confessed when
finally their sin had found them out it
was usually so in witchcraft trials it was
so in this garnier readily admitted mak-
ing a compact with the devil whereby he
was given the power of transforming him-
self into a wolf at will providing he
willed it between darkness and cock-crow

  witnesses in flocks appeared against
him the trouveurs who had been at-
tacked appeared and so did many a
farmer whose sheepfold had been raided
but the little maid the peasants saved
near chastenoy was strongest in her testi-
mony for she identified the prisoner by
his eyes furthermore when an impres-
sion of his teeth was taken it matched
precisely with the tooth-marks in her
half-healed scars the werewolf keeps
his human teeth as well as eyes while
metamorphosized it seems

  gamier admitted the attack and
added tales of many others to it on the
last day of michaelmas near the wood of
la serre while in his wolf-form he had
attacked with teeth and claws a little girl
of ten or twelve dragged her into a
thicket and gnawed the flesh from her
arms and legs there were those who
corroborated his story in part by telling
of the finding of the little mutilated
corpse

  on the fourteenth day after all


weird tales

saints also in the form of a wolf he had
killed and eaten a little boy on friday
before the feast of st bartholomew he
had seized and killed a lad of twelve
near the village of perrouze and would
have eaten him but for the appearance of
some peasants these men were found
and corroborated the prisoners story
and again conflict of testimony appeared
some swore he was in human form
though fur-covered and going on all
fours the others deposed he had a true
wolfs form all were agreed he howled
and growled like any natural beast

  by the way he broke off can you
recall the date mademoiselle noyer con-
voked her seance at twelvetrees

  why-er-i made a hasty mental
calculation-yes of course it was the
twenty-sixth of november

  precisementhe nodded gravely
and it was upon november  
that gilles garnier forever after to be
known as the werewolf of st bonnot
having duly been found guilty was
dragged for half a mile over a rough
road by ropes attached to his ankles
bound to a stake and given to the flames

  coinci- i began doubtfully but

  coinci-devil he snapped coin-
cidences like that do not occur my friend
for almost four and a half centuries this
mans wicked earth bound soul had
hovered in the air invisible but very
potent upon the anniversary of his exe-
cution his memory is strongest for
jealousy of life and rage and eagerness
to return and raven once again are great-
est then he beats against the portal of
our world like the wolf against the doors
of les trois petit cochons in the nursery-
story and where he finds a door weak
enough-he breaks through yes in-
dubitably it is so

   but see here i countered its all
very well to say hes seized hildegardes

brain-i shant dispute it with you-but
how is he able to manifest himself
physically it might have been a vision
or a ghost or specter or whatever you
wish to call it that fischer saw in the
cemetery or that norval fleetwood saw
sporting with his wife on the lawn at
twelvetrees but it was no unsubstantial
wraith which dug the little doyle girl
from her grave and tossed her poor
desecrated body back into its casket it
wont do to say hildegarde did it even
granting she had the supernatural
strength of the insane the task would
have been physically impossible for her to
perform unaided

  incomparable trowbridge he cried
delightedly always when it looks
darkest you do show me a light in the
blackness to you i and madame hilde-
garde owe our salvation no less

  i stared at him open-mouthed what

in the world- i began but he cut me

short with a delighted gesture

  attend me carefully he ordered
you have resolved a most damnably
complex problem into a most simple
solution yes you know-or at least i
so inform you-that one of the common
phenomena associated with spiritistic
seances is the production of light numer-
ous mediums have the power of attract-
ing or emitting light and even in small
amateur circles where there is in all truth
little enough light in the psychic sense
such elemental phenomena are produced
very good what is this light some of
it may be true spirit-phenomena but
mostly it is nothing but human mental
energy manifested as light waves and
given off by the concerted thought of the
circle of sitters at the seance but at times
this essence given off is something more
substantial than the mere emission of
vibrations capable of being recognized as

come with us into the nice warm fire

d

e next town am como sah
said the porter lugubriously
he said it in much the same tone
that he might have used in announcing
that my coffin awaited

  i swore under my breath impatiently
this confounded mystery was getting on
my nerves first the ticket agent at ral-
ston

  como he had said blankly you
want a ticket for como the inference
plainly was that no human being in his
right mind could ever wish to go to como
oh-uh-ticket for como yessir

  and then the conductor the way he
had stared at my ticket and at me and
finally asked as if doubting the evidence
of his eyes youre going to como are
you

  for heavens sake i answered why
shouldnt i be going there

  he had looked at me oddly and shook
his head without answering

  and then at the junction where the train
had changed crews the new conductor had
repeated the performance

  been there since the fire he asked
when he was finally assured of my desti-
nation

  i shook my head i remembered read-
ing in the papers that a month or so be-
fore the sugar factory at como had
burned under queer circumstances and
the death list had been appalling it had
taken half the town with it and i thought
the mystery was explained when half a
town of two hundred population bums
the remnant is scarcely visible to the
naked eye and certainly could hold little
attraction for the visitor

  you know there aint any-aint many

                                    


weird tales

people there now the conductor per-
sisted

   i hate making explanations but he was
plainly awaiting one

  im visiting friends on a ranch near
there

   oh thats different his voice indi-
cated positive relief theyll be waiting
to meet you i suppose

  why no they wont its a surprize
visit ill stop in the village over night
and hire someone to drive me out next
morning

  stop there over night the con-
ductor spoke so sharply that  jumped
say if theres no one to meet you-say
its only ten miles into san benito why
dont you ride on down there and catch
number one back in the morning then
youll get there in daylight

  im not scared of the dark i said
with what i hoped was withering sarcasm
please have the porter make up my berth
ill knock off a little sleep before we get
there

  the conductor opened his mouth two
or three times but finally went his way
without speaking he was back in a few
minutes with the porter to whom he spoke
heavily

  take good care of this gentleman
sam hes going to como

  fo de lawds sake the negros
eyes and mouth both popped wide

  i am i said irritably and please
make up my berth

  the conductor passed on down the
aisle and the porter after a moment of
goggle-eyed amazement began to prepare
the berth

  youll be sure and wake me in time
i added

  yessuh yessuh the negro spoke ab-
stractedly then turning to face me boss
does yo know yoll git in there at one
oclock in the monin

  what about it i asked

  everbody done moved away from
there boss scusin one old geezer whatd
make good food fo the squirrels

  whats wrong with him

  sorta weak in the haid an then
theres-theres-say boss you been there
since the fire

  no

  funny things goin on there boss-
funny things lots o men died in that
fire an they do say as how it was set

   an incendiary fire yes i read of it
and i suppose the ghosts of the burned
come back for vengeance

  all right all right boss laugh as
much as yo want to but shes a mighty
queer place fo to spend a night in

   i turned away impatiently and as soon
as the blankets were spread turned in i
was half tempted to ride on into san
benito as the conductor had suggested
but after all i had said that might be
construed into a confession that i was
afraid of the dark so i remained silent
and presently dropped asleep

  de next town am como sah the
porter had said and i sat up sleepily and
began drawing on my clothes

   listen boss be a lot safer if yo was
to ride on to san benito with us

   i had been thinking the same thing my-
self but this only stiffened my determina-
tion to leave the train there if i died for
it but of late ive been valuing my life
more highly

ihad scarcely finished dressing when
the train began to slow down and i
hurried out to the vestibule the porter
dropped the steps his eyes rolling uneasily
over his shoulder i was scarcely on the
ground when he hurled the steps back into
the car and followed them so fast that his
white coat fairly blurred in the darkness

  de lawd take keer o yo boss he
said as the train chugged out it gathered
speed so rapidly it almost seemed the en-
burnt things



gineer was anxious to leave como behind
-far behind

  nice cheerful cuss i murmured as
i picked up my suitcase and stared doubt-
fully around me

  it had been more than a year since i
had been in the village and the fire had
changed the face of things vastly the
gutted factory still dominated the town
however as of yore its broken fire-
blackened walls still towered jaggedly out
there across the tracks

   the depot was a mere heap of ashes as
were all the near-by houses but up where
main street had been some brick buildings
had partly withstood the flames appar-
ently they had also acted as a fire-stop for
other houses beyond there seemed to be
untouched i wondered why people should
abandon perfectly good homes in that
fashion

  i picked up my suitcase and set out
there were no lights showing but know-
ing that the old man at least still lived in
the village it shouldnt take long to locate
him and after all jims ranch was only
six or eight miles away if walk i must

  there was something horribly depress-
ing about the deserted street-as if i were
walking in a village of the dead i found
myself thinking of the entire families who
had perished in the fire-of the two score
men trapped in the factory and inciner-
ated

   it was no sort of thing to ponder on at
one oclock in the morning-even though
the fresh clean smell of western prairies
swept in out of the darkness for it had
been raining that day and heavier and
nearer at hand was the smell of wet ashes
and dead embers

   i gained the main street and stood look-
ing helplessly about i had no idea in
which house the old man might live and
it looked as if i might shift for myself in
one of the unburned buildings

  good evening said a voice pleas-
antly

  i had not heard the man approach i
must have broken all records for a stand-
ing high jump he stood close behind me
dressed in the greasy clothes of a factory
laborer with a cap pulled far down over
his face

  you startled me i said with a laugh
i was beginning to think i was the only
person in the village

  old john barrys still here said the
stranger youll find him over yonder
he never comes over here where the fire
was

   id like to find him i admitted ill
have to stay in town over night until i
can get transportation out to jim don-
nellys ranch

  he sleeps all day and prowls around
all night so youll find him all right-
over yonder

  i thanked him and turned away when
he took two quick steps forward and
rubbed both hands violently along my
overcoat then he vanished among the
ruins so quickly it seemed as if he had
vaporized into air

  perhaps he was die lunatic the porter
had described i thought as i crossed the
street certainly he had been dabbling
among the wet ashes for he smelt abomi-
nably of burning and some of the smell
had transferred itself to my coat

finding old barry proved no difficult
task i had gone scarcely a block be-
yond main street when i saw him com-
ing toward me

  he was no inspiring sight an old
old man with scraggly grizzled hair a
mouth that held only the stumps of teeth
a face netted with a thousand wrinkles
no dignity of age was here rather a
maniacal glitter in the sunken eyes a luna-
tic leer in the twisted face it made me no


weird tales

easier in mind to see that he leaned on a
shotgun in lieu of a cane

  he stopped as i approached and stood
eyeing me warily

  mr barry i suppose i began

  he made no answer

  the towns rather deserted since i was
here last and i paused feeling the re-
mark was scarcely tactful

  whered you come from he asked
gruffly

  ralston i said taking a step or two
forward im here to visit friends on a
ranch south of here and now im--

  i stopped again undoubtedly the old
man was shrinking away from me i got
the idea he was smelling me certainly he
was sniffing at something-that upleas-
ant smell of scorching on my overcoat i
supposed

  and then he screamed a wild goblin
wail it was

   youre one of them dont tell me
youre one of them with the smell of
burnin on your clothes an you come
from across the street i knowed it i
knowed it knowed sometime youd come
across after me

  listen i said ive no idea what
youre talking about though i had an
uneasy feeling i knew all too well all
i want is a nights lodging for which ill
pay-

  he screamed again disregarding me

  put you in my house so it has to be
in a house does it his face writhed in
stark madness he threw up the shotgun
get back where you belong you dont
belong over here get back ill shoot

  i tried to speak but he refused to listen
and the twin muzzles were pointing di-
rectly at my belt buckle i backed away
he followed me

  i remembered that lunatic fellow with
the smell of ashes on him had said barry
never crossed main street into the ruins

then here was an easy way to rid myself
of him

  i increased my backward pace a little
and he pressed after me-and burst into
cackling laughter

  afraid of me yessir afraid of me
an for weeks i been afraid of you ho
ho ho get back there

  we reached main street and i started
across backward at the curb the old
man hesitated a moment looking from me
to the blackened ruins beyond then
half fearfully he put one foot off the
curb then the other slowly as a man
wades into deep water he followed

  not so good being marched through
a village of the dead by a maniac at one-
thirty in the morning is no experience to
be envied i looked around for the other
lunatic but he was nowhere in sight

  we crossed the street and i plodded
slowly backward toward the depot and
the old man followed me we were al-
ready half the distance when i saw a
shadowy figure creep from behind a
broken wall

  the old man was still babbling insanely

  i killed you before and i can kill
you again kill you so youll stay dead
afraid of me ho ho ho

  and then the figure leaped the old
man screamed shrilly as the gun was
twisted from his grasp as he was swung
aloft in a firemans carry to the others
shoulders

  much obliged i said with heartfelt
relief they shouldnt let a lunatic like
that run loose-

  the man had made no answer he was
plodding methodically down the street
with old barry still swung across his
shoulders

  where are you taking him i asked
curiously

  to the factory said the man shortly
i recognized the voice as that of the man
who smelt of ashes
burnt things



  and then old barry recommenced his
screaming god such rending screams
like a lost soul in endless anguish

  dont dont let them take me dont
-oh jesus help me

  what are you going to do with him

i insisted

  come along and see and the man
gave a little throaty chuckle

  i thought then it was the wind whis-
tling for the chuckle seemed to be echoed
and re-echoed through the ruins as if each
separate brick and fallen timber were en-
joying some ghoulish joke

  i hesitated a moment and followed
even though old barry were a lunatic so
unquestionably was his captor and
knowing something of the strength of
madmen i thoughtfully retrieved the
shotgun

   straight down the street past the depot
across the tracks up the driveway to the
factory i followed once i remembered
that driveway had been lined with cotton-
woods now only their charred and black-
ened trunks towered lifeless to the sky
and though i looked about a score of
times and could see nothing i could have
sworn a host accompanied us there was
the rustle of many feet through the ashes
the plod of them in the dusty road and
always a subdued ghoulish chuckling-
a chuckling almost drowned in the cease-
less screaming of old barry

  the great driveway door was nearly
choked with debris but we threaded our
way through it and inside the door barry
was lifted high the air and dashed
violently to the floor

  i leaped forward lunatic or not i
wouldnt see him killed i caught his cap-
tor by the shoulder and swung him vio-
lently about his cap loosened by the
jerk slipped back on his head

  and what had once been a face leered
up into mine no nose no lips no eyes
only fragments of charred flesh clinging

to blackened bones and the smell of
scorching meat-

i screamed as i leaped back and turned
to run and the subdued chuckle rose
to a mighty roar of horrible laughter and
i stopped for something was forming
between me and the doorway-something
that made the heaps of blackened rubbish
look hazy and misty it was as if a gauze
curtain had been pulled down

  and the curtain was moving swaying
as if in some unfelt breeze it was knotting
and twisting - separating into distinct
forms

  the old man was moaning faintly yet
he still lay motionless on the floor where
he had been hurled

  i looked again at the curtain it had
melted into separate units now they
seemed to be drifting toward us and
then again i screamed my loudest

  forms of men they were-or had been
but men with arms-with legs-burned
away with twisted seared blackened
faces with great patches of charred skin
clinging to burned black flesh and
skeletons with only bits of flesh still hang-
ing on the incinerated bones and the
smell-oh god

  did you ever smell meat burning and
charring in the oven imagine that smell
multiplied a thousand times-the reek of
searing human flesh of red-hot crumbling
bones and there were the contorted
faces of men cooked alive-fire-blackened
faces still twisted and set in the last fierce
agony of death

  i screamed as i threw up the shotgun
its double report shook the tottering walls
the shot sprayed through that curtain and
harmlessly into the rubbish beyond and
still the things came on with ghastly arms
outstretched

  my recent rescuer gave a loud shout
his clothing fell away revealing his fire-


weird tales

racked body he joined the slowly drift-
ing throng

  old barry was on his feet now backing
slowly away his eyes fixed on those burned
things with the horrible fascination of a
bird charmed by a snake with all my
heart i wanted to turn to run but to turn
my back on those horrors-i could not

  slowly we backed away together among
the heaps of rubbish of wrecked machin-
ery from the fallen roof and second floor
past the beet-slicers past the big cookers
down through the beet-end we crept back-
ward with the bodies of the dead drifting
slowly after us

   past the oliver presses past the centrif-
ugals we couldnt go much farther
the rear wall towered above us the door-
way to the old warehouse was choked with
the wreckage of vacuum pans i threw an
arm across my face i couldnt bear the
sight of those shapeless fire-racked bodies

  i found the darkness even more unbear-
able in fancy i could feel those bony
hands with their scraps of charred crum-
bling flesh fastening on me i screamed
again and pressed tightly against the wall

  there was a chant in the air surely it
never came from those fleshless lipless
mouths

  come with us into the fire the nice
warm fire john come with us

  no no the old man was on his
knees i never meant-i didnt know-
dont hurt me oh dont hurt me

  and still the chant went on

  the fire the nice warm fire

  they were very close now i whirled
about desperately

  almost five years before i had worked
in the factory i knew there should be
another door-the door to the boiler-
house could i find it in the darkness and
litter in a maniac rush i sprang over the
piled wreckage a wave of devastating
heat scorched my face as the dead men

swept up there was a crackling of flames
among that burned-out rubbish the old
man screamed horribly

  i	pressed my hands over my ears as i
stumbled and staggered onward still i 
could hear him scream god i can hear
him yet

  jesus oh lord jesus it burns
theyre burning me-

  thank god the little doorway was open
and partly clear i pushed squeezed tore
my way through the rubbish i was out in
the areaway east of the boiler-house those
things were behind me-and the old man
was still screaming more faintly now
and a babble

  oh jesus oh jesus oh jesus it
burns-it burns-

  with my hands still over my ears i
raced away from that place of madness

how i reached jims ranch i never
knew i dont even remember get-
ting there it is eight miles from como
only when i opened my eyes jim was
leaning over me alternately pouring
something raw and fiery down my throat
and shaking me while shouting

  bob bob for gods sake whats the
matter

  hallucinations-nightmare-the doctor
from san benito said and i think jim be-
lieved him at first probably i would
have believed him myself if it hadnt been
for my scorched hair and burned face
relic of that searing wave of awful heat

  and jim believes now too for today
he handed me a clipping from the san
benito paper

  another body found at como

   further mystery is added to the great fire at
como by the discovery of the remains of john
barry former watchman at the factory of the
como sugar company

   readers will recall that barry was suspected of
starting the fire in revenge for what he considered

five old skippers smelling of the
sea used to foregather every evening
at one of the round tables in front
of the old ship-and-anchor cafe in
toulon to enjoy their aperative and at the
same time to tell each other stories of
blood and horror from time to time
they were joined by a sixth who seemed
to be more of an old sea dog even than
zinzin he who had spent twenty years
coasting up and down the china seas
than dorat the ex-commander of the
dorat expeditions than bagatelle who
in memory of a blissful sojourn on the
island of siam had taken a siamese
woman unto wife than that blackguard
chaulieu who had carried the benefits of
civilization to the aborigines of western
africa settled between the congo and
the niger than captain michel who
still remembered the taste of human
flesh after passing several weeks on a

  translated by morris bentinck

    w t - 

raft of the medusa from which the ship-
wrecked had escaped with their lives
even though some were minus an arm
others a leg and all more or less crippled

  this sixth mariner mr damour
john-joseph-philibert had gained his
entire nautical experience seated at his
desk in the offices of the oriental trans-
portation company and he used to refer
in an offhand way to the far-flung pacific
ports of call as we lesser men might
speak say of some pleasant little fishing
cove along the seine

  to tell the truth he had never stepped
foot on the deck of a ship nor had he
even been outside paris except on the
day when he retired but his face was
so weather-beaten his skin so tough his
beard so rebellious his clay pipe so stub-
by and so seasoned his walk so tpically
the sailors sway that you had only to
glance at him and you would exclaim

                                     


weird tales

theres one whos weathered many a
gale

  he whetted the curiosity of the old
salts and they made him welcome when
on one unusually crowded day at the
cafe he lifted his basque beret and asked
if he might have a seat at their table he
came again from time to time and it took
them some months to grasp the idea that
john-joseph this was what they called
mr damour who from the beginning
made himself known to them as captain
had really never been on any voyage any-
where

  the old fellow used to give such pre-
cise details concerning the most distant
parts of the globe setting every one
straight who erred on any point he was
so glib with facts about the history of
liners from their christening day to the
day of their sometimes very dramatic end
that for a long time the skippers kept
their doubts to themselves but on the
day when the truth did come out there
was the devil to pay it was their turn
now and it goes without saying that they
gave it to him hammer and tongs for the
deception and yet there was one thing
they can not figure out at all and that
was how after thirty years spent behind
a desk in a sunless steamship office scrib-
bling figures in piles of paper a man
could still have a face like captain
john-joseph it must be he makes him-
self up for the part declared captain
michel and zinzin re-echoed yeah
he trims up like that over at the black
lion

ouite a time passed and he didnt
come around finally he showed
up with a young man of about twenty
who really did sail the seas and no mis-
taking it but he didnt think it was
anything to boast about he was as pale
as a girl and he admitted quite frankly
that hed never yet made a trip without

being seasick hes my adopted son
young vincent vincent a real sailor
john-joseph told his friends proudly

  every time vincent vincents ship
docked at toulon john-joseph was so
happy about it that it wasnt unusual to
see him come into the cafe rolling and
pitching more than ever three sheets in
the wind no less he had probably
drunk as much liquor as any three dozen
hearty sailors could hold

   for the love o god said that devil
of a chaulieu whereve you been john-
joseph to get such a load on

  just come from seeing the boy off
from marseilles answered john-joseph
in a very sentimental tone as he began
to blubber

   well if you feel so bad about it and
its no fun for the boy suggested cap-
tain michel there are plenty of other
jobs he could take

   no he couldnt replied john-joseph
emphatically as he gulped down another
glassful

  not one of the company contradicted
him they all agreed with him on that
point at least

  and then he added i dont want
to have the day come when theyll take it
out on him poor lad as they tried to do
out of his adopted father

  at this point he began to cry and-he
sobbed as can only very drunken men
when great sorrows overwhelm them

  come on now tell us the truth
asked bagatelle his sexual imagination
always alert are you really that boys
father

  no john-joseph answered bluntly
tears streaming down his cheeks no
im not his father    his father was
murdered

  the poor boy said zinzin just to
say something

   yes the poor boy    because i was
just going to tell you his mother   
the crime on christmas night



  whats that his mother baga-
telle pricked up his ears

  well his mother she was murdered
too

  oh for the love o god exclaimed
bagatelle

  that said zinzin thats a horrible
story

  more horrible than any ive heard
you fellows tell stuttered john-joseph
between his hiccups

  well youve got to show us said
captain dorat for after all one of the
reasons we come here every day is to lis-
ten to tales of horror

  it isnt more terrible than what hap-
pened to captain michel declared zin-
zin

  i say it is-only you mustnt tell it
to anyone its a secret puffed out
john-joseph trying to swallow a second
hiccup

  stop your sniffling commanded
michel and tell us all about it youll
feel better when its out of your system
not to mention that that happens
every day said chaulieu rather scorn-
fully to have your father and mother
murdered-i dont see anything very
terrible about that who murdered them
john-joseph wiped his eyes with his
big red bandanna handkerchief and hic-
cuped wasnt any murderers

  how can that be they were mur-
dered but nobody murdered them
thats just whats so terrible sighed
john-joseph the poor wretches were
found stabbed with a kitchen knife-a
real butchery the old mans blood was
dripping all over the carpet and the knife
was still sticking in the old womans
heart

  so theyd been fighting

  fighting flared up john-joseph
looking round at the company those
two good people easy to see you never
knew them they were the kind of mar-

ried folks who never spoke a cross word
to each other in their lives and they
werent going to begin on that day ill
have you know im the only one that
can give my word of honor to that too
no they were murdered after thered
been a robbery

   now then why did you first say there
werent any murderers when it was the
thieves that murdered them

  wasnt any thieves john-joseph cut
off short

  good god said chaulieu

  oh let him go to hell grunted
dorat

  give him a chance to tell his own
story ordered captain michel

  ive got no more to say declared
john-joseph

   this time all five burst into shouts of
laughter seeing which john-joseph be-
came raging angry now he really
wanted to tell his story and as the others
kept on making fun of him he thumped
so hard on the table that he scattered the
stacked-up saucers right and left and bel-
lowed i swear that in a few minutes
you wont be making fun

  all right then come on now were
all listening

john-joseph began at that time
my home port was germain-pilon

street-

   paris-on-the-sea teased chaulieu
damn it all ill not say another word
until that big pig gets to hell out of
here

  dont worry john-joseph you
couldnt hire me to stay answered chau-
lieu im going to take a turn about
and he rose  the horrible murder in
germain-pilon street    very little of
that goes a long way with me id rather
spend my time looking at the pretty
women on the screen over at the palace


weird tales

  when he had gone john-joseph be-
gan

  i dont know if any of you fellows
know germain-pilon street it climbs
from the avenue up to the top of mont-
martre its a lonely neighborhood-not
always many people about but the
street is respectable enough theres
where i came to know the vincent fam-
ily they were what you call comfort-
ably off and their friends were even
rather surprized to see them keep on liv-
ing in a section thought rather danger-
ous but they said that in the fifteen
years they had lived there nothing had
ever happened to them and theyd rather
live in a little house with a back yard
and a garden all to themselves than in a
big apartment house where you had to
knock against all the other tenants every
time you turned around

  i was their neighbor and although
they werent very sociable we got ac-
quainted through the little baby he
was a sweetheart of a child and i spoiled
him every time i could    ive always
adored children    one christmas
night-

  hell one of those christmas stories
groaned zinzin well see you later
boys

  and he went out to join chaulieu

  got anythingabout a woman in your
christmas story bagatelle asked

  yes

  good-go on then

  one christmas night madame vin-
cent in her felt slippers came down-
stairs to the dining-room where her hus-
band sat toasting his feet at the fireplace
waiting for her

   is the baby sleeping monsieur
vincent asked

   like an angel answered the good
woman

  they adored that child born after
they had been married nmy years his

arrival so late in their lives filled them
with an almost supernatural joy madame
vincent was forty-five when this happi-
ness came to her and her husband fifty-
five one sees miracles like that every
once in a while

  theirs was a perfect marriage up to
this time they had lived just for each
other from now on they lived only for
that little child they baptized him vin-
cent and as their family name was also
vincent the neighbors used to say when
they saw the baby go by in his mothers
arms

    there he is the darling theres lit-
tle vincent vincent and his mama go-
ing for a turn on the avenue 

  and i too declared captain dorat
as he rose to leave

  bagatelle tried to dissuade him

  wait a minute until he gets to the
part about the woman he said to dorat

  ah to hell with his story-john-
josephs a bore hes not even drunk
any more now

  john-joseph give me your word of
honor that the part about the woman is
worth waiting for demanded bagatelle

  i swear john-joseph declared
that its impossible to find anything
more horrible

and is there any love in your story
is there-love even unto death but
if youre sensitive youd better go now
for such a death-well you dont see
them often in love stories

  i stay bagatelle decided but
dorat had already left to join the other
two



the memory of little vincent vin-
cents happy babyhood completely
sobered john-joseph he even forgot to
keep his old clay pipe lighted from
now on he told his story in the style of
the former model employee
the crime on christmas night



   i dont need to tell you how papa and
mama vincent allowed themselves to
spoil their baby in a thousand loving
ways-cakes candies toys ice-creams
little suits of velvet and lace they
were his adoring slaves-nothing was too
beautiful nothing cost too much for little
vincent

  the couple had been employed in the
well-known shop smart styles ever
since that house had been established and
at the time of their babys coming they
were earning with their bonuses and all
on an average of  francs a year
which permitted them to lay by a nice
little nest egg

  after vincents birth although they
never thought twice about spending right
and left for him they began to deprive
themselves of all the little indulgences
that had up to now made their married
life so sweet they counted every
penny little by little they became even
miserly no more anniversary dinners
no more visits to the theater no more
sunday excursions into the country no
more pleasant evening parties playing
games with their friends all that would
be so much put away for the little angel
who would find it when he needed it

  after he had prayed the infant jesus
to put a beautiful present in the little
shoes he had set purposely in front of the
dining-room fireplace little vincent had
fallen off to sleep on this christmas night
knowing his parents were to wake him
up later to see the lighted christmas tree

   the sight of those little shoes on the
hearth must have been very touching for
mama vincent noticed that when papa
vincent saw them there his eyes filled
with tears she went up to him and
patted him on the shoulder

   come now papa vincent youre not
going to cry on christmas night i hope

   he got up from his chair i cant help
it he stammered ive never been able

to look at those little baby shoes showing
where his little toes have been without a
lump in my throat i know its silly for-
give me my dear wife

    do i forgive you and as she said it
she drew him to her bosom and kissed
him with all the tenderness of a first kiss
then when she felt herself also yielding
to emotion she straightened up wiped
away a tear with the back of her hand and
said

   come now papa vincent lend a
hand were going to trim the christmas
tree

                                  

    so we are lets make it gay and beau-
tiful for him all pink and shining when
he opens his eyes on it the little dear 
bagatelle burst forth with for the
love o god you dont forget anything do
you but how do you know they did all
that you werent there were you

   papa vincent told me all these little
things understand

   no insisted bagatelle i dont un-
derstand if its the night he was mur-
dered

   its the very night and john-josephs
voice was getting more and more dismal
well then

   well he told me after hed been mur-
dered

   youre pretty slick you always put us
in the wrong but for gods sake get on
to the part about the woman afterward
we will see

  all right listen then began john-
joseph

tsvery year since the coming of the
m-j baby they had set up a christmas
tree after supper in the dining-room and
trimmed it with all the toys and all the
little gifts they had bought when they
finished trimming they used to go out for
a walk and drop into church for the mid-
night mass then they would come back
home light the pink candles go upstairs


weird tales

to the baby whom the maid had been
watching lift him up gently and wake
him up only when they stood right in front
of the tree all dressed with glittering tin-
sels and stars to make the child happy
they did the very same thing this year as
ever

  that night there was a traveling fair
set up on the avenue tents had been put
up along the pavement and in the empty
lots it was a fine mild evening winter
had hardly set in and the men and women
drinking their beer in the open air in front
of the cafes lingered to look at the dancers
and listen to the catchy tunes of the merry-
go-rounds and hurdy-gurdies

  did papa vincent tell you all this
after hed been murdered

  yes everything

  he must have had an awful thirst

  i gave him something to drink said
john-joseph and then he drew his last

breath-

  before he had proposed another round
of drinks

  no but after he had entrusted his
little son to me

  but what about that woman for
gods sake

  im coming to her

  calm now john-joseph took up the
thread of his story

  madame and mnsieur vincent went
up to place blanche where they met some
very old friends the duponts who wanted
to stop for a little chat but after the
barest how-do-you-do the vincents left
the duponts and walked rapidly down to
the church of the holy trinity where
they intended to listen to the midnight
mass

  it was now captain michels turn to
get up

  where you going bagatelle asked
him

  my religious scruples the captain ex-
plained good-naturedly keep me from

going to holy trinity for the midnight
mass you must excuse me john-joseph
i belong to the reformed church

  oh you damned old infidel pleaded
bagatelle wait at least till he gets to
the part where the woman comes in

  a damned old infidel said the cap-
tain mock-seriously takes no pleasure
whatever in stories about women   
not even good women he added and
wished the company good night

  bagatelle was now the only one left to
listen john-joseph went right on even
if his stack of saucers had been his only
audience he would have gone right along
he couldnt stop now his own story fas-
cinated him it was the first time he had
ever told it and it would probably be the
last he wanted to prove to himself that
he too could tell a story of horror

  after the vincents left them the du-
ponts swore they were ill-bred declaring
they had never been friendly and sociable
since the birth of their baby

  reaching the church the vincents
went in even though they had a whole
hour to wait before the services began
they walked right straight up to the
cradle and knelt upon the steps before the
infant jesus lying there in the manger be-
tween the ox and the ass

   he looks just like our baby whis-
pered papa vincent but his wife paid no
attention to him she was buried so deeply
and so passionately in prayer that the
lights and the organ and the crowd elbow-
ing past her couldnt make her turn her
head when the mass was over her hus-
band had to lay his hand gently on her
shoulder to bring her back out of that
pious stupor when she turned to look at
him her face was like wax

   heavens he said its not good for
you to pray like that come im sure our
boy is already awake and watching for us
to come back

    yes yes she said lets hurry along
the crime on christmas night



  and she led him on as though she was
really trying to flee something he had
difficulty in keeping up with her he was
all out of breath when they reached the
avenue and he tried to make her slow up
a little

   no not yet she said we must get
back as quick as ever we can

  he thought she was afraid to be out
in the streets of that district at such a
late hour as a matter of fact that corner
of paris had never been more disquieting
the hurdy-gurdies had ceased groaning
out their tira-liras a few melancholy
lights trembled down in the deserted ave-
nue and behind suspicious shadows
pleasure-seeking gentlemen eyed belated
girls wandering up and down the streets

  however the vincents did get back
home safe and sound as soon as they
were in their dining-room with the lamp
lighted the sight of the bright christmas
tree drove out of their heads all the ugly
sight of the streets from the foot of the
staircase monsieur vincent called to the
maid softly so not to wake up the child
but she didnt answer just as he started
to go up madame vincent said

  shes  dropped off to sleep beside
vincent dont disturb her lets finish ar-
ranging everything here

  then in great excitement they put
the last touches to the tree they tied some
more toys to the branches already weighted
down with punch-and-judy boxes they
hung some dolls and some mechanical toys
and some games they had bought from
time to time during the year and laid away
for this very moment papa vincent was
just getting ready to slip a general and his
trumpet into the little shoes on the hearth
when mama vincent stopped him short
and said

   no no not in the shoes dont put
anything in the shoes ill take care of
them

  and she spread a napkin on the table

put some glasses on it some plates and
some little cakes and brought out a bottle
of champagne then she lit the little rose
candles on the tree it was a real illumina-
tion youve never seen anything gayer
prettier than that room all trimmed up in
red and silver the only thing lacking to
start the party was baby vincent himself

   ill go upstairs and wake him up
said his mother you wait for us down
here

   and the shoes are you forgetting
the shoes asked the father

   no im not forgetting them its a
surprize you shall see

   good  all right

  she disappeared for a second into the
kitchen and took from a case an object
which she hid quickly under the cloak she
hadnt taken off since they had come back
from the mass

   ha ha i caught you at it sly one
laughed monsieur vincent come let me
see the surprize too show it to me

   go along with you youre more of a
child than little vincent go back to the
dining-room i want you to my dear

  it was always his way to do everything
she told him to he went back and sat
down again in front of the christmas tree
as for her she hurried to the floor above



rjhe ran up the stairs so fast that she
 had to stop a moment on the land-
ing her heart beat so furiously it almost
choked her on her right hand was the
half-open door of the room where little
vincent lay sleeping on the left a closed
door leading to their own bedroom be-
fore this one she stopped drew a key from
her pocket unlocked the door closed it
behind her and found herself in pitch
blackness feeling her way along she
came to the fireplace kicking to right and
left the objects she stumbled on at last


weird tales

her fingers touched a box of matches she
struck one she found a candle and lighted
up the room

  suddenly the flickering light of the
candle revealed a terrible disorder sheets
and mattresses snatched from the bed lay
strewn across the floor night table and
center table were turned upside down
toilet objects had been smashed a mir-
rored wardrobe completely ransacked the
clothes thrown here there and every-
where several window-panes had been
shivered into a thousand pieces finally
she noticed the sticky blade traces of old
slippers by whose aid some one had tried
to muffle his footsteps-for the room had
certainly been the scene of a robbery

   the candlelight flickering and leap-
ing in the breeze blowing in through the
window added weird shadows to the fan-
tastic horror of that scene of devastation

  to leave the warm atmosphere of the
christmas celebration of the soft enchant-
ment of that room below where every-
thing is prepared for the sweetest and pur-
est of family joys and to wake up suddenly
in the midst of that icy fear-wasnt that
more than enough to congeal forever the
simple heart of good madame vincent
in any case even if that heart did still
beat after such a shock what inexpressible
anguish must have seized little vincents
mother when sh thought of her baby
alseep only two steps from that tragic spot
devastated as pitiably as though a tor-
nado had raged through it

  well no    madame vincent
walking so cautiously in the midst of that
disorder the candle in one hand and a
knife in the other-a huge kitchen knife
quite new the mysterious object she was
hiding under her cloak a little while ago-
madame vincent showed neither surprize
nor fear

  she knew there had been a robbery
and she had kept it from her husband so
not to spoil the christmas party broke in

bagatelle who was not at all lacking in
common sense

  but ive already told you there had
been no robbery

  youve gone loony and im getting
bughouse    well never mind but
what about that woman what did she
have to do with all this business

  everything she was the one who com-
mitted the robbery

  good god my heads cracking open
with your damn story all right  go
on when she saw what had happened
what did she do old woman vincent
she went into little vincents room
she woke up the dozing maid she sent her
up to her own room to finish out her
nights sleep then there was little vin-
cent who opens his pretty blue eyes in his
mothers arms he doesnt cry he knows
its christmas hes been dreaming about
it he wakes up with the idea of all the
gifts waiting for him downstairs he claps
his little hands together and gurgles
christmas christmas and the kisses he
bites from his mamas cheeks taste as sweet
to him as though they were chocolate
nougats

   the little angel is as happy as he can
be he stretches out his arms toward the
sparkling christmas tree he wants to
touch everything take everything in his
hands play with everything at the same
time his papa and mama can hardly keep
him satisfied

  then all of a sudden his merry eyes
fall on his little shoes on the hearth he
sees they are empty he begins to cry

  papa vincent looks reproachfully at
mama vincent why did you make him
unhappy he asks but mama takes her
little one in her arms she consoles him
cuddles him dries his tears

   little jesus didnt want to bring
everything to you tonight little jesus will
come again tomorrow morning tomor-
the crime on christmas night



row morning there will be some beautiful
presents in little vincents shoes

    will there truly mama

    i promise you there will be my dar-
ling baby

  his mothers words bring smiles of
joy back to vincents eyes again

   but what surprize are you keeping
back from him asked the father in a low
voice

    you shall see you shall see mama
answers with an air of mystery

  and mama vincent takes her good
husbands head draws it down to the
babys and covers both of them with big
passionate kisses and silent tears this
demonstration so unexpected and some-
what nervous makes papa vincent a little
anxious

    you frighten me he whispers to his
wife

    lets eat some supper she answers

  and they sit down quietly to their
supper and she pours out the champagne
and the child is allowed to dip his lips in
the foam then his arms still grasping
the toys he dozes off to sleep again on his
fathers knee

    carry him back up to his little crib
says mama stay with him a few minutes
to be sure he drops back to sleep ill go
and put out the candles on the tree and
then ill come up to bed

papa vincent does as she tells him
mama vincent blows out all the can-
dles quickly now all is dark where a few
minutes before the christmas tree was
glittering and pink by the feeble rays of
the light coming from vincents room
she climbs the stairs her legs tremble
under the weight of her body and she
holds onto the banister as though she were
afraid she would fall backward she sighs
with relief when she reaches the landing

   whats the matter with you her

husband asks in a low voice from the boys
bedroom

  but mama vincent doesnt answer
she is too weak to speak she turns her
eyes away from her sons crib she pushes
open the door of the ransacked room she
plows through the disorder she lights a
candle once again her eyes take in the
sickening horror of it all

  she grasps the knife-the big new
shiny kitchen knife so finely sharpened-
and she places herself behind the door

  her husband calls out to her from the
other room he gets no answer

  he appears his broad chest well
lighted by the reddish light of the sputter-
ing candle flame he asks why dont

you answer my de-

  but he is not able to finish the word
mama vincent stretched forth her
arm and struck two terrible blows the
man uttered a shriek and fell down but
she threw herself upon him and covered
his mouth with her hand

   be quiet    dont speak 

   ah its you he said through his
struggling breath its you

    yes it is i dont speak

  between two snatches of breath the
man has strength enough to say at least
shut-the door

   she drags herself to the door closes it
again and comes back to the big bleeding
body which she now stares at with eyes
full of tears and terror

   my dear my dear wife sighs the
wretched man you did right but are you
sure everything is well thought out will
there be any suspicions

  no no no one will suspect anything
and she stretched herself out beside him
and pressed her lips upon her victims

   do you forgive me

   of course i forgive you you had-
more courage than i had

   dont say that but if i had let you
do it you would have killed yourself and


weird tales

they would have known that you were a
suicide i made believe a robbery

   you did right-yes-it was com-
plete ruin-worse than i told you night
before last the business utterly wiped
out    not a penny left    manager
fled  all die employees savings
squandered you have done just right my
dear wife

  he closed his eyes and said nothing
more she thought he was dead carefully
she drew the knife out of the horrible
wound then his eyelids moved once
more

   what are you doing he asked with
one breath

   nothing

    dont touch it he said again dont
touch the knife

   be quiet my dear they would you
understand ask me some questions i
must not be-able to answer they must
think weve been murdered-both of us
   you understand vincent-if possi-
ble dont die before i do-wait wait
here let me have your hand-help me-
do that little thing for me-help me-
vincent there-like that-strong-ah
ah

  helped by vincents hand she buried

the knife in her heart-deliberately-
steadily-and as she died she whispered
my little boy vincent one hundred
thousand francs in-your little shoes 
john-joseph ceased bagatelle looked
at him more stunned than terror-struck
hows that he said what did she
mean one hundred thousand francs in the
little shoes

  john-joseph began to blubber again
father vincent didnt die till the next
day he had time to explain to me that
he would not have been able to pay the
premium on the life insurance he had
taken out in favor of his little son they
were both too old to take up some new
kind of work in this way they were sure
that little vincent would never want for
anything

  bagatelle didnt feel like joking any
more so then the woman in the story
shes mama vincent

  exactly replied john-joseph have
you ever seen a couple who loved each
other like that

  oh pooh answered bagatelle shak-
ing his head its a damn good love story
-i wont say no to that-but nobody
would ever say there was anything very
horrible about it

in themselves the events had all
the horror of a nightmare but a
nightmare can be explained so that it
ceases to oppress ones mind the inci-
dents at norton in western minnesota
were different for now they may never be
completely explained it is not so much
the things we know that terrify us as it is
the things we do not know the things that
break all known laws and rules the things
that come upon us unaware and shatter the
pleasant dream of our little world the oc-
currence at norton was of such a kind a
horror of so appalling and incredible a

nature that no one concerned will ever be 
able to forget the day of madness

weird tales

darkness with phantoms and specters we
know not of and our little world plunges
blindly through abysses toward a goal of
which we have no conception that
thought itself is a blow at our beliefs and
comprehension we used to content our-
selves by thinking we knew all about our
world at least but now it is different and
we wonder if we really know anything or
if there can be safety and peace anywhere
in the wide universe

  the phenomena with which we are here
concerned began with the blotting out of
the stars an astronomical riddle which
was observed by three watchers professor
grill of harvard his assistant mr thorn-
dyke and an amateur astronomer in cal-
ifornia mr nelson an odd feature of
the observation is that the two easterners
swear the blotting out occurred far down
on the western horizon whereas mr nel-
son reported that it took place near saturn
are we to believe that one observation
was inaccurate or that there actually were
two simultaneous phenomena in different
parts of the heavens in the light of for-
mer and after events the latter conclusion
seems more likely furthermore mr nel-
sons observation made on the night of
march  is apparently connected with
one he had made on the preceding night
according to a note he had sent in to the
mount wilson observatory he had been
idly examining the planet saturn on the
night of march  the atmosphere was
exceptionally clear the observation per-
fect the rings were so plain and the
planet so impressive in its peculiar way
that he stayed on watching it minute after
minute thus it was that the unexpected
happened even while he watched shortly
after one oclock there appeared on its
surface a spot of such blinding dazzling
radiance that he thought his vision must
have been strained and he was merely see-
ing things he looked away for a minute
when he resumed his watch at the eyepiece

of his telescope he discovered that where
the spot of incandescent brilliance had
been was now a dot of blackness as he
watched it in curiosity he saw it grow
lighter and lighter until finally the planet
presented its normal appearance mr
nelson might have ignored the matter al-
together if he had not had sufficient scien-
tific training to respect the cardinal prin-
ciple of never overlooking any fact or
data thus it was that he wrote down his
observation and duly sent it in

  the blotting out of the stars on the
night of march  was an even stranger
phenomenon in the act of training his
telescope on saturn again to look for a
reappearance of the radiant spot mr nel-
son noticed a star suddenly flicker out and
return another vanish and shine bright
again an instant later he thought at first
that he must be the victim of an optical il-
lusion but he kept on observing and saw
that the stars which disappeared and
shone again were in a straight line which
he computed to lie in the general path
between saturn and the earth it was a
curious spectacle to watch according to
nelson it was just as if you were strolling
down a street at noon and stopped to look
at a diamond on a black plush cushion in
a jewellers window and then all at once
the diamond wasnt there even while you
were looking at it and then suddenly
there was the diamond again sparkling as
ever it was not as if a solid body had
come between you and the diamond but
rather as if something invisible had
crossed your field of vision something you
could not see but which intercepted light-
rays the observation of the two har-
vard astronomers duplicated nelsons but
they said that the blotting out took place
down on the western horizon far away
from saturn odder still is their statement
that the stars vanished in a straight line
that progressed in the general direction of
the earth
something from above

i

  no wide attention was paid to these un-
usual observations and even the three
watchers did not have much more than
idle curiosity for that reason because
every one was unprepared the terror at
norton stalked out of night like a hideous
dream as overwhelming as madness itself
perhaps the rest of the story should be told
through the eyes of lars loberg a stolid
norwegian farmer living some three
miles from norton for it was around his
farm that the terror centered and he him-
self was a first-hand witness until he went
insane and committed suicide

he arose early as usual on the morn-
ing of march  it was cold in the
farmhouse and he stepped outside to chop
an armful of kindling wood it was al-
ready light and snow was falling when he
opened the door he started to go
through then stopped just beyond the
threshold and looked around with a blank
puzzled expression on his face he care-
fully retraced his steps to the room he had
just left and stood there looking across
the farmyard and open fields

  helga he called in a curious tone to
his wife come here

  his wife came and the two stood in the
doorway looking at a sight such as they
had never before seen the whole air
seemed to be oozing blood not a breath
of wind was stirring not a cloud hung
in the sky but a fine mist was falling a
substance that was neither snow nor dust
nor blood but that had something of the
nature of all three the snowdrifts around
the farmhouse that were not yet fully
melted in the spring thaws were already
covered with a mantle of brownish-red
and minute by minute as the strange stuff
kept falling from the sky the layer on the
ground grew thicker the two of them
stood there in the quiet of dawn with awe
and a little fear looking at the unusual
downfall and a world that was bloody-red

there was a queer odor in the air almost
a stench it reminded lars of a two-days-
dead cat he once stumbled on and of a
pig he had bled to death recently

  lars stretched his arm out and caught
some of the falling stuff in his hand

  see he said simply to helga the
stuff melted it did not run off like water
it stayed in little oily globules of a color
like old blood instead of having the
fresh earthy smell of snow or rain it gave
off an unpleasant odor that offensively
suggested something dead

  helga was superstitious she shivered
and drew back from larss outstretched
palm red snow she said uneasily it
-it aint natural-i dont like it oh lars
shut the door

  lars looked out somberly for a minute
yeah-red snow maybe it means a bad
year for the crops then he shrugged his
shoulders and half smiled at helga but
its probably only dust in the air that got
mixed up with the snow nothing to get

scared about and-

  listen broke in helga sharply

  lars left unfinished what he had started
to say up to the house from the pig-sty
drifted an uproar of grunting and mad
squealing such as he had never heard in
the barn the horses were neighing and
whinnying shrilly and he heard the wild
clatter of trampling hooves above the
racket of the frightened animals he heard
the mournful whimpering howl of jerry
the scotch collie

  lars tore out of the house on a run
you stay here he shouted back as
helga started to follow him ill see
whats after em and quiet em down
the red snow was still falling lars
raced to the barn first but there were no
tracks of any intruder around it in the
new-fallen snow nor could he find any
evidence that man or beast had been
prowling around the pig-pen lars ran
back to the barn slid open the doors and
 

weird tales

did his best to quiet the plunging horses
something had badly scared them but he
had little time to speculate on what it was
tor the first time in his life the animals
paid hardly any attention to his efforts to
calm them and lars became more puzzled
and bewildered every moment then he
heard jerry howling nearer the patter of
racing feet came across the yard and the
dog leaped through the open door shak-
ing itself and tumbling around at his feet

  there jerry there jerry lars
crooned bending over to pat the dog his
hand came away wet with the snow and
then it struck him that the animals were
afraid of the weird downfall

  there was nothing much he could do
till the snow stopped so he walked around
among them talking to them and patting
them until they became a little more quiet
about seven oclock the snow ceased fall-
ing the horses were still nervous but
gradually ended their crazy bucking and
whinnying lars decided it was safe to
leave them now and walked back to the
farmhouse mopping his brow

	the thing in the field

over bacon and eggs and steaming
coffee lars and helga discussed the
phenomenon but with these homely
breakfast items before them and a warm
feeling inside the strange snow became
less mysterious and alarming to them

  no wonder the pigs and hosses was
scared said lars half in jest i guess
anybodyd feel funny to see red snow in-
stead of white but it aint anything to
worry about its probably just dust in the
air like i said

  maybe so helga answered doubt-
fully but wheres there any red dust
around here

  the question stumped lars he knew
minnesota the dakotas montana and
nebraska but in none of those states was

there anything with the peculiar color of
the snow

  i wish youd stay around here today
helga kept on slowly i dont feel right
somehow things aint natural like they
ought to be

  no need to worry lars answered
briefly everythings all right

  as if in mockery of his words the
whole house shook the coffee slopped
across the table and a terrific crash burst
on their ears from near by

  without a word lars made another run
for the door helga with superstitious
fear clutching heavy at her heart stayed
behind to straighten out the table some
intuition warned her that something was
wrong with the world the red snow and
now this explosive crash-what could
they mean she heard lars and jerry walk-
ing around the farmhouse as they searched
for the cause of the disturbance but when
lars re-entered the house ten minutes
later the frown on his face showed the
futility of his search

  what was it helga asked

  nothing that i could find he re-
plied puzzled and irritated sounded
like a tree or something fell on the barn
but there wasnt anything the matter i
guess maybe were hearing things that
aint

  it was poor comfort the two finished
their breakfast in silence at the conclu-
sion of the meal lars said briefly im
going up to the forty-acres to see how the
grounds coming along if you want me
shout and ill hear you helga made no
answer in spite of her fears-she knew the
futility of arguing with lars

  her husband called jerry and the two
set off the sun was up and the sky fairly
clear it was rapidly getting warmer the
red snow already looked soggy and the
air had a bad smell malodorous and stale

  a path led from the rear of the farm-
house down past the chicken coops and
something from above



bam cut across the hog-run then ran 
across an open field and finally up a small
hill on the other side of which lay the
forty-acres a tract used for wheat lars
walked down the path past the barn and
across the hog-run as they started across
the open field jerry suddenly bristled
lars heard him growl savagely he looked
around but nothing unusual was in sight

  cmon jerry he called and walked
on the dog lagged behind him growling
and whining then lars stopped abruptly
in surprize some ten yards ahead of him
was a great gash in the wet earth it
must have been freshly made for the
earth bulged around its edges and there
was as yet no pool of water in it

  as lars continued striding toward it
after his momentary pause jerry set up a
furious barking that ended in a long
whining howl and refused to advance
stop that fool barking and come along
lars swore irritably his nerves were be-
coming frayed but the collie absolutely
would not come and lars went on think-
ing that the dog would follow him if he
took the lead

   he was a few feet from the edge of the
gash when something he had not seen
caught his ankle and he tripped forward
in one mad second of horror the pit of
hell seemed to open up before him some-
thing else he could not see hit him a great
blow on his forehead and his outstretched
arms were bruised on a hard substance
he was leaning forward at a forty-five de-
gree angle over the deep gash he looked
straight down and saw its bottom a dozen
feet below him but he did not fall he
might have been resting on a steel plat-
form but there was absolutely nothing in
sight

   a great bubbling of sweat broke out on
him the blood from the bruise on his
forehead dripped down but hung sus-
pended in midair a few inches from his
face his eyes glazed with terror lars

slowly pushed himself upright and stood
trembling a moment he put out his
hand again and his fingers felt the same
stuff hard as steel colder than ice with
knobs here and there and strange grooves
there was one depression on the solid sur-
face into which he put his fist and the
hand vanished from sight

  at that sheer fright gripped him and
he turned and ran with all his strength
while jerry whined along at his heels the
terrific crash remained a mystery no longer
-would to god that it had something
that never was of this earth had fallen in
the midst of an open field whether by ac-
cident or purpose all the old folk-lore
and witch legends of his race surged into
his thoughts to increase his panic but he
thought of helga too as he ran and de-
cided that he would say nothing which
might alarm her more

  he stopped for a minute outside the
farmhouse to get his breath then he
walked in trying to be his usual self

  that you lars helga called out a
moment later she entered the kitchen
when she saw him she ran forward
why lars your face is bleeding

   yes i-i tripped and fell

   helga looked into his eyes that were yet
wild and dilated and the truth of intui-
tion leaped into her heart

  lars that crash-you know what it
was there was something in the field
no he answered deliberately no
there was nothing in the field

  	the falling that was upward

it was a solemn pair that sat down at
midday for lunch the oppressive
weight of mystery and fear hung over the
table and stopped even the small talk
that lars and helga ordinarily indulged
in by tacit consent they said nothing
further about the incidents of the morn-
ing


weird tales

  toward two oclock the sky began to
cloud up and it grew cooler outside but
the red snow had all melted in the warmth
of the late morning and around the farm-
house hung a putrid smell stale and
nauseating the odor of a charnel-house or
the grave

  lars puttered around the kitchen and
basement doing odd jobs to pass time he
did not leave the house his nerves were
on the ragged edge and he did not know
what might happen next the red snow
and the thing in the field lay heavy on his
heart nature had gone all wrong this
day the security and trust of a lifetime
had vanished in a brief hour what could
he do in the presence of a mystery that
seemed to have no explanation and things
that went against the laws of life he had
relied on as the great masses of leaden
clouds piled up overhead and gusts of
chill wind whined around the yard and
the house the indefinable fear of the un-
known hung over his thoughts he had
only one ray of hope that the paper which
the rural postman would leave in the
afternoon would give some explanation of
the mysterious snowfall the thing in the
field he vainly tried to put out of mind by
pretending that it must be a new kind of
comet

  it was about four oclock when lars
who was upstairs fixing a broken window-
sash heard the postmans whistle he put
down his hammer and nails then walked
down a short passage to die head of the
stairs from there looking across the
front bedroom and out its window he
could see the mail-box on its post where
the county road ran by some ninety or a
hundred yards in front of the house there
the familiar horse and buggy of the post-
man were halted to his surprize helga
with the mail in her hand was standing
there too talking with him but evidently
on the point of returning to the house she

  must have seen him coming down the road
and gone out to meet him

  the sight of helga made him curiously
uneasy he wished she had waited to let
him go after the mail as he started to
descend the flight of steps he decided he
would ask her to stay inside for the next
day or so but all thoughts were driven
from his head and black terror over-
whelmed him in a sickening rush when he
was half-way down

  for there came to his ears a sound that
was yet many sounds there was a strange
long zing-g-g the mad whinny of a horse
and the sudden piercing shriek of a
woman and then there came again that
long strange zing-g-g and the noise of a
great wind

   lars cleared the rest of the steps in one
leap and stumbled on a twisted ankle
around the comer and to the front door
and so outside the blind fear which he
had felt as he hung over the pit that morn-
ing suspended by a thing which he could
not see was as nothing to the surge of hor-
ror that swept upon him now

  for there was no one in sight the mail-
box was deserted the road stretched
away to the left bare of any human travel-
ler for three-quarters of a mile and to the
right just as empty for a half-mile and
in the field that stretched away on the
other side of the road not a living creature
was to be seen helga and the postman
with his horse and buggy had vanished as
though they had never been

  but there was a curious thing all
around was gray from the clouds that ob-
scured the sky except in a round patch of
blue perhaps a hundred yards in diameter
through which sunlight was pouring
above the mail-box lars mechanically
looked up high above was the single rift
in the cloud-banks a rift that the surging
clouds were rapidly filling again even as
he looked some white things fluttered
toward earth-letters and papers lars

picked up a handful like one dazed or
mad and stumbled back into the house he
was hardly conscious of the sudden roar
of wind that came up or the wall of sleet
that drove in a wild slant from the clouds
in the same mechanical irresponsible way
he turned again and went out into the
half-darkness with the hopeless hope that
his eyes and ears had played him a trick
he walked down the road in either di-
rection searched across the field called
and shouted till his voice was hoarse but
not a thing did he find and no one an-
swered his vain cries then at last when
the sleet turned to a fine drizzle which
ceased shortly he went back to the farm-
house still in that numbing daze

  the letters were lying on the floor
where he had dropped them and he auto-
matically picked out of them the paper
that he had thought might contain a news
item of explanation but he could not con-
centrate his thoughts and they were only
disjointed phrases that his eye picked out
here and there red snow falls-volcanic
dust in upper atmosphere-dust clouds
from western prairies-curious unknown
organism puzzles scientists-chemist as-
serts he found traces of a substance like
blood- were the paragraphs expla-
nations and comment that ran in a jumble
through his thoughts and somewhere else
on the page a few other phrases

beams of red green violet yellow-

	something from above

by nightfall of that day of madness
it was again partly clear outside in
the east still hung a low bank of clouds
but overhead and to the west the stars
were coming out

  lars sat by a window looking dully into
    w t-

the night as he had been sitting for the
last three hours his mind had become
calmer while he brooded over mysteries he
could not fathom but there was a light in
his eyes that had never been in them be-
fore only the stolidity of his race had
thus far kept him from going mad in his
ears still rang that medley of sounds and
his horrified eyes held before them yet the
vacant roadway and the letters fluttering
down it was incredible unthinkable yet
all his thoughts wound up with the expla-
nation that was no explanation at all
somehow the postman and helga had
been whirled up from the surface of earth
he had thought of a tornado but nothing
else had been disturbed and he had seen
no telltale whirling in the sky what was
it that could reach down to earth all in a
brief second or two and instantly vanish
skyward with its prey the cold sweat
broke out on his forehead once as a child
he had wondered how he would feel if he
saw an apple fall from a tree and instead
of dropping to earth sail toward the
heavens now he knew that dreadful sen-
sation the feeling that nature had sud-
denly gone askew

  he stared again into the sky directly
above where the stars shone bright and
cold vainly hoping that he might draw a
solution out of those fathomless deeps
minutes ticked by the milky way blazed
out in its mysterious beauty and the night
was quiet with no wind

  when it was that he became conscious
of something new he could not say but
in back of his futile thoughts a forgotten
phrase groped for expression northern
lights-phenomenon-red green vio-
let-

  then he knew high above him so
faintly that at first he could not be sure
beams of many-colored light stabbed
and shot and pulsed across the stars and it
struck lars with surprize and something
of a new fear growing upon him that no-


weird tales

where else was the display to be seen in
the past he had frequently watched the
aurora borealis creep down from the
north flaming brighter till streamers and
cataracts of weird radiance played across
all die northern sky but he had never
before seen it confined to so small a spot
in the heavens these flashing beams of
green and violet red and yellow did not
seem as remote as the northern lights
usually were and it was strange that they
occurred in so small an area an area
which looked no larger than a plate
though he knew it must be immensely
larger out there in space sometimes
only two beams would dance around
each other sometimes all would be gone
then a minute later rays of different
colors leaped out against die starry vel-
vet of night and the strangest part of
the display was the clearness and straight-
ness of the beams there was none of the
vagueness and change and slow merging
into odier patterns and colors that the
aurora had this resembled more the
snapping on and off of giant flashlights

  for several minutes lars looked at
the queer lights with the dullness of a
mind dazed by too many shocks and
even as he watched them he became
aware of something yet newer he seemed
to see one or twp black specks in the air
between him and the lights like the
dancing specks before die eyes of some
one who has been struck on the head and
there came to his ears a rush of wind
and two objects hurtled furiously past
him to smash on the ground a moment
later he thought he heard a thud down
by the road and another from somewhere
afar but perhaps they were only echoes
that he heard or his ears may have been
playing him tricks he could not be sure
for he looked at the two in the farmyard
and his eyes went wide and glary like
a run-down automaton he rose and

stumbled downstairs out into the chill
quiet night

  there was something oddly familiar
in that nearest object and he went up to
it with a far-away buzzing in his ears
and a wild swirl of insane dreams in his
mind he bent over the still form a
scorched odor came to his nostrils he
recognized the poor broken body of
helga the hideously white skin he
crooned a word of grief and bent over to
stroke the lifeless clay and then he
snatched his hand back again for it
burned like the fire of a furnace but he
knew it was no fire that he touched nor
any heat but the biting absolute cold of
outer space as helga had vanished in
mystery and terror so had she returned
but the horror for her was over for him
it kept on the night was all silent but
that maddening buzz was louder in his
brain he shook his head to get rid of
it and his eyes fell upon the other
object

for a second that was as long as
eternity time and space and the world
stood still for lars no eyes could look
unchanged on that slimy blob of liquid
flesh and fungus and ichor with its
loathly tentacles and beaks its blackness
of corruption its monstrous mixture of
all that was obscene in the vegetable and
animal kingdoms and more horrible
still the things metallic core like brown
quicksilver that still moved feebly with
an appalling parody of life and in its
center a sickly rotten bulb of a dead
blind eye that glared foully at lars with
its dying light

  the buzzing in his ears swelled to a
grating shrill din something snapped
his teeth champed together and the mad-
ness was upon him he muttered croon-
ing endearments to helga shrieked blas-
phemies at the slimy thing from above
something from above



burst out into peals of mirthless laughter
and rasping sobs his crazed mind went
off on another tangent and he stopped
his muttering and shrieking as suddenly
as he had begun instead he chuckled
with insane cunning as though he had
thought of a way to cheat his enemy he
backed slyly to the farmhouse was gone
for a minute reappeared with a great
armful of kindling wood he returned
to fetch another and another till a heap
of it lay on the ground he made a rude
pyre out of it except for an armful or
two he dragged the body of helga onto
it though his hands burned as if in a
white-hot furnace he ran back reap-
peared with a can poured kerosene on
the pyre he lighted it with tears of mad-
ness and grief running down his face
then fury entered his heart and he
threw the rest of the kindling on the
obscene thing and drenched it with the
kerosene as the flames flared up he
danced around with grief and hatred and
insanity alternately writhing across his
features he ran back to the woodshed
for more fuel he was about to return
with a load of cordwood when he heard
the roar of a small explosion saw a foun-
tain of sparks and burning wood spew
into the air he stood agape for a sec-
ond then ran madly to the fires the
obscene monstrosity was no more-some-
thing in it or something it carried had
exploded and in two or three places
burning chunks smoldered on the farm-
house roof but lars paid no attention
to them or to the flames that were begin-
ning to lick at the eaves for some half-
forgotten thing was pounding at the back
of his thoughts

   the thing in the field the thing in
the field the phrase sang through his
head like a chant and he burst out into
another wild peal of maniacal laughter
he scarcely looked at the black smoke
that surged up from helgas funeral

pyre or the flames that consumed as he
turned and sped back to the pile of wood
he picked up all he could carry of the
three-foot lengths and stumbled down
the path staggering under the weight
when he reached the gash in earth
faintly illuminated by the red glare that
began to come from the burning roof of
the farmhouse he tossed his whole arm-
ful onto the invisible thing and shouted
madly again as the wood hung sus-
pended in air over the gap he returned
again and again until all the wood was
strewn around and over the thing that
could not be seen on his last trip he
brought two one-gallon cans of kerosene
and poured them on as much of the wood
as was within reach then tossed them to
the top of the pile and lighted the mass
a tongue of fire leaped out and raced
over the pile and a volume of thick
black smoke issued up the field around
him was already made bright by a lurid
glare from the farmhouse that was now
entirely ablaze like a necromancer
uttering his ritual of incantation and dark
sorcery lars leaped and danced and
howled around the great bonfire he had
built a tower of black smoke from the
kerosene mounted almost straight up in
the air from the flames the wood
crackled the heat became scorching and
blistering and under the metamorpho-
sis of fire lars saw a last strange riddle
shape itself before his eyes there were
outlines forming the suggestion of a
vast structure imbedded deeply in earth
he gibbered to the stars as he saw
planes and angles and cubes that looked
like spheres and the geometry of another
dimension his maniacal laughter rang
out again as he looked through the glow-
ing transparent walls and saw objects he
could not name strangely mounted
mechanical devices fantastic articles that
no mind on earth could have imagined or
shaped and lying around them were


weird tales

dozens of those hellish slimy things that
were neither animal nor vegetable nor
matter but partook loathsomely of the
nature of all three he shouted in mirth-
less glee as he glimpsed briefly still other
things-weird gaseous substances on the
floor that held dieir shape as rigidly as
dead bodies

  there came a hiss like a great sigh a
rumble of warning and lars insanely
flung his arms wide apart as if to em-
brace the cleansing fire it was his last
gesture for earth and sky and life
trembled and were blasted before the
titanic explosion that wiped out the thing
in the field

	a riddle of the stars

on the afternoon of march 
shortly after two p m larry
greene took off from the twin city fly-
ing-field with a special consignment of
bank dispatches for seattle his plane
was last seen at elk forks twenty miles
east of norton at approximately four
adock when nothing more was seen
of him for several hours and no report
was received the importance of his cargo
caused a searching-party to be sent out
early in the morning of march  his
airplane was found near the burned lo-
berg farmhouse  it was completely
smashed but the pilots body was no-
where around the searching-party con-
tinued to scour the area an hour later
the missing flyer was picked up wander-
ing in a dazed condition through a field
near norton his account of what had
happened was so singular and fantastic
that his sanity was questioned when
however he was discovered to be suffer-
ing badly from exposure he was immedi-
ately rushed to the twin cities for
medical attention all efforts to save his
life were unavailing he died of gan-
grenous infection several days later

among his effects were found two sig-
nificant items a black object and the
following extraordinary communication
which was apparently written sometime
during the first day of his confinement
for medical care

  to others i leave the task of deciding
whether i have been the victim of in-
sanity or hallucinations already i my-
self doubt the testimony of my own eyes
and ears if it were not for the disk
which i brought with me i would believe
the entire adventure to be a delusion or
a dream but unless the disk proves to be
a figment of a deranged imagination i
can not doubt the truth of what i have
to say and the reality of what i saw

  at two-ten p m on march  i
took off from the twin city flying-field
with a bundle of bank dispatches for
seattle i headed due west weather con-
ditions were fair for the first hour and i
kept at the relatively low flying level of
two thousand feet at this point some-
what less than one hundred miles from
the twin cities i was nearing a region
for which sleet or snow storms were fore-
cast cloud-banks were piling up ahead
so i immediately began to climb for alti-
tude the last town i saw was elk forks
after that the clouds below me obscured
everything

  i had climbed to she thousand feet
then seven thousand five hundred and
was now keeping to an altitude of nine
thousand feet i estimated that i must
now be nearing norton

  without a word of warning the ter-
ror came

  my plane was suddenly enveloped in
a greenish light the motor and propel-
ler droned but my progress was at a
complete standstill my altimeter showed
eleven thirteen fifteen thousand feet so
rapidly that i could hardly follow it
nothing i could do had any effect on the
something from above



plane or its incredible rise the sensa-
tion was sickening i had the motor wide
open but not a foot did we advance in-
stead the plane rose straight up like a
balloon i scarcely had time even to ad-
just my oxygen tank and turn on the cur-
rent for the air-tight electrically heated
suit that i always wear in cold weather
flying the altimeter soared to forty
thousand feet then froze

  everything had happened so instant-
ly diat i was almost stunned a few sec-
onds at most could have elapsed between
the moment the greenish light came and
the altimeter froze

  through my suit i began to feel an
intense cold i had no knowledge of how
high i now was but i knew that if my
strange ascent were not quickly halted i
would perish in the absolute or almost
absolute zero of the upper atmosphere
the motor now froze and went dead in-
stead of falling the airplane remained
in its unnatural suspension still bathed
in green light the sky above me had
become so dark that i was certain i must
be near the outer edge of earths at-
mospheric blanket the cold was more
piercing than ever

  at this moment i thought i heard
two faint clicks closely following each
other a few seconds later they were re-
peated the green light disappeared
overhead the stars went out the effect
was precisely as if i were looking through
an invisible pane of glass but could see
nothing and only a few feet away from
my plane there had suddenly appeared
the bodies of a dead man and a woman
the intense cold rapidly lessened in
severity but had it been a thousand times
as icy as it was it could not have been as
numbing as the strange horror of all that
had happened to me in a brief minute
i was in the midst of a hellish nightmare

infinitely more titanic and brain-shatter-
ing than any i had ever had the terror
and fear of nauseating mystery were upon
me i hardly knew whether i was dream-
ing or awake alive or already beyond die
borderland of death and those two
corpses hanging in the air near me-
their appearance was as ghastly as it was
inexplicable

  the whole thing was like a delirious
vision i felt as if i were confined the
terrific cold had ceased yet there was not
a star in the sky above me nor could i
see the earth beneath if it were not for
the airplane and the two bodies i would
have believed that i had gone blind

  i had hardly understood-or rather
realized my situation since i did not
understand it at all-when there came to
me again a faint click from above and
i automatically looked up

  i do not know what i expected to see
except anything or nothing but it was
no answer to any of the thousand ques-
tions in my mind that i saw but mystery
darker and deeper there was cloud
vapor a dozen feet above me-or was
there i have never before seen a gas-
eous substance hold its form and shape
rigidly but i did then and with a sick
faint feeling i realized that the doud-
iike thing was alive i had an impression
of eyes burning into mine but there were
no eyes visible in it my brain received
a command but my ears heard no sound
in some way that i could not compre-
hend the monstrous living substance
above me had put into my thoughts a
picture of myself climbing from the
cockpit and ascending

  climb from the cockpit of an air-
plane heaven knows how many miles
above earth it was madness suicide i
fought with all my strength to retain my
seat but i was powerless and slowly i
climbed over the side into empty space


weird tales

  i should have fallen down down like
a dead weight but i was standing as
upright as if solid ground were beneath
my feet where was the ultimate cold
that should be freezing me why did i
not fall what was the meaning of all
the eery events of the past few minutes
i was trembling violently hot and cold
sweat broke out on me a deadly fear
gnawed at my heart for the first time in
my life

  then i thought i must have entered
some queer hypnotic state for a sudden
feeling of peace came over me and in
answer to another silent command i
mounted what seemed to be a short lad-
der and stepped off a moment later to
another invisible floor the gaseous
thing retreated as i advanced and now
hung a few yards away from me but i
scarcely noticed it for my eyes were
bewildered by the sight around me and
a dim light of comprehension began to
clear away the fog over my thoughts

  masses of intricate gleaming machin-
ery and delicate mechanism were every-
where about me together with elaborate
dials controls and other devices whose
purpose i could not even conjecture
around each device and control were
grouped scores of the gaseous things i
dreamed for a ihoment that i was in an
airship of some new kind but there were
no enclosing walls and i could see no
floor beneath me yet the sky was de-
void of stars

  all this i noticed in a brief instant
before my captor mutely commanded me
to walk forward a few paces and seat my-
self too stunned and overwhelmed to
offer any resistance i did so the thing
drifted toward me and hung a few feet
away i looked at it and again i had an
impression of burning eyes that i could
not see but there came over me again
that odd sensation of peace

tt ow can i describe the strange ter-
xi ror and fascination of the scene
or what followed surely no man was
ever before so suddenly jerked from the
habits and thoughts of a lifetime as i was
then without my realizing it until after-
ward i must have been placed again
under hypnotic or mental control for the
mechanism and gaseous shapes surround-
ing me suddenly faded away into blank-
ness and then while i had the disem-
bodied feeling of one who dreams a suc-
cession of fantastic images and pictures
were imposed on my imagination by the
thing before me no word passed
between us for neither could have under-
stood the language of the other by a
kind of mesmeric thought-transference i
was made to understand all that had hap-
pened to me and some things i had not
known about and some of which i shall
probably never have any further knowl-
edge to certify their truth

  as i had begun to suspect i was now
in a space-flyer of utterly new type and
construction to me the being who hung
a few yards away was relelpa director
of an expedition from saturn on a mis-
sion that meant existence or death to the
solar system

  for thousands of years civilization
had been progressing there until the in-
habitants were now as far ahead of us as
we are ahead of jungle apes the life
force which is persistent everywhere in an
infinite variety of organisms produced on
saturn opaque gaseous substances like
relelpa many years before our meeting
these eery inhabitants of saturn had dis-
covered deep in the bowels of their
planet one of the rarest elements in all
the universe saturn itself contained only
a few thousand tons of the ore from
which this element seggglyn was ex-
tracted

  seggglyn resists cold even to absolute
zero but if exposed to sufficient heat it
something from above



explodes its most curious and most valu-
able property is its imperviousness to
gravitation for instance a lump of the
pure element isolated under an open sky
is immediately hurled skyward by the
centrifugal force of the spinning planet
since gravitation has no effect on it
until it finally breaks up into atomic
particles it hurtles forever through the
universe rebounding anew from any
gravitational pull which it may chance to
come near

   in extracting the element and in ex-
perimenting with it the saturnians not
only discovered how to control it but
obtained by-products of inestimable
value seggglyn is completely transpar-
ent but nothing beyond it is visible-as
if you looked through a pane of glass
but could see nothing beyond perhaps i
can make this clearer by saying that it is
like a blind spot if you put two black
dots on a cardboard hold the cardboard
at arms length focus your eyes on one
dot and then draw the cardboard toward
you one of the dots will disappear when
the cardboard is about a foot and a half
from your eyes well seggglyn acts like
a blind spot at any distance from the eye
of the beholder

   in extracting the element the sa-
turnians found that the last impurity re-
moved had the effect of counteracting the
element that is until the impurity was
taken out seggglyn was held by gravita-
tional attraction thus by putting the
impurity back in or coating seggglyn
with it the element had only normal
mineral properties

  there was only a limited amount of
the stuff on saturn and no trace of it
was ever found in the spectrum of any
star what should be done with it the
saturnians considered every possible use
and finally decided that it would be most
valuable as an offense and defense against
any danger and so they built this vast

space-flyer and armed it with all their
weapons and rays of destruction the
flyer could not be seen nor its location
guessed unless it crossed a star and shut
out the light

   on the outside of the flyer at one tip
were placed dozens of thin plates of the
impurity these were controlled by radio
from inside the ship they could be ad-
justed to any position on the outside so
that die ships speed could be regulated
and just enough gravitational pull shut
off or turned on to let the ship rise and
land safely

   with their space-flyer the saturnians
had explored the solar system hundreds
of years ago and had even ventured out
into the galaxy beyond for there was
apparently no limit to the speed which
it could attain if its rate of speed were
constant when it left the gravitational
influence of saturn it would keep on
going at that rate but if its speed were
controlled so that it was constantly in-
creasing at the point where it passed
beyond saturns influence its acceleration
would continue at the same rate and if
it were worth the risk a speed of hun-
dreds or thousands of light-years per
second could be reached

   after their early explorations and ex-
periments the saturnians kept the flyer
idle but always in readiness for any dan-
ger they had discovered many dis-
quieting matters on their trips but so
long as nothing happened they preserved
their policy of waiting in readiness

  and out of night with no warning
had suddenly come the one cataclysmic
danger that they had not anticipated
from their great central observatory the
saturnians kept up a constant survey of
the heavens for astronomic and protective
reasons one week the observation had
shown a normal view of the region of the
evening star and the next week stars
were disappearing momentarily in a


weird tales

straight line that travelled toward the
solar system

  they could not believe the explana-
tion but there was only one explanation
possible some star or world beyond the
reach of their farthest telescope had pos-
sessed the rare ore and a space-ship made
from seggglyn whether a scouting party
or an expedition of invaders was hourly
leaping colossal stellar distances toward
the solar system their surprize turned
almost into panic when they discovered
that instead of one there were three
space-flyers hurtling onward

  so short was the warning that des-
perate measures had to be taken hasty
calculations showed that the invaders
were heading toward earth first perhaps
to reconnoiter or to use earth as a rico-
chet for reaching saturn relelpa was
summoned to lead the party the need
of reaching earth before or not later
than the invaders was desperate it could
not be accomplished even with the nor-
mal acceleration of the saturnian space-
flyer in the crisis at the moment when
the nullifying plates were stripped from
the outside of the flyer saturns most
powerful explosive was used to hurl it
off in a blinding flash to give it the in-
itial acceleration required

  over earth they met and before the
invaders realized that their coming was
known the red annihilation ray of the
saturn flyer stabbed out and the first ship
from outside dissolved into brownish dust
that drifted down the red ray stabbed
out again but missed the second ship
which used some other means than black
plates of using gravitational pull as the
first and third also did had dropped sud-
denly to escape the deadly ray but the
ship behind it had also dived and crashed
into the tip of its own comrade and as
the bitter cold of space mowed down its
occupants the second ship hurtled to
earth some of its occupants spilled out

into space and from one of these who
was instantly caught and swept to the
saturn-flyer by the green magnetic ray
the story of the invaders was found out

  where they came from is unknown
for their world lies beyond any galaxy or
nebula known to astronomers of the
solar system they too had discovered
seggglyn on their world and had dis-
covered it at the last moment for their
world was dying and had almost reached
its end with their super-telescopes they
had found traces of seggglyn in the
spectrum of saturn long before it was
isolated on their own world time was
priceless to these gruesome plant-animal-
mineral creatures from the spaces beyond
they had built three ships but these
were not enough to transport all the in-
habitants of their world before the end
came if they could obtain the ore from
saturn and build two more ships or even
one great flyer they would be saved

  and so the three flyers started out
each loaded with a thousand of the
loathly creatures one ship was to land
on the most habitable of the planets
earth and wipe out all life on it with
the violet ray of terrific heat and the
yellow ray that blasted anything it
touched the other two were to dis-
gorge on saturn and while one band
destroyed the inhabitants the other would
extract seggglyn from the ore and build
as many ships as possible as soon as the
three flyers had landed they were to re-
turn to their world empty except for the
crews to man them in order to bring
back other thousands of the loathsome
obscene things

  and their hellish plan would have
succeeded if they had not neglected one
possibility they thought that the satur-
nians were unaware of the property of
seggglyn and that the ore was still un-
mined or that in any case their own
three space-flyers would prove to be in-
something from above



vincible ahd so all unprepared in the
very moment of their triumph the
strength of the invaders was cut down by
two-thirds

  but now the third ship was warned
and all this day the saturn-flyer had been
engaged with it in a struggle on which
the fate of worlds depended if the sa-
turnians were defeated earth and saturn
were doomed even though the invaders
were unable to save all the inhabitants of
their own world by transporting them
across space

  relelpa showed me a great metallic
disk on which the heavens were mir-
rored since those inside the flyer could
see nothing outside television was neces-
sarily employed for guidance and there
close to the center of the disk which
marked our position i saw stars blotted
out where the invaders hung

  what can i do why do you want
me were the two silent questions that i
asked relelpa and the answer came back
there was nothing i could do up here
relelpa had sighted my airplane and
ordered it picked up by the green ray he
had told me all he wanted to and i was
now about to be released to warn the
people of my world in the event that the
saturnians were defeated

  i had no will-power of my own beside
this mental giant i merely followed his
directions it would have been fatal to
try using my airplane at this height and
my parachute would probably have ripped
from my shoulders with the force and
speed of my fall when it finally opened
relelpa gave me a curious black disk
when he read my thoughts and again by
mental image showed me how to use it

  suddenly he flashed me the image
that the final desperate battle was near
at the same instant he thrust me toward
the outer chamber through which i had
originally entered i saw his strange
cloud-like form for the last time i felt

him wish me good luck as i in turn
wished him success and jthen the door
clicked behind me i held the disk over
my head manipulating it as he had ex-
plained so that parts of the black cover-
ing slid off the seggglyn i heard another
click and then all at once i dropped
and my airplane twisted past me hurtling
downward and after it the bodies of the
two people who had been on earth in the
path of the green ray when its magnetic
power picked me up sped by me and
behind them the hideous monster which
the saturnians had captured

  as i fell slowly still feeling as if i
had dreamed a horrible nightmare i
looked above me and my eyes went wide
when i saw red and green ray flashing
against yellow and violet beam surely
it was the strangest and most important
battle ever witnessed by man sometimes
all four rays darted and flamed out some-
times only one or two or both rays of
one flyer would vanish only to reappear
suddenly in another spot

  i heard the wind whistle past me i
looked at earth far below and a great
fear took hold of me but i was falling
no faster than i would be with a para-
chute and the mental picture of relelpa
came back to reassure me

  once more i looked upward i saw
only the red and the green rays leaping
madly across the sky in a paean of victory
-the battle was won   

  the doctor tells me that gangrene has
set in i guess i was more seriously
frozen than i thought in those upper
spaces they think i am crazy and they
wont believe what i tried to tell them
last night maybe i am crazy but i swear
that i saw all the things i have written
of as plainly as i see now my hospital
cot or the skylight above me or the black
disk under my pillow well that ought
to convince them if nothing else does

weird tales

	the black disk

underneath the pillow of the cot on
which larry greene had died a
small disk was found the nurse who
discovered it looked at it in some curios-
ity puzzled as to its purpose and won-
dering what to do with it finally she
called the doctor who had vainly tried to
save the pilots life

  what is it he bruskly inquired
thats just it i dont know she an-
swered i found this on mr greenes
cot what shall i do with it

  the doctor took the object and scru-
tinized it closely it was a black disk
slightly oval in shape and approximately
a foot in diameter it was perfectly flat
with an unvarying thickness of a half-

inch on two sides it was indented and
at each indentation was a row of tiny
knobs

 hmm mused the doctor ive
never seen anything quite like it he
fingered the knobs meditatively

  there was a faint click and the black
covering of the disk somehow seemed to
slide off or collapse and all at once he
found himself with nothing in his hands
he heard a sudden wind the crash of
shattered glass a sound like the rush
of air

  the dumfounded doctor looked at an
amazed nurse as bits of glass from the
broken skylight dropped around them
the black disk which they had been
examining a few seconds ago had van-
ished

a dream of bubastis

          by harvey w flink

         i dreamt i stood before a shrine of bast

        and harkened to the piping of her flutes

        whilst in the dusk two ethiopian mutes

        came through the granite gates and bound me fast

        they laid me on an altar-stone and fled
        like shadows from the hall and in my dream
        i heard above the flutes a wailing scream

        and saw the goddess with the feline head

        i groaned and in the censers golden smoke
        i watched her lift her black enormous paws

        she tore my flesh with gleaming agate claws
        until with sweat upon my brow i woke   

        and knew that in the dawn a creature sat
        sphinx-like upon my chest it was a cat

haines the shorter and stouter
built of the two men hoarsely as he
stared at the two-mile stretch of placid
water fully five hundred feet below them

  its a slice of luck and by the look
of these walls its a miracle if we ever
get down to it replied the tall spare
elkins as he craned his head farther over
the edge of the huge wall to obtain a
better view of it

  well we got to make it said haines
relapsing into his natural slow stolid
manner of speech

  sure well make it-this blasted wall
cant go on forever without a break
growled his partner as his gaze returned
longingly to the silvery shimmering sur-
face that lay fully a mile or more distant
yet by reason of their elevation seemingly
so dose to them

  in all the four days of their crossing
the desolate plateau the scarcity of water
had been their great trouble hardship

them even in the stifling heat of the air-
less hollows or the roasting hell of the
open where a million facets of glassy rock
reflected the molten shafts of a flaming
sun that ceaselessly assailed them or
nights when they had shivered in the bit-
ing chill when the rocks crackled and
rang in contraction as the temperature
dropped maybe sixty degrees in an hour
after sundown and the plateau sloughed
the heat it had bathed in for fire had
been denied them there being never a
twig or a blade of grass in all that im-
mense desolation so for four days never
a morsel of cooked food or hot cheering
mate had passed their lips and a little

all they had to sustain them an occa-
sional trickle of seepage in the depths of
a canyon had just held life in them and
sustained their determination to reach a
spot from which it would again be pos-
sible to resume their search for the treas-
ure that had brought them deep into the
trackless and totally unknown regions of
the northern andes

  it was just a tale they heard in

froth that stained the pallid lips of the
dying derelict to the two hard-eyed ad-

eased his last hours of the misery of lone-
liness and poverty just a few faint chok-
ing words that had sent them hurrying
into the storm-swept savagery of the
top of the world as the peruvians so
aptly term the immense range that
frowns down on the pacific shelf where
alone maps are anything but mere waste
paper to the traveler in that great wilder-
ness a tale of wandering in the wilds
far to the north and coming on a tribe
of nomadic natives who had offered for
sale a dozen or so small rubies which
they stated now and again they found
inside the migrating waterfowl that broke
their passage south by alighting in a
small near-by lake the tribe frequented
he had purchased them for the price of
a blanket and later turned them over for
the price of a weeks spree in a filthy
drinking-tavern of a coastal town but
he knew something of such things and
affirmed there was no doubt whatever of
their identity and value and held the
natural conclusion that somewhere north
of that lake hidden in the huge hills
there lay another stretch of water in
whose gravel beaches there might lie a
fortune for the lucky discoverer

  so as though there was only one
course open to them they had come to
pienta arenas where he had made the
purchase and from there they had struck

fearlessly into the heart of the vast range
that towered above this last outpost of
almost savage humanity

  that odyssey might seem worthy of a
modern homers epic to them it was
the merest commonplace of existence
through frightful almost impassable
passes across soaring cloud-wreathed
summits piercing appalling canyons fol-
lowing foaming creeks whose wild wa-
ters vanished in veils of mist down depths
lost in obscurity always on and on the
two men foot by foot fought their way
ever northward creek after creek was
panned without a trace of treasure to re-
ward and inspire their labors neverthe-
less each failure meant no more than that
another creek could be abandoned and
but narrowed the ground yet to be cov-
ered before that last flow would direct
them to the source of the waiting fortune

  then they had come upon this im-
mense plateau and as they dropped down
to it lying several thousand feet below
the average fifteen thousand they had ar-
rived at there could just be discerned
another range of high peaks far in the
haze of the distance and they reckoned
fifty miles would barely span the cross-
ing to them and to this range the urge
of the unknown the lure of wealth the
spirit of high adventure-all drove them
irresistibly forward

  that this plateau had been the scene
of enormous convulsions was unmistak-
able for deep rents and crevices mean-
dered and crisscrossed in every direction
crags and sheer bluffs of a totally alien
nature dotted it and millions of great
boulders were profusely strewn over its
every acre

  of course such rock-wise men as el-
kins and haines could not fail to note
that the glassy vitreous surface of the
canyons faces of bluffs and many boul-
ders evidenced the fiery breath that eons
past had scorched the solid rock as though
the primeval pit



it was brown paper but as rubies like
most other gems are born in the anguish
of inconceivable heat in spite of the toil
and privation the crossing entailed the
two men endured it with fortitude and
even regarded the desolation with some
favor

  yet in four days by well-nigh incred-
ible labor they had not crossed the half
of it though from a high bluff they had
come to the conclusion that the plateau
was considerably wider than they had
first estimated then just before sun-
down of the fourth day they reached the
edge of the huge abyss for no other word
could convey a correct impression of the
great depth and sheer walls that enclosed
that enormous depression

  quite suddenly a canyon they had been
following had fallen away into the void
of empty space and coming to the edge
of that nothingness and peering over
they found themselves gazing in speech-
less wonder at what was apparently
another world altogether hundreds of
feet below billow after billow of dense
forests covered the undulating bottom of
a vast depression whose opposite wall
was so distant that even from their eleva-
tion it could be discerned only as a nar-
row shadowy ribbon whose ends mean-
dered into haze and invisibility exactly
below lay the silver blue of a small lake
and other gleaming patches in the distance
seemed to denote that a considerable
stream widening into basins flowed di-
agonally across though the extreme
length could be marked only by the sum-
mits of ranges enclosing them

  it was as marvelous as a mirage im-
mense a paradise of delight after the
setting of desolation and sterility the star-
ing men had fought with for days and
for men who had hardly more than wet
their parched throats in the last twenty-
four hours

  yet elkins who by nature was a born

scientist and indeed possessed a fair de-
gree of geological learning had at once
stared shrewdly at the frowning walls
where prominent buttresses rendered
them visible and in his hardly conscious
mutter probably summed the matter very
closely a huge fault in the strata-a
bad jolt-and down she drops in a solid
chunk while the molten stuff below is
squeezed each side and lifts the hills a
trifle then haines whose eyes had no
concern with anything save the water
had broken in on his musings and he too
became absorbed in the problem of reach-
ing it and after a little vain peering de-
cided that whether they followed the
crest east or west the descent was a pure
gamble and likely a very hazardous one

very soon the sun sliding below the
horizon they were turning to seek
shelter in the canyon from a chill night
air that commenced to flow over the
bluffs edge and elkins delaying a sec-
ond to stare thoughtfully into the gather-
ing dusk suddenly cried sharply look
tom what sort of birds are those and
haines whipping around was just in
time to catch a glimpse of the last winged
thing as it vanished into the forest

  the sam hill they must be as large
as ostriches why at that distance a con-
dor would seem no bigger than a spar-
row he exclaimed in some astonish-
ment

  and there was at least half a dozen
of them - i just noted them as they
crossed the narrow neck explained el-
kins referring to the western end of the
waters where it dwindled to a fourth its
middle width but after all i reckon
its the half light on die water sort of
balls things up for dieres no birds that
big in all south america he asserted
with careless conviction

  thats so agreed haines but likely
theyre big waterfowl anyway and with


weird tales

luck well have roast bird tomorrow he
added very contentedly and so the mat-
ter was dismissed as a quite insignificant
happening

  for some time in the cold starlight the
two men sat smoking and talking of this
amazing depression mainly from the
angle of its chancing to prove the source
of the waterfowls discovery for un-
doubtedly such an expanse of water
would tempt the birds to break their pas-
sage across the sterile ranges and in spite
of the bitter cold of night the gnawing
of hunger-for the last morsel of dried
meat had vanished that morning-and
the bite of thirst they were highly elated
and made light of their discomfort

  shall we chance it queried elkins
staring down gravely at the hundred foot
drop that yet separated them from the
rubble slope that fringed the walls bot-
tom

  damned if i know joe-one slip
would end a guys thirst for keeps re-
plied haines slowly yet it looks like
its this drop or nothing he added
thoughtfully

  now it was noon and the molten sun
had heated the shadeless rocks to a pitch
when a careless touch meant a seared cu-
ticle and the green shade so close to them
seemed an unbelievable heaven

                        

  since dawn they had followed the
crest first to the east then to the west-
ward and the endless ravines and can-
yons opening out into this vast depres-
sion had made the going slow and
infinitely laborious at last they had
returned to the only spot where they
deemed descent was in the least feasible
a gully that cut into the wall far deeper
than any they had discovered no more
than a hundred feet was the height of its
last great step which ended in a slope of
jagged rubble where nothing but clumps
of tough dwarf scrub could find nutrition
yet-with luck-it was possible for its

face was broken with many fairly wide
shelves and much of the rock was
threaded with seams and crevices that a
desperate man by the grace of fortune
might lower himself by here and there
undoubtedly would be spots where he
must drop and trust to keeping his bal-
ance on a shelf below but still it was
barely possible and already the torment
of the fire of thirst was weakening them
and they knew that shortly this last chance
would be closed to nerves and muscles
sapped of their virility

  thati the way i size it-well take
a chance said elkins with quick deci-
sion for by unspoken consent in any cru-
cial matter the final word seemed ever to
rest with the speaker but well lash the
blankets about the pack before we sling
them over-though we darent chance the
guns that way and after some peering
over and discussion of the line of their
descent they lashed both packs the pans
and cooking-ware in the center around
with blankets and made one bundle of
them with a dull sound it hit the rub-
ble and bounded to the slopes foot

  hope that billy aint busted said
haines anxiously and in a moment the
two men a few feet apart were careful-
ly though coolly lowering themselves
over a drop that spelt instant and horrible
destruction if a hand failed to hold or a
fragment of stone came away in its clutch-
ing fingers

  well thats that said elkins cheer-
fully as his partner dropped the last doz-
en feet of sheer rock face to the slope he
stood on

  and its a sure thing nothing but a
fly could make it back again said the
new arrival breathing heavily for his
solid build had felt the severe strain
more than his partners steel sinews and
his statement was by no means a grim
exaggeration for in a couple of places
high up the wall face had lacked a single
the primeval pit



niche for a finger and they had been com-
pelled to chance a drop of many feet to
a ledge beneath and on one of these
occasions but for haines herculean arm
elkins would have failed to recover his
balance and swayed backward into space
- but that was all in the game and
neither spoke nor thought any more of it

a hasty examination relieved their
anxiety of damage to their hard-
ware which seemed to concern them
much more than the daring skill of their
descent and quickly shouldering the
packs they commenced to make their way
along the rubble slope to the lake which
lay about a couple of miles distant the
sun beat full upon the towering wall and
the heat in the narrow passage between
it and the tall forest was as stifling as an
airless boiler room with the furnace gates
wide open but a thorny jungle fringed
and invaded the still depths and it would
have been an arduous waste of precious
time to pierce this barrier so doggedly
they went on through the heat and rough
going with their thoughts entirely cen-
tered on the mighty reward awaiting
them yet now and again they thought
they heard the tinkling of running water
in die distance and by its persistence ar-
rived at the conclusion that a large creek
must be running lakeward

  by careful note of some projecting
spurs and massive bosses from the heights
above diey had little difficulty in deciding
where they must strike into the forest to
hit the lake and with much labor and
swearing broke through the rim of jun-
gle which here had greatly narrowed
and entered the forest proper and even in
their exhausted and water-famished con-
dition they could not avoid noting the
strangeness of some of the great growths
which here and there they met in almost
isolated clumps and single specimens
amid the usual rank growths of a tropic

forest before one unusually large growth
elkins halted for a moment and sur-
veying it with a puzzled frown exclaimed
hoarsely these trees are queer - look
at this joker ever seen anything like it
tom he asked irritably as one tired of
marvels and impatient of yet having to
observe diem

  it aint a beauty acknowledged
haines severely regarding the tree
looks like it was as old as satan and a
damned heap more wicked he added
with increasing disfavor

  and indeed the strange giant had a
most forbidding exterior for its immense
bole that was lost in the green canopy
fully a hundred feet above them was
covered with large horn-like scales that
rose in their centers to sharp dark-hued
points that bore a striking resemblance to
the poisoned talon on the end of the tail
of a scorpion sharp curved and shad-
ing to a glistening black they possessed
a most repellent and vicious appearance
and very evidently would be wicked
things for any flesh that brushed against
them while to add to the suspicion of
latent hostility the thing aroused in die
observer each horny scale had a straggly
fringe of coarse gristly hairlike threads
drooping from its edges and thinly veil-
ing it its foliage was invisible but
crooked scaly limbs could be made out in
the dim light overhead truly the thing
was abnormal an enigma and entirely
distasteful to the two who stared at it as
though something hoary unnatural and
incredibly aged had stepped from the
abortions of the primeval and come to
poison a gentler creation with its fierce
malice and foulness

  curious muttered elkins as though
thinking aloud diere was once-hell
diats a crazy notion say lets get a
move on my throats burning up for a
moudiful of water

  and thereafter they paid no attention


weird tales

  to other like growths and still others fan-
  tastic and unnatural but not so markedly
  unlovely that they met with but one
  peculiarity of these strange growths had
  a profound bearing on the partners
  fortunes for oddly there was but little
  underbrush where they flourished and
  almost involuntarily the mens steps in-
  clined from their course to avail them-
  selves of the clearings this accounted
  for their striking the lake near its center
  instead of at the narrow neck they aimed
  for likely this saved their lives for
  unwitting of the deadly peril they had
  come into most probably their bodies
  would have been slashed to ribbons be-
  fore they realized the savage nature of
  the winged brutes that swooped down on
  them

    both were stretched full length on a
 shelf of flat rock that almost level with the
 lakes surface reached some yards out
 into a shallow and each man was gulp-
 ing great drafts of elixir as though he
 would drink on forever behind them
 lay a narrow strip of pinky quartz out-
 cropping that rimmed the lake for some
 way each side of them behind that lay a
 dense thicket of stout growths much the
 size and appearance of northern alders

 elkins was the first to hear the dull
 beat of heavy wings approaching
 looking up he stared in the direction the
  sound came from which was to westward
 of the narrow neck they had thought to
 hit

    say tom he exclaimed just look
 at this bunch will you fresh meat sure
 enough--but what the devil are they
 and haines raising his head from drink-
 ing stared also at the flying things that
 about a quarter of a mile away were com-
 ing at a great speed toward them though
 the odd powerful wings beat so slowly
 that their passage seemed more the swoop
 of a hawk than an effort of their wings

  what sort of birds are they cried
haines in amazement unless my eyes
are on the blink im blessed if they got a
feather on them

  and as he spoke a duck rose squawk-
ing from the surface right in front of
the strange things and made off at full
speed for a bed of reeds there came a
downward drive by one brute a little
ahead of his companions an enormous
beak gaped and in a flash had closed on
the fleeing bird that was all there was
no more to be seen of the duck than there
is of a midge snapped up by a bat

  by - cried elkins blankly

whats this bolt a duck at a mouthful
say these brutes are making for us
quick tom beat it to the bush those
beaks could slash a limb off

  luckily these were men accustomed to
quick decision and instant action but at
that they reached cover a few yards away
not a second too soon for in spite of
their deliberate movement of wing which
afforded a false impression they came up
at an immense pace and the two men
had no more than burst into the shelter
of a grove of thick - foliaged lesser
growths that for some distance here
fringed the giants beyond when the thud
of the wings of the foremost brutes was
above them and the air resounded with
harsh loud cries of bestial savagery

  peering out through the stout stems
they saw the brutes withdraw a little
and after some fluttering about the edge
of the water arise to a hundred feet or
so and there more slowly pass backward
and forward like pointers quartering a
covert but the little time they hovered
had sufficed to show the amazed watchers
the extraordinary appearance these things
presented and the fact that they bore not
the least resemblance to any species of
bird they had ever seen or heard of-if
bird they could be called for save in
possessing wings and beaks there lay no
the primeval pit



feature that could be identified as falling
certainly into that classification rather
were they the abortions that alcohol-
crazed victims screaming flee from

  great featherless hairless monsters
with angular ungainly bodies not less
than five or six feet long ending in short
thick legs with long clawed feet that
seemed covered with homy plates above
long snaky necks ending in blunt thick
heads that without a break ran into enor-
mous beaks nearly a third of their body
in length thick wide sharp-pointed and
it seemed as though the edges were deep-
ly serrated one glance was enough to
realize that these would be terrible weap-
ons quite capable of stabbing and slash-
ing a strong man to ribbons and their
wings with their full fifteen-foot stretch
like a dirty brown parchment in hue and
texture leathery stuff through which
ridges of bone and gristle were plainly
visible and what looked like a couple of
long curved talons on the outer edge
these things were all in the picture the
astounded men stared at to the greasy
sickening flapping of their monstrous
wings the brutes were horrible crude
and brutal beyond expression as was the
strong rank odor as of putrid meat that
saturated the air with its filthiness on
their first close onslaught

  dont shoot tom said elkins quick-
ly as he laid a restraining hand on his
partners upflung arm and gun better
save our shells-we may need them no
saying how many of these hell-fired
things roost in this pit and maybe therell
be trouble getting clear of it

  but what are these damned things
i never heard tell of the like of them
they aint birds thats certain growled
haines as he blankly stared at the last
one flap along the lakes edge and beyond
his range of vision

  theyve got me guessing confessed

elkins there was once- he com-

   w t-

menced then broke off short and impa-
tiently muttered but thats just crazi-
ness and continued we just got to
take the facts as we find them-weve run
up against some sort of brutes we never
heard of but theyre facts and there aint
a doubt in the world but any one of those
queer things could rip a guy up easy as
look at him and seemingly theyre par-
tial to living meat we saw ten of them
-lord only knows how many more of
the breed there may be around us i tell
you tom i dont fancy the look of
things he added thoughtfully

  no i aint stuck on the uglies my-
self said haines simply seems to me
one of us must stand sentry any time we
fossick around in the open and keeping
close to cover i reckon we wont get hurt
any suggested haines in the matter-of-
fact tone in which one would discuss the
most commonplace occurrence for his
solid unimaginative nature was quite con-
tent to accept the evidence of his senses
without troubling overmuch whether it
offended common sense or the common
interpretation of such

a little while they quietly listened
to the flapping wings as in ever
widening circles the brutes slowly drifted
away from them and shortly the sound
died away in the distance then they
came to the woods edge and after care-
fully scanning the vicinity commenced
to make their way cautiously eastward
about the lakes edge but now though
refreshed by the water they suffered
much from hunger for no more than a
handful or so of raw beans had they
eaten in the last two days however
luck was now with them and in a nar-
row sheltered slough they flushed a large
waterfowl from its nest in the reeds in-
stantly elkins had cut its head off with a
-bore bullet after the report had
ceased to shatter the breathless silence


weird tales

for a moment they heard a distant harsh
screaming but it ceased abruptly and
nothing further happening very quickly
a smokeless blaze had the hastily skinned
bird scorching over it that and a billy
of steaming mate made new men of
them and as the day was far spent and
the spot snug for camping they decided
to go no farther but have a long night
in and start with completely restored
vigor at dawn they had little fear of
being attacked during the night as they
were satisfied that the brutes being un-
embarrassed by the midday sun would
not likely be abroad in the darkness
nevertheless they agreed to take turn
about in watching and sleeping

  as dusk descended the hush and peace
that surrounded them seemed as perfect
and innocuous as a new england coun-
tryside on a summer sundown it was
hard to believe that but an hour or two
back seconds only had separated them
from the ghastly death that had descend-
ed like a whirlwind with strange terrible
shapes astride it but though the men
contentedly smoking by the firelight
might have been no more than a couple
of camping fishermen enjoying a well-
earned vacation yet each man was im-
mersed in a train of thought that fisher-
men would scarcely indulge in

  haines thoughts ran all on a ledge he
had marked as worthy of close examina-
tion and elkins whose ideas ranged
farther and were always seething with
speculative queries and delvings was full
of a brilliant invention for minting hard
cash out of the weird abortions that had
assailed them

  see here tom he exclaimed as the
thought boiled over i wouldnt wonder
but the hide of one of those brutes might
be worth a tidy few dollars if we toted
it back to the coast - those highbrow
museums just eat up such things

  what the hide of a blasted thing like

that said haines in surprize but as he
had a great respect for his partners more
nimble gray matter he added more hope-
fully and can you put a figure to it
joe

  a figure well i dunno exactly but
i do call to mind that some old bones of
a beast dead thousands of years ago
fetched well into four figures replied
elkins thoughtfully as he recalled some
odd paragraph he had come on in his
omnivorous reading for when opportu-
nity offered he had an insatiable thirst
for devouring every scrap of information
on the natural sciences he could assim-
ilate from periodicals and other sources
adapted to the needs of the layman

  four figures echoed haines oh
thats another matter then if lucks
against us well shoot up the whole ca-
boodle and start in the hide and bone
business say maybe theres a bunch
more of those uglies hell i hope
theres a thousand he exclaimed enthu-
siastically the prospect of such good for-
tune overriding any doubt of success as
he stared out into the starlit water as
though trusting to see there an immedi-
ate response to his rapacious ambition
and even elkins who in spite of his
imagination was a very shrewd reasoner
and clearly saw the many obstacles to be
overcome caught a little of his enthu-
siasm moreover though the precious
metals and gems were the main motif of
their existence yet the exigency of living
had interested them in oil orchids feath-
ers rubber and even the hides of devils
if thereby they came by hard cash to for-
ward their search for el dorado

haines was sleeping and elkins
standing the first sentry go when
the night commenced to unbosom itself
of strange loud noises that seemingly
had their source far to the westward
where the lake greatly narrowed and the
the primeval pit



winged things had vanished wonder-
ingly he had listened to a hoarse cough-
ing bellow that spilled itself suddenly
into the stillness the sound allowing
for the distance was of preposterous vol-
ume like that of a dozen wrath-inflamed
bull challenges rolled into one it ceased
then in a moment broke out afresh and
now another great throat was adding its
quota to the hollow reverberations that
came booming through the darkness as
he nudged haines the sounds abruptly
hurled themselves into each other in a
typhoon blast of savagery

  what in sam hill is this cried the
awakened man as he leapt to his feet
hells a-popping out there-they must
be bull elephants or dragons belike mix-
ing it i never heard such a rumpus he
declared as beside elkins he strode from
the fire and at the waters edge stood star-
ing into the shapeless blur of the distance

  dragons growled elkins harshly
and in his voice lay a curious recognition
of an appropriate word just discovered
dragons-maybe thats a better guess
than you reckon he muttered half to
himself anyhow i aint sorry the length
of the water lays between us and those
scrapping devils and it strikes me tom
this blasted pit is all loco what say
shall we up stakes and beat it in the
morning and as he spoke there be-
came audible the crash of rending wood
fibers crackling like far-away gunfire and
the most hideous monstrous snarling that
could be imagined

  my- cried haines whatever

they are they must be as large as houses
at this distance what sounds like dry
sticks must surely be real big timber being
busted-what sort of land is this weve
got to

  i dunno replied elkins savagely
but there aint a doubt wed better get
out of it i reckon we would be no more
than humming-birds to beasts like those

scrappers just listen to that will you
he broke off suddenly silenced by the
enormity of the huge scream of brute
agony that seeped the air with its poig-
nant passion and swept the very skies
with a titanic wrath and malign protest
at the torture it suffered then as a light
blown out it ceased and a silence as-
sailed the listeners a silence that seemed
even more filled with frightful things

  after waiting awhile but no further
uproar arising they returned to the fire
and shortly elkins was slumbering as
peacefully as a babe in its mothers arms

the dawn and a hearty though single-
coursed breakfast found them not so
set on quitting or at any rate the matter
was by tacit agreement left in abeyance
though they resolved to exercise the great-
est caution in their movements but
what sort of monsters they might have to
deal with they could not conceive there-
fore being not unduly loquacious men
they wasted no time in idle discussion

  with guns ready at half cock and
every sense keyed to highest pitch they
resumed their passage along the waters
edge here and there one or the other
would pick at the numerous outcroppings
or wash a pan or two of gravel from the
banks or shingle beaches but though
everywhere they found fine gold yet
there was never a sign of crimson stone
nor was the gold heavy enough to work
with profit

  nevertheless the ground was sufficient-
ly interesting to raise their hopes to a
pitch of anticipation that almost blinded
them to the extraordinary nature of the
creatures they had run up against for
these were men of the breed who dare
everything and would challenge all the
might of hell itself if it opposed the in-
satiable craving that obsessed their reck-
less determination

  as they had shrewdly suspected there


weird tales

could be no doubt but that in some by-
gone age a great river had swept through
this country and the placid lake was the
last remnant of its greatness for every-
where lay the evidence of gravel deposits
and naked outcropping of eroded rock
rising in low ridges above and between
the imprisoned detritus just as the play
of flood and drought had filled the
chasms and scoured the rock crests free
of the burden the flow had for untold
ages laid on them numerous small
creeks had also furrowed the deposits
with deep gashes at the lower extrem-
ity of the lake they came upon a twenty-
foot-wide overflow gliding and vanish-
ing into the gloom and tangle of the for-
est depths so it was very probable that
a similar stream emptied itself into the
lake at the upper narrow end

  it was as they neared this upper end
that elkins had discovered in his pan
three tiny crimson fragments-the merest
grains almost microscopic but under a
pocket glass indisputably revealed as the
lure that had driven them through the
vast ranges and into this lonely land of
nightmare creations

   that settles it declared the finder
triumphantly all the devils from hell
may be hidden in there but im going
through with it after all two s
arent a bad liile of argument to meet
any sort of damned brute with

  though unvoiced as they drew closer
they had viewed with distrust and query
what was apparently the haunt of the
savage winged creatures and the scene of
the fierce uproar in the night of the
former they had no particular concern
for they could not free themselves of the
impression that in spite of their weird
appearance and savagery the things were
simply extraordinary birds and as such
could hardly be reckoned as menacing
assailants moreover so long as cover
was handy and a sharp lookout main-

tained they could easily evade an attack
by them but the brutes that had fought
so savagely and rent the very night with
their frightful uproar and splintered
trees as though they were no more than
brittle reeds-these things were another
matter for there could be no shadow of
doubt but such brutes must be enormous
and terrible antagonists true they were
inconceivable incomprehensible mon-
sters without name or history neverthe-
less that did not make them any the less
solid and menacing facts and likely as
not one might as well wear brown paper
as the armor of dauntless courage when
dealing with such gigantic savagery and
these men were neither fools nor movie
heroes but merely iron-souled prospec-
tors accustomed in the ordinary routine
of their business to take many a long
chance in the gamble with death

  but those tiny crimson grains had in-
stantly turned distrust into indifference
and as elkins had recklessly declared the
forest might be a hive of escaped devils
but that wouldnt hinder him from en-
tering it and haines growling his ap-
proval of the sentiment without hesita-
tion they resumed their panning and
passed steadily on to whatever might be
awaiting them

   here the lake was no more than a half-
mile wide and rapidly narrowing to the
end about a like space distant the out-
croppings were now rising into knolls
and low bluffs that invaded and vanished
in the fringing groves and the banks of
gravel descended to rubble beaches in
sheer drops that topped the heads of the
treasure-seekers now gravely exultant
for pan after pan held in its crescent res-
idue more of the crimson grains now
coarser and to be identified by the naked
eye as small rubies it was plain that
somewhere beyond lay the storehouse that
had spilled these minute fragments of
its treasure abroad
the primeval pit



   suddenly haines called excitedly see
here joe-thats more like it and held
out the pan to elkins who had been
standing impatiently inactive as they had
agreed that only one of them should pros-
pect while the other kept guard for assail-
ants and haines being the more adroit
and faster in handling his pan had per-
formed most of the washing after the
first little grains had delighted them

  yes said elkins enthusiastically
that sure is a pretty sight for sore eyes

  his hand dipped into the shallow pan
and picked out a little fragment the size
of a small white bean and the blood
crimson of its fiery depths glowing as a
living spirit through the unpolished vit-
reous surface proclaimed certainly its
perfection and value even in that little
stone lay many a days provender and
simple luxuries for the finder

  thats the start of- began

haines but never finished the sentence
for a yell from elkins snapped it short

  look out tom-heres another of
those devils he shouted in urgent warn-
ing and before haines had time to move
a finger he saw his companions rifle flick
to his shoulder and upward and as the
crash of the instant explosion shattered
the deathly stillness and echoed from the
wall of forest a dark mass not fifty feet
above them with thrashing wings shot
past and over the water

  got him between the eyes cried
elkins jubilantly see hes falling
curse the blasted thing he added in
bitter triumph as a hundred feet away
the ungainly evil-looking beast suddenly
went into a spinning headlong dive for
a second it righted itself then dropped
and with a hollow crash hit the water
a vast convulsion of flailing leathery
wings sent the foam flying in clouds and
almost hid it from the watching men
then something happened that left them

breathless with amazement and staring
blankly at each other

  what was that did you see it joe
-or am i crazy said haines slowly as
he turned to stare again at the heaving
water where not a sign of the stricken
brute was visible and only the speeding
ripples were evidence of what had hap-
pened and the monstrous nightmare
thing they had seen rise above the sur-
face and engulf what had lain there

  crazy echoed elkins angrily no
but it will be a miracle if we both aint
before we get quit f this blasted pit
for weve struck a land where nightmare
shapes are solid things and ordinary
facts aint got a leg to stand on crazy
no we aint crazy its old father time
has got balled up in his bean and spewed
out things that aint got no right to be
living of course its all crazy-but

by- its facts cried elkins harshly

and haines listened not at all understand-
ing what his partner was driving at

   what youre spilling i aint got a no-
tion joe but i do know that all the
gems in this hell-fired hole wouldnt make
me cross that water why a guy would
need a six-inch gun to tackle that unholy
dragon-i thought such things were kept
special for booze-soaked guys and fairy-
tales replied haines as with a dazed
troubled stare he still regarded the heav-
ing water

  well this is how i size it up-but i
reckon we might as well get under cover
and have a bite while we palaver said
elkins turning to enter the grove of les-
ser growths that ribboned the wall of
giant forest

a little way in they seated them-
selves on some mossy boulders by
design opposite each other so as to com-
mand a view in every direction and eat-
ing from a billy of cold boiled beans
elkins gave his view of the conundrum
i

weird tales

  well i reckon youll think im bugs
or dreaming but it aint no crazier than
what weve seen said elkins lighting
his pipe after a hasty meal at which no
fire was lighted in case it might betray
them to unknown monsters right here
i reckon were in a tight comer and well
have to keep our eyes skinned if we want
to get clear of it but were on the track
of a fortune and im damned if i quit
without a try for it - aint that right
tom he gravely asked his partner

  sure thats me replied haines
simply

  now you saw that gray white thing
widi a head like a chinese devil and the
size of a big barrel and a great gash of
a long-toothed jaw blunt-ended and all
whiskery like seaweed and the yellow
and slime of the inside of it which was
like to make a guy vomit as that gash
grabbed at the winged devil flogging the
water with its fifteen-foot stretch of wing
-just a snap and it was gone easy as a
trout flicks up a fly skimming above it
now what sort of a beast that we are wise
to could get away with a mouthful like
that

  none i ever heard tell of replied
haines with conviction

  or those winged uglies-or the rack-
et put up by the things that ramped some-
where around here last night seems like
it numbs the brain just to think of it but
theres one sort of answer and it fits like
a glove every one of the crazy shapes
weve set eyes on theyre all quite na-
tural in the notion so i dont see no way
out of it first along those blasted trees
started me thinking then birds without
feathers and wicked as satan gave me a
jolt that really set memory working for
it wasnt possible to make a mistake over
things like those i couldnt believe it
but a kid would have noted how like
they were to the pictures in books telling
about such queer brutes and now this

great water devil-i tell you tom all
are wrote about in the books ive studied
odd times beasts that ramped around
lord only knows how many hundred
thousand years back and whose bones are
sometimes found a hundred foot deep in
solid stone i cant call to mind but few
of the names the highbrows tag them
with mostly latin and greek i reckon
but that winged thing was a peter -
something or other and the dragon the
spit of a breed labeled dinosaurs ive
turned it over and over but i cant get
away from it but these damned freaks are
the same as what were in those books-
what they call prehistoric monsters if
thats the truth of it then me and you
tom are up against a hard proposition
for some of those beasts stood twenty
feet high and could bolt us whole with-
out any chewing he declared thought-
fully as carefully knocking the ashes
from his pipe on to a bare rock he eyed
them in frowning abstraction

  twenty feet repeated haines and
then was silent in contemplation of the
hugeness it pictured

  sure in a museum they got a leg-
bone as thick as your middle assured
elkins with the parental pride of your
true scientist

  but if those things cashed in all that
while back how do you reckon some
chance to be still living down here
queried haines with a pertinacity for de-
tail not uncommonly met with in men of
his practical type

  well i dunno-i aint wise to that
admitted elkins shortly maybe about
a million years back the land had a jolt
that let drop this plateau in a solid chunk
and so walled the brutes in as a prison and
whatever was the cause of the breed pass-
ing out couldnt get at them but thats
just a guess all were dead sure of is what
weve clapped our eyes on-and no logic
or learning can give the lie to that he
the primeval pit



asserted simply and as his past studies
could afford no further light on the mat-
ter and time and fate were hard on their
heels they left discussion to a time of more
leisure for their mode of life had bred
in their blood an impatience of inaction
and mere words and a strong bias in favor
of decision and instant action when dan-
ger threatened moreover they had no
thought of abandoning the search before
they had satisfied themselves one way or
another if fortune was hid there or not

   foot by foot they sampled the gravel
banks though by reason of frequent halts
to listen intently and scan the way ahead
their progress was much retarded but
far or near nothing stirred and the quia
was as that of a painted picture or the si-
lence of the dead and over all as a shroud
lay the stifling heat in which their pigmy
figures seemingly no more important than
maggots bred in festering filth ceaselessly
nibbled at mother earth as they slowly
pressed onward

   so they came to the lakes extremity
where a deep creek entered it between the
high banks of a conglomerate of clay and
pebble of cement-like hardness the
banks became more lofty a little way in
and the gloom of the dense forest roof
imparted an intangible air of mystery and
menace to the narrow passage even their
hardihood disliked its treacherous appear-
ance and for a moment they hesitated in
doubt if it would not be better to recon-
noiter the vicinity somewhat but im-
patience overruled prudence for the pan
had proved that the nearer they ap-
proached this somber channel the dirt be-
came richer and though no stone equaled
the one in haines pouch yet nearly a
dozen fragments now lay there almost as
well worth the saving

   we got to chance it said elkins im-
patiently after a few seconds survey
might take an hour to run over the
ground and then a brute could amble

along any moment besides if we go
quiet the rush of the water and height of
the banks will hide us from sight or hear-
ing of anything not actually staring down
on us he urged reasonably enough

  thats right said haines and if
ever i saw a likely spot for fossicking its
right ahead of us he added with the fever
of the search firing his voice

without further hesitation they en-
tered the cutting and making their
way along a narrow edge of rubble that
lay at each side of the water were soon
absorbed again in panning though as
before only haines did the washing while
elkins remained on guard

  at once it became apparent that their
high expectations stood some chance of
being justified for pan after pan be-
queathed more of the crimson pebbles to
their pouches even now and again a spec-
imen larger than the one first placed there

  why joe we must have a tidy stake
on us right now said haines as he hand-
ed his partner another fragment to pouch

   depends on their quality but i reckon
theyre beauties-maybe five hundred
dollars lays on us this moment replied
elkins adjudging the weight in his hand
for though no expert yet his knowledge
of gems was greater than his partners

   then even if there aint nothing larg-
er in this dirt still we could scrape a small
fortune out of it in a few days panning
exclaimed haines anxiously waiting for
a corroboration of the statement

  but elkins made no answer instead
stood keenly eyeing the opposite bank
where a stray spear of sunlight had lit on
a vein of dark pebbles recently exposed
by a miniature landslide of the dirt and
trailing vines that had faced them

  haines looked up in surprize at his
partners sudden apathy hear any-
thing he queried in a low voice

  no replied elkins slowly then


weird tales

sighed deeply as though just awakened

but take a squint over there will you
-if that aint what were after then its
damned like it and haines after one
sharp look at the extremity of the light
shaft agreed with the speaker

  holy prophets he exclaimed its
like as though a crimson fire burned
there and he stared at the glowing
spot that the spear point rested on an
eye of flaming light at least a couple of
inches in diameter it seemed as truly liv-
ing as any wild felines they had ever
gazed on

  i reckon this water aint more than
waist-high was all that elkins said as
slipping off his pack he raised it shoulder-
high and with rifle gripped in the hand
of the circling arm he led the way into
the black waters

t reckon wed better stop and beat it
a joe said haines hoarsely or well
be toting back common pebbles i cant
trust my eyes no longer to tell one from
the other he complained in a shaking
voice

  for some while they had been working
feverishly but silently the first burst of
incredulous wonder having burnt itself
out in the succeeding realization that each
stone they handled was without ques-
tion a gem of the first water and the
storehouse they lay in apparently inex-
haustible a vein a bare six inches wide
running diagonally across a face of clay
and common rubble it meandered from
the beach several feet upward and every
other stone they picked from it was a
blood-red precious gem many the size
of a large filbert a few the bigness of a
walnut and a couple of magnificent finds
lay beside the pile between them the size
and shape of an ordinary hens egg even
from the debris that had sloughed from
the wall could have been garnered a pail-
ful of lesser stones but with such a trea-

sure chest in front of them these were
neglected their pouches early had been
filled to bursting so they had hastily
scooped a hollow in the loose rubble and
set their finds in it just a pile of glow-
ing crimson pebbles but the least among
them would equal in value the figure
earned by twelve months of hard labor

  wealth beyond avarice it was no
dream stone by stone they had handled
it at last fate had smiled on them but
behind her apparent kindliness lay a
taunting jeer of malice as with one hand
she thrust her gift upon them while the
other had already the fingers crooked to
snatch away her treasures

  likely the noise of the water-for
though an unhurried flow and at most
points quite fordable yet close above a
ridge of rock made a swirl of clamorous
rapids-and the sharp bend in the creek
just below had held them unaware of the
approach of the enormous thing that
came shuffling along the creek bed and
suddenly appeared from around the turn-
ing not a hundred yards below the intent
workers who had recklessly abandoned
all pretense of caution and indeed for
the moment had forgotten everything save
their delirious greed in the discovery

  the colossal thing ceased to shuffle
and craning its long thick neck forward
stared eagerly at the pigmy figures then
snuffed at the air suspiciously as though
the odor of the human species was some-
thing new and incomprehensible and
the sound of that vast inhalation was as
the sough of a sudden blast of wind amid
the forest tops

  in a flash the bent figures had whirled
around and each had swept up his rifle
and snapped the safety catch wide open
but in the same second all thought of
using such insignificant weapons had de-
serted them for obviously it was an inane
absurdity to dream of tackling such a
monstrous creature with anything less ef-
the primeval pit



fective than a field gun or preferably a
trench mortar never had they imagined
that anything so vast unnatural and sav-
age-looking could exist even in that lair
of horrific things it was so entirely out
of prpportion with its surroundings as
though it had been intended for a much
larger scheme of creation but by some
mishap had strayed to our planet where
the lilliputian hills and trees and living
things could never be anything save a con-
temptible substitute for the majestic ob-
jects it was exiled from

  fully three times the height of a very
tall man it towered nearly a half of its
height above the banks as it stood erect on
huge hind limbs very similar to those of
a kangaroo and though hidden by the
water very probably there lay below an
abnormal length of foot so marked a fea-
ture in the marsupial but this was no
harmless giant of that innocent species
for its upper half bore a striking resem-
blance to an enormous crocodile being
covered with a yellowish scaly armor and
the short forelimbs though thick as a
mans thigh were taloned as a saurian and
plainly had no part in the brutes locomo-
tion while the frightful head and jaws
though a solid mass of horn and hooked
at the extremity of what could only be
termed the upper mandible had the blunt
end and rapacious hugeness of a croco-
diles one could imagine cattle and
horses being torn to pieces by that terri-
ble beak as easily as a hawk picks the
bones of a chicken

  the whole effect was paralyzing there
was about it such an air of irresistible
might diabolical savagery and such a
sensed mixing of the species a welding
of bird beast and reptile that it deprived
the aghast men of the power of rational
thought and all they could conceive in
the line of action was an instant flight

  quick tom whispered elkins
hoarsely mount my shoulder we must

get out of this ill sling the packs up
and you give me a hand-if were quick
i reckon we may make it

  as he spoke he leapt in a flash to the
top of a near-by heap of rubble that fallen
from the bank had made a step nearly
waist-high up it in a second haines
had mounted the stooped back and swung
from there to the banks crest without
a fraction of a seconds pause two packs
landed beside him as he hung over with
arm outstretched and gripped elkins up-
flung fingers

  normally both menwere as hard as
wire nails and as active as mountain goats
and now speeded up by the appalling
sight so close to them the move was com-
pleted almost as smoothly and rapidly as
the swoop of an eagle on its quarry yet
none too soon did elkins feet rest on the
banks crest for as he tore through the
trailing vines the gigantic brute hurtled
toward them in a flying leap that covered
nearly a third of the space between the
splash of its landing sent a great wave
crashing nearly to each banks summit
and a slash of spray that drove like hail
to the brush above just in the flick of
an eyelid the two men saw this as they
slipped their arms through the pack
straps then they were tearing through
the thick fringing brush keeping close
to each other

  make for the wall we dropped down
tom-we got to get quit of this hellish
hole somehow and i reckon that blasted
thing isnt a climber called elkins as
they tore free of the brush and came into

the tall timber by- its up and

after us he exclaimed as there came a
tremendous crash in the tangle behind
them beat it for all youre worth dont
chance hiding he admonished urgently

  possibly they had a couple of hundred
yards start of their pursuer but what was
that when as they had seen the creature
could cover a hundred feet at a single leap


weird tales

and a thicket hindered it no more than so
much dried grass luckily the tangle
had been but a fringe of jungle luxuriat-
ing in the stronger light seeping through
the scantier foliage above the creek be-
yond this lay the tall timber where the
underbrush was negligible for the eleva-
tion of the plateau forbade the mad riot
of vegetation engendered in the steaming
plains a thousand miles to the east of it
of course it was by no means easy going
and one unaccustomed to such gloomy
depths would have been hopelessly lost in
five minutes but these men sensed direc-
tion as instantly and certainly as any wild
creature and though they made a hun-
dred slight deviations to avoid clumps of
lesser growths yet they held true to the
goal they aimed at and laden as they were
with pack and rifle tore ahead at a furious
pace

  crash after crash sounded close behind
them often so close that they feared the
next second would bring the terrible
thing hurtling on them but apparently
its amazing mode of locomotion was here
a hindrance to its progress for many of
the young growths were too stout for even
its great bulk to splinter and too close
together for it to penetrate so very soon
it came to the fleeing men that for all the
brutes gigantic leaps and huge thews yet
they were holdirig their own and might
continue to do so until their strength
failed them

  whether it hunted by sound or scent
it was very certain of every step they had
taken for though several times by abrupt
turns and swervings they essayed to evade
detection yet the thud and crash followed
always behind them shortly instinct in-
formed them that they were obliquely
closing on the point where they had
dropped from the heights above and also
knew that soon the pace must slacken for
their heaving chests and thumping hearts
seemed bound in by red-hot iron bands

that every moment were growing tighter
and more agonizing

  had it not been for the heavy packs
they would have thought little of such a
race and probably could soon have left
the brute far behind them but the lack of
those packs would spell the end of their
prospecting and entail hardship that even
they would flinch from as for their rifles
in such a remote spot the loss of them
would almost certainly be a death war-
rant to such men things like these are sa-
cred and only to be surrendered with life
itself

   we got to let up for a spell soon joe
panted haines whose heavy build felt the
strain more than his partners sparer flesh

  hold on tom encouraged his part-
ner anxiously just to that clump ahead
-well slip around it and try out a few
pills on this blasted brute-hes got to
slow up coming round it and that will give
us a chance to fix his lamps for him he
cried savagely

  crash again came the splintering of
young timber as the brute alighted not
many hundred feet distant behind them
though save for infrequent more open
spaces the giant growths were so thick
together that the creature had little chance
to display its prodigious leaping ability
and hindered by its vast bulk its progress
had been no more rapid than that of the
fleeing men

   putting their last ounce of flagging mus-
cle into it they dashed to the clump ahead
tore through the thick barrier and raced
to its nearest extremity behind a mas-
sive bole and a wide lane between them
they awaited the brutes coming each
knew that failure spelt the end of every-
thing for at least one of them but now
their nerves were as calm and steady as
the giant growths they pressed tight
against for many a time before had each
mans life lain in the pressing of a trig-
the primeval pit



ger and so far they had no reason to doubt
the efficacy of such a line of argument

  thud the thing had hurled itself to
the barrier and for a moment by the harsh
rending and straining sounds the listen-
ers knew that it was vainly essaying to
force a passage through the stout stems
there was something strangely bird-like
in the imbecility of the action and one
might imagine that a giant stupid fowl
was there dashing itself against a barrier
of wire-netting but in a moment the
beast part of it took the ascendancy and
with sudden decision it ceased to assail
the barrier and in a leap came to the lower
end where the way was open and now
there was more than a hint of the reptile
in the writhing shuffle of its turning and
the manner in which the horrible head
flicked from side to side as though unde-
cided which trail of scent to follow so
it shuffled forward a few yards and came
right between the waiting men just
caught a glimpse of one of the strange-
odored things it had chased-and then
the light winked out forever in the shat-
tering report of two rifle shots blended
together

  after that chaos indescribable cata-
clysmic unleashed primeval energy spill-
ing its titanic force in convulsions of enor-
mous muscles here there soaring in
huge bounds in every direction crashing
into young growths and smashing them
to splinters ramming great boles with in-
credible thunderous impact that the very
giants shivered under and for a second
the battering-ram lay a quivering moun-
tain of flesh below them again to shoot
upward in another convulsion and repeat
the performance in another direction

  now the bird spirit entirely controlled
it for on an infinitely magnified scale of
space and time it was duplicating the riot
of intense reflex action displayed by a de-
capitated chicken

for some moments the men had their
work cut out to avoid the terrific
hurtlings of these monstrous convulsions
but shortly the first violence of the out-
burst had exhausted itself and the inter-
vals grew longer between the spasms and
after one stupendous crash it lay stretched
on the ground with its immense muscles
bunching and twitching in waves of fast-
diminishing virility and then haines risked
a dash across to his partner

  aint that the limit exclaimed elkins
as the two stood staring at the heaving
brute

  tm darned if we aint fixed him
cried haines exultantly

  just luck replied the other man
those pills or one of them threaded its
gray matter-likely no bigger than a hens
egg either but being dumdum they
scooped it clean its a stroke of luck
that i aint stuck on running up against
again he added thoughtfully

  what would you reckon it is joe
queried haines in a tone of awed wonder

  search me-though i did see a pic-
ture in the book that wasnt a bad likeness
of the brute but i dont call to mind what
they named it replied elkins knitting
his brows in an unavailing effort of mem-
ory but whatever it is maybe its dad
and ma aint dead and like as not it had
a mate and i aint dyin to meet any of
them so i guess we better go find a
way of quitting this nightmare he de-
clared emphatically

  and pass up a fortune remonstrated
haines moodily

  i dont see no way out of it-we aint
fixed for tackling such devils this brute
got his by a chance that might not happen
again in another hundred years no i
aint scared of taking chances but its
crazy to tackle these brutes with pea-shoot-
ers like we got next time well have the


weird tales

right dope along with us he asserted
grimly

  next time repeated haines with sur-
prize and great content thats right-
of course therell be another day in our
calendar and what we got pouched will
give some style to that outfit

  sure well have hardware that can
throw an ounce ball through armor plate
explosive shells to tickle em and a case
or two of dynamite-oh yes well have
the dope all right agreed elkins sav-
agely but now wed better get out of
this as quick as we can beat it-though i
reckon the brutes keep most to the water-
ways and likely theres other lakes hid
away in the forest where grub is handy for
them-still keep your eyes skinned may-
be im wrong

  after a moments delay while they lis-
tened intently for any sound that might
betray that the great uproar had disturbed
other frightful life in the vicinity and
failing to catch the faintest murmur in
the absolute stillness that surrounded
them the two men picked up the packs
they had hastily discarded just before the
monster came between them and with a
last stare of fierce loathing at the mon-
strous carcass still pulsing with immense
primeval virility they left a scene that
looked as though a battery of field guns
had recently swdpt it

midway in the afternoon they were
back at the spot where they had
first descended from the surrounding deso-
lation for miles they had followed the
great wall westward and come on no spot
that offered the faintest hope of ascent
always the sheer heights rose in frowning
bluffs that nothing lacking wings could
surmount and at last in despair they had
retraced their steps to scan again the
feasibility of what looked like their only
hope of escape

  i dunno said elkins slowly but it

might be possible-save for that twenty
foot in the middle he added pointing
to a spot about half-way up where the
face of the bluff for a dozen feet seemed
as smoothly shining as a pane of glass
and not the slightest indication of a
crevice or a prominence was visible

   one could give another a lift from the
ledge below it replied haines with no
great surety of tone but the first up
couldnt stir a finger to help the one be-
low until he had climbed another dozen
feet

   the fact was patent for just above the
glassy surface lay a stretch of sheer bluff
where it would mean instant disaster for
one ascending to endeavor to aid another
apart from this the ascent was just possi-
ble to men with the iron nerves and mus-
cles possessed by the two surveying it

  for a moment his partner was silent
apparently lost in deep consideration of
the problem then he observed abruptly
it aint no use foolin about it theres a
show for one to make it-but not a chance
in the world for the other one of us
must stop while the other beats it across
the hills for a length of rope to fish him
out with i dont see no way out of it
for we got to move quick-the grub will
just hold out to make that trip and to go
hunting around any lake down here is no
more than plain suicide he added coolly

  but joe haines expostulated ten
days is the least one could make arenas in
and thats the nearest settlement that
means twenty days for one of us alone in
this damned hole and he was silent
as he imagined the experience

  well what of it theres ledges
around here where one could lie safe
enough night times and keeping hid day-
time i reckon one could last out that long
anyway we got to chance it for there
aint a single liana to be found this high
up said elkins summing the situation
briefly
the primeval pit



    yes said haines very quietly and
 who do you reckon is stopping 

    why  am replied elkins sharply

   youre wrong joe i am stated
 haines as simply as a god might deliver
 an unalterable fiat elkins stared half
 fiercely half whimsically at his partner

    of course a stick of dynamite couldnt
 budge you once you got your mules mind
 set but heres the answer said he with
 a half smile as stooping he picked from
 the rubble a couple of small fragments
 see ones quartz others granite you
 do the picking and the guy who gets the
 quartz he stops aint that square he
 queried gravely

    i guess so agreed haines unwilling-

  ty-

    at once the stones were swirled around
 in a hat by elkins who then with a quick
 move turned it over on a flat slab slid
 his hand underneath and withdrew the
 clenched fist with a fragment inside it

   now which is which he asked
 quietly

    white replied haines touching the
 clenched fingers which thereupon fell
 open-and on to the slab tinkled a little
 granite fragment

    thats that said elkins as cheerfully
  as though he had won a lottery now
  well get busy sooner you beat it the bet-
  ter wouldnt tote more than gun billy
  and grub take the fishline up with you
  and ill come down and hook them on
  said he referring to the stout line that lies
   in the pack of every prospector

    and after a little argument over the
 division of the beans wherein haines had
 his way by simply stating that if you
 send up an ounce over a third of them
 ill dump the lot over the edge and ar-
 ranging that whether he found a way up
 or not elkins would return to this spot
 before the twentieth day the two men
 stepped to the point where they had agreed
 ascent was most feasible

  at the foot of the wall haines turned
with troubled eyes and growled say
joe wont you let me off this if we kept
on going there must be some break in the
blasted wall

  did it seem that way from up there
queried elkins shaking his head and
haines could not deny but everywhere the
towering battlements had appeared as an
unbroken line of sheer precipice not in
frequently more lofty than the crest they
stood on

  curse the hellish hole broke out
haines harshly ips bewitched just

thirty feet of rope or hide would-

and then he was dumb as a light of im-
mense wonder swept into his eyes then
suddenly he was laughing deeply and
joyfully though almost noiselessly

  whats the joke queried elkins in
surprize

   if we aint a couple of kids in white
nighties cried haines contemptuously
though very contentedly why theres
more line than we can use lying not ten
minutes from us right now

  line where snapped elkins

   why the underside of that great brute
-isnt there many a thirty-foot length of
hide on it-strong enough i reckon to
swing an elephant aloft declared haines

  well im damned come on was
all elkins said at all printable

tvtext time well shin up and down

   a rope ladder said haines as he
laid aside the knotted lengths of greasy
rawhide with which they had just hauled
up their gear from a ledge forty feet be-
low them i aint stuck on this human
fly business-with maybe any minute a
poke in the spine from some winged
devil

  i own the same notion gave me the
cold shivers as we hung by our eyelashes
on some of those ticklish places yes i


weird tales

guess next time well be fixed for a little
straight talk with those hellish things
agreed elkins very heartily as he stood
watching the approaching night draw its
dusky veil across the still forest-covered
depths

  and then from afar there sped through

seeped in frightful emotion that it

seemed the whole universe must be lis-
tening aghast at the immensity of its virile
ferocity and utter devilishness

                        	the bells

                    year after year i heard that faint far ringing
                    of deep-toned bells on the black midnight wind

                     peals from no steeple i could ever find

                   but strange as if across some great void winging

                  i searched my dreams and memories for a clue

                   and thought of all the chimes my visions carried

                  of quiet innsmouth where the white gulls tarried
                  around an ancient spire that once i knew

                   always perplexed i heard those far notes falling

                  till one march night the bleak rain splashing cold
                  beckoned me back through gateways of recalling
                  to elder towers where the mad clappers tolled
                  they tolled-but from the sunless tides that pour
                  through sunken valleys on the seas dead floor

again the small craft of the harrying
english outmaneuvered the unwieldy
spanish vessels again a raking dis-
charge of chain shot and a hail of balls
from sakers falcons and bastard cul-
verins spread destruction along the three
decks of the towering galleon the
scuppers ran red again at the discharge
as though the fabric of the vessel itself
was bleeding

  it was the year of our lord  the
day august th and the scene the

  a ll day the shot-torn santa ysabel

her deck ill-manned a welter of

great armada prepared to stand and
fight

  the engagement was brief and deadly


weird tales

the swift english privateers had mowed
down the soldiers on his unwieldy
troop-ships until from being over-
manned the galleons were in danger of
running ashore for lack of able hands

  far from parma the battle of grave-
lines was in progress the eagle forma-
tion which had been of such value in the
battle of lepanto was still maintained
heavy galleons for the body lighter
ones including galleasses for the wings
and troop-ships making up the tail of the
fighting bird

  against hawkins-achines the span-
ish called him with revilings-and drake
-el draque or the dragon-this clumsy
formation had beaten along intact save
for the loss of here and there a straggler
that lagged too far behind now the two
powers were locked in the final battle of
the ten days flight all that remained to
fight were forty ships after the fire-ships
had scattered the fleet the greater part
were far to leeward and driving toward
the banks of dunkirk

  the english fire went through and
through the santa ysabel when the can-
nons and culverins spoke with force
enough to shatter a rock no ship had
struck its colors though the english fleet
had lain yard-arm to yard-arm and the
spaniards had endured five hours of
being torn to pieces by cannon-shot

  at three hours before sunset the firing
had blended into a continuous roar of
sound deafened gunners served the
small demi-culverins and falconets which
were all that remained of the santa
ysab els armament from the maintop
nothing could be made out through the
smoke but below in the pall pinnace
and barque drew near the galleon dis-
charged their broadsides and gave place
to the next

  here and there a spanish fly-boat a
gunboat manned with oars slid through

the fighting met a pinnace and sank it
but these now were very few

  there was no flinching on the decks of
the santa ysabel while the air shook
with the roar of the artillery priests
went up and down under the hottest fire
crucifix in hand confessing and absolv-
ing the dying

  to the patter of drum-beats and a cry
of saint george for merrie england a
privateer drew close and lodged a volley
in the galleons hull a hoarse cheer
went up from dry throats when a cough-
ing roar and a burst of white flame
showed that the spanish magazine had
exploded

  had it not been for the fact that the
powder was nearly gone that would
have been the end of the santa ysabel at
once but although crippled she did not
sink drifting with fire showing through
her ports and swathed in black clouds of
smoke

  boarding party away rang out from
below as the doughty little bark pre-
pared to close with the giant but before
this could take place there came an
interruption

  from behind the flaming galleon a
galleass like a many-legged water-bug
came striding out in all its pomp of
swinging oars and engaged the bark
banners flew free and gay as they met
but a well-directed chain shot brought
low the spanish standard and a storm of
balls felled the mainmast along with a
fallen sail that billowed over the rowing
pit and which was straightway set aflame
with a pot of wildfire

  a second volley crashed into the
galleass between wind and water and
with a burst of bubbles and frenzied
screams the craft heeled over and went
down taking with her soldiers sailors
and two hundred chained and helpless
galley slaves

  this short and decisive battle had dis-

                 w t-
the master fights



tracted the attention of the english from
the santa ysabel a mistake that was
brought to their attention when their
sails flapped uselessly beneath the moun-
tainous side of the galleon

  red-hot cannon-balls now fell from
the heights into the hold of the bark and
the galleon limped along after her con-
sorts still burning in isolated spots but
leaving the bark behind her a pillar of
fire which presently subsided into the
cloud-darkened sea

  before sunset the wind rose the firing
ceased and the smoky canopy drifted
away

  far behind the mass of the spanish
fleet the santa ysabels condition was
desperate the soldiers though few out-
numbered the seamen and snatched con-
trol chose their own course and forced
the pilot to steer where they pleased the
natural result was that after a miserable
night spent in attending to the wounded
throwing overboard the dead and exam-
ining into the injuries of the vessel they
had lagged behind so far that the fleet
was barely in sight

  there was no fresh water and no pow-
der save what was in the loaded guns on
deck and a few muskets below a hun-
dred and four men walked the deck
haggard desperate and hopeless they
were entering the north sea but at
present were in water that was shoaling
every moment so that they could see the
yellow foam where the waves broke on
the banks the english hung menacing
and grim a mile on the weather quarter
but drawing more water than the galleon
they did not advance

  about noon after prayers the wind
shifted to the southwest and with the
remaining rags of sail the santa ysabel
wore away from the shallows the eng-
lish followed as she plunged forward
into the north sea but seemed satisfied
w t - 

to let the elements finish the work they
had begun

  two days later they passed the mouth
of the forth and the dogging fleet
turned back no nearer the tatters of the
armada the santa ysabel sailed on her
crew reduced by half

  a ghastly proof of the suffering and
famine ahead in the fleet was given the
followers in the morning the mutilated
galleon sailed on through the forenoon
through the carcasses of many hundreds
of mules and horses that had been flung
overboard in the night to save water for
the men

  the santa ysabel kept up the forlorn
pursuit in a rising gale as far as die
orkneys passed those surf-lashed coasts
in weadier that steadily grew more wild
and fell in with two other galleons in as
ill case as herself learning from them
that the fleet had separated each vessel
for itself the three passed down the
wild west coasts of the hebrides were
scattered again in a furious storm and
with fourteen still living the santa
ysabel beat on toward ireland

  the other two were splintered on the
iron cliffs of connaught and those of
their crews that escaped the skenes and
axes of the wild irish tempted by plun-
der were shot or hanged on the spot by
the english troops garrisoned there

it was night around the santa ysabel
away to port somewhere in the dark-
ness a flare of ruddy light lit up the
surging clouds seconds after a rumbling
came sullenly over the dark water some-
where a commander radier than be taken
or wrecked upon the inhospitable coast
had thrown a torch into his powder
magazine and gone with all his dreams
of conquest

  leon gunnar leaned on the four-foot-
thick bulwark famine-weakened and
thirsty wondering if those unknown dead


weird tales

were happier in the sea or were more at
rest than they had been before the crash
of exploding powder had reft them of
their earthly problems the doubt hang-
ing in his mind had kept him for days
from ending his misery in the sea

  long days and nights of dread with-
out hope the galleon had driven along
fever delirium speaking in hellish screams
and oaths from below leon was grateful
that the ship was free from that horror
at last

  low in the water a seam having
opened a few hours before the survivors
floated toward the irish coast leon de-
bated incuriously the probable mode of
his death would they sink before they
were smashed against the rocks of sligo
bay he hardly cared the end was the
same in either event it seemed

  the officers had long been gone and
many of the crew had died in the hope-
less struggle for home died from sheer
exhaustion and overwork four days a
mate had been captain of the galleon
for four days and nights he had not slept
on the morning of the fifth day leon
recalled the mate had looked red-eyed
into the rising sun had smiled myste-
riously at some one he thought he saw
there and mounting the bulwark had
stepped open-armed toward the sunrise
and the friend whose name was-death

  far behind in the waste of tossing
water shone a following light twinkling
waving unsteady as though it winked
and signaled at the iron-bound lantern
upon the santa ysabels carved high
poop

  leon ran back lifted the lantern and
waved it from side to side the thought
of a following spanish vessel was dis-
pelled when faint and dulled by distance
came the sound of an english cheer
above the slap and spatter of the driving
spume along the high unwieldy stern

  leon let the lantern fall into the sea

and ran forward to where the weary men
slaved at the pumps beaten by the howl-
ing wind and driving rain they made all
sail possible and slid a trifle faster
toward the deadly coast

  when morning came it found the
santa ysabel all but a derelict hulk an-
other mast carried away and only a rag
of canvas giving steerage way terribly
near and menacing spun a pursuing pin-
nace a cockleshell of a boat but filled
with dauntless hearts its captain too
late to join the gravelines battle had
sworn to turn back only as master of a
galleon and at last spied his long-sought
quarry but a quarter of a league away
steadily the little vindictive bore down
upon the wallowing titan and an hour
after sunrise opened fire her third shot
unanswered from the santa ysabel
smashed through the galleons rudder
and crippled her like a hamstrung el-
ephant

  the spanish vessel swung about and
lay in the trough of the seas careening
wildly foam spurting over the stumps of
masts

  the english howled and drew close in
the melee a round shot had hulled the
santa ysabel adding a new menace to the
surviving invaders through this rent
water poured into the hold from a myriad
widening seams now opened now closed
by the strain of the twisting seas

  the vindictive drew alongside and a
sailor roped high on the single mast with
a dozen or more muskets beside him in
the cask that did duty as a fighting-top
picked off one by one the sweating heart-
sick spaniards that manned the pumps
from different quarters of the deck a
spatter of shots answered but none took
effect while the replying fire shortly
ceased for their powder at last was ex-
hausted

  suspecting a ruse the pinnace sheered
off sending a chain shot screaming
the master fights



through a yard which fell crushing two
and hiding leon gunnar in a fold of
canvas he felt himself wrapped in a
crushing tangle of cordage that bit and
stung like steel whips a bight of the
cord tightened about his throat and short
indeed was the painful pressure for
shots cries shrieking wind and booming
seas melted together into a solemn bass
organ note and silence and darkness shot
with fire

  again the english drove close while
the sailor at the masthead in a wreath of
smoke swung a hissing missile about his
head and hurled it upon the galleons
deck the earthen pot of wildfire broke
and let loose its devouring contents which
flamed blue and green but quickly sput-
tered out beneath a douche of sand wet
with vinegar that had been prepared in
expectation of such an attack

  then to the surprize of all a quick
shift of wind and a towering sea con-
spired together and smashed the vindic-
tive all too near against the rugged side
of the santa ysabel crushing in the
weaker vessel

  a few of the english clinging to the
scrollwork the gunports and the chains
made their way to the bulwarks rushing
water dragged three of them away but
five reached the spanish deck

  nine bloody haggard men last of the
santa ysabels hundreds battle insanity
in their red-rimmed eyes met them as
they came dagger met dirk a musket
exploded a spaniard choked as the teeth
of a dying englishman met in his jugular
his heels drummed once or twice on the
splintered deck then only the slap of the
waves was to be heard on the sinking
galleon

it was night again when a giant wave
broke through a hole in the bulwarks
sloshed in and out of the scuppers and
wet icily gunnars covering gasping for

breath and stung by the salt in a number
of abrasions the young man tore himself
free with the help of his dirk

  loose he could see at once that the
ship was far gone it heaved and pitched
lower in the water to the tune of rumbling
below as the wash of the deep currents
in the hold carried empty barrels and
floating cases to and fro the tiller
swung idly and the deck was strewn
with bodies swiftly he examined all but
found no signs of life and consigned
them to the seething waves

  a toy of the elements the doomed
santa ysabel careened in the choppy sea
a derelict hulk drifting near an inhos-
pitable coast the gale and rain had
stopped but clouds hid the moon from
sight

  however leon had no need of moon-
light to trace the outline of the shore
there as far as eye could see beacon fires
flamed from horizon to horizon like a
glittering necklace of diamonds upon
black velvet

  there also men wild irish kerns
clothed in hide and raw meat eaters
danced about armed with spiked poles
waiting for their fellow christians to
come tossing in that they might slay and
slay and slay until the arm grew weary

  a light wind rising again was chill
and cut through his soggy garments
leon shivered and looked about for
something to throw across his shoulders

  near by a black heap appeared to be a
cloak flung haphazard over an overturned
keg but as he touched it a movement
startled him and he drew back beneath
the cloak crouched a little dark man

  leon noticed that his eyes sparkled
strangely as the fellow spoke and his
teeth were long and sharp his hair was
gray and stringy upon his head his eye-
brows joined upon his forehead forming
a continuous bar of hair lending him a
wild and sinister appearance


weird tales

  ah friend well met we are alone
at last

  leon harked back in his memory and
found nothing there that recalled the
presence of this man aboard the santa
ysabel

  no said the little man as though
in answer to leons silent question you
have not seen me before it is true but i
have been near to you all your life i
watched over you when you were born
during your youth and when you first
planned to reach scotland tell me
what is that about your neck

  leon felt a peculiar antipathy to this
strange man and made surly answer if
you know so much you know that also
he eyed the stranger coldly

  ey ey that i do the dwarf
cackled is it not a part of a certain
key to a certain tomb in blois and are
you not in search of its mate in scot-
land

  in spite of himself leon was sur-
prized but even this seemed to be the
culmination of his long journeys curious-
ly he inspected the dark dwarf but with
recognition and no fear

  i think i know you you are the
persecutor of my people arch-demon
you are the master you are here to pre-
vent my success i know have you come
to kill me also

  the master nodded a saturnine smile
exposing his white fang-like teeth

   it is your turn to go unless you choose
to live

  leon laughed

  by daylight he said the ship will
strike upon the rocks and that will be the
end of both of us i do not believe that
even you can escape such a sea you can
neither save nor harm me now

  the master drew himself up and faced
into the wind which had increased to a
gale while they had been talking mum-
bling to himself he performed odd gyra-

tions with his arms ending with palms
pressing against the growing tempest in
an attitude of command the wind
dropped became a breeze and finally
lessened to a mere puff of air

  above the clouds still raced along but
around the sinking galleon lay an area
of utter peace and quiet where the waves
were low and no wind blew

  now do you doubt the masters
power

  gunnar shook his head

  more i have done to bring you here
 aided your progress to corunna and im-
planted in your mind the suggestion that
you take ship there for england  caused
the storms to rise that sent the armada
to seek shelter in that port my will
alone has broken the sea-power of spain
delays winds niggardly equipment 
fomented them all because you were
with the fleet i had the power to smash
the armada and it is ruined forever

  poor timorous sidonia spain will
blame him for the loss of sixty-five ships
and twenty thousand men but the mas-
ter met his fleet and fought on the side
of the english although they too are of
the accursed race of men the glory is
the masters and sidonia will never meet
parma now

  what is it gunnar asked calmly
that such a murderer wants with me
your body after death to do with as
it suits my pleasure and with your con-
sent answered the master without
hesitation if you will promise me to be
my slave i will save your life now and
you shall have until the time of your
natural death to live as you ordinarily
would i reserve this condition only that
if you call upon my help or visit that
tomb in blois then you forfeit your days
of life beyond thirty years from now
gunnar made a rapid mental calcula-
tion he had but just passed twenty-one
death seemed certain in a few hours
the master fights



without some unforeseen aid a sinking
vessel lay beneath his feet an unknown
shore ahead that seemed alive with sav-
ages even then he could hear their
eery cries like lonely devils wandered far
from their home in the pits across the
heaving seas the sounds came faintly to
him in the ominous unnatural silence
around the galleon the prospect was
dismal he shivered

   he might live sixty years in the normal
course of life gunnar made to himself
a solemn vow to keep away from france
and to avoid ever calling upon the
master

  he turned to his enemy who smiling
slyly appeared to understand his decision

  i promise he said to serve you
after my death and i acknowledge the
conditions of the pact

  so be it cried the little man and
whistled through his hands

  instantly the wind whooped through
the shreds of rigging and the waves rose
high again but above the howling of
the elements leon gunnar heard as he
hurried for shelter the high ululation of
the masters cackling laugh and shivered
again but with more than cold

  something within him warned that he
had been a fool and queried with an in-
ward jeering as to the meaning behind
the promise he had made

the half-light which precedes morn-
ing finally came and leon after a
night of terrors in the demolished cabin
issued forth to see the master swathed in
his long black cloak leaning on the
bulwark

  the master smiled and beckoned him
to approach

  we are to be friends now gunnar
he said with an underlying fierce humor
what do you think of this

  leon caught his breath at the sight
before him thev were verv near a sandy

beach where broke a violent sea two
galleons were pounding themselves to
pieces among surrounding rocks the
forecastle of a third was jammed between
rocks that held it partially together
although drenched and groaning in the
seas that swept over it leon could see
men upon the wreckage that waved piti-
fully at the santa ysabel as she lurched
nearer as though their efforts could thrust
her away

  the surf and beach were dotted with
bodies and the irish were down in hun-
dreds stripping the dead knocking some
of the living on the head and leaving
others naked to perish of the cold

  then with a grinding crash the
santa ysabel drove into the wreckage
and the remaining mast went by the
board

  at the same time the forecastle of the
other galleon was swept from its perch
and foundered

  leon had no remembrance of swim-
ming but found himself on the shore
among the howling men he had a
tight grasp of the masters hand and the
black cloak was about them both

  take care growled the master
they can not see you while you are
with me the cloak of invisibility pro-
tects us both

  boats an upturned tender hatches
spars and cordage mingled with the dead
upon the shingle

  as they passed along the edge of the
water a man came in upon a drifting
scuttle-board his leg badly bleeding from
a blow by a spar in the surf leon
recognized in him a don cuellar com-
mander of the san pedro a man for
whose valor die younger man felt a deep
admiration

   let us go along with him he said
to the master and they followed

  a miserable figure the irish who were
plundering the well-dressed took little


weird tales

notice of him he crawled along until he
came to some rushes where he lay and
hid himself

  he is safe there said the master
we will see him again

  they passed on through the wreckage
and entered a lane that led up toward the
hills held close within the masters
cloak leon passed unseen within a few
feet of the nearest fire and those who
squabbled around it the sound of their
alien voices came faint to his ear as
though they were far away

  a naked wild-faced hairy man ran
toward him as he strode on beside the
master the youth caught his breath
sure that he was seen but the savage
veered as he came near and rushed by
waving a bit of pointed stick red and
dripping his hand bloody to the elbow

  they threaded their way through the
cordon of fires near one where the
natives had dragged him lay a naked
graybeard whom leon recognized as the
chief gunner of the rata coronada as
they approached he seemed to sense the
coming of a compatriot and raised him-
self on an elbow feebly croaking agua
agua from salt-cracked lips

  a virago tending a pot struck him
down with a heavy iron ladle so that he
fell across the feet jf one who appeared
to be some sort of a sub-chief as he wore
a pair of tight-fitting knee-breeches and
a goatskin jacket open in front this
man snarled and kicked the gunners body
away

  the spaniard cried out as his hair
began to burn for he lay now upon
glowing embers

  the sub-chief seized a large rock and
coolly as though it was a matter of
familiar practise beat out the brains of
the tortured gunner

  leons soul seemed to turn steel within
him at the horrible sight freeing his
dirk with his right hand and clutching

the masters scraggy wrist with his left
they leapt toward the fire as they
neared the light of the flames the master
stopped seemingly in pain leon stared
in wonder then left his protection raced
to the fire and sprang like a cat upon the
back of the murderer

  it was a seconds work to yank the
shaggy head back and draw his keen
blade across that bronzed bull-throat

  the throng shouted at this tattered
sea-soaked apparition that had material-
ized before them out of nothing blood
spurted hissing on the flames and the sub-
chief fell without a cry into the fire across
the body of his victim

  the pot overturned and sent a flood of
scalding broth over the old hag and in
the excitement and confusion leon ran
back several steps into the shadows and
by the masters side invisible to all but
him they were both again unseen

  the master laughed for the third time
this was a protege much to his liking
hand in hand master and pupil marched
inland from the coast

  because of the gunnars the master
had crossed the channel a new hunt-
ing-ground was before him and the first
kill was satisfying to the enemy of all
things human

  he was still laughing softly to him-
self when the sun rose beyond the hills

  leon was suddenly aware that he was
again alone with the first ray of sun-
light the master had vanished as mys-
teriously as he had appeared aboard the
wrecked galleon

  	the bug-wolves of castle manglana

on the battlements of castle man-
glana leon gunnar stood leaning
on a musket and gazing pensively across
the deep placid waters of lough erne

  it was late in october in the year of
our lord 
the master fights



  manglana stood on a promontory pro-
jecting far out into the broad lake whose
ripples lapped against the base of the
castle wall

  no boats plied lough erne all had
been sunk a week before when
orourke the owner of the castle had
retreated with his family and retainers
into the mountains leaving gunnar and
eight other spaniards to defend them-
selves as best they might against a force
of eighteen hundred english soldiers
these had been collected in dublin and
were led by irelands lord deputy whose
orders were to scour the west country
and kill all fugitives from the thirteen
galleons which were wrecked upon that
part of the coast

  a swallow skimmed by and left a
trail of widening circles on the still
water leon sighed and followed it with
his eyes wishing that he too had wings
with which to leave this wild land far
behind how soon would he flee to
scotland and his kindred there

  a crack of a musket and a jubilant
yell broke into his revery and he turned
to see a bearded man dressed in the
saffron mantle of an irish gallowglass
dancing about the battlements

  byr lady he shouted i got the
dirty spy that time see him kicking in
the marsh

  well done cuellar leon ap-
plauded we cant waste ammunition
every shot must find an english heart
cuellar became serious and looked
around to see if any one was listening

  boy he whispered you dont know
how true that is i was prowling about
in the powder room today and i found
that three of those powder kegs orourke
left us were some that had been picked
up on the beaches after the wrecks
well queried gunnar

  no  water soaked in somehow
weve got a half-keg left and a dozen

muskets to fight an army with senora
cuellar will be finding another man im
afraid

  dont feel low-leon urged keep
up your spirits sir time is fighting for
us too you know the english dont
know our strength and a couple of heavy
rains will drown them out

  he pointed toward the landward side
of the promontory far enough from the
castle so that musket fire could not reach
the defenders lay the camp of the eng-
lish on such high ground as existed in the
low swampland now and then some
foolhardy soldier would leave the camp
and try to find a way through the
swamps and effect an entrance into the
castle but after the first few attacks in
force had ended in disorder and bloody
defeat the english had sat down in
their camps and commenced a policy of
waiting until starvation drove the span-
iards into their hands

  with food for two months this did not
disturb the besieged greatly but the fail-
ing supply of powder was an event of
the first importance once the english
learned that a man might penetrate to
the castle walls without being fired upon
others would follow

  ah gunnar answered cuellar
you dont understand the feelings of a
father all of us here have got families
waiting for us but you when you watch
your own children growing up and see
the look in their mothers eyes you wont
feel like waiting for some other man to
step into your boots almost a year
weve been away and no one home knows
that we still live or where

  you came ashore on that galleon that
smashed into mine on the rocks of sligo
bay you said do you remember that
burned monastery and the twelve span-
iards hanging dead from the rafters in
the nave but for gods grace we might
have dangled there


weird tales

  leon nodded vigorously and the
blessed saints all tumbled on the
ground beneath their feet almighty i
can see them yet

  it was horrible agreed cuellar
and only a miracle could have saved us
from those madmen that plundered the
wrecks i shall remember in my prayers
for ever the chief that saved my life
leon spoke up bitterly

  you dont think he did it because he
loves spaniards do you he hates eng-
land as he does hellfire and only gave us
shelter because we are enemies of the
english if he had cared anything about
us he would have helped us get back
home instead of leaving us here

  true agreed cuellar but we are
alive and it was a blessed miracle that
allowed us to reach his protection

  he crossed himself fervently and gun-
nar in disgust returned to his post of
duty on the eastern wall

  only too well leon knew that the
saints had had nothing to do with the
bringing of himself cuellar and a young
naval officer to the dubious protection of
castle manglana an unseen companion
had journeyed with the three one power-
ful to protea those whom he wished
against any foe and he a dread enemy
of mankind was self-called-the master

cuellar shouted down the stairway
to some one below

  gomez tell ramon to bring up an-
other flask of powder and three more
muskets send up diego enrique and
rodriguez i think those english frogs
are going to come paddling out here
again

  gunnar ran back across the flat roof
again it was true that an odd commo-
tion was taking place in the camp hardly
perceptible in the growing dusk

  then far across the flat marshes arose
a puff of white smoke an eery whistle

rose to a scream which steadily mounted
passed overhead and a heavy missile
plunged sullenly into the lake

  the echoes were still in flight between
the cliffs of lough erne when a thud
shook the castle and both gunnar and
cuellar felt a slight sensation of giddi-
ness as though the firm structure rocked
beneath them a dismal wail came from
below and the two watchers gazed into
each others eyes with dawning compre-
hension and fear

  a man staggered up the stairs and
came out on the roof his hair was
crisped and smoking the beard gone
from one side of his face and sparks ran
to and fro on his charred clothing he
saw cuellar and came straight toward
him saluting the tacitly recognized
leader of the garrison

  mad re de dios gomez speak cuel-
lar cried what has happened

  ramon said the man with difficulty
his eyes rolling as he choked went-
into-the magazine-with-a lighted
torch- and he fell still at the posi-
tion of salute across cuellars feet

  that finishes us cuellar looked at
leon the english have dragged a can-
non up at last and now our powder is
gone

  leon thrust a hand inside the fallen
mans goatskin jacket

  sir gomez is dead he announced

  i expected that came the hopeless
reply come let us see how many yet
live

  as the two left the roof another dis-
tant report sounded from the camp and
gunnar turned back

  go i will watch here and call if
there is an attack

  very well replied cuellar adios
friend this is the end and he dis-
appeared in the billows of smoke pouring
up the stairway
the master fights



  it is not the end murmured an unc-
tuous voice in gunnars ear

  he recognized the voice at once the
master was making his usual nightly visit
whenever gunnar was alone

  are you utterly merciless gunnar
burst out passionately is there no pity
no humanity in you beast fiend
devil you disgrace the name of man
you are a monster in the name of every
holy saint i plead with you to leave me
and let me die in peace

  a cold ferocity gleamed for a second
in the masters eyes

  do not be misled by the body i hap-
pen to wear just now i have other
semblances that might surprize you i am
not a man and neither am i a beast you
will soon learn that i am not human as
for mercy and pity i had them long ago
but they were stolen from me however
i did not come to tell you this but to
show you a way out and perhaps to help
those who are with you

  gunnars face lighted and he took a
step closer to the odd creature who held
him in his power by a pact of servitude
pledged aboard a sinking galleon earlier
in the year

  what is it he urged tell me
quickly

  did you know that tonight is hal-
loween the one night in all the year
next to walpurgis night when it is
easiest for a man to become a wolf from
sunset to sunrise

  gunnar chuckled you may have
wonderful powers and i admit that you
can make yourself invisible and can lull
storms but no man can become a wolf
that is only an irish and french super-
stition

  as i have already told you i am not
a man you are too ignorant to under-
stand what i am if you had traveled
more you would know that what you term
a superstition has been known and be-

lieved in all countries and all ages i
the master am the one who began that
knowledge upon this earth strip off your
clothes and we will see what can be done
on halloween night

  gunnar hesitated and the master urged
him sternly strip he again com-
manded and the spaniard without mov-
ing his eyes from that twisted face began
to do as he was told

  the red eyes of the master fixed the
young man like stone as he moved
nearer

  i am giving you a choice he said
slowly i promised you upon the santa
ysabel your full term of life if you
bound yourself to me after death and but
thirty years if you found it necessary to
call upon my help choose now if you
are willing to become a thing that will
scatter the english from their camp like
leaves before the blast if you will it so
i shall cause such storms to arise tomor-
row that they will flood the marshes and
save the lives of your friends if not-
you can see them die tomorrow when the
soldiers take the castle and be saved by
me knowing all your life that you could
have rescued your friends and would
not

  leon gunnar considered he had no
one to care for or to care if he lived or
died thirty years of life at least lay
before him according to the pact in
which something might arise that would
defeat the masters plans then too
here was a promise that the lives of cuel-
lar and the rest would be spared senora
cuellar-the children-spain and love-
and sunshine in weary hearts

   i wish to fight and i ask your help
he replied

  thirty years then my lad clucked
the black dwarf and stooped his head
over gunnars arm

  the young man felt a sharp pain in
the hollow of his elbow the master


weird tales

backed away and threw an evil-smelling
liquid upon him muttering a low in-
cantation as he did so

  then--agony unspeakable as though
every bone in the spaniards body had
been violently wrenched from its socket
and as violently reset

   he fell to the roof crying out in pain
was it fancy or truth that the cries
sounded like yelps and howls instead of
words his nose seemed strangely long
in fact it was no longer a nose but a
snout and rolling there his hands came
within his vision and he howled again
they were not hands-they were could
it be possible the hairy paws of a wolf

  he felt a kick in the ribs the dwarf
seemed very wroth

  be quiet you fool you will have
the others here watch now

  the master drew his black cloak tight
about himself and leaned far forward
gunnar meant to gasp but it sounded
like a low whine of surprize when he
saw that suddenly the black cloak was no
longer cloth but black hair

  then the master fell forward his
scrawny limbs shrinking his face chang-
ing frightfully and two tailless wolves
stood side by side upon the roof of
castle manglana

   gunnar felt a strange wild thrill in his
veins he seemed to have imbibed some-
thing of die masters proud alien spirit
he was no longer human but a beast
and felt as a wild predatory animal
should

  man was his enemy should he not
kill below in the castle were men

  he stalked stiff-legged over to the
open entrance his hackles lifted and
foam drooled from his avid jaws man
smell here was strong he took one step
forward and howled long and dismally

  he would have hurled himself down
at his former friends had not a chill com-

mand halted him and he stood still
trembling violently

  there was nothing left of his former
life now he was but a machine meant
for one purpose only and that purpose
was to kill as long as he was able to fight
in his mind surged the red tide of mur-
der

  the black wolf was regarding him
with grim humor you will do he an-
nounced and the words made themselves
felt without sound in the gray wolfs
brain more men are over here follow
me

the black beast loped across the roof
and sprang over a low opening in
the battlements into the lake the gray
wolf plunged after the leader and struck
out for shore

   by the time they reached it the sky was
covered with clouds mysteriously having
appeared where ten moments earlier not
one was to be seen

   the beasts sank belly-deep in the ooze
and struggled to a firmer footing there
was a musty smell from green-scummed
pools filled with rotting leaves and small
dead things a drizzling rain spat and
hissed in the slimy water

  this will keep our prey under shel-
ter thought the gray wolf and the black
bent his head as though words had been
uttered they loped into the shallows
swam a bit and waded into sucking mud
beyond lay the camp

  cautiously they skirted the edges a
sentry approached and leaving the gray
behind the black wolf sneaked forward
gathered his legs beneath him and his
wiry muscles tensed

   a leap a stifled sob then a splash in
the puddles and the man was down with
his throat opened wide and bubbling

  another sentry approached peering
about for the source of the faint noises
and the gray wolf sprang then both
the master fights



muzzles dabbled red slunk into the
sleeping and defenseless camp

  as the gray had supposed no one was
visible in their quarters some slept and
others dozed but over all lay quiet and a
patter of rain that hushed any possible
sound of velvet footfalls

  near the cannon the black wolf
stopped sent out a silent command and
the gray prowled watchful alert to pro-
tea while the master assumed the human
form once more an instant he busied
himself there then again two misshapen
tailless wolf-things trotted on into the
camp

  a brush and canvas shelter lay a little
apart from the others and from it came
stertorous snores an instant of hesita-
tion and both wolves entered the low
doorway when they came out again
the snoring had stopped

  the eyes of both gleamed with a
strange exhilaration as they separated

  the black took one line of shelters and
the gray wolf commenced dipping in and
out of another line leaving a trail of red
drops on the wet ground to mark where
he had passed behind them lay a quiet
that would never again be broken by the
occupants of the shelters they had visited

  this dreadful business went on for a
long time without interruption the
black wolf had finished two lines of shel-
ters and was half-way along with a third
while the gray was slaughtering joyous-
ly drunk with killing on his second line
when a man awoke from frightful dreams
to look into slavering jaws and find a
more horrid reality there

  he had just time to cry out ware-
woolfes before his spine cracked in
those iron jaws the other occupant of
the shelter roused and yelled somahing
incoherent and also died

  at once there was commotion men
running about without aim or purpose
looking for an enemy band of raiders

not realizing what they were to fight
until they saw the two beasts oddly high
in the hind quarters leaping in and out
of the lines of shelters

  an irish renegade guide with the
troop fell on his knees at the sight
demons he howled the bugs the
bugs the bug-wolves are after us and
went crawling away toward the cannon
on hands and knees through the mud

  the cry of bug-wolves went racing
through the camp adding to the general
terror of the troops to whom the coun-
try tales of men-beasts were speedily
being brought home

  and all the while the two wolves
making the most of the confusion were
leaping swiftly about pulling down one
here and another there and worrying him
to death snarling like mad things heads
down and dodging blows they finally
dashed through the center of camp
toward the castle again on a little rise
of ground they stopped plain against
the lighter sky and direaly in line of fire
of the cannon

  the irish guide breathing a hurried
prayer that the cannon was loaded de-
pressed the muzzle and surrounded by a
frantic crowd of soldiers ignited the
charge

  the mighty concussion that followed
shook the camp a lurid flash of light lit
up the billowing clouds overhead frag-
ments of iron and mangled bodies flew
everywhere and in castle manglana six
men looked at one another with surprize
in their eyes not daring to hope that the
missing man had found a way to help
them

  the flimsy shelters were down in many
places and when the deafened survivors
of the explosion thought of the two
wolves again the rise of ground was bare

  a rising wind now brought a down-
pour of rain a steady fall that brought
the surface of lough erne lapping over


weird tales

the marshlands at the base of the prom-
ontory and still continued before morn-
ing castle manglana would be upon an
island and the rain which would follow
for days would prove sufficient to ren-
der the position of the english untenable
before another cannon could be secured

  cuellar and five other spaniards were
to see their homes at last

  miles away the master stood wrapped
in his black cloak a gray wolf crouched
at his feet

  that way said the somber dwarf
lies antrim from there you can easily
reach scotland i have told you where to
find your surviving relative and i am
very sure you will like her run now and
get as far as you can before morning
take the clothes of the first man you
meet an hour before dawn

  what caused the cannon to blow up
i put in an extra charge of powder and
filled the muzzle with mud good-bye
leon gunnar you are a worthy slave

  a second later the gray wolf was
alone he did not hesitate but turned in
the direction the master had indicated

  senora cuellar would some day see
her man again and never know that an
unknown friendless wanderer had given
years of his life diat six men with fam-
ilies might be together again nor had
she known would she have believed

  but he who had sacrificed to save
others was loping on through the night
toward antrim and scotland in desperate
haste

  in the morning he would be a naked
man never again to know the unholy
power and desires of this one red night

	in the tomb of the bishop

when the tomb was new and the
smell of freshly cut stone still
hung about the rock that formed it men
came with sad faces and walking slowly

and placed therein a man who they sup-
posed was finished with walking and the
other trivial matters that interest the
living

  after the proper ceremonies had been
observed they shut and locked the mas-
sive iron door and leaving the poor dead
thing there they went their several ways
and thought but little of the remains of
one who had but lately been held in high
respect

  for a while on anniversaries those
who had loved the bishop came and
placed flowers there and wept a little for
all the hopes and fears that they were
burdened with and being comforted
within themselves they went away again

  and all the while the great iron key
hung in a secret place in the ancestral
castle of the gunnars and it was the
only one that would fit the intricate lock
that fastened the tomb of the bishop

  and all the while the worm who is
lord of us all went to and fro within
the tomb and fed in his own manner
and was filled and well content

  and the soul of the bishop basked in
the mellow light of paradise caring no
more for his body or its future than we
for a shoe that has been outworn and
cast aside

  one by one those that had known the
bishop ceased to visit the tomb and
passing from the places that had known
them well also joined him again and
were content

  and the worm who is lord of us all
finding nothing to keep him longer
there left the bones of the bishop in si-
lence and darkness and peace

  lichens and mosses and vines grew
over the gray stones and rust flaked
thickly red in the hinges of the iron door

  and in the secret place where hung
the key a great fat spider lived out her
life and was not disturbed

  in the tomb of the bishop time was of
the master fights



little account but outside a hundred
years went by and brought changes that
were inevitable and to be expected

  one night men came to that tomb in
desperate haste casting glances behind
them as though they were sorely afraid
and when they placed a key in the lock
and it would not turn they panted as
though they had been running far and
had yet far to go by morning

  and they tried yet another key and
another and the lock would not turn
and despair came upon them for it was
very important that the tomb should be
opened

  at last the youngest of the men came
across the garden and in his hand was
the old key and behind him inside the
ancient castle of the gunnars which was
burning with a great crackling and a
vast amount of light an old fat she-
spider cursed that man with all the
power of a spiders curse for he had
taken away a home that to her line had
been far more ancient and hallowed than
any place can be to men

  it took four men to open that rusty
door and they did not remain long in-
side but placed a parcel well wrapped
and protected against the damp upon the
casket where lay the bishops dry and
aged bones

  in the parcel was a book whose pages
were made of human skin and which
told a story which was grim and horrible
and a little sad

  and they left it there where they
thought it to be safe and separated and
went to far countries and saw one an-
other no more till the day after their
deaths when some of them were re-
united

  and behind them rust gathered again
in the hinges of the door and the lichens
and mosses and all the green vines
gathered more thickly still upon the

stones that formed the tomb of the
bishop

  but the key had been cut into two
pieces and one of the men had taken
one half and his younger brother had
taken the other and the movements of
that last half have been told elsewhere
at some length

  over the tomb of the bishop crawled
another hundred years but if you had
chanced to enter you would have noticed
perhaps that there was now a feeling
within that some one else was present
perhaps if you had laid your ear very
close to the casket where the book lay
you would have heard a faint rustling
inside that sounded like a very small
mouse that could not or would not be
quiet and then you would have left i
am sure

two men walked in the old gunnar
park and came to the garden long
grown over with weeds

  one was an old man apparently but
his wrinkles and white hair came from an
inward trouble and not from the piti-
less claws of time

  the other obviously the son of the
first mentioned was but just come at his
maturity there was a look in his young
eyes that spoke of evil things that no
man should know and live lest the rest
of the world should find cause to regret
after it was too late to prevent knowledge
from becoming unspeakable action

  leon gunnar had married in scotland
apprenticed his only son to a warlock
sorcerer in the hope that the resultant
learning would provide a way to fight the
black master to whom he had bound him-
self and now with but a day remaining
of the thirty years that he had been
allowed by the pact to which he had
agreed had come with his son after the
book which had something in it that the
younger man must know


weird tales

  in a thicket a monstrosity gloated and
hugged itself and chattered in a voice
more shrill than any bat as it watched
the culmination of a long-planned re-
venge

  it was close when they unlocked the
door with a shining new key made from
the pattern of the split and rusty one its
voice was so high that the older man
could not hear it at all as they pried back
the aged door with all their strength and
short iron bars the senses of the young
warlock were made keen by his training
and he stopped his work to listen but
the master was more cunning than he and
made no more noises

  it was alert and waiting for its chance
when they entered the tomb of the bishop
and saw there upon the rotten old casket
what they had long desired 

  it was watching when the younger
man came out of the tomb with the
precious book in his arms and it tittered
nervously when leon gunnar thought
he heard a noise inside the old casket
and turned back to listen

  the young scottish warlock was on his
knees in the weeds tearing off the cover-
ings from the old book when he heard a
tiny noise behind him he looked back

  the door that jiad almost defied the
combined strength of two strong men
was closing by itself without a creak or
rasp from the rust-eaten hinges

  from inside the tomb came a scream
that held all the terror imaginable to the
mind of man

  the young man cried out father
in agony of spirit and reached for the
edge of the door

  a mist swirled before him there out
of which stared two red burning eyes
without a sound he dropped in his
tracks and the door closed

  inside leon gunnar had seen before
the tomb went dark the old wooden

casket crumble into dust it was atthe
sight of the horror that sat upright in
that heap of punk its jaws clicking and
its bony arms reaching out for him that
he had screamed

  it was then he knew that his thirty
years of life had come to an end


after a long while the iron door
l opened and a third individual ap-
peared in the opening about four feet
in height the master was wrapped from
head to foot in a cloak of black that hid
all of his form except his glittering eyes
in them lurked a suspicion of moisture
as he looked upon the interior of the
tomb where bits of dry hard bones min-
gled with scraps of tattered flesh

  could it be possible that the master
felt regret for the end he had plotted

  had the young warlock not been un-
conscious outside that place of sudden
and frightful death and had he heard
the masters low soliloquy any impres-
sion of this nature would have been con-
firmed

  i have been a fool said the master
to himself and i have made one of my
few mistakes i gave only a will to tear
and mangle to that heap of dry bones i
should have instructed it to save enough
of the body intact so that i could use it
there is nothing here of value to me

  he directed his piercing gaze into a
comer of the dark chamber

  you have won gunnar through no
wisdom of yours our past is ended and
you are free your boy i shall allow to
return to scotland when he awakes to
learn more magic i will meet him again
when he is worth fighting leon gunnar
take your freedom

  something shot by the master and out
of the door with the zip of an arrow
audible only to the black dwarfs senses

  slowly he closed the iron door and
men of steel



turned the key the vines fell into place
again and there was silence and darkness
and peace in the hidden tomb of the for-
gotten bishop

  and the worm who is lord of us all

came in the night and found that there-
in which made him merry but the young
warlock was far away with the book of
ill omen and no one knows where the
master went in deep regret

men of steel

      by ainslee jenkins

                a vicious swing of his
                right hand caught ared
                haggard on the jaw

i still remember above all else
ared haggards smile

that you might think is not un-
usual but when you have heard this
fantastic tale to its end - and set me
down perhaps for a weak-witted crea-
ture whose mind the brooding desert has
turned-you will wonder that it is the
smile i recall so distinctly

  you however never saw ared hag-
gard smile

  picture a long blankly white face
etched over with a hundred intercrossing
lines a thin prow of a nose and on
either side of it two deeply imbedded

low-lidded eyes a fat sensual underlip
its color the livid purple of a fresh
bruise contrasting oddly with the lean
twisted upper one a straight chin with
the black bristles of a harsh beard

  the lips though were the things that
wrought ared haggards smile and it is
that twitching smile planted undyingly
in my memory which bids me set down
this story

  on the lonely reaches of the great mo-
jave desert you can not pick and choose
amongst your neighbors to the contrary
you must be thankful if you even have
one ared haggard was mine and


weird tales

though from the very first some wary
sixth sense warned me that here was a
man dangerously different from all
others i welcomed his presence and did
my best through fairly frequent visits to
cultivate and strengthen our friendship

  he was i gathered comparatively
wealthy and thus able to humor his
slightest whim an eccentric certainly
otherwise why had he purchased the
rambling grotesque castle he lived in
miners folly they called the place
and a folly it definitely was years ago
some pick-and-panner had struck it rich
and as many of them do in similar cases
built for himself this huge castle set just
below the cadaverous ribs of one of the
mojaves barren mountain ranges the
structure had been lonely and deserted
for years when ared haggard chanced
upon it evidently it had appealed to
him for hed purchased it and converted
it to his own obscure purposes as ive
said

  this particular evening i had felt the
need of some type of conversation no
matter how morbid - as haggards
usually was-and had accordingly paced
the three miles which separated my little
shack and miners folly hundreds of
yards off id heard the baying of his
gaunt wolf-hound which always heralded
my approach and haggard was standing
under the raised portcullis of the doorway
when i trudged up portcullis yes
that miner had followed the plan of a
mediaeval castle to the smallest detail

  even in the fast-thickening gloom i
could detea a change in the mans man-
ner and when i came closer i saw that his
eyes were burningly alive restless even
eager he stretched out his bony hands
and grasped my shoulders and then actu-
ally slapped me on the back never be-
fore had i been granted such a greeting

  im glad wells his harsh impatient
voice told me that youve come over to-

night i want somebody to talk to i was
even thinking of going over to fetch you
but come inside and let old tom give
you a glass of my very particular port
wine the occasion needs some celebrat-
ing

  occasion i said puzzled what
occasion

  but he only shook his head and led
me into the high-raftered main room of
his castle

  as far as i was concerned it might
have been the only room of the place for
id never been through any of the others
there were others of course but the tall
bolt-studded doors which led to them
were forever closed and haggard simply
didnt hear me whenever id suggested
inspecting them ill admit that this silent
refusal had put an edge to my curiosity
often id laughingly accused him of being
a second bluebeard with his dread secrets
locked up in those mysterious rooms
some night he once said ill show
you them   

   was this i wondered to be the night

when we were seated in the squat
leather chairs which haggard fa-
vored old tom true to his masters word
brought us glasses of a rich port wine
and we both lit cigarettes old tom was
haggards lone servant a tall dark na-
vajo indian some affliction had rendered
him dumb though he could hear very
well and this fortunate combination made
him in my opinion the perfect menial
 haggards white face seemed to be
hanging suspended before me in the half-
light he had drained the drink with a
gulp and was i could see itching to
speak

   well i began to start him off why
so anxious to have me over tonight hag-
gard

  he leaned forward and his eyes with
their pin-points of flame ran over my

                     w t -
men of steel



whole body i felt curiously naked under
that concentrated stare i laughed some-
what uneasily and repeated the question

  youve wondered i suppose wells
he rasped finally why i live up here as
i do a hellish life eh no reason for
it you of course write and stick your-
self away in the desert because of its sol-
itude but i-ah why have i secluded
myself in this crazy castle a mystery
isnt it he chuckled delightedly

  i said hurriedly of course i have
conjectured sometimes about your pur-
pose in coming up here i supposed that
you were sick as i was of the noise and
brawl of the city or perhaps its your
health

  not he murmured my health oh
no no but ill tell you this wells the
deserts a marvelous place for more things
than writing  

  youve got a hobby then i asked

  the question had a peculiar effect on
him his lips positively writhed and the
uneven rows of his yellowish teeth
showed through in a ghastly smile
smile it shouldnt be called a smile a
smile is warm and human and friendly
haggards might have been friendly but
human-it wasnt human

  at that moment i was downright
afraid of him

  a hobby he said slowly you can
call it that wells if you like yes i
have a hobby so did edison have a
hobby and steinmetz and thousands be-
fore them thousands of whom the av-
erage mans never heard thousands who
followed their calling in the ignorant
superstition-ridden middle ages when
the slightest rumor about them meant a
horrible torturous death those men-
the astrologers alchemists scientists of
mediaeval times-are my heroes wells
and to them ive dedicated-my hobby

  strange uncanny talk in the wavering
gloom of that fantastic desert castle with
w t-

the night wind moaning through the sage
and sand outside

  then i said essaying a nervous
little laugh its your hobby that you keep
concealed behind those mysterious
doors

  he nodded his lank head there cer-
tainly seemed to be a fascination for him
in running his prying eyes over my body
he did it constantly yes he muttered
behind those doors i intended at first
to take you through them tonight but now
i think ill reserve that pleasure for you
till the final triumphant instant then
itll be twice the thrill it would be now
oh youre fortunate wells youre for-
tunate youve got the experience of a
lifetime coming to you

  the experience i repeated of a
lifetime

  yes he wagged his head gleefully
a thing to remember to your dying
day

  he suddenly fell silent as if brooding
then he peered up at me i just recalled
it he said didnt you say something
about your fiancee coming to see you

  i smiled i always smiled when i
thought of jean erskine wed been en-
gaged for i dont know how long wait-
ing till i could afford our marriage jean
told me repeatedly i was a stilted fool not
to accept for a while her comfortable
income but i couldnt abide the thought
of it you know the feeling

  yes i confirmed shes going to

weird tales

  too out of whats behind those locked
doors youre so curious about

  i overlooked the commanding tone of
his invitation haggard was like that

  cant you give me an inkling of its
nature i asked nothing thatll upset
her is it

  again that contortion of his lips oh
no i wouldnt ask her otherwise you
may rest assured of that wells   
but more i wont tell you i want the
glory the magnificence the triumph of it
to take you by surprize i want - but
enough ill say no more thursday night
you will be admitted to the secret of se-
crets the most splendid achievement ever
consummated by man the ultimate con-
quest of mind over matter

  his tone had risen to that of a fanatic
his sunken eyes streamed fire his gaunt
face was alight his hurtling words
boomed challengingly through the vasty
hall for the moment i was forgotten
haggards mind i am convinced had
soared to an immortal realm once more
i felt a tingling shiver scamper up my
spine and i told myself that jean and i
would keep away from miners folly
on thursday night   

  but curiosity is with love and hunger
the great impelling force of life and it
was my damnable curiosity that con-
quered my dread and brought me back to
that cursed house on thursday night

  soon after i left ared haggard had
slumped down in his chair he did not
even rise to see me to the door i stole
out and the romping gust of the icy
sage-spiced wind drove from my head the
queer words and half hinted at thoughts
i had heard i walked slowly revelling
in the deep clear purple of the desert
night listening to the crooned symphony
of breeze and sage and sand shot through
occasionally with the far-away whining
yap of a slinking coyote

my own house is a rude hut of three
flimsy rooms the door has no
lock you do not need one on the desert
i strode zestfully up to it shoved it open
stepped in - and was immediately con-
scious that there was some one in the
house

  no electric light of course i fumbled
with a match struck it and in the quick
wavering flare i saw him

 who

  old tom haggards navajo servant

  he was standing there impassively
awaiting me i muffled an ejaculation of
surprize and lit a lamp then i turned
to him the obvious question on my lips

  whats wrong

  he gestured for pencil and paper his
only way of communication i found
them and watched him scrawl three shaky
words on the white typewriter sheet

  i-am-afraid

  his dumb peculiarly dog-like eyes
rested on me as i read his message i
glanced up and jerked

  of what

  he shook his head his brown gnarled
old face wore an expression of puzzlement
tinged with fear

  write it down i commanded
what are you afraid of

  he took some time over his next sen-
tence writing was a great labor to him
but finally it lay before me and i scanned
it with a feeling of unreality

 i-am-afraid-of-mister-hag-
gard

  i	laughed what else could i do
then the memory of haggards wild
flaming eyes and wisted smile came upon
me and i fell silent and asked him more
soberly

  why

  i	did not like to read the words he put
down in reply but they were there more
ominous and chilling than if theyd been
spoken
men of steel



  he-is mad

  there was a sudden surge of wind and
the door rattled on its hinges almost i
expected to see it swing open and re-
veal haggard piercing us with his devil-
ish eyes i dragged it back and stared out-
side but there was nothing except the
ghostly stretch of the desert and the crin-
kled outflung shadow of a joshua tree

  what makes you think hes mad
tom

   his painful writing answered

  he works-on a-great machine he
-looks-at me-with eyes-of-mad-
ness

   i too had seen those eyes but i put
the old indians alarm down to haggards
excitement and the deep superstition of
the navajo race i tried to cheer him up

  nonsense tom he looks at me in
the same way-looks at everybody like
that hes just excited about his machine
or invention or whatever it is you
neednt worry hell get back to normal
after thursday night when hes ex-
plained the thing to me

  but tom was writing again and the
words were

  you-must-not-come-thursday
you must-keep away

   i laughed again no ill be there i
said im too curious now go home
and get a good sleep youre tired and
worn out youre seeing things that arent
so dont worry tom mr haggards
far from mad

  yes he was indeed far from mad

  old tom looked at me once more with
his plaintive dumb eyes then he turned
and slowly silently trudged out of the
house and faded into the mystic night

   fool that i was to let him go witless
unseeing selfish fool had i but known
-had i but been able to see a few hours
in advance

   but its useless to waste vain regrets i
was to blame for old toms fate and the

thought has fanged and accused me ever
since

  for when the navajo returned to
miners folly-however let me tell the
tale as it happened

i slept soundly that night one does
on the desert no matter what the
events of the day and in the morning i
followed my regular routine a stiff brac-
ing walk breakfast of the customary eggs
and bacon and then work

   i was writing at that time a series of
rather boring articles on the great west-
ern deserts for some geographical maga-
zine and i devoted a portion to the in-
dians that inhabited them this necessi-
tated a bit of research on my part and
most of the day i spent in delving into a
few musty volumes i fortunately had on
the subject quite accidentally i hap-
pened to strike a chapter explaining in
detail the sign language of the indian
tribes the art of speaking through ges-
tures of the hands it interested me and
i read it thoroughly

  but my mind was really occupied with
thoughts of jean erskines approaching
visit if you ever saw her youd under-
stand how it was

  so passed tuesday wednesday i real-
ly proved just how crazy i was over the
girl i cleaned up the house

  i did not have occasion to go near
miners folly and the strange appear-
ance of old tom and his fears passed
gradually from my mind

  and early thursday morning jean
rode out of the desert a guide bringing
her safely through the sandy wastes to my
home

  she was radiantly beautiful in the
fresh streaming sunlight i could see that
her guide a raw-boned bronzed typical
desert westerner had fallen for her al-
ready and i didnt blame him jeans like
that this chap put off leaving as long


weird tales

as he could and when i offered him a
cup of coffee he almost split his long face
with a grateful grin jean immediately
began to fuss around the house crying
out now and again at the perfect atrocity
of my arrangements and disturbing all
my loving work she didnt want any
coffee so the guide and i sat down by
ourselves in the kitchen-which didnt
please him any too much

  say mistuh wells he drawled
slowly pouring a full five spoons of
sugar into his drink yuh got a queer
neighbor oveh here

  ared haggard

  yes suh he said emphatically
thats th one i reckon hes kinda
cracked aint he

  strikes me as being sane enough i
said smiling has he got the reputa-
tion of being a bit cracked

  well suh my guest announced i
aint got no defnite dope on him but i
sure do know hes hauled an awful lot o
funny-lookin junk into that theh crazy
castle o his

  whos this asked jean coming out
from the other room some one near
here

  the guide grinned bashfully at her
mistuh ared haggard he informed
her he lives just a mite away from
here in a doggone crazy castle we call
miners folly

  castle repeated jean oh jim
you must take me over to see it

  hes asked us there tonight i told
her i didnt know whether youd
want to go or not

  i could see that her curiosity was
aroused for she said emphatically that
she certainly did want to go at which
statement the guide perked up his ears

  i dunno he muttered as how id
go oveh theh-specially at night yuh
see miss this fellah comes down t th
village ever oncet in a while an hauls ud

a lot o queer-lookin machinery dog-
gone f i know whut he wants it foh

  i informed jean that haggard evi-
dently had some kind of an invention he
wished to demonstrate to us hes an
unusual type of person i finished but
perfectly harmless youd like to go
then

  i would she said and that sealed
the matter

  the guide had sunk into the very
gloomiest of moods and he soon took his
leave muttering unintelligible things
about ared haggard jean sped him on
his way with a smile however and that
cheered him up some then she came
and sat with me and we talked we
went all over the old ground-she trying
to urge me to leave this awful place
and be sensible about the financial diffi-
culty which was postponing our wedding
and i just as firmly refused

  after a dreamy afternoon the shades
of night stole over and cooled the desert
and transformed its rawness into a thing
of soft beauty well said jean
youre just a pig-headed stubborn old
fool and i dont like you a bit now
let me get some dinner and well go and
see this mysterious mr haggard

  so we set out

when i look back on it all i marvel
i wonder that at the time i did not
foresee the horror into which we were
placidly walking and yet i suppose i
was not so terribly to blame it is hard
to realize how very thin the veneer of
civilization of normalcy is-how easily
an individual deluded by opium-like
dreams can smash it and recreate for
awhile the barbarous savagery of the dim
ages

  we walked slowly my arm around
her and i knew perfect contentment
the evening was at its most beautiful
men of steel



state romantic ideal i was indeed
happy

  the first glimpse of the castle how-
ever changed that mood it seemed to
sound a muttered hushed prelude of
what was to come-of the hidden beast
soon to spring upon us   

  i had never seen miners folly look
so ominous

  the hulking hills behind it threw a
mantle of deep shadows over its gro-
tesque walls in the rear of the place i
seemed to glimpse lurking figures
shadow-cloaked the very air was still and
charged with a peculiar tautness

  i know that jean felt it as well as i
did for she looked up at me and ex-
claimed what an uncanny spot this is

  it impresses me more that way this
evening than ever before i said
dyou think wed better turn back

  she laughed at my suggestion but
she admitted i have a curious sensation
of-of being watched does your friend
haggard always watch the approaching
guest

  no i told her but i cant blame
him for watching you at which she
laughed again

  we walked into the brooding shadow
of the doorway the great door swung
silently open-and there peering at us
from the dark hall were haggards eyes

  for a moment i was wordless and
while we stood there like dumb fools
there was a rattle and a slithering noise
and behind us the raised portcullis
dropped down effectively barring us in

  good lord i exclaimed involun-
tarily what-

  then haggard came forward with
that smile on his lips

  i must apologize he murmured i
did not mean to frighten you-merely
wished to show the young lady what a
really complete mediaeval castle this is

  overcoming my astonishment i re-

membered my manners and introduced
them

  delighted miss erskine said ared
haggard that you braved my idiosyn-
crasies and came here tonight please
excuse me for alarming you with that
contraption

  his eyes positively gloated over her
body

  it did rather astonish me she ad-
mitted but what a curious place you
have here mr haggard

  curious he said curious well
perhaps it suits me however exactly
sit down wont you andhave a drink

  i noticed that he brought the wine
himself this time

  wheres old tom i asked

  busy said ared haggard busy
in the rear youll see him presently

   and we did see him presently   

   i still shiver when i think of it

   at any rate we all seated ourselves in
the somehow pregnant silence of the
lofty hall and i did my best to encourage
a cheerful conversation so did jean
but after a few minutes words died on
my lips and i became conscious of a
strange new noise-a strange new sensa-
tion rather

  it was a low vibrant humming a
humming that did not assault the ear
only it seemed rather to enter the whole
body and to set the fibers and muscles
and nerves quivering in sympathy with it
the nerves i believe particularly for its
deep almost inaudible buzzing soon had
me irritable and jumpy and at the same
time afraid-of what i do not know i
was conscious of the steel-barred port-
cullis of the heavy tightly closed doors
of the fact that i was absolutely unarmed
i tried to convince myself that i was a
suspicious fool and strove to ignore that
persistent humming but i could not
it pierced through all my weak defenses
and i glanced uneasily at ared haggard


weird tales

  he was watching me with the eyes of
a hawk

  he was waiting for something wait-
ing waiting

  waiting for what

  and then i remembered the rich port
wine he had given us my god that
was it even as i thought of it the dim
walls above seemed to crumple to sway
to jig and dance and pound to the
rhythm of the hypnotic humming and
soon the narrowed gleaming eyes of
ared haggard had joined that mad caper-
ing they too were leaping up and down
up and down up and down   

  frantically i stared at jean erskine
her head had fallen over on her shoul-
der she was asleep drugged

  i dragged at my limbs i forced my
leaden lips open an abortive shriek came
from them in the guise of a miserable
groan i tried to get up and trembling
half arose then my legs turned to
clay i staggered and fell

  ared haggards thin eyes surveyed
our helpless bodies mockingly mock-
ingly-and triumphantly

  this was the night we were to see his
invention only now can i understand
the grim sardonic humor of the man the
way he toyed with me deliberately baited
and enticed me through my curiosity

  yes we were to see his invention we
were to feel it

have you ever been under ether
you have an inkling then of the
sensations utterly mad and fantastic
which surged through my brain during
that helpless period when i lay a victim
of the drugs of the master of miners
folly

  i seem to recall a malevolent lank
face with the smile of the devil himself
scourging its lips coming close to mine
and shudderingly i remember the foul
beat of its breath i could not avoid it

i was no better than a limp corpse i
did not know whom this grinning face
belonged to for there was of course no
remembrance in my doped brain of pre-
vious events i recall being slung like a
bag of flour over a bony shoulder a
bolt-studded door opened i was carried
i think into a large white room bathed
in the most awful radiance i have ever
beheld i could not then define it i
was merely conscious of it

  next in this macabre distorted epi-
sode there came the vision of a hideous
monster with a huge jerkily moving
body of dull metal

   i remember feeling the press of straps
being fastened around me binding me to
some kind of chair before me moved
two figures one lean and long-legged
the other the monster of steel

   then i sank into a black gulf and ap-
parently slept of this time i recall ab-
solutely nothing

  outside the night thickened the
moon was on the other side of the world
only a slow wind moaned around the
desert castle called miners folly

   at about twelve i think i awoke

  i did not know for the moment
where i was the first thing i saw when
my senses had partially returned was the
bound gagged figure of jean erskine
harnessed to a peculiar chair over which
hung a round headpiece of sheeny metal
sprouting a myriad of spidery wires

  i tried to call to her i could not
my mouth too was gagged

   it was then that i turned my attention
to the rest of the room and it was then
that my blood choked icily in my veins
it was then that the full realization of the
situation we were in smote me with a
sickening thud and it was then that
i cursed myself and felt the pricking
sweat spurt through my pores

  for we were behind those mysterious
locked doors we were face to face with
men of steel



the deviltry i had unknowingly called
ared haggards hobby

   jean and i were alone for the moment
in the room and i was staring with
bulging eyes at a contraption whidi i do
not even pretend to understand a con-
traption which still leads me to believe
that ared haggard was a genius-not a
madman no madman could have de-
vised and perfected that machine it
came from a cool and logical brain not a
disordered one although to be sure a
genius is not a normal person he lives
in a world apart from ours

  to begin with set in the white floor
perhaps five feet in front of me was a
deep vat in which simmered a liquid that
astounded my eyes with its constantly
changing colors and more amazing
still this liquid seemed oddly transpar-
ent for i could plainly see the bottom of
the vat through it

  next i discovered that the chair in
which jean was bound had small wheels
on its legs and these wheels were set on
a pair of miniature rails resembling
street-car lines and-good lord-the
rails led to the brink of the liquid-filled
vat

   my chair was similarly outfitted

  in the rear of the room bulked a huge
black device shaped like a dynamo and
from this droned the low humming i had
heard earlier in the evening a confusion
of cables led from it some extending to
the vat in the floor wrapping around it
i judged underground others went to a
sort of switchboard arrangement from
which fresh relays of cables wound to a
flat platform that reminded me of an
operating-table and on this table lay
two grotesque hideous figures molded
in the external form of human bodies

   but they were made of steel

  then with a shudder i recalled the
man of metal that had moved jerkily be-

fore my drug-crazed eyes when i was first
carried into this room

  was that man a reality i hardly
dared think

   i noticed jeans eyelids begin to flicker
presently they opened full and she gazed
at me she did not as yet realize where
she was i prayed that by some mercy
the drug would have a lingering effect on
her brain and that she would not be
fully conscious of whatever we were
doomed to suffer

  but the horror that dawned and grew
in her large eyes forced me to abandon
that hope

  i could not speak could not comfort
and reassure her-that was the hell of it
i could merely stare and try vainly to
speak to her through my eyes

  a mad idea of struggling free entered
my head i inspected as best i could
my bonds i found that tight leather
straps circled my body just above the el-
bows clamping the upper parts of my
arms to me allowing me to move the
lower part freely my legs were also
tied to the chair i thought of tearing
the gag from my mouth with my free
hands but this proved hopeless the
head was held firmly upward and my
fingers could not reach it by at least three
inches

  no use no use there was no es-
cape

  at that moment one of the doors
swung open and ared haggard
stepped into the room

  he did not appear to notice us but
walked to the switchboard fiddled with
a few levers and then put what looked
like a pair of radio earphones on his
head for some time he listened again
adjusted the levers and next pulled full
over a large control switch

  the low humming soared upward
grew to a quick vibrant drone hag-
gard appeared to be satisfied he took


weird tales

off the headphones and walked toward
us his captives

  i imagine the look in my eyes must
have been murderous for he glanced at
me and then laughed-a harsh delib-
erate cackle

  my dear wells he chuckled im
afraid youre taking this altogether in the
wrong spirit please try to see it in its
true light you and the young lady are
-er-lending your valuable selves to a
glorious enterprise not a mad butchering
of bodies im sorry that i was of neces-
sity such a poor host tonight but youll
realize i feel positive that the course i
took was the only possible one really
i swear to you if you were capable of
conducting this operation id willingly
change places with you you look at it
in such a material way mans progress
must always be made through sacrifice
the scientist the prophet of a new day is
forced to stern measures in order to bring
about his improvements you can rest
assured that in after years your name and
that of your fiancee will be hallowed and
honored will be always coupled with
that of ared haggard though you do
not realize it now that alone is ample
reward for what you must submit to to-
night

  he glanced down at the vat of radiant
liquid

  this he continued is a mixture of
various chemicals which neutralizes cer-
tain acidic forces in the body and aggra-
vates others you will find i believe
that the vat treatment is the only down-
right uncomfortable one of the whole
process i really envy you your expe-
rience of it your nervous reactions after
a few moments of rather painful penetra-
tion you will have the feeling of leaving
your body of floating in an ecstatical
medium the head-clamp youll observe
just over your chairs will transfer certain
qualities of your brain to the steel figures

over there this involves a profound
formula never yet stumbled upon by
science it plants in the robots-but wait
ill demonstrate the thing to you he
held up a lean forefinger

  remember he pronounced slowly
and gravely this is not an experiment
my method has been proved h is a
reality

he turned to the open door which
led into a room behind the one we
were in

  come he said sharply

  there was a dull heavy tread a
monster seemed to be moving and
then there strode in a thing that eclipses
the figments of the craziest nightmare

  it was the man of metal

  it stood about six feet five its trunk
was merely a barrel-like casing of steel
squat on top of it was the creatures head
resembling the casque of mediaeval
knights mechanical yes but from
the head glowed two eyes that were
alive

  they were now fixed dumbly on hag-
gard who stood surveying it smilingly
the things arms swung from ball-like
swivels imbedded in the huge shoulders
one of them ended in short stumpy fin-
gers the other a pointed sharp shear it
stood on wide pads of feet stood firmly
solidly

  i saw that jean had closed her eyes
and i was grateful

  bend over ordered haggard and
the creature instantly bent jerkily but as
if sure of what it was doing

  straighten up

  each command it followed exactly
precisely

  the power of individual thought
said ared haggard has been excluded
in short the robot has no soul though
possessing the other human qualities of
hearing seeing and obeying orders
men of steel



this one can not speak why because
the man it was formed from was dumb
my god it struck me like a thunder-
bolt this was old tom the navajo
servant

  i strained at my gag my bonds use-
less useless

  yes said ared haggard as if read-
ing my thoughts this is the navajo in-
dian you knew as old tom unfortu-
nately he was the only material i had to
experiment with you can see why i
wanted two perfect bodies to transform
into robot shape

  can you appreciate what this inven-
tion means armies of robots the con-
summation of the mechanical age

  thus he talked i watched his thin
eyes his triumphant face his leering
smile and i knew we could expect no
mercy from him

  it will make me he said master of
the world but enough i have par-
tially explained  the beauties of the
method to you you can thus appreciate
it  i think i will take the girl first
he returned to the switchboard put on
the earphones touched a lever imme-
diately the helmet-like thing above jeans
chair swung down fitting neatly over her
head the noise of the motor leaped to
an infernal roar in the vat the liquid
bubbled anew a veritable rainbow of
dazzling colors rioting through it hag-
gard pressed a button the chair in which
the girl was bound rolled with terrible
deliberation toward the edge of the vat

  this was agony i strained tried
vainly to release myself

  and then a mad hope flashed through
my brain

  haggards back was toward me he
was hunched over listening intently
waiting i fancy for the exact moment to
plunge the victim into the simmering
fluid old tom-the robot rather-
was standing where his master had left

him his ghastly eyes pointed by some
chance toward me but there was of
course no recognition no thought no
life in them

  jeans chair was slowly tilting on the
brink in a second haggard would cut
her bonds and so force her into the liquid

  then with desperate concentration i
raised my hands waved them to at-
tract the robots attention pounded one
fist into the palm of the other

 why

  the indian sign language

  would he respond would he under-
stand again i repeated the signal

meaning you- and this time i

thought i could detea a gleam of com-
prehension in the metal monsters star-
ing eyes

  frantically my hands moved and he
was watching me you i signaled
release-me and repeated it again
and again

  it was then that i blessed my casual
study of the hand language-a study
which i had paid much attention to years
before and which i had refreshed just
two days ago

  for the robot moved ponderously
toward me

  i could have shouted in my exultation
haggard was still stooped at the switch-
board the roar of the machine was
deafening and jean had seen what i
was attempting to do there was hope in
the eyes that had previously held hope-
lessness

  the robots right hand raised jerkily
the shear sped down-and sliced through
a portion of my bonds

  my arms were free

  haggard must have sensed something
for of a sudden he whirled around a
roar came from his twisted lips he sprang
toward us he shouted an order at the
robot but the tumult of the machinery
drowned it


weird tales

  my legs were free

  i bounded up still partially gagged
but otherwise gloriously capable a
vicious swing of my right hand caught
ared haggard flush on his pointed jaw
he staggered flailed at me but i was
sure of myself i stepped back and
belted him cleanly again

 the blow drove him back he
tripped and fell shrieking into the vat
of chemicals

  horror-struck i rushed up and peered
down into the liquid the sight sent a
shiver over me

  the mans clothes seemed to have van-
ished his whole naked body had gone
a weird greenish-white as i watched
it changed to a purpiy tint his face
was that of a dead man yet there must
still have been consciousness in him for
before my bulging eyes his lips writhed
-and he smiled

  i couldnt stand it that smile fev-
erishly i undid jean erskine hauled her
from the chair she slipped down onto
the floor in a faint then i rushed to
the switchboard with some crazy notion
of stopping the roaring machine as i
pulled frantically at the switches i beheld

one of the metal figures on the operating-
table stir slightly it was coming to
life

  i jammed over the main switch there
was a crash and an insane bellow and
clouds of dense white smoke billowed
into the room i saw tongues of fire
lick out with what strength i had left
i picked up the girl and staggered from
the place

  the portcullis barred the main en-
trance but i broke one of the long win-
dows shoved jean through and finally
felt the breath of the sane night once
more on my brow

  a second later it seemed there was a
rending explosion and miners folly
crumpled to the ground

i have never set foot on that desert
since men might have discovered
and wondered at the ruins of the castle-
i do not know i am content with my
wife and my life with her has partially
erased the scars of the night ared hag-
gard showed us his hobby

  partially i said yes nothing can
erase the memory of his last smile

weird tales

  i suppose we might as well eat said
larry if what that chap said is o k
miss scudderll be here in safety pres-
ently

  that statement does give one appe-
tite returned the old doctor come
gemma dont be so terrified they dont
intend to harm us as far as i can see
calm yourself my girl

  the italian girl stood before him her
head hanging then she raised her oval
face and the liquid dark eyes met his
with such terror in their depths that he
felt a cold shudder run over him

  you tell me to be calm and un-
afraid sir why how can i when they
have brought pan back to earth is it
possible you dont know what that
means

  job scudder cut her short bruskly
dont make a fool of yourself gem-
ma pan is nothing but a myth

  doctor peabody turned a troubled face
upon his friend

  im not so sure of that job he said

  dont tell me that you-

  my friend what is happening to us is
so incredible that it makes me feel that
nothing is impossible to people who have
set their wills upon it returned the doc-
tor seriously i am sure that this kid-
napping has at its root-he lowered his
voice cautiously-the theft of the stone
i am carrying to the circle of light
let diem have it by all means if
theyll let us all go job urged with
eagerness a geological specimen sur-
rounded by an old womans fanciful no-
tions    would you let that stand in the
way of our freedom from this intolerable
situation

  the doctor shook his white head slow-
ly lips compressed

  that i can not do i mean job i
must keep my word to old hannah
moreover i am convinced that matters of

grave import depend upon the safe de-
livery of that talisman into the right
hands well we shall see what we shall
see meantime as quint suggested sup-
pose we have breakfast whatever is to
happen we will be the better for nour-
ishment i must admit that i am hungry
he confessed with a half-smile

  i dont know that i can eat began
job but the doctors hand under his
elbow urged him toward the table the
party followed the example of the two
older men and were soon distributed
about upon the divans

  the serving women brought a con-
vincingly modern breakfast of orange-
juice bacon eggs rolls coffee and mar-
malade gemma alone could not eat her
terrified eyes rolled toward the door
every few minutes as if she expected
something fearful and portentous to ap-
pear at the threshold and wished to be
ready to hide herself when it came

the party had hardly started to eat
when a sound at the door caught
their attention henry winch holding
the airedale on the leash came briskly
into the room scanning all the faces
there with anxiety

  wheres leda he asked abruptly of
job

  larrys head turned and he stared sus-
piciously at the speaker who took such a
liberty

  quint says shell be here presently
replied job scudder quickly better eat
winch while youve the chance none
of us knows what were confronting

  henry winch shook his head

  i cant eat said he but whiskers
could and suki i presume

  on the dogs now patient and accus-
tomed back suki was riding in triumph
gemma called the marmoset to her and
began peeling a banana for the tiny ani-
the portal to power



mal when the airedale sniffed the air
wistfully the italian girl snatched up a
platter from the table and regaled the
dog with bacon and eggs

  henry winch replied to the queries of
die doctor that he had been drugged in
some way or chloroformed and had
wakened to find himself on a divan in a
great room and that immediately he had
regained consciousness quint must have
been sent for quint had told him that
the rest of the party were waiting for him

  as he talked his anxious eyes were
always on the door and at last his watch-
fulness was rewarded at the sound of
advancing feet the sentinels stood to one
side to permit the entrance of a gilded
litter carried by four men as black as
ebony their muscular bodies draped with
leopardskins the litter was set upon
the ground and the black bearers stood
back folding great arms upon their
chests faces impassive

  leda cried out henry winch
springing to the litter and drawing
heavily embroidered curtains to one side
with a clatter of sliding rings leda
leda speak to me

  he leaned down frantically

  doctor peabody is she-- agon-
ized entreaty rang in the secretarys voice

  old job had somehow reached the lit-
ter before the physician could rise from
his divan the tired gray face bent down
with one hand he motioned back the
crowding larry gemma and sir hubert

  give her air ordered the doctor
pushing his way among them shes
perfectly all right he added after a
moments brief examination coming
out of a faint thats all

  henry winchs keen young eyes did
not move from the pale face of the girl
who lay back among the silken cushions
when her lips trembled slightly and her
eyelids lifted drowsily a kind of sobbing

came from his throat leda he whis-
pered low and tenderly come back
dear

  as if his voice had crossed the thresh-
old of her drifting consciousness the girl
opened her eyes widely crying out as she
did so hubert help help

  sir hubert uttered a choking sound his
eyes seeking those of the italian girl who
rewarded him with a look of utter hate
and scorn then knelt at her mistresss
side

  padrona it is gemma

  leda raised herself to a sitting posture
and looked about her in a half-dazed
manner her gaze drifted over gemma
sir hubert larry weaver it rested for
a moment upon henry winchs solicitous
face it passed the doctor by and
wavered to old job her arms lifted to
him her one secure refuge

  uncle job save me uncle job save
me from the goat-man

  she was safe in his arms against his
heart then over her head that lay on his
breast old jobs eyes sought his friends
stark amazement and dire dismay was in
his own

  it was gemma who voiced their
thoughts

  she has seen pan pan is unleashed
upon the world dio

  she beat her breast with clenched fists
wailing

  take that woman to the other end of
the room and make her shut up or-
dered the doctor sharply to larry weaver
who raised the shrieking girl and half
led half dragged her to the other side of
the table

  will you save me can you sobbed
leda hysterically all her young bravado
gone look

  she tore at that coronet above her
smooth brow but the old doctor stayed
her hand gently


weird tales

  wait my dear until we know what
this means it may be wiser to leave that
insignia of high authority where it is
now

  these clothes gasped leda

  most becoming the doctor reassured
her in a matter-of-fact voice his eyes far
away nevertheless just calm yourself
my dear and tell us exactly what has up-
set you

  the tone the direct query calmed
leda she withdrew from her uncles
embrace shamefacedly dashing away the
tears of sheer terror and panic that had
sprung to her brown eyes

  doctor they have a monstrosity down
here that they worship a thing like a
goat but with a mans body above the
waist she explained trying her best to
keep the high note of hysteria from her
voice he even had little black horns
   and quint called it pan

  a loud wail greeted the last word
gemma rocking her body to and fro
despairingly sobbed louder than ever

  the old physicians face was grave
then these clothes and your coronet
signify something

  im supposed to become the high
priestess of that goat-thing

  suddenly ledas sense of humor got
the better of her now that she was back
in her own party she saw the look of
solicitude plainly portrayed on the face of
the secretary her pride braced her into
a burst of laughter

  this is too absurd cried out leda
quint said that if i didnt comply with
their wishes you folks would be thrown
to the pan-worshippers to be torn to bits
this masquerade is too silly for words
i mean now isnt it idiotic

  larry lend me your pistol will you
if i get near that disgusting goat-thing
again im going to see what its made of
if its flesh and blood it ought to die

declared leda if it isnt-her voice
faltered-if it isnt-the more reason i
should have a weapon

  larry weaver did not speak he took
the gun from the holster and gave it to
her she thrust it inside the bodice of
her golden robe

  at least ive the way out said she
oh uncle job im afraid

  henry winch came softly to her side
leda-they-they havent dared hurt
you have they asked his deep melo-
dious voice

  leda looked up from her uncles
shoulder where she had again sought
refuge met those grave eyes and shook
her head in that fleeting moment none
of the previous ugly hate shone in her
own eyes with a sigh of relief the sec-
retary stepped back unobtrusively

  but what if i may ask is this all
about inquired larry weaver briskly
i dont want to push myself forward
sir said larry to old job but it appears
as if we ought to try to figure things out
a bit and find out whats going to be
asked of us

  that is very simple said a voice
from the doorway

  everybody turned quint stood there

his whole proceeding is an out-
rage cried sir hubert in a high
angry voice

  quint shot a scornful look at the
speaker then he turned to the doctor

  doctor peabody i must have the
talisman hannah wake gave you you
know well how i have been cheated out
of it it will be well for you if you de-
liver it to me without further ado

  and if i refuse the doctors voice
was low his faded blue eyes sharply upon
quints determined face

  i shall be obliged to have resort to
force which i would very much regret
the portal to power



  i understand said the doctor but
made no move to deliver the talisman
and if i give it to you may i ask what
use is to be made of it

  into the younger mans eyes shot a
flame of proud and fiery emotion

  you know what that stone is-the

portal to superhuman power-

  just what power in particular is it
destined to aid in entering this mortal
plane pursued the old doctor doggedly
almost fiercely quint replied

  does it matter by what route through
what agency light-hearted happiness
comes to a world drowning in sorrow
and pain

  quint you are evading a direct reply
there is something behind what appears
simple and high-minded on your part
your methods of attaining innocent hap-
piness are entirely wrong they fill me
with suspicion so said the old doctor
with staunch determination i refuse to
give you the talisman

  quints teeth ground together then
i must seize it

  i know i am an old man and not as
strong as once i was said the doctor
gently but by taking this talisman from
me    consider quint you lose the
power of entry from higher planes evil

will be the talismans powers-

  you are right well perhaps it would
be best for you to come with me to the
high priest he may be able to explain
things better than i

  he turned motioning imperiously for
the doctor to follow him

  farewell old friend murmured the
doctor to job scudder

  farewell repeated the airplane mag-
nate troubled

  i do not know said the doctor his
smile very sweet whether i shall be per-
mitted to return or not

  give me the stone then whispered

job at least that may delay things a
little

  unnoted leda had listened to the two
mens low voices is there danger to
you doctor in that stone

  why yes my dear said he simply
then drop it inside my bodice she
whispered who could believe that 
had it

  the doctor looked at her earnest face
for a moment then leaned over her i
leave with you said he softly the hope
of the world or its greatest menace--
who knows whidi if i do not return
child do what your heart prompts you
with this stone

  he followed quints marching feet his
gallant old form straight his leonine
head high

  uncle job what is this talisman
whispered leda

  job shook his head my dear i dont
know but john says it is something mys-
terious and supernatural that could do all
manner of evil in the wrong hands
also as you may have gathered from that
interchange of conversation between the
doctor and quint the stone must be
given if it is to yield the highest results
ledas hands went to her breast press-
ing into her warm flesh the small cold
thing that the doctors hand had dropped
there when he bent over her in farewell

  oh what a terrible responsibility i
have undertaken hubert

  she withdrew herself from old jobs
arms and threw back her young shoul-
ders under their golden webbing at
sight of her resolved and pale face henry
winch took a step toward her then
waited his eyes on hers

  for all that was your fault i forgive
you henry winch said she firmly
and for all that was my fault i ask
your pardon


weird tales

  he stood rooted to the spot regarding
her with agonized eyes

  i do not know what terrible thing we
may yet have to face and i do not wish
to go into it with bitterness in my heart
for we may not come out of it alive
leda my darling

  larry weavers look at henry winch
was grave to leda he said if there is
anything i can do tell me you ought to
know that i am completely at your
service

  the girl hesitated then drew herself
up proudly

  thank you there is nothing that any
one can do for me now i fear i must
walk alone

  even as she spoke there was the clash
of metal at the doorway and quint ap-
peared his face dark with anger

  the litter awaits you miss scudder
everything depends upon you now if
you can take a sensible view of things all
will go well with this entire party if you
can not other steps must and will be
taken said he menace in words voice
and flashing eyes

  the airedale was straining at the
leash muttering low growls curling his
lips back against his white teeth

leda murmured the agonized voice
of henry winch if this cur is annoying
you say so and ill quiet him at least
quint cast a threatening look at the
secretary

  dont be a fool said he curtly dis-
pose of me and find a hundred men
sprung up where i stood

  leda intervened quickly

  no henry winch you can do noth-
ing for me it is my cue for action i
must go i see it now it is up to me
i-i have-protection she said her eyes
on his and he knew that she spoke of
larrys automatic

  larry himself was at her side fists

clenched lean face working with emo-
tion

  no larry there must be no disturb-
ance leda cried hastily quieting him
with a touch of one hand on his arm

  no harm will be done miss scudder
or any of you if she proves amenable to
her high destiny quint declared

  head high as the old doctor had gone
before her the girl went outside and
mounted the litter

  holy virgin we are all lost we
are in the hands of the pan-people
screamed the italian girl hysterically and
fell back on the divan writhing in an
agony of apprehension we shall never
see my mistress again

   in the silence that followed the eyes
of the secretary met those of job scudder
incredulously when the younger man
started toward the door drawing the gal-
lant airedale with him the old magnate
put out a restraining hand

   they are too many for us said he in
sad resignation we must await the
event

chapter 

a small room draped with em-
broidered velvet hangings on every
side light fell goldenly from the glass
dome in the ceiling upon a great bench
on which was seated that old and rever-
end priest whom leda had seen before
his benignant gaze was upon her and
he moved to one side to make place for
her when she alighted from the litter in
silence watchfully the girl awaited his
words while the litter-bearers departed
lightfooted from the room

  we are quite alone maiden said
the priest in a normal tone we can be
quite frank with each other

  your frankness might begin with
telling me where doctor peabody is
leda answered quickly

                     w t-
the portal to power



  he is already returning to your little
party in just as good shape as he went
from it replied the priest smiling

  but he was threatened-

  he should not have been said the
priest his face clouding over i fear my
grandson quint exceeds his instructions in
his anxiety to bring about that which we
are all aiming at

  undoubtedly leda observed dryly
with a shrug of her shoulders i fancy
he was to blame for injuring our mechan-
ic so that he could go in the poor fel-
lows place in the queen

  i wonder sometimes if the end does
truly justify the means cogitated the
priest aloud well you mention that the
doctor was threatened he has refused to
deliver to us the talisman that is the con-
necting link between us and the powers
beyond

  well what are you going to do about
it asked the girl

  the priest regarded her oddly

  we will have it in our hands sooner
or later for to gain that stone any of our
little company would wade through
blood because of what that stone may
mean to the world moreover maiden the
physician-when he realized that we were
determined to have the stone-confessed
that he had hidden it in the bosom of
the great mother 

  the girl could not restrain from a
slight start but caught herself quickly
and regarded the priests impassive face
narrowly

  that can mean one of two things
he went on serenely he hoped to mis-
lead us without giving us the direct lie
it may be that his trip west is a feint to
draw us off the trail and that he has
left the talisman at home buried in the
garden perhaps on the other hand he
has slipped it into the bosom of the great
mother of humanity-a woman

    w t-

   with difficulty the girl controlled her-
self but she knew that her efforts at self-
control had not passed unobserved

  if you are to be frank with me tell
me why you must have that stone

  for a long moment the high priest
scrutinized the girls fair face thought-
fully then a sudden smile broke across
his countenance and he nodded his head
several times

  your destiny is high if you accept
it even my authority must bow to yours
for you will be the spokeswoman for the
most high gods so my child i will be
frank

  the stone i seek must be placed
here and his fingers touched that hol-
low opening in the jeweled breastplate he
wore it is the portal to power by its
judicious and consecrated use the initiated
wearer may open the door to other planes
of existence and may invite other and
higher beings to this plane that the
world may benefit greatly

  suppose you had his stone what
would be my part to play

   a dedicated virgin is always a neces-
sity when supernal powers are invoked
my child for a lad old enough to realize
the potency of chastity and yet young
enough to be chaste is a difficult human
being to find

  what do you mean by dedicated
do not be afraid we do not want
blood we are all dedicated to the same
grand object happiness for the entire
world we who have begun by worship-
ping pan the god of simple nature
you my child would have the felicity to
embody within yourself the power the
wonders that are now waiting disem-
bodied on another plane

  in spite of your aim such a dedica-
tion sounds terrifying to me faltered
the girl

  you need not fear your own entity


weird tales

would be maintained except at such times
as the use of the talisman would enable
those great and beneficent forces to use
your body for their tremendous purposes
yours would be the part of a most
exalted priestess spokeswoman for the
high gods

  oh believe me maiden you would
be bringing the world periodical aban-
donment to the ancient wild joy in life
such as it has not seen since the sad-faced
christian era can you not understand
what it would mean to tired humanity to
be able to escape its heavy burdens with-
out the use of intoxicating liquors or
habit-forming drugs

  it sounds wonderful leda mur-
mured reluctantly but if it is all right
why wont the doctor give you the
talisman

  first because he has promised to de-
liver it elsewhere and he is a man of his
word so it can not be given by him but
must be taken away and that would never
do for us because of the mysterious qual-
ities of the stone that carries good only
when it is given now do you under-
stand his attitude

  she nodded face thoughtful

  i know by the way where the doctor
has hidden the talisman

  keen black eyes narrowed upon the
paling face of the girl

  you know stammered she and one
hand went to her bosom instinctively

  the high priests slow smile told her
that she had betrayed herself and her
charge angry tears of chagrin clouded
her eyes

  even if you know where it is i can
under no circumstances give it to any one
without the doctors permission

  i think his permission has been
tacitly given suggested the priest smil-
ing insinuatingly he has given me a

hint of where it is and he gave the
stone did he not

   i shall not give it up leda said

   the priests clean-shaven lips stirred in
a sigh

   child you are very obstinate in that
case we must try other methods of per-
suasion you see maiden you must give
that stone to me it must go into its
destined place and he touched again
the hollow in his breastplate of fiery
jewels

  leda confronted him her expression
determined

  i shall not give it up she pro-
nounced definitely if you wish to do
good with it-which i must say i doubt
-you will have to stop right here for
you dare not take it from me

  so be it my child then i must turn
you over to one who can perhaps per-
suade you better than i

  he rose and beckoned

  follow me

  to whom are you taking me

  pan must see you and must decide if
his power is sufficient to break the spell
of evil that will rest upon the talisman if
it is taken from you by force explained
the priest sadly

  at that hidden threat leda grew
paler then with compressed lips her
hand tightly against her bosom where
the talisman and larrys lethal weapon
lay together she followed the high priest

it was the same room to which quint
had conducted her before the curtain
concealed the dais but it could not deaden
certain sounds that caused the high priest
to check his forward stride with a quick
breath his brow frowning

  like a warning rang his hail evohe
pan

  behind the heavy curtain sounded
tripping feet and as the goat-man
the portal to power



whipped aside the silken drapery ledas
quick eye caught the fluttering garments
of a woman her ear knew a womans
soft mocking laughter the creature
thick lips twitching with sulky resent-
ment addressed his priest angrily

  why this intrusion

   great pan is it well that you should
so soon forget your high intent re-
proached the high priest i know-i
understand-it is your prerogative-
but-

  the goat-mans small eyes glowered
for a moment then moved ever so slowly
to the golden figure of the girl who faced
him braced for she knew not what the
thick lips quirked in an impish smile

  has the maiden consented asked he

  the high priest bowed low

  she is stubborn great pan in her
bosom she hides the portal to power and
refuses to place it where it belongs that
the world may laugh again i have
brought her to you for persuasion

  the smile widened

   it is well retire oh bringer of good
tidings the maiden will consent smiled
pan thick lips a-leer so you may lay
upon this dais your breastplate in readi-
ness

  at the movement of the old man to go
leda caught at his robe in momentary
panic

  oh dont leave me alone-with-
that

   mirth convulsed the sly features of the
goat-man

   give her an attendant by all means
he tittered send her the black slave
whom she knows

  in a moment a stumbling of feet came
down the passage and into the doorway
waddled a great obesity in white drill
uniform with white chefs cap on the
tight black wool

   leda stared then cried out

  captain

  the chef paused looked at her in a
kind of dazed surprize then his suetty
voice murmured plaintively ah lost m
rabbit-foot m venus gave m rabbit-
foot to me all m luck went away wid
dat rabbit-foot got to git anudder
charm

  captain sit down here leda or-
dered and pointed to one corner of the
dais where stood the goat-man his
mouth wide in a silent laugh that dis-
played glittering white teeth

  the chef obeyed sinking fady upon
the edge of the dais and letting his
triple chins telescope against his breast
despondently leda looked at him in a
kind of despair of what use would cap-
tain be in any emergency perhaps it was
for this reason that pan had suggested
him her eyes rose at the ugly apprehen-
sions that assailed her and met the
watchful puckish eyes of the travesty
grinning upon her she shuddered the
high priest was gone and she was prac-
tically alone with pan for captain cer-
tainly counted for less than nothing

  will you sit beside pan maiden
asked the goat-man in a high strainedly
agreeable voice that rang falsely on the
girls ears

  thank you i prefer to stand where
i am she returned coldly now what
is it you want me here for

  her warm brown eyes flashed cour-
ageously she was telling herself fran-
tically that it had to be a dream after all
because it could not be true even what
her eyes appeared to see could not be real

  the goat-man moved slowly toward
her puckish eyes on her face mis-
chievously

  you will give me the talisman
maiden he said imperiously it is in-
tended to do great and wonderful things


weird tales

and if you give it to me as you should
your reward shall be in proportion

  she shook her head lips a tight crim-
son line across her white face as the
goat-man came nearer

  what you have the talisman that
will make the world happy and will not
give it up cried pan his voice sudden-
ly harsh and strident maiden you are
acting with rash and unadvised boldness
know if you do not give to me the portal
of power without further trouble i must
order all your party delivered over to my
people and if my people know of your
stubbornness in setting your ignorant
will against the immortal gods they will
tear your friends to pieces for my people
have set their wills to bring joy to man-
kind and nothing can stand in their
way

  oh

  your golden self whispered pan
then sibilantly i shall keep for my very
own self and laughed shrilly

  oh what a beast you are

  yes and no shall you selfishly keep
the talisman with its potentialities for
blessing to mankind and send those you
love to a ghastly death at the hands of my
outraged people or will you lay the
stone willingly upon my hand and save
your friends and bring blessings upon all
who live today maiden if i am harsh
it is because i can not let a few blind and
stubborn men and women block the way
of happiness for all the world

  leda her hand clutching at her blouse
hesitated

  dare you tell me that your inten-
tions are noble she demanded only

a few minutes ago- and her voice

trailed into silence but her eyes met
pans accusingly

  i tell you that this body is merely the
materialization of an idea maiden it is
real yes again it is not real hence

your veiled accusations are ridiculous
moreover-is not the free companionship
of man and maid a beautiful and joyful
thing if it is so little you should be
the more willing to give it up forever
to be the high priestess of joy to the
world do not forget maiden that your
part will be a high one

  leda shook an impatient head

  you are not saying anything to the
point whatever you are my heart tells
me that you do not mean well to the
world i-i shall keep the talisman

his white teeth bared in an animal-
like snarl the goat-man was upon
her with a lithe bound thrusting one
hairy hand into her bodice

  struggling she shrank from that raid
upon her dignity fear and disgust
sickened her at the touch of that travesty
upon human shape

  you dare not take it from me she
cried

  his hand withdrew holding larrys
automatic at which he looked in puz-
zled fashion leda pulling away from
the grasp of his free hand that had
gripped her shoulder in its hairy grip
gave a little gasp and snatched at the
weapon frantically pan gave an in-
effectual snatch and the girl set her
teeth and pulled the trigger

  her amazed eyes saw the course of the
bullet through the hairy chest of the
goat-man and in horror and incredulity
were obliged to witness the closing of
the wound behind the bullets flight as if
no injury had been made

  another new thing observed pan
with childish interest ah you had
meant it to hurt me foolish maiden
you see i am not real with the realness
of yourself or it would have hurt me
now do not be silly any longer give me
the talisman
the portal to power



   you shall not have it

   maiden if evil follow it will be your
own stubbornness that has caused it he
lunged at her again once more trying to
get the stone from its hiding-place i
am saving all your friends from horrid
deaths that you are too callous to save
them from by your own simple act of
acquiescence

  oh take it take it but get away
from me for heavens sake cried out
the girl hysterically the nausea of her
disgust at his unwelcome touch had com-
pletely unnerved her combined with the
amazing inefficacy of the bullet to rid her
of him

  the goat-man retired almost pre-
cipitately at her capitulation a look of
childish concern puckered his narrow
brow

  but i dont want to take it from
you he objected i want you to lay
it down there beside the breast-plate i
will not even touch it since you think i
wish to bring evil to my beautiful world

  half sobbing wholly soul-sick leda
drew the talisman from her bosom and
laid it on the platform near the breast-
plate

  captain eyed her stupidly he had
lifted up his face with interest during her
struggle with the goat-man and now his
small deep-set eyes followed her trem-
bling hand as she laid the stone upon
the dais

   is that a powerful spell miss leda
he finally asked when he realized that
the girl was too agitated to reply he con-
tinued in a low mutter mus git me
anudder spell mus git me anudder-

  the goat-man waved exultant hands
at leda his high tittering laugh
sounded disagreeably triumphant almost
maliciously so

  now maiden as a reward you shall
receive the highest post any maiden can

hold in the new regime that is coming
upon the world why do you weep
laugh maiden laugh you have wisely
saved your friends and you will soon be
the happiest of the happy

  leda did not reply she was sobbing
hysterically

  come hither priest take the maiden
away until tonight maiden replace the
talisman in your bosom the gift you
have given may remain in your custody
until tonight tonight will be the night
of all saints- tittered the travesty

  evohe pan cfied the old priest
resonantly

chapter 

the goat-man went nimbly up on
the dais and jerked together the
heavily embroidered damask curtains

  you are dismissed said his high
voice and the clatter of his little hoofs
went rattling about behind the curtain

  maiden follow me murmured the
high priest but his request was couched
in a voice so gentle almost propitiatory
that leda scudders drooping head went
up proudly for she remembered that he
had said that even his will must bow to
hers if she became the spokeswoman for
the unknown powers that in some mys-
terious manner were to be embodied in
herself

  with a poise and tranquillity that she
did not feel she said to him i have not
eaten since noon yesterday is part of this
new regime starvation for me

  gods this is indeed an oversight
cried the priest you shall be returned
to your party immediately and a meal
served

  yet another thing went on leda
satisfied that her wishes actually meant
something to the high priest some
kind of explanation must be made at
once of this whole affair this wholesale


weird tales

kidnapping that has evidently been done
under your orders

  maiden chosen by pan you shall be
obeyed my grandson or myself shall be
with you as soon as you have eaten to
answer any questions you may desire to
ask your mind must be set completely at
rest so that you will know your own high
destiny and what this means to the
world

  leda seated herself in the gilded litter
and was borne back to the rest of the
party henry winch was first to reach her

  thank god leda you are safely
back they have not dared any insolent
tricks he demanded fiercely

  the girl gave him a side glance from
under lowered lids but her expression
was far kinder than the secretary had had
bestowed upon him since the ill-omened
flight of the queen

  perfectly safe henry winch said
she accepting his proffered aid to alight
from the litter

  open arms and jobs broken cry my
little girl

  into that shelter leda crept suddenly
weak and shaky from her strange ex-
perience her hysterical sobs filled them
all with consternation what had hap-
pened to break that proud high spirit
over her bowed head her uncles ques-
tioning gaze met the old doctors grave
face

  nerve shock diagnosed john pea-
body softly i suppose they took you
before pan my child

  that-creature spat out the girl
with a long shudder oh ive been a
cowardly fool ive given that horrible
monstrosity the stone you put in my
charge and with that she went to
sobbing again uncontrollable hysterical
weeping

  it was written murmured the old
physician shaking his leonine head

  jobs tender hand stroked ledas hair
monotonously soothingly his lips were
a thin tight line

  leda-tell me-if anybody has dared
lay a finger on you ill throttle him
snarled the entirely altered voice of the
secretary poised and sophisticated no
longer tell me leda

  job scudder saw the flame in those
eyes and jerked his head at the secretary
in quick caution while the doctor laid a
hand restrainingly on the young mans
twitching arm behind them larry
weavers lean face peered lips drawn
back into an ugly menacing threat

  theres nothing to tell murmured
ledas subdued voice at last he-he
frightened me so-that i gave up the
stone but please dont give a thought to
that now in a few minutes either quint
or that old priest will be here to tell us
all about this place and everything
shes had nothing to eat since lunch
yesterday suddenly snapped the secre-
tary for heavens sake leda get some-
thing into your stomach youre hungry
thats whats the matter with your
nerves

  the old magnate nodded confirma-
torily and drew the girl to the tables

  here my dear is hot coffee a cup-
ful of that will do wonders for you

  leda complied and gulped down the
bracing coffee

   id like to have that gun back if its
all the same to you miss leda larry
exclaimed

  the girl smiled wanly

  by all means larry ive found
said she with a hard little hopeless laugh
that its no weapon to use against pan
a quick interchange of glances between
the men and a lifting of larrys eye-
brows incredulously

  if you have no use for it said the
pilot tentatively and held out his hand
the portal to power



to take the automatic which the girl gave
him i have an idea he continued
sotto voce to henry winch that ones
aim must be pretty good to make any im-
pression on that creature she speaks of
leda spoke up the doctor drawing
his pocket medicine case out thoughtfully
i am going to give you a few pellets in
an envelope keep them where they
wont be taken from you child and in
case such a contingency arises as might
make it necessary here his piercing eyes
told much to ledas inquiring ones take
them nothing on earth can harm you
once you have taken these oh he
added quickly in reply to jobs horrified
look their action is swift and painless
i for one believe it would be better to
go out at will into gods hands than to
remain helpless in the hands of those
who might have power to injure my
soul

   thank you doctor john whispered
the girl and hid the small white envelope
in her bosom

she withdrew herself a little from the
encircling arms of her uncle as he sat
beside her on the divan and lifted red-
dened eyes to look at the anxious little
group about her she drew out the stone
and held it glistening pulsating almost
with milky opalescence now as if with
some strange life of its own

   thats an odd-looking thing com-
mented henry winch bending over to
get a closer look at it seems as if it
were alive

   it is that is through it pulsate the
living throbbing streams of power from
other planes of life but how is it that
you still possess it if you have given it
to pan also my child and the doctor
pushed his heavy spectacles up and
peered at the stone again

   he told me to keep it until tonight

  tonight tonight screamed the
hysterical voice of gemma and she flung
from her with a frantic gesture of im-
patience the chattering marmoset this
is the night when all that is evil is
abroad dio mio and she flung herself
face downward on her divan moaning
pitifully

  sir hubert his face tense with some
secret emotion regarded her in a kind of
desperation finally he crossed the room
and stood without speaking beside her
once he put out his hand to her shoul-
der then as quickly withdrew it flinging
a swift glance at the rest of the party to
see if his action had been observed but
they were all far too busy to watch sir
hubert

  gemma is right tonight is all hal-
low eve murmured the old doctor half
to himself like walpurgis night or
may eve it is the time for powers from
other planes to function here lord
lord what a hideous mess weve been
drawn into i blame myself for coming
along with you folks carrying that
stone

  leda still with the stone on her ex-
tended palm regarded the old physician
with intentness

  child what do you want me to do
if i take it they will only rob me of it
in the end and if they force it from me
the result may be tragic for tonight this
stone can be utilized to force an entry
onto the earth-plane of god only knows
what untrained and undisciplined forces
of evil    it is better that you keep it
my dear and give it when you must
perhaps then the higher powers will see
fit to take a hand in this drama

   mechanically the girl dropped the stone
back into the bosom of her golden
frock her eyes went to henry winch as
if impelled by some powerful influence
that she could not combat


weird tales

  if you are afraid dear said the sec-
retary softly let me take it

  she shook her head slowly from side to
side

  why if it must be given them in the
end why not give it without friction
perhaps as doctor john says if we give
it willingly    oh they told me i was
to be a kind of high priestess of their
cult and even that high priest would
have to take my orders she remembered
did pan tell you that

  she nodded at the old doctor who
sighed thoughtfully

  well said he with reluctance per-
haps things may come out better than
seems possible to us now if such author-
ity is to be vested in you my child the
way may open for our safe escape from
this strange and nerve-racking situation
gemma ordered leda sharply re-
covering something of her pristine poise
stop your noise do halloween isnt
going to hurt you and it looks as if we
were going to have a mighty exciting
halloween party here suki

  the whimpering marmoset scampered
across the floor to her and sprang to her
shoulder ledas tender hand stroked the
furry little body abstractedly

  gemma lifting her face from her
cupped wet hands looked up directly
into the solicitous countenance of sir
hubert for a moment she appeared
amazed at his imploring look she
bridled and looked quite through him
much to his obvious dismay and despair

  while we have time to ourselves
hurriedly observed john peabody id
better tell you people my experience with
pan

  leda leaned against jobs shoulder
and appeared not to notice that henry
winchs hand was resting lightly on her
arm larry walked noiselessly to and fro
but he was listening tensely not only to

the doctor but also to the sounds in the
corridor without where the ebon-skinned
litter-bearers still stood beside the gilded
litter

  the high priest asked me directly for
the stone and when i refused took me
to pan there is an interesting anom-
aly-

  is that what youd call him leda
wanted to know disgustedly i call him
a horrible unnatural monster ugh
she shuddered the memory of his grop-
ing hairy hand returning to her sick-
eningly

  monster he may be yet not purely
physical monster mused the old doctor
he is a splendid example of what con-
sciously directed will-power and occult
knowledge can do in the way of embody-
ing an idea in a material form

  do you actually mean interrupted
larry weaver truculently that this pan
is merely an idea from what youve told
me he is just plain matter

  matter of course responded the old
doctor patiently but the entirety of him
is the massed-together ancient belief in
his existence without it he simply could
not be hence i call him an idea

  larry snorted

  can you kill an idea with a couple of
bullets he inquired pointedly

  the doctor regarded him with gravity
  yes    and no larry

  its the yes im interested in
growled the air pilot

  you see so much depends upon the
idea if it is embodied in something
material and that material thing is de-
stroyed when it is believed to be inde-
structible-

i think i get you and the no
sometimes the embodiment of an
idea when destroyed leaves the idea
itself stronger than ever christianity is
an example of this the great master
the portal to power



was apparently slain but he left behind
him an idea that has revolutionized the
world

  the airman his keen face darkly mus-
ing turned away

   go on john with your interview with
pan we dont know how long a time
we may have without interruption job
urged

   oh yes yes so the high priest took
me to pan pan began in a most friendly
manner until i positively declared myself
out of any occult experiments that might
be made then he merely tittered at me
and said he would be pleased to send me
away with the rest of the party    except
one member

  the doctors look was significant
gemma whipped one hand to her lips as
she regarded her young mistress whose
lips compressed as her warn brown eyes
met the old doctors squarely

  the dirty dog ejaculated henry
winch hotly does he think for a mo-
ment that we would go away and leave
leda behind

  just the same i believe we would be
wise to let him think just that suddenly
whispered larry weaver approaching the
little group

  are you mad snapped old job with
an irate glare at the pilot

  not a whit responded the lattter
still in a lowered voice if we can make
them think that leda actually wishes to
remain and that she wants us sent away
because we might interfere with her ac-
tions  we might get them to put the
queen up on that plateau again and we
might all-

  so childishly simple growled henry
winch of course the glass walls
would melt before us when we wanted
to go

   i have a theory as to that doggedly
replied larry

  the old physician beat one fist into
the other palm

  of course i have it he lowered
his voice to a whisper leda can go to
see us off and once we are up there
larry can hold off the bunch at the head
of the steps with his gun and-

  righto only it will be i who will
hold diem off declared henry winch
with a touch of fine hauteur it is my
right and his eyes sought those of old
job

  right nothing your privilege you
may mean scowled larry well ive
got the gun havent i

  in case our plans fail- leda

faltered nervously

  my child you have what i gave you
and they will mean freedom for you
from any situation that may complicate
matters beyond our power to remedy

  thats putting it very prettily
groaned henry winch but it does seem
to me that we ought to be able to get
leda away in safety

  the girl turned her face upward and
looked at him gravely for a long moment
then meeting his ardent anxious eyes
squarely she smiled very sweedy her
face as she made sure of the small
envelope in her bosom was so absorbed
and distant that henry winch turned
away from her with a kind of groan as if
he could not bear to look upon it

  larry youve our only weapon it ap-
pears do not forget in our plans that
you alone can pilot the queen so you
must take the best care of yourself for
the sake of your young mistress warned
doctor peabody

  henry winch began to pace the room
by larrys side and the two men who
loved leda scudder started talking very
animatedly together ledas eyes were on
them and a half-puzzled look passed


weird tales

over her piquant face as she saw them all
at once clasp hands firmly looking at
each other with such warm looks that her
heart felt lighter and safer in their love
for her it appeared to her that they had

very much to say to each other and she
continued watching them until a clatter
of spears at the doorway sounded and in
the opening stood the high priest looking
at them expectantly

the startling denouement will be told in the thrilling chapters
which bring this story to a conclusion in next
months weird tales

a iveird tale of the sea

the boat on
the beach

          by kadra maysi

the life-guards watched her every
night come down the boardwalk
from the beach hotel cross the
dunes obliquely and go to sit in the boat

  they talked about her-idly but spec-
ulatively as lonely men talk about the
smallest thing which crosses their horizon
-and they agreed that she wasnt bad-
looking

  she was a slim voman-probably some-
where in the thirties-a slim woman
dressed all in white with a lot of wavy
blue-black hair they noticed that her
hair was unusually beautiful and most un-
usually abundant they noticed that she
had narrow feet in the low-heeled one-
strap white kid pumps and slender
ankles above them they noticed that she
wore no color on her clothes her cheeks
or lips

  one day she turned and looked directly
up when the boy in the observation room
had the glass trained upon her the boy
fell back a step and said good god

when the others asked him what the mat-
ter was he said i saw her eyes they
asked him what color her eyes were and
what was the trouble with them he said
theyre big and i think theyre black as
her hair but they look-they look-well
they look like youd expea the eyes of
somebody nailed on a cross to look

  she did not look up again but every
evening before dark she came down and
crossed the dunes and sat in the life-
guards boat for several hours and the
life-guards talked about her-idly when
they were not discussing the far more im-
portant topic of the latest maritime dis-
aster

  for this was just three weeks after the
passenger steamer astarte had sprung a
leak and foundered-in foul weather-
just a few hundred miles off the coast
for some reason which the surviving
members of her crew could not satis-
factorily explain her sos had not been
sent out in what her surviving passengers
the boat on the beach



and the public considered time enough to
bring her aid more than fifty per cent of
those on board had perished either in the
launching of the lifeboats or in the
stormy bitter cold of the days before that
pitiful flotilla was picked up by the rescue
ships

  shipping boards and owners passen-
gers and reading public investigated
questioned promised explanations threat-
ened suits wrote to the papers and
when they were through nobody knew
any more than they had known at first
for the only man who had that secret
locked under the breast of his blue uni-
form had done his best-whether right or
wrong-and had gone down on the
bridge of his ship

   it was a far more important topic than
idle discussion of a slim woman in white
who sat alone in a boat on the beach from
sunset until the three-quarter moon had
passed high overhead toward the west

  the life-guards were discussing it
gravely humbly understanding as be-
seemed men who know that the sea has
crises too great for any man to meet

  the boarders at the beach hotel-most
of whom had never taken a longer sea
voyage than that afforded by the six-mile
ferry from the mainland to the island-
were discussing it shrilly assertively not
hesitating to censure and to state what
should or should not have been done

  but everybody was discussing it-even
the eight-year-old small boy who came
every day from the nearest cottage to in-
spect the life-guard station to mount the
lookout ladders to climb into the boats
to help the sunburned men in white wash
paint scrub brass and oil the heavy two-
wheel carriages so that they might be
momentarily ready to be launched upon
their runway to the sea

  the small boy knew that a boat had
sunk-a big boat full of men and women
and little boys and girls his daddy had

said they were drowned because the cap-
tain had not sent a wireless off in time
but the oldest life-guard-the little one
with the bow-legs and the grizzled hair
that stood up straight-had said sonny
all a man can do is do his best the
small boy understood too and privately
he agreed with the life-guard rather than
with his daddy he was in the third
grade-would be when school opened
again-and he practised writing on the
beach a-s-t-a-r-t-e

  one morning while he was laboriously
tracing it the lady in thesleeveless white
silk dress came up behind him she said

  you too

  and not understanding but liking her
voice he looked up and smiled at her with
his wide governors gates of missing
teeth

  she said will you come down to the
drug store and eat an ice cream cone with
me

  at the counter she said what do you
want

  he chose a strawberry one and asked
politely what do you want

  she looked at him with her wide black
eyes and the soda jerker heard her say
a little boy like you-for a sea anchor

  but she ordered another strawberry
cone and then for some reason did not
eat it and asked him if he would be kind
enough to eat it for her

  that evening she came down as usual
along the walk across the sandhills
looking up over the dunes from the boat
she saw the sea-oats etched in golden
grain and sheaf against the sky sunset
out on the back beaches had set the marsh
aflame up to the zenith its wastrel opals
spattered the western clouds east the
giant copper disk of the moon came out
of the sea

  she sat there so long-so long-with
her arms clasped around her knees the
wind was whipping her thin white dress


weird tales

and loosening strands of her long black
hair but her body did not move to the
life-guard up in the observation tower
she looked a woman carved in stone she
saw the moon go higher and cut in the
seas green jungle a silver road it
stretched from the climbing planet
straight to the boat on the beach her
brain was grasping at scattered thoughts
as a drowning person grasps drifting
straws she was half-remembering queer
old lines-things that nobody reads now-
adays who wrote

   -wished that the ebbing tide

     would bear me away on its bosom
     to the ocean far and wide

  the life-guard up in his conning-place
remembered that next night would be the
full moon and the flood tide he looked
again to see that the boat on its heavy
carriage was well above the high tide
mark it was well above it there in the
moonlight with that lonely figure sitting
in the stem

  the small boy lying on his stomach on
a sand dune just a hundred yards away
was watching too he had seen the red
moon rise and throw that path across the
sea to the boat being a child and nearer
to god his vision was clearer than
theirs he saw what the life-guard did
not see-what the slim woman in the boat
did not see although she looked for it
with eyes which bore witness to her
crucifixion every night he had been
watching every night-the small boy on
the dune it had happened every night-
and it was happening again but the
woman in the boat sat marble-still the
wind moved only her dress and her hair
she seemed to think that she was alone at
the end of that long moon-sequined path

flood tide foamed on the beach next
night-brimmed the gutters and shal-
low pools-washed the sides of the out-

post dunes into new concave wave-
carved shapes

  just before sunrise the lookout saw
that the boat on the beach was gone the
man who had had the night watch re-
ported having seen it shortly before mid-
night tide had turned three hours before
that time and it was then well above the
water anyway it was an eight-man boat
and it took two husky ones to launch it
yes he was sure he had seen it at eleven-
fifty p m he was absolutely sure-for
the woman in white had been sitting in it
then

  the two life-guards who went down to
investigate found the heavy carriage with
its two broad-tired wheels its chassis
pole and ropes well out in the surf of
the now incoming tide that in itself
proved that someone had taken the boat
had the flood tide coming higher than
usual washed it out it would have taken
the boat alone and not the carriage with
its sand-imbedded wheels some persons
-for the strongest life-guard could not
alone roll that carriage down the shingle
-had rolled it out into the surf deep
enough to launch it

  with one man hauling on its rope and
one pushing on the pole they got it back
to its place high on the beach starting
up the boardwalk they met a group of
men from the hotel the manager him-
self was one of them and he was speaker

  weve just been to the station to re-
port a woman missing one of the ladies
didnt come in last night can you help
us

  what did she look like well send
a man out on the beach and send a boat
out too right away

  she was a slim woman with a lot of
dark hair and she was dressed all in
white

  thats the woman who sits in the
boat said the grizzled life-guard and
the younger one added
the boat on the beach



   she was in it last night sawyer said
he saw her there just before midnight
what boat wheres the boat de-
manded the manager

   the station boat that sits on its car-
riage just across the dunes shes been
coming down and sitting in it for hours
every night

  where is it now

  wed like you to tell us that some-
body rolled the carriage down the beach
and launched it sometime between mid-
night and daybreak

  and you say a slim woman-a woman
in white-was sitting in it last night
sawyer saw her in it at eleven-fifty
but great god said the manager
that was mrs card

  what mrs card you dont

mean-

  yes i do mean said the manager
that was the mrs card-wife i
should say widow of captain card of
the steamship astarte

  i hadnt heard she was here one of
the coast-guards said

  she registered under a different
name answered the manager she
wanted to be quiet and that was the only
way but she told me who she was and
why she was doing it do you think
well find her on the island or do you

think-

  nobody said what he thought but
they all were thinking hard not one of
them failed to wonder whether the theft
of a seaworthy boat by parties unknown
and the suicide of a woman beside her-
self with grief might not be unrelated
incidents occurring only by coincidence on
the same night

  within thirty minutes there were half
a dozen volunteer boats as well as the
station boats out past the breakers and
posses were patrolling the beach and
every foot of the island

  but midday came without a trace of
lost woman or lost lifeboat

the oldest guard was in the lookout
room when the little boy climbed the
ladder he usually came earlier but he
had been following the search the sta-
tion was quiet for all the men except the
lookout and the wireless operator were
engaged in that search

   he climbed the ladder-the little boy
did-and stuck a tow-head in a cap much
too large for it into the door of the look-
out room and the grizzled lookout
dropped the glasses in his hand and stared
as if he saw a ghost

  godamighty whered you get it
whered you get that cap buddy

   the little boy took it off and proudly
held it out to him and the man set it on
one gnarled fist and turned it slowly un-
believingly around with the other hand

   it was the regulation blue and white
cap of a passenger steamships officer its
gold braid and insignia told those who
knew the sea that it was a masters cap
and the lettering above its vizor told
anyone who read that it was property of
the s s astarte

   the lifeguard was still turning it
slowly unbelievingly

   whered you get it buddy

  on the beach-where the man
dropped it while he was shoving the boat
last night

  what man buddy

   the man who came and took the boat
and the lady away with him the same
man who used to come and sit every
night in your boat with her

   landsmen have always called sailormen
a superstitious folk this is as it should
be for superstition-like everything else
-lends itself to the individual interpreta-
tion and those who go down to the sea
in ships know well enough that there


weird tales

occur phenomena which are outside lands-
mens experience

  so the old life-guard turned the cap in
his rope-gnarled salt-scarred fingers

  tell me about it buddy sure you
didnt dream it

  no sir i was wide awake sitting out
on the sandhill there nights that mother
and daddy go to the hotel dances i stay
out until the music stops then run back
home before they get there

  tell me what you saw you say
youve seen him before

  oh yes hes come every night since
the lady came i dont know which side
he comes from i never see him until
hes on the beach at the edge of the
waves right where the end of the road of
moonlight is he goes and sits in the
boat with her but she never seemed to
see him before perhaps she saw him last
night because the moon was so bright and
big

  she saw him

  yes she saw him she held out her
arms to him and he came across the beach
and put his arms around her i watched
him launch the boat and when it was
afloat jump in it with her i thought he
had a right to do it because he was
dressed like an officer

  he was dressed like an officer

  yes like the captain of the ferry that
brought us over here he had a blue uni-
form with gold braid on his cuffs and
he had this cap he dropped it on the
beach can i keep it

  the telephone bell it was the hotel
manager asking whether there was yet
any news of boat or woman

  no not yet said the grizzled guard
and after he shut the telephone he
handed the blue cap back to the little boy

  yes you can keep it buddy he said
because-there wont be any news

as drowning men clutch at straws
any port in a storm or a gambling
chance

  when men have exhausted science
and religion they turn to mediums and
crystal-gazers and clairvoyants and pat-
ent medicines i knew an intelligent
pharmacist who was dying of a malig-
nant disease operated on three times
specialists had given him up then he
began to take the nostrums and cure-alls
on his own shelves although he knew
perfectly well what they contained-or
could easily enough have found out
consulted a lot of herb doctors and long-
haired indian healers and advertising
specialists

   and of course without result com-
mented the little english doctor

  i wouldnt say that said bliven
it kept alive the forlorn spark of hope
in his soul better than merely folding
his hands and waiting for the inevitable
he was just starting in with a miraculous
brazilian root when he snuffed out on
the whole he lived happier and quite
possibly longer because of all the fake
remedies and doctors he spent so much
money on its all in your own mind
you know nothing else counts much

  all fakes including the records of
the p s r nodded holmes who lec-
tured on experimental psychology

   the little doctor shook his head depre-
catingly

   i shouldnt go as far as that really
he objected because every now and
then in the midst of their conscious fak-
ing as you call it with the marked cards
and prepared slates the hidden magnets
and invisible wires and all these mediums
and pseudo-magicians come up against
something that utterly baffles them i
have talked with a well-known presti-
digitator who has a standing bet of a
hundred guineas that he can duplicate the

manifestations of any medium and yet
he states that every now and then he finds
himself utterly baffled he can fake the
thing cleverly you understand but he
can not fathom the unknown forces back
of it all it is dangerous ground it is
sometimes blasphemy it is blundering
in where angels fear to tread

  piffle snorted bliven the sub-
conscious mind explains it all and we
have only skirted the edge of our subject
when we have mastered it we shall do
things right in the laboratory that will put
every astrologer and palmist and tea-
ground prophet out of business

  nobody seemed to have anything to
answer and the psychoanalyst turned to
the little doctor

  you know this royce he asserted
a bit defiantly

  i dont pretend to follow you new-
era chaps as closely as i ought but i re-
call an incident in my early practise that
is not explicable in the present-day stage
of your science as i understand it
bliven grunted

  well-shoot he said of course
we cant check up your facts but if you
were an accurate observer we may be
able to offer a plausible theory at least
royce flushed at his brusk way of put-
ting it but took no offense every one
makes allowances for bliven who is a
good fellow but crudely sure of himself
and a slave to his hobby

  it happened a long long time ago
began royce when i was an intern in
a london hospital if you know any-
thing about our hospitals you will under-
stand that they are about the last places
on earth for anything bizarre to occur in
everything is frightfully ethical and
prosy and red-tapy--far more so than in
institutions over here better as these are
in many ways

  but almost anything can happen in


weird tales

london and does you love to point to
new york as the typical cosmopolis-
because it has a larger italian population
than has rome a larger german than
berlin a jewish than jerusalem and so
forth well london has all this and
more it has nuclei of afghans and
turkomans and arabs it has neighbor-
hoods where conversation is carried on
in no known tongue it even has a
synagogue of negro jews-dating cer-
tainly from the plantagenet dynasty and
probably earlier

   myriads spend all their lives in lon-
don and die knowing nothing about it
sir walter besant devoted twenty years
to the collecting of data for his history
of the city and confessed that he had
only a smattering of his subject men
learn some one of its hundred phases
passing well scotland yard agents buy-
ers of old pewter or black letter books
tea importers hotel keepers solicitors
clubmen but outside of their own little
pool broods the eternal fog hiding the
real london in its sticky yellow embrace
i was born there attended its university
practised for a couple of years in white-
chapel and migrated to the fashionable
westminster district but i visit the city
as a stranger

  so if anything mysterious were to
happen anywhere it might well be in
london although as i have said one
would hardly look for it in one of our
solid dull intensely prosaic hospitals

  watts-bedloe was the big man in my
day you will find his works in your
medical libraries bliven though i dare
say he has been thrust aside by the on-
march of science osteopathy owes a
deal to him i think and i know that
doctor lorenz die great orthopedist of
today freely acknowledges his own debt

here was brought to us one day a
peculiarly distressing case the only
child of sir william hutchison a wid-
ower whose hopes had almost idola-
trously centered in this boy who was a
cripple you would have to be british
to understand just how sir william felt
he was a keen sportsman played all out-
door games superlatively well rode to
hounds over his own fields shot tigers
from an elephants back in india and on
foot in africa rented a salmon stream
in norway captained the all-english
polo team for years sailed his own yacht
bred his own hunters had climbed all the
more difficult swiss peaks and was the
first amateur to purchase and operate a
biplane

   so that to natural parental grief was
added the bitter downfall of all the plans
he had for this boy instructing him in the
fine art of fly-casting straight shooting
hard riding and all that sort of thing
instead of a companion who could take
up the life his advancing years were
forcing him to relinquish in a measure
he had a hopeless cripple to carry on and
end his line

   he was a dear patient little lad with
the most beautiful head and great in-
telligent eyes but his wrecked little body
was enough to wring your heart twisted
warped shriveled-and far beyond the
skill of watts-bedloe himself who had
been sir williams last resort when
he sadly confessed that there was noth-
ing he could do that science and skilful
nursing might add a few years to the
mere existence of the little martyr you
will understand that his father came to
that pass which you bliven have illus-
trated in citing the case of the pharma-
cist he was in short ready to try any-
thing to turn to quacks necromancers
to satan himself if his son might be
made whole

weird tales

  oh naturally he had sought the aid
of religion noted clergy of his own
faith had anointed the brave eyes die pa-
tient lips the crooked limbs and prayed
that god might work a miracle but
none was vouchsafed i havent the
least idea who it was that suggested the
luciferians to sir william

  luciferians devil-worshippers in-
terrupted holmes were there any of
them in your time

  there are plenty of them today but
it is the most secret sea in the world
huysmans in la-bas has told us as much
as has any one and you know perfealy
well or should that all priests who be-
lieve in the real presence take the ut-
most care that the sacred wafer does not
pass into irresponsible hands many will
not even place it on the communicants
palm but only in his mouth for the
stolen host is essential to the celebration
of the infamous black mass which forms
the chief ceremony of the luciferian
ritual and every year a number of
thefts or attempted thefts from the
tabernaculum are reported in the press

  now the theory of this strange sea
is not without a certain distorted ration-
ality they argue that lucifer star of
the morning was cast out of heaven
after a great battle in which he was de-
feated to be sure but not destroyed nor
even crippled today after centuries of
missionary zeal christianity has gathered
only a tithe of the people into its fold
the great majority is and always has
been outside the wicked flourish
often the righteous stumble and at the
last great battle of armageddon the
luciferians believe that their champion
will finally triumph

  meanwhile and in almost impene-
trable secrecy they praaise their infamous
rites and serve die devil foregathering
preferably in some abandoned church

which has an altar and above it a cruci-
fix which they reverse it is believed
that they number hundreds of thousands
and flourish in every quarter of the world
and it is presumed that they employ grips
and passwords but amid so much that
is conjecture this faa stands clear the
cult of lucifer does exist and has from
time immemorial

  i never had the least idea who sug-
gested them to sir william may have
been some friend who was a secret de-
votee and wished to make a proselyte
may have been an idle word overheard
in a club-or a penny bus the point
is he did hear discovered that an occult
power was claimed by their unholy
priests was ready to mortgage his estate
or sell his soul for his little chap and
somehow got in touch with them

  the faa that he managed it that he
browbeat watts-bedloe into permitting
one of the fraternity to enter the hospital
at all is the best example i can give of
his despairing persistence at that the
physician agreed only upon certain seem-
ingly prohibitive conditions the fellow
was not to touch the little patient nor
even to draw near his bed he was not
to speak to him or seek to hold his gaze
no phony hypnotism or anything like
that

  watts-bedloe i think framed the
conditions in the confident hope that they
would end negotiations and he was pro-
foundly disgusted when he learned that
the luciferian though apathetic was not
in the least deterred by the hardness of
the terms it appeared that he had not
been at all willing to come under any cir-
cumstances that he tried persistently to
learn how sir william had heard of him
and his address and that he had refused
remuneration of any sort altogether a
new breed of faker you see

  there were five of us in the room at
weird tales



the time appointed besides the little pa-
tient who was sleeping peacefully fact
is watts-bedloe had taken the precau-
tion of administering a sleeping-draft in
order that the quack might not in any
possible way work upon his nervous sys-
tem watts-bedloe was standing by the
cot his sandy hair rumpled his stiff mus-
tache bristling for all the world like an
airedale terrier on guard the father
was there of course and the head nurse
and a powerful and taciturn orderly you
can see that there wasnt much chance of
the devil-man pulling off anything un-
toward

  when precisely on the moment the
door opened and he stood before us i
suffered as great a shock of surprize as
ever in my life and a rapid glance at my
companions faces showed me that their
amazement equaled mine i dont know
just what type we had visualized-
whether a white-bearded mystic dad in a
long cloak with a peaked hat bearing
cabalistic symbols or a pale sinister and
debonair man of the world such as
george arliss has given us or what not
but certainly not the utterly insignificant
creature who bowed awkwardly and
stood twirling a bowler hat in his hands
as the door closed behind him

  he was a little plump bald man of
middle age looking for all the world
like an unsuccessful green-grocer or a
dealer in butter and cheese in a small way
although the day was cool with a damp
yellow fog swirling over the city he per-
spired freely and continually wiped his
brow with a cheap bandanna he
seemed at once ill at ease yet perfectly
confident if you know what i mean i
realize that it sounds like silly rot but
that is the only way i can describe him
utterly certain that he could do that for
which he had come but very much wish-

of unutterable dullness

    w billy barbe of san antonio texas writes to the eyrie weird tales is
now reaching an amazing stage from the standpoint of present-day american ficti-
tious literature magazines that depend almost entirely upon a universal appeal to
the imaginative and more or less secreted side of the human race generally falter
in their stride a bit sooner or later yet weird tales seems to be increasing rather
than decreasing in popularity i have perused weird tales for over seven years
and although i am of a very restless and impatient disposition i have never tired of
the periodical there is a very good reason for this weird tales unlike so many
other magazines has not altered the original type of the contents that it first started
out with but is even now publishing stories of the weird bizarre and unusual
order while many other magazines not so successful today have for commercial
reasons filled their pages with either lewd risque and racy sex-appeal stories or with
the soft dove-eyed love stories of grandmothers day thinking thus to increase the
circulation i wonder if it would not be possible for you to publish as a reprint a
merrits story the woman of the wood that is the most beautiful and yet the
most fascinating story that has even been published in weird tales even now
although i lost my copy of the magazine that contained the story some time ago i
can close my eyes and become enraptured by the mere thought of its dramatic
beauty should you see fit to comply with my request you will do a huge army of
my friends as well as myself an enormous and generous favor

watts-bedloe mutter my word and i
believe he would have spat disgustedly-

seemed entirely in keeping with his ap-
pearance that he should take liberties with
his aspirates im ere mlord and

the specialist  e that i serves can and

i warns you im not to be eld responsible

  watts-bedloe turned to sir william
lets have an end to the sickening farce
he said curtly i need fresh air

  sir william nodded to the little man
who mopped his brow with his bandanna
and pointed to the cot draw back the
coverlet he commanded

  the nurse obeyed after a questioning
glance at watts-bedloe tyke off is

  watts-bedloes lips parted in a snarl
at this but sir william arrested him with
a gesture stepped to his sons side and
with infinite gentleness took off the tiny
gown leaving the sleeping child naked

tion was quickly drawn back to die
strange man

  barely glancing at the child he fum-
bled at bis greasy waistcoat watts-bed-
loe watching him meanwhile like a lynx
as he took out a crumb of chalk and
squatting down drew a rude circle on
the floor about him a circle of possibly
four feet in diameter and within this
cirde he began laboriously to write cer-
tain words and figures

  hold on there spoke bliven cer-
tain words and figures just what sym-
bols please

  there was a swastika emblem royce
promptly replied and others familiar to
some of the older secret orders and some-
times found on aztec ruins and baby-
lonian bride tablets the open eye for in-
stance and a rude fist with thumb ex-
tended also he scrawled the sequence
--------the  omitted you no-
tice-which he multiplied by  and
again by  and by  you can amuse
yourselves working it out the result is
curious lasriy he wrote the sentence
signa te signa temere me tangis et an-
gisf a palindrome you observe that is
it reads equally well or ill-backward or
forward

  hocus pocus old stuff snorted
bliven

  royce gazed mildly at him

  old stuff as you say professor
older than recorded history having
done this a matter of five minutes per-
haps with watts-bedloe becoming more
and more restless and evidently holding
himself in with difficulty the fellow rose
stiffly from his squatting position care-
fully replaced the fragment of chalk in
his pocket mopped his brow for the
twentieth time and gestured toward the
cot with a moist palm now cover im
hup he ordered all hup ead and
ail

  the nurse gently drew the sheet over
the little form we could see it rise and
fall with the regular respiration of slum-
ber suddenly eyes wide open and star-
ing at the floor the fellow began to pray
in latin and whatever his english his
latin was beautiful to listen to and vir-
gin pure it was too voluble for me to
follow verbatim-i made as good a tran-
script as i could a bit later and will be
glad to show it to you bliven-but any-
how it was a prayer to lucifer at once an
adoration and a petition that he would
vouchsafe before these christian unbe-
lievers a proof of his dominion over fire
earth air and water he ceased abrupt-
ly as he had begun and nodded toward
the cot hit is done he sighed and
once again mopped his forehead

   you infernal charlatan snarled
watts-bedloe unable longer to contain
himself youve got the effrontery to
stand there and tell us anything has been
wrought upon that child by your slobber-
ing drivel

  the man looked at him with luster-
less eyes look for yerself guv-ner he
answered

tt was sir william who snatched
a back the sheet from his son and till
my dying day i shall remember the un-
earthly beauty of what our astounded eyes
beheld lying there smile upon his
lips like a perfect form fresh from the
hand of his creator his little limbs
straight and delicately rounded a picture
of almost awesome -loveliness lay the
child we had but five minutes before seen
as a wrecked and broken travesty of hu-
manity

  again bliven interrupted explosively

  oh i say now royce ill admit you
tell a ripping story as such you had even
me hanging breathless on your climax
but this is too much as man to man
weird tales



you cant sit there and tell us this child
was cured

   i didnt say that for he was dead
bliven was speechless for once but
holmes spoke up in remonstrance

   it seems strange to me that such a
queer story should not have been repeat-
ed and discussed

   it isnt strange if you happen to know
anything about london hospitals royce
explained patiently who would re-
peat it would watts-bedloe permit it
to be known that by his permission some
charlatan was admitted and that during
his devilish incantations his patient died
would the stricken father mention the
subject even to us or the head nurse
and orderly cogs in an inexorable ma-
chine

   all this took place nearly forty years
ago and it is the first time i have spoken
of it watts-bedloe died years back and
sir williams line is extinct i cant ver-
ify a detail but it all happened exactly as
i have stated as for the luciferian
none of us i think saw him depart he
simply stole out in the slimy yellow fog
back to whatever private hell it was he
came from somewhere in london the
city nobody knows and where anything
may happen

an unjust discharge no proof could be offered
however

  yesterday his charred body was found in the
ruins of the factory identification being possible
by means of an old-fashioned watch he always
carried it is surprizing the body has not been
discovered sooner for it lay in plain sight near the
warehouse wall

  the mystery is heightened by the fact that sev-
eral reputable people claim to have seen barry
prowling among the ruins of como as recently as
last sunday that this is impossible is evidenced
by the watch the hands of which stopped at two-
fifteen this is the approximate time the factorys

light there is indubitably proof of true
materializations being made at seances
the british society for psychical research
and the societe detudes psychiques-
both reliable associations of scientific men
-have attested it very well what makes
such materializations possible

  a spiritual being whether it be the
ghost of one once human or otherwise
possesses passions but neither body nor
parts to make them effective some
ghosts may show themselves others may
not and it is these latter which visit
seances in hope of materialization of
themselves they can not materialize any
more than the most skilled bricklayer can
construct a house but give the artizan
materials with which to build and pouf
the house is reared before you know it
so with these spirits a form of energy
is radiated by die sitters at the seance
something definite as radio waves yet not
to be seen or touched or handled this
is called psychoplasm if enough of it be
present the hovering ghost spirit ot
demon can so change its vibrations so
compress it as to render it solid and pon-
derable in fine he has built himself a
body

  in normal circumstances the psycho-

plasm returns to the bodies which gave
it off when once its work is done ha
but suppose the spiritual visitant is a lar-
cener-one who so greatly desires once
more to live and move and have his
being in this world that he will not re
turn that which furnishes him a corporeal
body what then

  there lies the danger of the seance
my friend it may unwittingly give bod-
ily structure to a discarnate evil entity
so it was in this case yes

  yes i answered well wheres
the solution of the problem you said
youd found

  here par dieu i shall reassemble the
sitters at that seance and make that thief
gilles garnier give back what he stole
from them yes i shall most assuredly
do that and this very night

all afternoon he was busy at the tele-
i- phone tracing down the ten mem-
bers who composed the circle at twelve-
trees with norval fleetwood and his wife
when all had been reached and agreed
to gather at fleetwoods town house that
night he rose wearily do not wait
dinner for me my friend he told me
sadly rather would i lose a fingec
weird tales	

than forego the little young pig the so
talented nora mcginnis roasts in the
kitchen for dinner but something more
precious than roast young pigs is involved
here i shall dine at an hotel in new
york helas

  why where are you going

  to a booking agency of the theater

  a theatrical booking-

  precisely exactly quite so i have
said it meet me at monsieur fleetwoods
at ten tonight if you please and as you
value my friendship see to it that no one
of the party leaves before i come au
plaisir de vous revoir

half-past nine was sounding on the
clock in fleetwoods drawing-room
when de grandin arrived embarrassed
and ill at ease the sitters in the seance
at twelvetrees were grouped about the
room norval doing his best to entertain
them hildegarde looking pale and hag-
gard but showing no serious physical re-
sults of her nights adventure sat before
the fire and every now and then she
shuddered slightly though the room was
warmed somewhat past the point of com-
fort a frightened half-expectant look
was on her face and once or twice as
motor horns hooted mournfully in the
street outside quick fear leaped into her
eyes and she half rose from her seat with
blenched cheeks and twitching terrified
lips

  with de grandin came a tall pale-
faced young man in poorly fitting eve-
ning clothes a virtuosos mop of long
dark hair and deep-set melancholy eyes
professor morine doctor trowbridge
de grandin introduced the stranger
monsieur fleetwood professor mo-
rine

but the gentlemen at the theatrical bureau
denregistrement recommend his talents
without reserve his fee for tonight will
be one hundred dollars you agree mon-
sieur he looked inquiringly at fleet-
wood

  if it will help cure hildegarde its
cheap at twice the price

  very good let us then say one hun-
dred and fifty remember the professor
can secure no advertisement from tonight
moreover he has promised to forget all
which transpires within this house

  all right all right fleetwood an-
swered petulantly lets get started
tres bien all is prepared in the
farther room good if you will kindly
make excuse to have madame hildegarde
leave the room a moment

  norval whispered something in his
wifes ear and as they left the apartment
together de grandin addressed the com-
pany

  messieurs mesdames we are as-
sembled here tonight in an endeavor to
duplicate the conditions obtaining when
madame fleetwood became first indis-
posed upon my honor i assure you no
advantage will be taken but it is neces-
sary that you all submit to a state of light
hypnosis i shall stand by and personally
see that all goes well do you agree
one after another the guests reluctant-
ly acquiesced in the proposal until mazie
noyer was reached i wont she an-
swered shortly ill not be a party to
any such ridiculous proceeding you just
want to get me in that mans power to
make me a laughing-stock i know no
indeed ill not consent

  mademoiselle de grandin protested
do you not care to see madame fleet-
wood restored to health you assume a
great burden by refusing

  i dont care whether hildegarde re-
covers or not she can die before ill con-

sent to being hypnotized you just want
to make a fool of me

  parbleu nature has forestalled us in
that he muttered but aloud he an-
swered very well mademoiselle as
you wish you will excuse us while we
perform our work with a frigid bow
he turned from her and motioned the
others into an adjoining room

  all furniture had been removed from
this apartment save a single round table
and a dozen chairs about the latter de
grandin traced a pentagram composed of
two interlaced triangles and in each of
the five points he set a tall wax candle a
tiny sharp-pointed dagger with tip point-
ing outward and a small crucifix

  norval led in hildegarde and as the
sitters took their places round the table
professor morine walked slowly round
the circle stroking each forehead and
whispering soothingly all right doc-
tor he called softly as he completed the
circuit what next

  the frenchman lighted the candles
one by one murmuring some sort of
prayer or incantation as each took flame
surveyed the dimly lit room for a mo-
ment then turned to the professor bid
them take orders from me if you please
he answered

  while professor morine repeated the
command de grandin drew forth five
shallow silver dishes from beneath the
table poured some thick dark fluid into
each from a prodigious hip-flask then
from another flask he added some fur-
ther liquor dark like the first but thinner
and less viscid as he recorked the second
flask i became aware of the pleasant
heady odor of port wine

  each of the five dishes he placed just
outside one of the five points of the
pentagram then drawing something
which jangled musically from beneath
the table he handed morine and me each
a small ecclesiastical censer and set the

weird tales

point there came a strange soft sound
such a sound as a cat makes when it laps
milk and the rubescent liquid in the dish
showed faint ripples as though disturbed
by a dabbling finger-or an invisible
tongue lower lower sank the liquid
the bowl was now all but empty

  softly swiftly de grandin moved
snatching one after another of the silver
vessels dragging them within the outline
of the pentagram

  again we waited the monotonous re-
frain gilles garnier give me back what
you withhold dinning in our ears then
in a farther corner of the room showed
a faint and ghastly phosphorescence
brighter and brighter it glowed took
shape took substance - a monstrous
shaggy white wolf crouched in the angle
of the wall

  the beast was bigger than a mastiff
bigger than an irish wolfhound almost
as big as a half-grown heifer and from
its wide and gaping mouth there lolled a
gluttonous red tongue from which a drop
of dark-red liquid dripped but dreadful
as the monsters size and aspect were its
eyes were more so incongruous as living
orbs glaring through the eye-holes of a
skull they were fierce fiery malevolent
and human but human only to be vi-
cious cunning and wicked as human
intellect perverted is crueler than the in-
stincts of the crudest of brute beasts

  for a moment the monster glared at
us then with a bellowing cry of rage it
rose upon its haunches got to all four
feet and charged full-tilt upon us

  accursed of heaven cast-off of hell
give back that which you withhold de
grandin cried advancing to an angle of
the pentagram to meet the werewolfs
charge swinging his censer toward it so
that clouds of incense floated forward
and returning the wolf-things glare with
a stare of equal hatred and ferocity

  where the narrow chalk-line of the

pentagram traced across the floor the
great beast stopped abruptly as though
in contact with a solid wall gave a bay
of wild insensate rage and recoiled
choking and gasping from the cloud of
incense

  accursed of heaven give back that
which you withhold de grandin or-
dered yet again

  the great white beast eyed him ques-
tioningly lowered itself till its bellyhairs
scarcely cleared the floor and slowly cir-
cled round the pentagram whining half
fearfully half savagely

  accursed of heaven give back that
which you withhold came the inexor-
able command once more

  oddly the wolf-thing seemed losing
substance its solidarity seemed dwin-
dling where a moment before it had
been substantial as any terror of the for-
est we could now plainly discern the out-
lines of the room through its body as
though it were composed of vapor it
lost its red and white tones and became
luminous like a figure traced in phos-
phorescent paint on a dark background
the head the trunk the limbs and tail
became elongated split off from one an-
other rose slowly toward the ceiling like
little globes of luminosity floated in mid-
air a moment then slowly settled toward
the monotonously droning sitters round
the table

  as each luminous globe touched a sit-
ters head it vanished not like a bursting
bubble but slowly like a ponderable sub-
stance being sucked in as milk in a gob-
let vanishes when imbibed through a
straw

  a single tiny pear-shaped globule of
light remained bobbing aimlessly against
the ceiling bouncing down again as an
imprisoned wasp may make the circuit of
a room into which it has inadvertently
flown

  accursed of heaven give back that

 short she had walked across an angle of
 the pentagram oversetting and extin-
 guishing one of the candles as she did so

   i wont be bullied and insulted by
 you any longer you miserable little
 french snip she announced striding
 toward him ill-

    the fire-ball fell to the floor as though
 suddenly transmuted to lead we could
 hear the impact as it struck the boards
 for a moment it rolled aimlessly to and
 fro seemed to shrink-compress itself-
 and quickly took on the shape of a tiny
 white wolf

    scarcely larger than a mouse it was but
 a perfect replica of the great beast which
 had menaced us a few moments earlier
 even to its implacable savagery with a
 howl which was hardly more than a rat-
 squeak in volume yet fierce and terrify-
 ing for all that it dashed across the room
 straight at the angle of the pentagram
 where the candle had been overturned

   pardieu we meet on something like
 even ground monsieur le loup-garou i
 think de grandin cried seized one of
 the small sharp-pointed daggers from
 the floor and impaled the advancing
 miniature monster with its keen blade

   the tiny savage thing died slowly
 writhing horribly with teeth and claws
 it fought against the steel which pinned
 it to the floor blood and futile hissing
 agonized squealing howls issuing from
 its gaping mouth at last its struggles
 ceased it quivered and lay still

a crucifix and also a dagger which had
