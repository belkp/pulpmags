why duofold outsells any other

though hosts of pens are lower-priced	ksaf

          says a hotel man
my duofold was used by 
hotel guests and their different styles
of writing didnt alter the point one
iota

    four train dispatchers declare
its the only pen that stands our
gruelling pace  hours a day  days a
week its worth twice as much in the
hand as it costs in the show-case

           states an author
its -year point makes writing lux-
urious its so beautifully smooth and
quiet-going its full-handed grip
doesnt try to elude the fingers or tire
the hand

          a salesman says
i laid down ablack peninapost office
and walked off and forgot it then i
bought a parker duofold and its
black-tipped lacquer-red color always

flashes my eye this friendly caution
dont leave your pen behind 

       two women speak thus
its color makes it easy to find on my
desk says a young business woman
and a fashion writer declares  it adds
a gay touch to any costume

             says an artist
it has classic lines and balanced
symmetry adds a golf expert

        an executive writes us
i signed  checks in  hr  min
without once refilling its over-size
barrel

 is all it costs to own this speedy
sure-fire writer with the over-size ink
capacity and -year point

   occasionally one of our stories will be called an off-the-trail story a warning that it is in some way different from the
   usual magazine stories perhaps a little different perhaps a good deal it may violate a canon of literature or a custom of maga-
   zines or merely be different from the type usually found in this magazine the difference may lie in unusual theme material
   ending or manner of telling no question of relative merit is involved

punctuated by a stinging slap shorty
carroways breath came in gasps from be-
tween a pair of bruised bleeding lips

his weight resting on the heaving chest
of the big man under him knees jammed into
the bulging muscles of that beaten mans
forearms shortys full-swung slaps jolted
the swollen battered face then the little
cowpunchers hand gripped the shock of
hair and raised the big head from the saw-
dust-covered floor

shorty shifted his weight to one side and a
sharp-roweled long-shanked spur raked

the ribs beneath the big mans heavy macki-

bloodshot eyes of the heavyweight cham-
pion of the little rockies

  yuh made a crack a few minutes ago
that you was the toughest gent in montana

adventure

 of miners and cowpunchers who crowded
 backward behind the battered pool table
 and abandoned faro layout

   thats my lit ol runt of a pardner
 yonder he taunted the surly crowd my
 danged lit ol bench-legged pard watch
 him hombresl watch him dost while yuh
 see yore alder gulch champeen git his
 needins got ary more sledge-swingin
 snuff-eatin loud-mouthed fightin men
 that wants tuh git worked down to shortys
 size and whupped by a gent that does it
 scientific got ary more nasty remarks
 tuh make about the ponies that me and my

 pardner rides got ary-

   what the - goes on in here

   the voice came from the doorway in no
 uncertain tones a gray mustached white-
 haired man of stocky build stepped through
 the swinging doors to the lapel of his open
 vest was pinned a sheriffs badge a blue-
 barreled  covered tad

   behind the sheriff stood a mottle-faced
 white-aproned man in shirt sleeves the
 mans clothes were torn and dust-covered
 his pudgy hands and mottled face were
 covered with small cuts

tad shoved his gun back into the waist-
band of his faded overalls he grinned
pleasantly at the sheriff nodded then his
grin widened as he looked at the portly man
 in the discolored apron

   so yore back eh he said pleasantly
 jest like a danged jack-in-the-box i
 pitch yuh out the window and yuh come
 back through the door

   tad turned to shorty who heedless of
 the interruption was lending an attentive
 ear to the pleadings of the whipped miner

   let up on the big rock-buster shorty
 he called john law has done took chips
 in the game

   tads words had much the same effect as
 a bucket of ice water thrown on a couple of
 fighting dogs shorty got to his feet felt of
 a discolored and partially closed eye and
 reached for papers and tobacco he grinned
 uneasily into the cold-blue eyes of the sheriff

   hand me my gun taddie he said his
 breath coming in labored gasps wed
 jest as well be moving along i reckon

    but the sheriff blocked the exit

   im takin charge uh the shootin irons
 he said sternly ante big un butts
 first thanks

   he shoved the tendered weapons into his
 waistband

  will you two come peaceable er do i put
the cuffs on yuh

  yuh mean were arrested gasped

shorty

  yuh dont think fer a minute that you
trouble hunters kin come into my town

bust out windows and raise-in general

and not see the inside uh my jail do yuh
shorty turned a sorrowful gaze on his big
partner

  kin yuh beat it tad kin yuh ever tie
it looks like its agin the law tuh trim
down oxes like that bohunk settin yonder
a-feelin his sore spots down home theres
a bounty on em

  but were a long ways from home runt
and as the sayin goes we has fell among
strangers montana aint arizona and our

footin aint so- solid as she might be

  but dang it all sheriff pleaded shorty
the low-down skunk was blackguardin my
skewball pony the best hoss barrin
none that ever packed a cow hand yuh
seen him outside bald-faced black with
stockin legs the fastest cow pony north

uh-is skewball and i aint aimin tuh

have no quartz-clawin pick-rassler hoo-
rawin me regardin him ill gouge his

eyes outa him an-

  tads restraining hand kept shorty from
renewing the fight the crowd surged for-
ward angrily

  easy runt cautioned tad yuh won
yore fight were plumb overmatched

  why the-dont you take em to the

hoosegow whined the white-aproned sa-
loon man theyll be gettin away if yuh
aint careful

  i reckon not said the sheriff i got
their guns

  yore plumb welcome to the smoke-
poles sheriff grinned tad neither uh
the durned things is loaded like our
pockets our guns is empty as the sayin
goes likewise our bellies i hope yuh
feeds yore prisners we aint et since
day afore yesterday

  the sheriff gave the pair an odd look
then herded them outside they almost
collided with an extremely tall black-clad
man who stood on the sidewalk the man
had evidently been taking in the scene from
outside his height permitted him to see
over the short swinging doors into the
saloon

  the long-tailed black coat white shirt
and black string tie gave the tall man the
paid off



appearance of a minister the mans face
however belied such a worthy calling
lean thin-lipped unsmiling it was a face
without a single redeeming feature his
eyes were small a pale gray in color set
close together on each side of a thin beak of
a nose

  a wide-brimmed weather-worn black
stetson covered the head that tad felt sure
must be bald the mans reddish eye-
brows met in a scowl as he met the cow-
punchers frankly curious gaze

  i bet hes a cross between a buzzard and
a rawhide rope said shorty as the sheriff
shoved them along

  one uh these here fire an brimstone
sky pilots gone wrong is my bet which
of us wins sheriff added tad

  neither the sheriffs tone was sharp
with annoyance you shore cooked yore
goose with them bright remarks yuhll
git the limit now when yore trial comes up
that was luther fox

  and who inquired the punchers in
unison is luther fox

  yuh mean tuh say yuh never heerd tell
uh fox

  were plumb strangers mister lets
have it both barrels

  he couldnt help hearin them remarks
mumbled the sheriff musing aloud

hmmm -s tuh pay all around

  but you was goin to tell us about this
fox hinted tad

  was i i reckon not i dont talk to
nobody about that gent

  the sheriffs tone was decisive

  tad glancing covertly at the old sheriff
caught a glimpse of tightly clamped jaws
beneath shaggy white brows the sheriffs
keen eyes smoldered with some inner fire
it was a dogged sullen look strangely out
of keeping with the general make up of the
grizzled law officer

  yuh dont mean tuh say that ole scare-
crow has yuh buffaloed put in shorty
wincing as tads spur raked his shin with
meaning vigor

  the sheriff turned on shorty eyes ablaze
with hot resentment

  who said i was scared whoever told
yuh that lied lied hear me

  the sheriff fairly trembled with fury
he seemed about to hit shorty with the 
in his hand

  tad poised easily on the balls of his feet
clenched his big fist and his practised eye

picked the point where the well-placed blow
would put the sheriff to sleep there was a
look of resignation in the big punchers eyes

  then the sheriff wjith an effort regained
control of himself and turned from short
tad gave a sigh of relief striking an of-
ficer even in defense of his partner was
little to his liking

  the trio moved on in silence for some mo-
ments tad meeting shortys eyes gave
his little partner a ferocious look shorty
squirmed uneasily

  im askin yore pardon sheriff he
said meekly i was jest tryin tuh be
funny it was a fool crack to make and
im plumb sorry

  his tone was sincere the sheriff nodded
his silent acceptance of the apology

  i reckon its shore gaily uh me tuh be
askin ary favors sheriff shorty put in
as they halted before the padlocked door of
the log jail but would yuh kinda look
after our bosses while me and tad is
penned up

  uh course agreed the sheriff yore
hosses will be took care of yuh wont be
needin em where yore goin better sell
em tuh git lawyer money

  is it goin tuh be that bad asked tad
seriously

  wuss came the cryptic reply and the
two prisoners heard the click of the padlock
as the sheriff locked them in

  in dejected silence the two listened to
the receding tinkle of the sheriffs spurs

  well my short-complected amigo yuh
shore done us proud this day tad broke
the silence you and that hair-trigger
temper uh yourn kin shore git us into more
trouble than ten judges and a herd uh law
sharps kin git us outa yuh mighta put
off the show till after wed grazed some
im gaant as a dogie in the spring follerin
a hard winter

  and if i hadnt took it up when that
box-ankled shovel swinger insulted us wed
uh bin run outa town for a coupla uh
sheepherders you was doin a heap uh
yellin and so on fer a gent that hates
fightin it was you that busted that purty
shiny window by thowin that drink mixer
through it yuh mighta slung him out the
door jest as easy but no yuh had tuh go
bustin things that glassll set us back
the price of ten good drunks and a reason-
able fine got ary terbaccer tuh go with
this here brown paper ox

  tad handed over a thin sack with a pinch
of tobacco in the bottom

  gimme butts on er runt its the
taiiins uh the last sack uh what was once a
full caddy uh smokin fer which yore still
owin me for yore half uh the price say
what ails that sheriff i wonder he
like tuh busted a ham-string when yuh
joshed him about that fox feller shorty
theres somethin danged queer about the
whole deal raisin a lil ol ruckus in
yonder saloon aint no penitentiary offense
the way that ol sheriff took on a mand
thought wed killed a few folks is them
bars yonder solid

  solid as rocks tad even if they was
loose we bin on short grazin so long that
were too weak to pry em loose if the
paint hoss hadnt got drowned crossin the
missouri and our beds and grub got lost
wed uh bin to the wyomin line by now
and if you and that overworked temper
uh yourn hadnt broke out and run hog
wild yesterday wed uh got a square meal
and a job with that outfit we struck at noon
work fer that spread after that black
muzzled wagon-boss asked me was i ex-
pectin boys wages and could i hold down
a hoss wranglers job i wisht yuh had let
me finish workin that smart aleck over
ox i was jest gettin my second wind
when yuh drug me off him

  say

  huh shorty startled by the ve-
hemence of his partners exclamation
turned from his inspection of the bars across
the one window what bit yuh

  i was jest rememberin that black-
whiskered gents talk yuh mind shorty
he says to us that luther fox dont pay
out good money to undersized gents that
cant do a mans work

 mans work i showed him what a

man and son we shore set into a hard game
if weve hurt the ol rannyhans feelins
i dont like the lay uh the land shorty

none whatsomever

  if that ol wolf sets his mind to it our
hidesll be hangm on the fence afore
mornin yeah and if him and his
black-muzzled wagon boss ever gits tuh
makin medicine and the black gent lows
were the same parties that rode into his
camp and raised a ruckus me and you is due
tuh stretch some rope

  that big bohunk of a quartz wranglerll
be rearin tuh work in the lead uh sech a
necktie party too was shortys wry com-
ment whatll we do taddie shucks

i	hates tuh stay bogged down here till
they come tuh hang us i dont have no
-of a lot uh confidence in that ol sher-
iff feller if it comes to a fight

  yuh might uh done some heavy thinkin
along them lines afore yuh got us into all
this yuh fire-swallerin lil ol rooster now
gimme butts on that smoke sos i kin
smudge some thoughts outa my brain

ii

  way up high in the mokiones among the
      mountain tops

  a lion cleaned a yearlins bones and licked his
       thankful chops

  when who upon the scene should ride a trippin
       down the slope

  but high-chin bob of sinful pride and maverick-
       hungry rope

         shortys voice loud and high

          pitched filled the small cabin
  i	fr once tad found no fault

a y with his partners singing this

man-

  dry up fergit it yuh dont foller
my meanin luther fox must own that
cow outfit that black whiskers works for
saber

 uh-huh and supposin he does
what of it go on from there big un
and lets see if yore words makes sense

  well from where i was settin that
round-up looked like a big spread they
was holdin a herd that a man couldnt shoot
across looked like three hundred head uh
hosses in their remud a if this fox feller
owns that outfit hes one danged big cow-

because the sound of the singers voice
drowned out what noise tad might be mak-
ing as he whittled doggedly at the pine log
wherein the iron bars of the window were
embedded

  shorty eyes fixed on the heavy pine
door sang with the air of one who does his
duty in the face of great obstacles with-
out missing a note he gathered in a handful
of whittlings and shoved the shavings under
his hat which lay on the floor then his
toe poked tads shin with none too gentle
contact and the whittling ceased shorty
resuming his seat on the edge of the bunk
sang on head tilted upward eyes half closed

 thus the sheriff found them when he
entered bearing a heavily laden tray

they looked innocent enough these two
paid off



shorty reclining on the bunk tad gazing
broodingly out between the rusty bars in
an attitude of silent dejection

  ten oclock breakfast taddie shorty
thus broke off his song come and git it
er i thow it away gosh amighty tad
its real grub steak and taters and pie
sheriff yore a plumb white man

  the sheriff grinned and set the tray on
the table the grin gave the old officer an
almost benign appearance

  have at it cowboys afore she gits cold
its the best i could rustle at the chinks

place yuh earned it both uh yuh my
hats off tuh ary two gents that kin clean up
alder gulch on empty bellies and with
empty guns

  yuh aint holdin no hard feelins

  not me joe kipp aint that kind
personal it done me good tuh see that big

miner whupped that-bartender had

it cornin too

  gosh

  tad swallowed a mouthful of food
washed it down with a swallow of coffee and
eyed the sheriff in mild surprize

   pears tuh me like youd had a sudden
change uh mind sheriff yuh acted
plumb ringy when yuh nabbed us

  folks was watchin the bartender
had swore out a complaint and with fox
a-watchin i had tuh go through

  yuh mean this luther fox gent is after
yore taw hes rearin tuh jump yore
frame

  somethin like that him and me dont
waste no soft-spoke love words on one
another

  he paused scowling at the floor as if
worrying out some problem

  theres more than a few gents on this
range thatll tell yuh im scared uh luther
fox and black jack he finished

  black jack

  foxs wagon boss runs the lf spread
tad and shorty exchanged grins
black-whiskered gent eyes like a
injun

  kipp nodded

  you boys know him

  we come by the lf round-up yeah
we know him tuh look at

  aint yuh the boys from the south
inquired kipp i see yuh both ride

feller says when shorty on his skewball
pony bustin that water like a side gougin
steamboat jest nacherally ropes me takes

drifts to a sand bar and wades out while
shorty bails the mud and water outa me
drunk er sober my shorty pard aint much
tuh look at but theres times when he
shows good pints

  shucks sherriff dont pay no mind tuh
tad grinned the self-concious shorty
he shore likes the sound uh his own voice
if yuh was tuh thow him and mouth him
yuhd find his front teeth plumb wore down
that comes from his havin his mouth open
fer talkin so much the wind a-blowin to


adventure

and fro across his teeth consequental has
wore em down

  the sheriff was beginning to like these
two oddly mated partners thoroughly he
moved across the floor to a chair as he
did so he accidently moved shortys hat
revealing the pile of whittlings shorty
manfully stepped into the breach

  before the sheriff noticed the little
puncher had grabbed the handful of shav-
ings and shoved them into his mouth

  now swaller whispered tad in an
undertone as he dropped his neckscarf on
the sill to cover the freshly whittled notch
at the base of the steel bar

  shorty swallowed choked gasped and
his tanned face grew purple

  tad moving swiftly promptly up-ended
shorty thumping him on the back with
an unconcern that hinted of boredom
a wad of mashed potatoes well wadded
with shavings spewed forth and tad
promptly kicked the sodden mass under
the bunk

  will yuh hand me the water pitcher
sheriff thanks now irrigate runt

  he held the pitcher to shortys mouth
and poured a generous potion down the
little punchers throat then with a pater-
nal air he sat shorty on the edge of the
bunk and loosened his collar

  aint i told yuh time and again not
tuh swaller yore grub whole little un
dang me if i can see how yuh ever growed
up without chokin tuh death

  tad turned to the sheriff with an apolo-
getic grin

  in spite uh all i tell him that lit var-
mint will wolf his grub it aint the fust
time hes choked down on me thataway
onct at a ice-cream sociable down on the
gila a brockle-faced school marm a-ketch-
in him off his guard with a face full uh

tween the horns im out in the kitchen

ceedins i bin thinkin serious uh knockin

  a shadow passed the window the grin
on kipps face vanished

  here comes fox he whispered play

best man he has in camp shorty and hes

tough men with a empty gun down in

saloon and the busted window fact is

tuh bust the door down

  with a faint uneasy smile kipp rose
and unbolted the heavy door

 luther fox entered with one long
stride his gimlet eyes were fixed on
the remains of the prisoners sumptuous
dinner

  fancy victuals that you give your pris-
oners kipp he spoke in a rasping flat
voice county payin for such grub
kipps eyes took on a chilly look

  i paid the chink outa my own pocket
fox

  luther foxs thin lips twitched at the
corners it may have been meant for a
smile devoid of mirth it seemed to ac-
centuate the cruelty that lurked behind the
pale-gray eyes

  i want that i should be left alone with
these two men kipp clear out

  it was the command of a man who was
accustomed to being obeyed

  tad watching kipp closely saw the
sheriffs mouth tighten so as to leave the
lips a bloodless crooked line for a long
paid off



moment the officer and the cow man held
each others gaze

  fox said kipp measuring his words
with deliberate slowness im sheriff here
this jail is county property i leave here

when i get-ready if yore aimin tuh

smell powder smoke go fer yore gun

  foxs upper up lifted revealing long
crooked yellow teeth they made the
man hideous his long fingers patted the
butt of an ivory-handled  that swung in a
tied holster low down on his thigh

  whenever i pull my gun kipp this
county will be in line for a new sheriff
however its bad luck to kill an officer of
the law our quarrel will keep without
spoilin ill word my wishes differently
id like a few minutes pow-wow with your
prisoners sheriff kipp will you be so
kind as to grant so great a favor

  his long frame bent at the waistline
in a mocking bow rumor had it that
luther fox in his youth had been a new
england schoolmaster like rust corrod-
ing a steel blade frontier contact had well
nigh obliterated the polish that belonged to
that former life occasionally it was vis-
ible usually in the form of sarcasm

  kipp with a visible effort fought down
the hot rage that surged up inside him he
turned on his heel and walked to the door
without a backward glance he closed the
door behind him

	inside the jail tad and shorty
looked up with curious gaze at
fox and waited for him to break

v- the silence that followed kipps

departure foxs lips were again twitching
at the corners otherwise his expression
did not change

  well what have you two got to say for
yourselves he asked finally

  long legs far apart bony fingers twisting
in a knot behind his back he glanced coldly
at the two punchers

  it dont look to me like it was our ante
tad grinned easily the sheriff tells us
yore holdin the joker

  exactly the way the play stands i
can either make or break you two

he paused	

  spread yore cards mister

  tad forestalled the silence that fox had
anticipated a silence during which he had
expected to watch these two cow punchers
squirm

  a frown of annoyance brought his red-
dish brows together he had rather ex-
pected to find the prisoners afraid and eager
to please him instead both were grinning

as if they enjoyed the situation

  very well he snapped i give you
your choice either you go to the peni-
tentiary or on the lf payroll

  penitentiary said tad slowly since
when has it got tuh be a penitentiary offense
tuh mix in a two-bit saloon fight

  assault witha deadly weapon means
a stretch in the big house smiled fox
crossing luther fox you may find is even
a worse crime

  yuh mean youll railroad us eh said
tad evenly he seemed to be musing aloud
yeah i reckon yuh could men my lit
pard is strangers in a strange land and
plumb broke yeah reckon yuh could do
it mister now supposin we take yuh up
on the other proposition jest what kind
uh work do yuh aim that me and shorty
should do tuh earn our pay i might as
well tell yuh now fox our guns aint fer
hire if thats yore game

  the job i have in mind for you two is
legitimate and within the law said fox
a rancher named hank basset owes me
money i hold his note for ten thousand
dollars which falls due next week it will
be your job to ride to his ranch and collect
that ten thousand dollars in cash or steers
since the man is broke the payment will be
made by turning over to me five hundred
head of steers at twenty dollars per head
mighty cheap cattle grunted shorty
fox shrugged

  mebbeso thats beside the question
i am waiting for your answer and it aint
healthy as a rule to keep luther fox
waiting

fox fished a long stogie from his pocket
repaired its broken wrapper with a cigaret
paper and set fire to it his little eyes sur-
veyed them through the haze of blue smoke
tad turned to shorty

  supposin we leave it to the sheriff to
decide fer us pardner

  suits me tad

  luther foxs eyes became pin-points of
glittering gray through the smoke haze
his head thrust forward on a skinny neck
he peered at the two punchers a sinister
hate-lined face unchanging in expression
behind his back the long bony fingers
intertwined until the joints cracked


adventure

  -old buzzard was shortys inward

comment

  without a word fox turned and strode
to the door he swung it open and shoved
his head outside

  come in here kipp he snapped
youre wanted

  kipp a stub of cigaret sticking from the
corner of his mouth rose from his squatting
posture against the log wall of the jail

  fox wants men shorty tuh collect a bad
debt from a gent named hank basset said
tad coming to the point we lowed wed
leave it up tuh you

  kipp nodded

  kinda figgered he might pick you boys
fer the job take him up on it

  were obliged to yuh sheriff grinned
tad mister fox yuh done hired two
hands

  again the twitching at the corners of
luther foxs thin lips

  get your guns from kipp and pull out
i heard your six-shooters were empty
youll find ammunition a-plenty in your
saddle pockets likewise a winchester
apiece in your saddle scabbards heres
an order on basset for the steers

  he held out a folded paper tad shoved it
in his vest pocket fox turned to the sheriff

  kipp these two men are now on my pay-
roll the charges against them are dropped
give em their guns and let em go theyre
wasting lf time here and they have a long
ride ahead if you have any message for
hank basset carry it yourself understand
my men are paid to carry out my orders
not to deliver your messages i think kipp
that you savvy what im driving at even
if these men dont

  i savvy fox returned the sheriff even-
ly as he handed tad and shorty their guns
he ushered them outside

  boys he said ignoring fox i loaded
both yore guns five shells in each six-
gun leavin a empty chamber under the
hammers when yuh ride away from alder
gulch jest remember this them is good
honest catridges bought with clean honest
money so-long and good luck

  kipp nodded a brief farewell and reenter-
ing the jail swung the door closed behind him

  tad and shorty gave each other a puzzled
look then followed the scowling fox toward
the livery bam

  in the corral adjoining the barn were
their private horses saddled also six more

horses and a pack mule the latter bearing
a bed covered by a new tarpaulin

  that gives you three mounts apiece be-
side your privates fox explained youll
help basset gather those steers use your
own judgment about any difficulties that
come up the same as any regular rep
would do one week from tomorrow ill
meet you at the lone cottonwood on rock
creek and receive the cattle i dont want
either of you to forget that youre drawin
lf pay and top wages at that youll
govern yourselves accordingly

  uh-huh grinned tad top wages
fox but not fightin wages me and my
pardner is peaceful fellers lessen we gits
tromped on we dont travel none on our
shapes ner lead-slingin qualities we aint
wanted no place fer no crime and we dont
figger on leavin this country with a posse
follerin us well gather them steers but
we wont fight none tuh hold em i bin

steers yoresef er send some uh yore regular
hands tuh do the job we taken the sheriffs
say-so about hirin out and well see the
play through to the last card but we aint
doin no dirty jobs fer no man mister

  tad had swung aboard his horse and sat
slouched in the saddle watching fox

  get the cattle and ill be satisfied re-
plied fox yonders the trail bassets
home ranch lays at the foot of that hazy
peak you should make it by daylight to-
morrow follow this trail till you come to
the lone cottonwood where the trail forks
take the right hand trail

  shorty swung open the pole gate and tad
hazed the horses into the open

  legs spread far apart hands clenched
behind his back luther fox stood in the
dusty trail and watched them out of sight
once more the corners of his cruel mouth
twitched oddly as he watched the rapidly
fading dust cloud that hid the partners his
eyes glittered with a look of cunning

hi

i dunno jest why tad
shorty broke the silence but
wrmvt i shore feel sorry fer that kipp
gent hes right old tuh be
pestered by a skunk like fox his nerves
aint so steady as they once was i seen his
paid off

ii

hand shake when he called foxs hand a
man cant do good shootin when his hand

shakes tad

  hed a played his string out though
shorty even when he knowed fox ud
beat him to the draw kipps game and
i reckon thats why we kinda cottoned to
him besides he shore fed us good im
wonderin what he meant by sayin hed put
honest catridges in our guns reckon
were nosin into a range war danged if
we dont git into more jams than a burglar
yonders the lone cottonwood

  the sun had just set and the rolling hills
were bathed in the subdued afterglow the
greasewood flat beyond took on the appear-
ance of a dark-green carpet distant peaks
reflected the last rays of the sun a covey
of sage hens whirred from the brush in front
of the horses then dropped out of sight
tad and shorty pulled up in front of the
giant cottonwood eyes fixed on a rudely
lettered sign nailed to the wide trunk a sign
riddled with bullets

  warning to lf men this here tree is my north
boundry hie ine runs due west to squaw butte
ary fox man that crosses that line will be huntin
trouble and hell shore find it hank basset

  tad waved a hand toward the sign

  yonders the reason why me and you are
picked fer the steer-gatherin job runt i
knowed there was a ace hid up foxs sleeve
what do yuh say pard do we turn back
from here er go through with it

  we done hired out fer the job tad
lets play our string out shucks id hate
tuh be bluffed out by ary sign

  tad nodded thoughtfully

  kipp aimed that we should go through
theres more to this play than a bad debt
and im right curious tuh turn the next page
haze that hammer-headed pack-slippin
mule on to the trail and well git goin
pardner im rearin tuh git a squint at

hand yuh shore kin git shet of a heap uh
advice ill remind yuh about it when yore
yellin fer me tuh pull this basset feller off
yuh git along mule

  hours passed and the moon rose if the
future held any fear for these two followers
of the dim trails they gave no sign shorty
rode in the lead picking the trail some-
times he sang and as the words of the lament
drifted back to tad the lanky puncher
grinned his appreciation and hummed an
off-key accompaniment now and then
they dozed heads swaying gently with the
movements of their horses innumerable
cigarets were rolled smoked and the butts
pinched out thus the night wore on and
the first streak of dawn found them halted
before a pole gate

   beyond the gate lining the near-by creek
were innumerable tall cottonwoods a thin
spiral of smoke lifted from the chimney of a
hidden cabin twenty feet beyond the gate
was a buck-brush thicket not a sound
broke the quiet of the morning

   shorty leaned in his saddle to pluck forth
the wooden pin that held the gate closed
a moment later he straightened

  shes locked with a stay chain and pad-
lock tad he called softly

  reckon we better call out afore we goes
further with the game haloooooo

   he raised his voice in a wolf-like howl
followed a moment of silence then in
an ordinary tone of voice that caused both
punchers to jump with surprize a man
called from the brush patch

  hello yoreself jest set where yuh be
till we looks yuh over a spell keep the
little un covered with the shotgun ma
ill make a sieve outa him if he makes
ary move hank tend to the big feller

squattin behind aint so thick as she might
be i kin see yuh plain yuhd orter pick
a boulder fer shelter

  a muffled curse and cracking of twigs
came from the brush as hank basset shifted
his position tads eyes followed the mov-
ing brush tops his ruse had worked he
now knew where the cow man crouched
shorty grinned his approval at tads clever
lying

  good guessin taddie now shoo that
there settin hen of a female from her nest
and well feel easier he whispered if it
comes to the wust we gotta run we cant
noways shoot no female women i might

plenty of em thatll take it theres our
proposition basset take it er leave it
there was a long silence broken only by
whispering between the cow man and his
wife then the answer came from behind
the boulder in the voice of ma basset

  shed yore guns and fight as long as
we gotta be pestered with lf menitd as
well be you two as them others keerful
how you handle yore hands while yore
coming through the fence keep to the
middle of the wagon road that leads to the
house hank ami mell have yuh covered
every step

  tad and shorty exchanged a quick look
tad nodded briefly

  shed the cannon pard and well take
her up

  they tossed their guns to the ground
swung from the saddle and approached with
their hands in the air the presence of a
woman caused shorty to blush confusedly
but tad seemed to rather enjoy the situ-
ation once through the barbed-wire fence
they kept to the road a bend in the road
brought them in view of the buildings

the sun was just rising and both
cowpunchers gazed in surprize
at the scene spread before them
low walled log buildings the
sod roofs covered with green grass and wild
mustard well-built horse corrals branding
shute and branding pen beyond a well-
irrigated alfalfa patch blooming and ripe
paid off



for cutting a small blacksmith shop sur-
rounded by mowers rakes and two round-
up wagons everything neat and orderly
rare indeed for a cattle ranch

  the ranch house and adjacent bunk house
were whitewashed and climbing the walls
were masses of morning glories wild rose
bushes pink blossoms wet with the early
morning dew lined the gravel walk that
led to the doors all around were the tall
cottonwoods

  gosh whispered shorty and removed
his hat

  tad followed suit they halted on the
threshold of the open door carefully wiping
their feet on the burlap sack mat tad
sniffed the warm air that came from the
kitchen

  from the service-berry brush behind the
cowpunchers stepped the oddly mated
couple with their shotguns

  hank basset shorter by six inches and
lighter by some eighty pounds than his wife
was clad in faded flannel shirt and freshly
laundered neatly patched overalls slight-
ly bent over tanned the color of an old
saddle a bald patch showing in the center
of his silvery hair he was anything but war-
like in appearance his mild blue eyes
twinkled with humor but there was a look
about his straight mouth and square chin
that told of hidden determination and a
fearless spirit if he were roused

  ma basset red of cheek her well-combed
abundance of gray hair glistening in the
morning sun was as neat as her rose bushes
and as fresh looking in her red-and-white
checked gingham despite the scowl that
furrowed her wide brow there was every-
thing in her make-up to denote a generous
mothering personality a bit stout to be
sure but her step was firm and alert and her
bare arms were more muscular than fat
a woman of the pioneer stock ranch born
and raised as much at home in the saddle
as in her immaculate kitchen a fair example
of the cattle mans wife whose courage and
sacrifice has played so important a role in
the building of the west even as her
mother before her had fought indians so
now did ma basset wield her sawed-off
shotgun in defense of her home

  suddenly tad sprag forward into the
open door of the kitchen

  coffees bilin over he bellowed over
his shoulder

  shorty left on the threshold shoved his

aching arms higher in the air and gazed with
agonized eyes into the twin barrels of ma

bassets raised shotgun

  tad now appeared in the doorway hold-
ing aloft the steaming coffee pot as proof of
his good intentions

 - amighty yuh big lummox

groaned shorty yuh like tuh got me
killed

  there was that in the appearance of the
two partners to cause even the stoniest
hearted to smile shorty his swollen eye a
sickly green tanned face perspiring and red
from suppressed emotion and embarrass-
ment gazing beseechingly at his partner
tad his homely rough-hewn features
wreathed in an infectious grin holding aloft
the huge granite-ware coffee pot

  shucks hank muttered ma basset in
an undertone of relief them two boys
aint no badmen why that pore little
feller is nigh scared tuh death dont sup-
pose he ever hurt a livin thing in his hull
life my gracious but that big un did give
me a start when he tore into the house
thataway i was sure certain he was aimin
to make a fight of it lawzee

  the elderly couple dkl not relax their
vigilance however until breakfast was well
on its way

  tad with his unaffected loquacious man-
ner did much to quell suspicion he in-
sisted on putting on an apron and helping
with the breakfast all the while keeping up
an aimless chatter with the lady of the
house more than often he had her
chuckling gaily

  shorty in the front room with hank
told a straightforward story of their sojourn
in alder gulch

  yuh mean that you whupped that big
miner by yoreself why fox claims that
big hunkie is a ex-prize fighter

  shorty shrugged

  i dunno about that mister if hes a
pug hes a pore un youd uh died laffin
tuh see tad a-holdin off that gang with a
empty gun

  and you boys aint fightin fer luther
fox

  mister said shorty solemnly when
me and ted draws our shootin irons we
does it because somebodys crowdin us er
our friends bad were aimin tuh go back
tuh arizony some day and we got friends
down there that we want tuh look square in
the eyes sabe


adventure

  breakfast is about ready called ma
basset from the doorway

  hank and shorty got to their feet
maam said shorty flushing hotly
our hosses is outside the fence yonder
my grub ud plumb choke me if i was tuh
set down to the table afore id took care uh
my skewball hoss tad i reckon feels the
same about his yaller hammer hoss hed
a said so hissef only hes a-tormentin me
by makin me axe yuh kin we be excused
while we tends to em the big walloper
pesters me continual when theres women
folks around

  shorty was the color of an indian blanket
by now tad grinning widely winked at
hank

  tush son smiled ma basset now
dont you pay no attention to him hed
orter be ashamed uh hisself tormentin a
boy half his size you boys hurry on now
and tend to yore ponies the key to the
gate hangs on a nail on the gate post un-
saddle and turn yore hosses into the pasture
theres blue-joint grass and watera-plenty
there ill put the biscuits and eggs in the
warmin oven hurry now

  five minutes later there came the sound
of splashing water ma basset look-
ing- out the kitchen window nodded her
approval

  theyre washin-up at the bunkhouse
hank she whispered those boys has
had raisin

  when a man sets down to his grub afore
hes took care uh his hoss watch out fer
him added hank i was a-waitin tuh
see if they was goin tuh let their animals
wait it dont take no smart gent tuh see
that theyre as different from the other lf
riders as a gentleman is different from a
sheep herder i bin thinkin ma mebbe
so them two boys kin help us theyre
kinda like home folks sorter

  help us

  ma basset shoved a second pan of bis-
cuits in the oven and closed the door
thoughtfully then she straightened

  help us hank im afeered not the
cattles gone thats all theyre good boys
like as not but they cant make a herd uh
cattle outa a handful uh sore-footed cows
and wind-bellied calves no were beat
and beat bad but we aint hollerin
neither of us if only our pete boy was back
home id feel as chipper as a meadow lark
but the thought uh him cooped up in a

prison cell kinda takes the warm feelin
outa the sunshine somehow

  tears glistened in her eyes she seated
herself on a chair and dabbed at the tears
with the corner of her apron hank crossed
over to her and put an arm about her
shoulders

  tad and shorty had removed their spurs
at the bunkhouse they made but little
noise as they came to the door and halted
to wipe the dust from their boots they
could not help but see what went on inside
the kitchen embarrassed they looked at
each other in silence

  our pete sent over the road by that low-
down lf spread our cattle run off and a
ten-thousand-dollar note due next week
came the voice of hank basset whose back
was toward the cowpunchers its hard
lines fer folks as old as us ma but we aint
licked yet i kin still hold down a job
punchin cows

  and i kin beat ary round-up cook that
ever burned a batch uh beans er turned a
mess wagon over added ma basset brave-
ly yuh mind that fall when i cooked fer
the outfit hank and drove two broncs fer
wheelers i can do it again too

  tad a vise-like grip on his partners arm
backed quietly away from the door on
tiptoe they retreated to the bunkhouse
then with careless step and a whistle com-
ing discordantly from tads pursed lips
they again approached the kitchen

  ma bassets eyes showed faint signs of
redness and hank seemed somewhat ill at
ease he led them back into the front
room

  biscuits aint quite done he explained
waving the two punchers to chairs

  he moved stealthily to a cupboard and
reached a hand in behind the curtain it
came forth holding a brown bottle

  ma keeps it fer snake bite he whis-
pered have a nip

  but before he could hand the bottle to
the expectant shorty an approaching step
sounded from the kitchen hank deftly
slid the bottle back behind the curtain a
second before his wife appeared in the
doorway

  in ma bassets hand was a piece of raw
beefsteak and a strip of cloth

  fer your eye she told shorty and
forthwith tied the piece of meat over the
swollen and discolored member

  your pardner was a-tellin me how you
paid off



fell off your hoss and bunged that eye up
she smiled standing aside to survey the
bandage critically

  hoss thowed me returned shorty
dazedly shucks i--

  nothin to be ashamed of she replied
there aint a bronc rider livin that aint
got it some time er another

  never was a rider that never got
thowed chanted tad trying in vain to
catch his partners eye never was a
bronc that never got rode he finished the
rime

  but shorty did not see hank was shift-
ing uneasily in his rawhide-bottomed chair
he too seemed to be trying to convey a
silent message of some sort to shorty

  but maam i-

  ma aint them biscuits a burnin
hank was sniffing the air like a hound
scenting a fox ma her thoughts diverted
to the bread made her way hastily to the
kitchen

  hanks hand darted to the cupboard and
the bottle of whisky came forth once more
this time it went the rounds hank re-
placed the cork and the bottle vanished
behind the curtain

  now ox growled shorty howtcome
yuh lied about this here eye

  miz basset lowed that them as mixed
up in saloon fights was mighty low-down
sorter humans sabe tuh keep yuh from
bein disgraced i lied a mite about that
black eye that miner hung on yuh

  ma is plumb sot agin fightin added
hank i aimed tuh wise yuh up but it
kinda slipped my mind onct when i gits
tangled up in a nice quiet scrap and shows
up with a swole up jaw ma kinda quaran-
tined me off and i et slept and subsisted
as the sayin goes in the blacksmith shop
one uh the boys toted my grub to me
doggone she was on the prod she dont
paw the earth ner beller loud ner bend no
rollin pins across a mans withers no sir
she jest swells up like a buck injun gits
proud and haughty and kinda looks a
feller over like he was lower than a sheep
herder

  shorty was not cheered by this bit of
news ma basset summoned them to break-
fast at this juncture and the little puncher
inwardly writhed with the burden of a
guilty conscience pangs of hunger con-
quered however and he ate as heartily as
tad

       iv

i aint noways aimin tuh be
hollerin explained old hank
spraying a sage bush with to-
bacco juice i jest want that
you boys should know what kind of a skunk
yore workin fer and how hes throwed the
hooks to me

  tad and shorty riding on either side of
the cattle-man nodded

  two years ago come july fourth my
son pete gits into a jam over a hoss that
black jack is abusin on the street in alder
gulch black jack pulls a gun hes
tanked up on injun whisky and onery as

- sabe he hates the pete boy anyhow

helena tuh see the governor and i comes
back and starts the fall round-up with as


adventure

sorry a crew as ever rode a good hoss tuh
death my range covers the country be-
tween the lone cottonwood and the missouri
river some eighty thousand acres and
shes supposed tuh be fair stocked gents
it sounds scary when i tell it and yuh kin
believe it er not but we works that range
and we dont gather five hundred head uh
steers somebodys beat us to it under-
stand and im cleaned out complete

  i ships the five hundred head which
dont bring no kind of a price pays off these
hoss killers and gits joe kipp tuh help me
home with the remuda uh sore-backed hoss-
es then me and joe starts in fer tuh hunt
them stolen cattle

  theres old sign a plenty and when we
cuts the main trail we splits up and follers
it into the bad lands theres mebbe so
a stretch uh rough timbered brakes fer
fifteen-twenty miles betwixt the open prairie
and the river timbered some and stood
on end fer the most part i follers a trail
along a timbered ridge while joe takes the
main trail which seems tuh twist eastward
towards the lf range

  ive rode mebbe so eight-ten miles when
my hat gits knocked off and i hears the pop
of a - some gent has drilled my hat
over behind some boulders is a puff of white
smoke the range is upwards uh five hun-
dred yards i picks up my hat unlimbers
ole meat-in-the-pot and heads fer mister
bushwhacker

  ping off goes my hat onct more and
this time the shot comes from the other
side a good four hundred yards away

whoever is doin that shootin is-good

shots thinkin along them lines and won-
derin where the next bullet will hit i jabs
home the spurs and goes a shootin towards
mister polecat behind the boulders

  wham a winchester barks and my
hoss piles up shot between the eyes i
takes my stand behind his carcass and
throws some lead in the direction uh the
brush patch where i sees the white smoke
fadin away when my gun is empty i
commences shovin fresh shells in the maga-
zine then-busts loose seems like

a army is bombardin me but every
danged bullet is goin about a foot high
sudden like the shootin quits

  got a plenty calls a stranger voice
we bin foolin up to now the next
shootin we does will be the real article
git on yore laigs and hit fer home

  i feels the wind of a steel-jacket bullet
as she misses my nose by about a inch
mad i was bilin gents only fer leavin
ma a widder id uh stayed till they got
me but het up as i was i sees how
plumb useless it is tuh make a fight so i
drags it

  at the edge uh the bad lands where
wed split up i finds joe kipp hes
kinda white and shaky like and hes afoot
the same as me the drawed look around
his mouth and the way his eyes looks at
me makes me feel plumb sorry fer him
hes takin it wuss than i am

   they shot yor hoss and made a danged
target outa yuh joe i asks not knowin
how else tuh ease his feelins

   hank says he solemn like and ear-
nest as - i wish tuh -- theyd

uh killed me instead uh wingin me like
they did

  and he shows me his gun arm busted
between the shoulder and elbow by a soft-
nosed bullet i ties up the arm the best
i kin and we commences that thirty-mile
walk home ol joe never whimpered
onct durin that nights walk though i
knowed he was sufferin bad ner did he
do ary talkin up till then hed bin right
hopeful about gittin them stolen cattle
back but bein set afoot and sech musta
drug it outa him bad fer he aint never bin
the same man since

  theres them that claims hes scared uh
fox and sometimes it shore looks like they
done read the sign right me i dont
know seems like if he was scared uh
fox that hed throw up his tail and quit
but he still holds the job down some day
i look fer him tuh kill fox er git killed a-
tryin

  didnt yuh never make no more fight
tuh find them cattle asked tad after
some silence

  kipp done went down into the hills
two-three times each time he went there
he come back afoot lookin like hed seen
a ghost and somewhere in his hide ud
be a bullet hole not bad jest a kinda
souvenir uh the occasion as the feller
says

  onct i gathers me a posse uh cow-men
from around the county and we slips into
the brakes after night injuns couldnt
uh done it more quiet wed gone mebbe
so five-six miles and was goin single file
down a steep trail that led into a canyon
paid off



sudden like fifty feet dhead uh my hoss-
im in the lead sabe-a match sputters
before i kin unlimber my cannon a heap
uh brush blazes up there we are square
in the fight uh the blaze the trail too narrer
tuh turn around with a dead drop uh two
hundred feet on one side and a shale cliff
on the other on the trail behind us afore
we gits our senses good another brush pile
busts into flame

   do you idjits turn back from here er
does we start a shootin bellers agent from
the dark up above

  it dont take no moren a half-witted
sheep herder tuh decide which to do we
tells this gent that were turnin back

   fifty feet down the trail says he
the trail widens when the front fire goes
out ride over it to that place and turn ary
man that passes that wide point gits a

free ticket tuh - us boys is holed

up here fer a spell and we aint cravin
no visitors the next man that rides into
these brakes dont see his happy home no
more 

  that ended it eh inquired tad

  hank nodded

  i aint never bin back there whats
the use they got the bulge in that coun-
try they kin set on a pinnacle and see
every rider between the brakes and my
place if they got ary fieldglasses which
they likely has the only way tuh git into
the hills is along them trails and every
danged trail is watched them cattle is
like so many flies in a bottle and foxs
hand over the mouth tuh keep em in
the same crew uh gun fighters that keeps
folks from goin into the hills keeps the
cattle from driftin out

 hmm mused tad aloud regular
hole-in-the wall proposition aint it yeah
how many trails leadin into that section
hank

  two came the prompt reply its a
kinda pocket widening out beyond where
the brakes meets the bottom lands

  trails along the river bottoms aint
there

  nary trail ceptin late in the fall when
the waters low its what they call the
narrows except fer where trails has bin
cut out a man cant water his saddle hoss
along the riverbank fer ten miles thirty
and forty foot banks sabe and at each
end uh the ten-mile stretch is a gorge cut

out by spring rains and the cricks which is

   

so full uh quicksand that theyd bog a
jacksnipe a danged pocket i tell yuh
a danged gyp-water soap-hole shale-
banked pocket and theys feed in them
canons tuh winter half the cattle in mon-
tana

  uh-huh yet some way er another
hank it dont sound noways reasonable
that a man cant git in there supposin
that a man was tuh cross the river say at
one uh the ferries ride back on the opposite
bank till he come opposite them narrers
then swim across to where one uh them
trails is cut in the bank

  hank laughed mirthlessly cant be
done pardner my boy pete is the only
human that ever done it and he crossed
when the river was down now at high
water the-hisself couldnt make it

  yore pete done it put in shorty
silent up till now

  hank smiled reminiscently

  pete knowed the river bettern ary
human alive as a kid he used tuh kinda
look after the hosses durin the summer
hed go into the pocket with a pack outfit
and stay there till time fer the fall round-
up long afore i even knowed he could
swim that kid was bustin that river wide
open jest fer the fun of it he like tuh
drowned a dozen hosses learnin em the
channel i never knowed nobody else
that ever swum the missouri at the nar-
rows

  got ary uh them water hosses at the
ranch hank shortys eyes were dancing
excitedly

  shore thing but even if you was fool
enough tuh tackle it shorty the rivers up
and boomin now and the current swiftern
a blue-racer snake i wouldnt let yuh

tackle it boy -s bells what ud yuh

do if yuh did git across

  now theres where yuh got me guessin
grinned the little puncher but that danc-
ing light still flickered in his eyes as they
rode on

  if yore figgerin on playin fish runt
fergit it grunted tad as he licked the
paper of a cigaret

  they rode on in silence for some time
heading back toward the basset ranch

  hank tad broke a lengthy silence
did kipp ever try tuh git help from the
stock association on this deal

  if he did he never said so ner nothin
ever come of it why
i

adventure

  i was jest a-askin thats all came the
evasive reply jest tryin tuh git a squint
at the lay from all sides how long have
yuh knowed kipp

  ever since he come to the country
lemme see about eighteen years near
as i kin figger

  whered he come from

  dont know as joe ever said and i
never asked him look here if yore
figgerin that joe kipp is mixed up with fox
and aint square yore plumb wrong
joes honest bank on that id bet my
last steer on it

  mebbe so yuh done bet em already
and lost em laughed tad

  hank smiled bitterly

  i reckon not ladd does ol joe look
like a crook er a cow thief tuh you

  no hank if ever a man had honest
eyes its kipp a right nice ol feller
from what men shorty seen uh him how
long has this fox pole cat bin clutterin up
the range around here

  three years he leased and bought all
the range he could git holt of and throwed in
some dogie stuff from the south black
jack come with the cattle hes bin after
my range ever since he come to these parts
but he never offered nowhere near a fair
price he told me last time he made me a
offer that it was his top price and if i didnt
take it hed bust me it looks like hes
shore doin it too him and that black-
whiskered injun

  is black jack a injun asked tad
half-breed so they claim apache i
reckon by his looks it wouldnt surprize
me none if hes a outlaw if he wasnt
scared uh bein recognized why does he
wear them whiskers i asked joe but he
lowed a man couldnt arrest a man and
shave him without havin danged good
reason and i reckon hes right

  they rode on each of the three busy
with his own thoughts ma basset was
waiting for them at the corral beside
her stood joe kipp both seemed unusu-
ally excited ma bassets eyes showed
signs of weeping

  god help us and him hank she cried
out as hank dismounted petes escaped
the pen

  have they caught him yet asked
hank his lips white with fear

  he got clean away hank said kipp
i rode over tuh tell yuh

     v

if ever a man looked worried
it was joe kipp every feature
of his tanned face was drawn and
haggard his eyes were blood-
shot and seared with some tortuous pain
his hands shook so that he spilled the to-
bacco he was pouring into a brown paper

  pete was a sorter trusty at deer lodge
he went on to explain he waited till
the chance come then made a clean get-
away he was gone two hours afore they
found it out i got orders tuh watch out
fer him hank yuh see they figger hell
be showin up around these parts

  look here joe kipp said ma basset
firmly her eyes still wet i dont intend
to sit by with my hands in my lap while
you or any other man is gunnin fer my
pete yore a law officer and theres no
way to keep yuh from hangin around here
but im givin yuh warnin here and now
that no man kin take pete while i kin hold
a gun

  she turned to her husband

  hank im glad the boys loose and a
breathin good clean air again he aint
goin back if i kin help it are you standirt
by yore wife and son er do you line up on
the side uh the law that sends innocent
boys tuh prison are yuh-

  hush ma yore excited interrupted
hank uh course im stayin by pete
right er wrong but theres no need
tuh-

  ma basset sent him a withering glance
and whirled on the uncomfortable sheriff

  if you was as eager tuh git back them
stolen cattle as yuh are tuh shoot our pete
boy wed not be facin poverty in our old
age its a wonder tuh me that you got
the nerve tuh show yore face on this ranch
joe kipp

  the sheriff winced as if struck shoulders
sagging eyes fixed on the ground he made
no reply tad and shorty unwilling spec-
tators were heartily wishing themselves
elsewhere

  a mother cat will face a dog fifty times
her size in defense of her young face him
without fear men call it mother instinct
and there is in this life no more courageous
more self-sacrificing nor more beautiful
trait not a man there but respected ma
basset for the stand she took joe kipp
included
paid off



  maam he said his eyes still fixed
on the ground i dont reckon i blame yuh
none fer the way yuh feel but yore
plumb wrong about me gunnin fer pete
basset no matter how the play comes up
i aint drawin no gun on him if i should
cut his trail if i was as ornary as you
figger i am id uh kept my mouth shet and
laid low till pete showed up my idee in
ridin over was tuh kinda let yuh know it
in time tuh warn him in doin that im
violatin my oath uh office

  kipp turned abruptly and swung into
his saddle before hank basset or his
wife could say a word he had ridden
through the pole gate and was lost to sight
in the trees

  id orter have my tongue cut out
said ma basset contritely talkin to
the pore ol feller thataway when he was
doin us a good turn hank git on yore
hoss and ketch him tell him i was jest
a fool woman talkin a lot uh fool nonsense
hank shook his head

  i reckon ol joe savvys ma he aint
holdin no grudge supposin we tackles
some grub its past sundown and we kin
talk this thing over better after weve took
on a bait uh beef and beans

  he jerked the saddle off his horse and
followed his wife to the house

  holler when suppers ready hank
tad told him men shorty wants tuh
tack a shoe on one of our hosses

  hank nodded appreciatively he knew
that there was no horse to shoe and he
thanked tad with a look for the kindly lie
that gave him and his wife a chance to dis-
cuss in private the escape of their son

  when hank had gone in the house tad
turned serious eyes on his partner

  shorty i got a hunch that joe kipps
a worryin over somethin besides this pete
gent hes sick inside as if he was gut shot
and i aim tuh find out whats eatin on him
yuh seen how he flinched when miz basset
lit on him

  yuh dont think the ol fellers playin
a double game do yuh tad shortys
voice dropped to a whisper

  i hate tuh be thinkin hes that ornary
but dang me if there aint some things
about this deal that has me guessin
im goin tuh foller kipp and see what
comes uh it tell hank and miz basset
some durned lie er another about why i

  why cant we both go

  because my well-meanin but plumb
onsenseless amigo its a one man job this

side and-

  of all the plumb dehorned knee-
sprung narrer-foreheaded idiots that ever

and i dont want tuh put in the rest uh the
summer hangin around them sand bars
waitin fer yore fool carcass tuh come

wheres in montana

  ten minutes later shorty watched his
partner ride his fresh horse out the pole
gate and along the trail kipp had taken
a wide grin spread across the little cow
punchers weather-tanned face

  yuh long-legged preacher he muttered

good humoredly yore plumb - on

givin forth wise words aint yuh yuh
give more danged advice than a jersey


adventure

cow gives milk then yuh rides away
tuh hog all the fun whilst i hangs around
the kitchen door like a dad-gummed blow-
fly and whittles sticks till yuh chooses tuh
come back now i gotta go in there and
lie tuh cover yore trail dang yuh well
see about swimmin that river big un
grub pile called hank from the
kitchen door thus putting an end to
shortys muttered tirade against the tyr-
anny of his big partner

  a wicked look gleamed in his eyes as he
made his way to the cabin

  wheres yore partner asked ma
basset

  gone said shorty shaking his head
sadly

  gone gone where

  tuh town i reckon maam i done
the best i could tuh stop him but twant
no use yuh see miz basset hes one uh
these here habitual drunks goes fer
months without tetchin a drop then
sudden like he jest busts out hell swim
rivers climb pinnacles go afoot if he has
tuh till he locates licker then he bogs
down till hes soaked up enough tuh kill
ary ten men forks his hoss and comes
back and the queer part of it is he looks
cold sober all the time i bet a new hat
yuh wont be able tuh tell hes had a drink
when he gits back

  land sakes the pore diseased critter
whod uh thunk he was inflicted thataway
hank i hope he gits home safe

  hank gave shorty a suspicious look and
when ma bassets broad back was turned
the little puncher winked broadly hank
chuckled

  hank basset ma whirled at the sound
shame on yuh makin fun uh that pore
diseased boy if that aint like a man
cow punchers is the most cold-hearted
humans livin i do believe

  yesm agreed hank shorty if
yuhd crave the use of a brush and comb
ill herd yuh to it

  he led the way into the living room and
to the bed room beyond as he passed the
cupboard his hand slipped behind the cur-
tain and when the two gained the bed room
hank uncorked the bottle of snake bite
cure

  happy days hank

  drink hearty shorty came the reply
soft whispered barely audible above the
ensuing gurgling noise

vi

with shorty left behind to

	excuse his partners absence
i at supper tad despite gnaw-
ing pangs of hunger made no

complaint

  in the graying dusk of twilight he rode
slowly along the dusty trail a solitary
graceful figure as he sat his horse with a
careless ease a cigaret drooping from the
corner of his straight lips not a trace
of weariness was perceptible in spite of the
fact that he had been in the saddle since
dawn he had the appearance of some
cowpuncher bent on a careless mission and
time was a minor factor yet his keen
eyes constantly swept the rolling hills with
a restless gaze always that gaze came
back to focus on the moving speck far
ahead on the trail

  looks like he was headin straight fer
town yaller hammer he said softly to
the twitching dun colored ears of his horse
mebbeso im havin this here ride r
nothin i dunno

  from his chaps pocket he produced a
weatherbeaten square of plug  tobacco
gnawed to a ragged edge at one end he
surveyed it critically wiped it carefully
on the sleeve of his jumper and bit off a
generous piece

  nothin like chawin tuh keep down the
hungry feelins he mused aloud aint
smelt grub since daylight mebbeso wont
sniff none till mornin neither its --
but its honest pony if yuh want tuh figger
it thataway

  darkness slowly gathered and tad and
yellow hammer closed the gap that sep-
arated them from joe kipp tad grinned
his thanks to the full moon that rose ma-
jestically from beyond the skyline

  he rode more alertly now eyes and eats
strained to catch any sign of the man he
followed also he watched the wagging
ears of his horse when those furry points
stiffened pointed forward tad would
halt twice when he thus stopped he
was rewarded by the sounds of a traveling
horse ahead on the trail once kipps
horse had nickered and tads big hands
closed over yellow hammers black muzzle
just in time to prevent an answering nicker
he allowed kipp a bigger lead from that
point on

  the hours dragged tad dared not
paid off



risk lighting a cigaret now the plug of
tobacco was gradually being gnawed to
smaller size then silhouetted against
the skyline showed the lone cottonwood
that marked hank bassets border line
tad could make out the form of a horse-
man halted beneath the wide branches
the waiting man lighted a cigaret and
tad recognized the features of joe kipp

  nodding sagely to himself tad dis-
mounted and led yellow hammer into the
tall greasewood

  hate tuh treat yuh so ornary he
whispered as he slipped a burlap sack
across yellow hammers muzzle and fast-
ened it to the cheek bands of his bridle
but i jest cant have yuh makin no hoss
howdys sabe this aint the fust time
ive cluttered yuh up with one uh these
contraptions so dont act spooky thats
the good hoss i wisht shorty had half
yore sense dang his ornary lil hide i
bet hes in the saddle this minute streakin
it fer the river playin hookey like a
school kid and worryin a man plumb
gant

  with the caution of an indian tad de-
void of spurs and chaps which were hung
to his saddle horn crept through the brush
toward the cottonwood two horses stood
beneath the lone tree now the glowing
ash of two cigarets showed where the dis-
mounted horsemen squatted against the
wide tree trunk

  a clear space separated the tree and the
greasewood patch where tad lay prone on
the ground a space wide enough to pre-
vent him making out the words of the low-
toned conversation only when th voices
momentarily laid stress on some spoken
thought could he make anything of the
murmur the voice of kipp was clearly
recognizable the other speakers voice
was vaguely familiar

  i tell yuh came kipps voice raised
with emotion ive come to the breakin
point ive stood it till i cant stand it no

longer why in-s name cant you and

fox let me quit and pull outa the country
i tell yuh now i cant be crowded no more
ill tell the whole -- miserble story

  like-you will came the sneering

reply low pitched calm distinct youll
play yore string out when we clean up
the basset deal you kin go not till then
we need yore protection

  kipps reply came in a hoarse whisper

indistinguishable to the listener hidden in
the brush

  a coarse jeering laugh came from the
other man in reply a match flared to
light a cigaret and tad recognized the black-
bearded face of the half-breed black jack

 you know - well you wont do no

talkin came the breeds voice with cold
conviction

  wheres fox asked kipp breaking a
brief silence

 somewhere on the lf trail headin
this way and i dont aim that he should
ketch me here neither im draggin it
for the pocket

  black jack got to his feet and took a step
toward his horse then he halted

  goin to stay here all night better
be gettin to town where yuh belong
foxll be along directly and hell wonder
what brung you here pete basset breakin
his stake rope has put the old gent in one

-of a humor and he might treat yuh

rough better hit the grit

  im aimin tuh wait fer fox replied
kipp hoarsely

 dont be a plumb - fool heu

mebbe kill yuh

  reckon not

  its yore funeral im driftin good
luck mind what i say now foxll beat
yuh to it if yuh make ary gun play that
ol--s a snake so-long

  tad listened to the thudding of hoofs as
the breed rode away into the night a few
moments and all was silent as a grave yard

  kipp got to his feet pinching out the
glowing ash of his cigaret he led his
horse to a patch of brush beyond the tree
when he returned the pale rays of the moon
fell on the blued-steel barrel of the win-
chester in the crook of his arm

  tad watching the sheriffs every move
whistled noiselessly he saw kipp settle
down behind a small patch of brush this
shelter hid kipp from the trail but tad
could see him plainly outlined against the
pale sky came the clicking of the sheriffs
carbine lever as he threw a cartridge from
the magazine into the barrel then the
gun raised and tad saw kipp squint along
the barrel

  testin his sights mused tad if
ever a man went through the motions uh
bushwhackin a enemy kipps a-doin it
now he dont noways aim tuh give fox
a chanct


adventure

  tad pondered this decision for some time
his eyes fixed on kipp

 -he muttered inwardly puts

me in one-of a mess fox needs killin

and needs it bad shore does even
shootin him from the brush is mebbeso
whats cornin to him i dunno but that
wont keep kipp from bein a low-down
bushwhackin killer iffen he does the job
looks tuh me like this black jack injun
and fox is shore thowin the hooks to the
ol sheriff plumb scanlous they got him
nigh loco pears tuh me but shore as hes
a foot high kippll hate hissef fer pullin
the trigger afore his gun barrel cools off
yessir bound tuh then whatll he do
hell go to the bad complete boozell
put him in the bog fer keeps either that
er hell turn that gun on hissef and blow his
own head off which wont do nobody
no good ceptin mebbe this black jack
skunk hmm i never cut into no mans
game up till now but im shore declarin
mysef in on this

noiselessly he slipped back
to his horse and swung into the
saddle as yellow hammer
scuffed along the dusty trail at
a running walk tad raised his voice in
song to herald his coming he rightly
guessed that his approach would for a few
moments so startle kipp that the old sheriff
would not have time to beat a retreat until
tad was too close

sam bass was born in indiana it was his native
    home	

  and at the age of seventeen young sam begun
    to roam

  sam fust come to texas a cowboy fer to be

  a kinder hearted feller you seldom ever see

  the words of the old range song came in
full-toned discordant abandon as tad rode
into the clearing

  from the brush kipps horse nickered
and this time tad allowed yellow hammer
to give answer

 whoa geldin mumbled tad loud
enough for kipp to hear looks like we
got company halloo pardner come out
sos we kin read yore brand

  a second of silence then kipp stepped
into sight the sheriffs bushy white brows
bristled in a frown of annoyance yet
tad was certain that the old fellow looked
relieved he eyed tad with suspicion
hes wonderin if im suspectin him

was tads inward comment aloud he
said with hearty pleasantness

  howdy sheriff yuh git bucked off er
was yuh ketchin some shut-eye

  dozin a spell lied kipp what brings
you out this time uh night on this trail
tad had not expected this question but
his ready wit came to his rescue

  miz basset lowed shed acted plumb
ornary towards yuh and lowed that hank
should ride after yuh and bring yuh back
i knowed hank was tuckered out and a-
feelin a heap upset about pete so i took
the job off his hands they want that i
should bring yuh back

  this last statement came to the nimble-
witted tad as a happy after thought if
the sheriff returned with him fox would
ride his homeward trail without being shot

  no need uh me ridin plumb back there
ladd i done told her and hank i didnt
bear no hard feelins i got business in
alder gulch that should be tended to

   twont do kipp i give my word
that i wouldnt come back till i brung you
along dont make me go follerin yuh
around fer a week er so

  tads tone was that of light banter yet
there lay an undercurrent of determina-
tion that did not escape the sheriff

  all right if theres no other way to it
lets git goin

  he led his horse from the brush and
mounted together they headed back
for the basset ranch

  for some time they rode in silence
tad from the shadow of his wide-brimmed
hat studied the sheriffs features kipp
was staring fixedly at his saddle horn deep
in brooding thought the reaction was
setting in now and he was shaking like a
man with palsy then this passed and the
old sheriffs shoulders straightened

  ladd he said abruptly you dont
know it but yuh saved my life tonight i
wisht i could tell yuh about it but i cant
therell come a day when i will though

i come-nigh doin somethin that would

uh made life a livin hell i come nigh bein
a low down ornary coyote im plumb
obliged i hope some day i kin pay yuh
back in full

  - thats all right kipp fergit it

if i heped yuh ary way im right glad tuh
uh done it yuh know there aint none uh
us humans that aint got a ornary streak
hid out somewhere in our innards and
paid off



some time er another that there ornary
streak jest nacherally busts all holts and
comes a-rearin sometimes we kin grab
a tail-holt and jerk er back in time more
often its some other gent that heads off
that ornary streak and herds it back into
our system tuh stay put fer the rest uh our
life i mind the night mine broke out

  tad grinned into the sheriffs eyes
lighted a cigaret and went on the words
coming lazily in his soft southern drawl

  my mammy died when i was little
moren a yearlin leavin me tuh grow up
kinda keerless like my daddy not payin
me much attention when i shows i kin
kinda do my own rustlin hes a cow-
puncher fer the turkey track at the time
and im wranglin hosses fer the spread
when they ships i goes tuh town with the
boys and while theyre a-blowin their coin
fer licker and gamblin and such im
squanderin my ten a month fer sody pop
and sweet truck ive likewise bought
mysef a sore-backed ringboned mexican
mule which i gits from a drunken pisano
fer six-bits and a pint uh rot-gut licker

  my daddy bein a good drinkin man
and jest about slick enough at stud poker
tuh hang and rattle all night afore he loses
his taw to the tin-horns aint much better
off financial as me

  then one fall night in a mex town along
the rio my daddy gits downed in a gun
scrap im sleepin on a poker table at the
time waitin till paw goes broke sos i kin
load him on his hoss and go tuh camp by
the time the smokes cleared away and i gits
full waked up dads a-passin out fast and
callin fer me i sets there on the dobe
floor and wipes the blood off his mouth
while he crosses the big divide a grin on
his face while his eyes goes glassy

  kid says he afore the blood chokes
him it was pedro sanchez the bronc
peeler that done it heres my gun
when the time comes git that greaser

	im some twelve years old then that
night i pads that mule uh mine with gunny
sacks throws my dads saddle on him and
proceeds tuh foller this sanchez gent who
has left town pronto after the killin my
ol rusty chihuahua spur is tied to my bare
foot and the long-barreled  gouges my
ribs and starts wearin the hide off my hip
bone thus burdened as the sayin goes
i hits the trail uh the gent thats downed
my daddy

  tad smiled reminiscently

  yuh found him asked kipp his own
troubles momentarily forgotten

  ten years later i finds him he dealin
faro bank in juarez and alongside him on
the table lays a white-handled six-gun with
five notches filed on the handle plain and
insultin like sanchez havin got off to a
good start has done turned out tuh be a
killer sabe

  up to now i bin as peaceful a kid
as ever follered a long-horned steer ive
done got outa the notion almost uh shootin
up this greaser ive done met up with
fellers as the years passes and i gits rings
around my horns that tells me as how paw
was ornary mean when hes lickered and
the sanchez gent has done no more than
right when hes kills him off im beginnin
tuh think that mebbeso im not bound and
beholdin tuh down this sanchez after all
rights right and wrongs no man thinks i
and if paw had it cornin he done got it
and jack-pots played and won so yuh
see i aint noways huntin no trouble ner
makin no play tuh hunt down this greaser
feller it jest pops up sudden

  there i stands a awkward long-legged
high-withered ol kid and im lookin into
the wickedest pair uh snake eyes that i
ever seen his lips is kinda smilin but
the smile dont go higher than his black
mustache which is twisted to sharp points
sudden like i recollects a-holdin of my
daddys head and wipin that sickish lookin
pink froth from his mouth sos he kin
talk somehow my gun has got into my
hand and im coverin this snake-eyed
killer

   i come tuh kill yuh sanchez i says
and my voice sounds weak and uncon-
vincin as-

   so says sanchez laughin short and
nasty like id sprung a josh on him i
wish yuh luck sonny and with that he
goes right on dealin like hes clean fergot
im there

  if hed a knocked the gun outa my hand
er slapped me alongside the jaw i could uh
waded in and done battle but hes
treatin me like i was a yearlin kid a-packin
of a pea gun i feels my face go hot like i
was settin over a fire my hands is cold
as ice and biggern snowshoes the barrel
uh my gun is rattlin on the edge uh the
table im that shaky wust of all a kinda
blurry look looms up in my eyes and i know


adventure

its tears man it was jest nacherally-

  the crowd snickers and grins a mex
vaqnero makes a funny crack and his friends
giggles sanchez holdin his head kinda
sideways tuh keep the smoke uh his cigaret
outa his eyes goes on dealin without look-
in up payin bets and rakin in chips uh
them that loses

  somehow i makes it across to the door
dizzy and all sickish inside me like a kid
thats swallered a chaw uh terbaccer it
aint till i gits out into the dark and sets
down on a empty beer keg that i finds that
im still holdin my gun in my hand

  fust off i starts tuh thow that-gun

as fur as i kin sling it then i gits a idee
im goin tuh lay out there in the dark till
this sanchez comes out then ill down
him i ketches mysef talkin out loud like
a loco sheep herder and tears is runnin like
cricks down inside my shirt collar

  i wipes off the tears blows my nose and
takes a chaw uh fine-cut tuh make me feel
more like a man then squattin in the
shadow near the door i cocks my gun and
waits fer sanchez tuh come out fer his mid-
night lunch which i knows most dealers does

  sudden like theres a noise behind me
i swings around startled sorter

   fer gosh sake put up that cannon yuh
got stuck in my belly says a good texican
american voice that dont sound none too
old she might go off bein cocked that-
away ease er tuh half-cock and shove er
back in yore jeans men yous gonna have
a medicine talk slim

  i dunno yet why i done it but i does as
he says without a whimper he leads me
into a saloon down the street and orders
two sody pops i gits a good look at him
in the light

  hes a kinda runty built kid with a face
thats plenty sprinkled with freckles like
some cow has coughed bran in his face
he aint much tuh look at till he grins then
hes right easy tuh stand hes got one uh
these grins that makes yuh grin right back
afore yuh know it his left eye is black
and swole up and his lower lip is split bad
hes about twenty and a cowpuncher

   my last two bits he lows as he pays
fer the sody pop i bet thats two bits
more than you got long boy

  i admits the charge and he nods happy
like

   then we starts even feller down
yore pizen and loan me the use of a fresh

chaw then im gonna take yuh back and
watch yuh pull that sanchez gents fangs

   yuh seen him bluff me down i asks
plumb ashamed

   yeah i seen it and i follered yuh
outside i seen yuh while yuh made up
yore mind tuh shoot him from the dark

   how come yuh know i was layin fer
him says i

   you was talkin to yoresef about it
pardner all set then rattle yore hocks
and well git goin they thowed me outa
that wigwam last evenin after the poker
dealer had robbed me uh two months pay
mebbeso its because im cooled off er
mebby its because this short-legged boy is
so danged sure that i kin turn the trick
anyhow when i goes back into that gam-
blin house im steady as a work ox

   whup him a plenty slim whispers my
new pardner as we steps inside im
standin at yore back till yore belly caves in
ill keep the gang off yuh whup him with
yore hands

  which i does sanchez goes fer his gun
there on the table when he sees me cornin
but hes slow and my bullet tears that fancy
cannon loose from under his hand without
hurtin him though it plumb ruins that
white handle with the notches he un-
limbers a knife as i clears the table but i
weans him away from it pronto when my
gun barrel ketches him across the wrist
then i hands my smoke pole to my new
pardner and proceeds tuh work mister
snake eyes over with my hands

  tad paused to light his cigaret kipp
was again staring at his saddle horn

  that fight wins me two things that
night one was shorty carroway the
gamest pardner a man ever had the
other was what book-learnt folks calls sef-
respect only fer shorty id uh killed that
sanchez from the dark that night and lost
my right tuh call mysef a man

  kipp shot tad a covert glance laden with
suspicion did the cow puncher suspect
him of lying in wait for fox but tads
homely features were guileless they rode
on in silence

in telling this story tad
felt that he was accomplishing
two purposes he was perhaps
giving the nerve-racked sheriff a
new grip on his ebbing courage and self-
control likewise he was explaining to his
paid off



own conscience his reason for breaking one
of the unwritten laws of the cow country
the law that says a man shall tend to his
own affairs and leave the affairs of his fel-
low men strictly alone

  kipp busied himself with a sack of to-
bacco and brown papers in the gray light
of dawn tad watched the gnarled fingers
of the sheriff pouring the flaky tobacco into
the paper those fingers were steady now

  nigh sunup and yonders the ranch
im gant as a coyote grinned the cow
puncher

  kinda feel thataway myself pardner
smiled kipp dont know when ive felt
as hungry

vii

a surprize consternation and
a trace of suspicion were written
on ma bassets face when she
greeted tad and kipp at the gate

  theres-theres nothing wrong sher-
iff she cried her work-reddened hands
gripping the gate pole

  figgered you and kipp ud want tuh
talk over this here pete business so i done
brung him back tad explained easily
wondering why ma basset looked at him so
sharply

 fresh in ma bassets memory was
shortys fabrication regarding his partners
absence at supper the night before and she
was searching the big punchers rugged
features for traces of his debauch

  tads eyes flitted to the log barn fifty feet
away he smiled faintly as he saw six
inches of blued rifle barrel protruding be-
tween the chinks of the logs the gun was
covering kipp who had not seen it

any sign of pete asked ma nervously

  not nary maam returned kipp
id like fer tuh powwow some with hank
regardin him and them cattle beginnin
this mornin miz basset im turnin this
here sheriff star over tuh hank then im
makin a trip into the bad-lands iffen i
comes out with them lost cattle ill be
askin fer the badge iffen i dont bring
them cattle out i wont be needin it no
more nohow as fer pete i aint a-huntin
the boy ner would i lay a haiid on him was
i tuh run acrost him until i come back
from the pocket im a plain every-day
citizen

  tad and ma gazed at the old officer in
startled surprize tad was smiling oddly

the rifle barrel slid out of sight in the barn
and hank basset holding the gun in the

crook of his arm stepped into sight

  howdy joe i done heered yuh whats
the idee in actin thataway

  kipp grinned

  a feller done told me a story last night
hank i dont reckon he meant tuh but he
sorter showed me which trail tuh take be-
ginnin here i want that you should keep
this here badge fer me fer a spell after
breakfast ill be askin the loan of a fresh
hoss

  land sakes gasped ma reminded of
her duty to those who ride within ones
gate light and come to the house
theres flapjacks and steak thats spilin
to be et

  hank gazed thoughtfully for a moment at
kipps badge now lying in the palm of his
hand then he pocketed the star and
reached for the bridle reins of the two
horses

  foller ma to the house joe tad will
yuh lend me a hand fer a minute er so here
at the barn

  kipp and his wife out of sight hank led
tad to the barn with an air of one who has
news to impart

  wheres shorty asked tad

  gone came the cryptic reply he
done left a message fer yuh he said tuh
tell yuh that you was a long-geared psalm-
singin ol sand-hill crane and that hed
learn yuh to leave him tuh tell yore lies fer
yuh likewise that he was free white and
past votin age and that he could take keer
uh hissef in ary tight thems his exact
words

  then the danged lil banty rooster is up
tuh suthin what hoss did he ride

 petes water dog pony he-

  i knowed it i knowed it groaned
tad i seen it in his eye drat his pesky
speckled hide i should uh tied him up
afore i left ever since you said no man
could swim that river i seen that ornary
contrary mule-minded lil varmint a-mill-
in over a idee in his head all yuh gotta do
is tell that lil ol son of a gun that no hu-
man kin do somethin and he dont sleep
easy ner swaller his grub right till he makes
yuh out a liar i knowed it and when i
pulled out last evenin i was plumb skeered
hed do somethin like that if hes killed
hank im tuh blame how long has he
bin gone


adventure

  they pulled out two hours afore day-
light came the reluctant answer

  they

  pete went with him

  pete tads lips pursed in a silent
whistle tell me about it hank he
finished grimly

  the boy showed up afore midnight
seems like hed got word somehow while
he was at deer lodge that fox was cleanin
me out thats why he run away he
made me and ma tell him the hull thing
how the cattle had bin run off and how fox
is aimin tuh jerk the rope tight next week
when that note falls due then he takes
my gun and lows hes startin then and
there fer town hes goin tuh kill fox like
hed kill a mad dog and mas tears ner my
arguments dont stop him

   hold on a minute pete calls a voice
from the door there stands shorty grin-
nin pleasant like tut up that gun and
listen fer a spell while we talks sense kill-
in fox wont git yuh nothin but a hangin
bee but you and me barrin accidents
and good shootin on the part uh the lf
polecats kin git them cattle back say
we throws our hulls on yore top-water
hosses swims that crick and kinda give
them gents a suprize party 

  hanks hands went out in a jesture of
helplessness tad nodded understandingly

  shortys jest plumb fool enough tuh win
out too he mused aloud

  pete lowed that the swimmin was a
cinch admitted hank but then meb-
beso he was jest lyin tuh make me and ma
feel easy say whats come over joe
kipp he acts plumb queer yuh dont
reckon the ol fellers losin his mind do
yuh

  noooo dont know as id go so fur as
tuh say kipp was gittin weedy fact is
i think hes jest kinda pullin hissef to-
gether yeah supposin we eases our-
selves over to the house hank my bellys
so empty that the chaw uh terbaccer i
swallered tuh keep from goin tuh sleep is
rattlin around in my stummick like a bronc
in a corral

  on the way to the cabin hank told tad
how shorty had excused his partners
absence

  the wust of it is tad she believes it
said i was a kinderd spirit and a whisky
soak when i tries tuh explain that shorty
was jest funnin i thought fer a minute

that she was goin tuh haze me into the
blacksmith shop again dang it

  hank grinned twistedly

  ill wring that danged lil roosters neck
when i ketches him grinned tad

  he lowed he was breakin even fer that
windy yuh told ma about a hoss throwin
him and givin him the black eye

  during breakfast tad caught ma bas-
sets gaze fixed on him and he felt his ears
growing red no doubt the woman thought
that bringing kipp back with him was some
sort of drunken whim moreover kipps
odd behavior did much to convince ma that
the sheriff was also under the influence of
liquor tad breathed a sigh of relief when
they were safely back at the corral and kipp
had caught a fresh horse

  id like tuh go along joe said hank
thems my cattle yuh know and its no
moren right that i should be goin

  its a one-man job hank therell
like as not be some powder burnt yuh
dont want tuh leave no widder behind yuh
in case i dont come back heres the com-
bination to my safe

  he handed hank a slip of paper on which
were some penciled figures

  in the safe is a sealed envelope addressed
to you it has some papers which will be uh
use to yuh but it aint tuh be opened till
im dead savvy

  hank nodded then looked at tad
reckon id best tell joe about pete
tad pondered this a moment then
might as well cant do no harm
hank

  petes aimin tuh swim the river from
yon side uh the narrers and come into the
pocket joe

  - kipps eyes filled with pain

hell never make it hank even if he
crosses theres a man watching the trail
from the river hell be killed shore
then i reckon ill be goin along with
yuh kipp said tad shorty went with

pete if shorty gits killed all-cant

stop me till i downs every last man thats
mixed up in this all of them sabe
tads eyes had gone hard as ice the
good-natured expression had given way to
hard grim fines

  i reckon said kipp slowly meeting
tads gaze without flinching that i sale
ladd that bein the case i want that
you should come along with me

  they saddled in silence tadd slipped a
paid off



winchester into the saddle scabbard and
emptied a box of - shells into his
pocket

  i told fox id meet him at the lone cot-
tonwood to deliver those cattle hank
said tad with a grimness that gave the
statement the tone of a threat thatll
be sunday noon i reckon youll be there
so-long till then

  remember the paper in the safe kipp
reminded hank itll explain a heap that
i reckon yore a big enough man tuh under-
stand hank

  without another word tad and kipp
rode away leaving hank standing in the
gateway scratching his head in a puzzled
manner

  hank basset called ma from the door-
way some time later whatever in the
world are yuh standin there in the road
fer a person ud think youd jest said
good-by to yore last friend a standin
around like a hoot owl with yore hat in yore
hand gawkin

  last friend muttered hank as he
turned to the house i dont know but
what she done guessed it right the hull
danged business has got beyond me dad
gum it

  if you bin hittin that bottle warned
ma her voice firm with determination
youll put in the rest of the week at the
blacksmith shop ill have no drunken
rowdies set foot over my door sill

  ten feet from the cabin hank halted
he saw ma basset holding the bottle of
snake-bite medicine to the light mem-
ory of shortys healthy-sized drinks came to
hanks mind

  a good three inches below my last
mark he heard his wife mutter i sus-
pected as much

  with a groan hank turned and with
dragging steps entered the blacksmith shop

  beat her to it that time he muttered
seating himself on a keg of horse shoes and
biting off a corner of plug tobacco

viii

as well marked as a prize-
winnin white-face and as quick
actin as a top-cuttin hoss was
shorty carroways mental sum-
ming up of young pete basset hed orter
act plumb purty in a scrap be it six-gun
er knock down and drag out

  nor was shorty far from being wrong in
his estimation of his companion straight-
featured clean-limbed his clear eyes honest
and alight with the fire of unspoiled youth
the son of hank basset sat his horse with a
careless grace that marked him a born
horseman even college had left him un-
spoiled by the flattery and idolatry that is
the unmaking of many a crack athlete

  i dont much like the idea of you getting
mixed up in this mess carroway he said
in a troubled tone its really not your
scrap you know and theres going to be
some nasty battling before its over it
sure is white of you and darn few men
would do what youre doing now even
friends of long standing hang it all were
little more than strangers to you and its
not fair to-

  fergit it pete grinned shorty redden-
ing strangers i reckon not theres
some folks that ive knowed since i was
hock high to a cotton-tail rabbit thats
more strangers tuh me than yore paw and
mammy they done took me and my tad
pardner into the house like we was kin
folks dang it i aint et such grub since i
was a yearlin

  anyhow my reasons fer takin chips in
this here game is sorter vary and sundry as
the feller says tads bin abusin me
scanlous and i aim tuh git even thats
one reason then this here fox hombre is
nacherally goin tuh rear up and fall over
backward on hissef when we brings out this
herd thirdly and mostly im spilin tuh
lay hands on this here gent which goes by
the handle uh black jack thereby com-
pletin a job uh manhandlin which i was
forced tuh quit sudden like onct at the lf
wagon

  again im honin fer tuh show yore
daddy that theres one human besides his
son which kin bust that missouri wide open
all uh which amigo downs ary argument
on yore part aint it about time we was
gittin to that place acrost from the nar-
rers we bin ridin right along since we
crossed on the ferry and shes nigh dark

  were about opposite the upper end now
shorty see that high-cut bank below the
first little bend thats her that lighter
brown strip is their trail where they water
the stock were a smile above rough
figuring that means well drift to that
trail nicely starting here well angle it as
much as we can currents swift and the


adventure

channel lays full against the cut back on the
other side	

  see that sharp pinnacle well thats
the point well head for itll show plain
against the sky when the moon rises bar-
ring undercurrents and snags we stand a
fighting chance of hitting it if we dont
its thumbs down for us that cliff is ten
miles to the lower end and not six inches
toe-hold in the ten miles i wish you
wouldnt tackle it pardner

  shorty shook his head and following
petes actions dismounted and unsaddled
hobbles were adjusted and the two partook
of a meager repast of jerky and canned
tomatoes brush screened them from the
opposite bank as they squatted beneath a
big cottonwood and waited for darkness and
a rising moon

  already the approaching danger was fast
cementing a strong friendship between these
two as men will do on such occasions
they exchanged confidences swapped stories
and lighted their cigarets from the same
match

  petes quick movements and the dancing
light in his gray eyes betrayed the nervous
tension within shorty showed not a trace
of whatever emotion lay behind his soft-
spoken banter though a scant ten years
older than his companion shorty had been
well tutored in the school of hard knocks
like his partner tad he was an orphan
range-reared and self reliant the only
living thing that he was afraid of was a
woman the more beautiful the more fear
she instilled in the heart of the little cow-
puncher danger merely quickened his
pulse as strong drink affects a man unused
to it yet he masked his feelings as ef-
fectively as the seasoned gambler hides four
aces it was as if risking his life was an
everyday occurrence all in a days work

  twilight deepened into night and a white
moon pushed itself over the ragged skyline
a horned owl hoo-hooed in the cottonwoods
the timid white-tail deer bedded down in
their red willow thicket back in the
brakes a wolf gave voice to a long-drawn
howl a ripple showed on the smooth sur-
face of the water as a muskrat swam from
its hole in the clay bank plunk a beaver
tail slapped the water with such abrupt-
ness that shortys hand dropped to his gun

  i reckon we might as well tackle it said
pete quietly getting to his feet

  they saddled in silence with great care

cinches were left loose hackamores took
the place of bridles boots and chaps were
foiled in a neat bundle and tied to the backs
of the saddles shorty bit off a large chew
of plug and swung into the saddle

  theres no way of keeping you from
coming along shorty

  not nary pete i done hired out fer a
tough hand and i plays my string out
chaw

  he held out the gnawed plug

  thanks but i never chaw pardner
then dont never learn i gotta own up
though that theres nothin quite so plumb
downright soothin as a man-size hunk uh
plug at a time like this its as intoxi-
catin as a shot uh tea is to a ol maid school-
marm take the lead pard im follerin
dost behind the sooner yuh starts the
better these dad-gummed mosquiters is
shore a-eatin off me fierce

  pete in the lead rode out on a sand bar
and his horse waded out into the stream
the swift-flowing water swirled and eddied
about the animals legs

  that high peak yonder shorty he
called softly as his horse hit swimming water
right yuh are peter

  no further word was spoken shorty
set his jaws as the swift current swept his
horse downstream easily he slipped from
the saddle and with a hand holding to his
horses mane swam alongside the water
was cool enough to freshen his tired nerves
he grinned to himself and jerked his hat
down on his head with his free hand ahead
of him he could see pete and hig horse
both horses swam high in the water

  suddenly like a bobbing cork pulled by a
string pete and his mount were sucked be-
neath the surface

  undercurrent muttered shorty as he
filled his lungs with a deep breath of air

then he and his horse went under as if
drawn by an invisible hand in reality but
a moment yet it seemed an hour to the cow-
puncher and they again came to the top
all right called a voice from ahead
settin purty he called back

  the horses were blowing softly with a
rattling noise unexcited swimming stout-
ly they battled against the current shorty
splashed water against the side of his horses
head to guide the animal a point down-
stream once more he was heading straight
for the sharp point that loomed black
against the sky
paid off



  a dark misshapen object bobbed up
ahead it was a big tree half submerged
floating down-stream with swift sure
movements shorty swung his swimming
horse to face straight up-stream against
the current

  easy now ol hoss he murmured sooth-
ingly jest kinda mark time fer a minute
till yon snag drifts on to st louis thats
the idee now shes gone

  and they were under way once more
ahead pete was watching for snags and had
worked his way back until he now clung to
his horses tail behind him shorty was
doing the same a scant hundred feet
ahead the black shadow of the bank rose
ominously pete scanned the unbroken
shadow for a trace of the trail

  momentary panic clutched pete where
the trail should be only a perpendicular
wall showed either he was above or below
the trail that meant escape from the treach-
erous river then the panic passed giving
way to dogged unyielding determination
he dared not call out to his companion for
fear of being overheard by the men they
sought he swung his horse to breast the
current and waited for the coming of shorty

  a moment and the little puncher was
alongside careful to keep his distance lest
the horses paw each other the animals
were breathing hard now it had been a
desperately hard swim how long their
strength and courage would hold out was a
problem that might easily mean death to
men and beasts

  missed er whispered pete hoarsely
we got to chance it down-stream t
reckon

  swimming squarely against the current
their horses had been losing ground slowly
shorty nodded and gripping his floating
saddle strings pulled himself alongside the
neck of his horse he deftly slipped free
his rope strap and flipped the end of his
lariat to pete pete caught it and with a
nod slipped the end under his armpits and
knotted it shorty passed his loop over
his head and under his arms then drew it
tight now if one of them should find
footing along that treacherous bank he
could save his companion on the other
hand if one of them went under the other
would meet the same fate

  both or neither explained shorty in a
grim whisper then swung his horse down-
stream here goes nothin

  two pairs off bloodshot straining eyes
swept the bank that slipped past so swiftly
shorty now was in the lead pete ten feet
behind the slack of the rope coiled in his
hand to keep from tangling both men
were taking it with deadly calm as they
fought their battle against the death that
lurked in the muddy swirling water

  suddenly shortys horse ceased swim-
ming the animals legs were swept down-
stream and he floated

  gone belly-up pete shorty grunted

  look out called pete in a hoarse whis-
per as his horse lunged forward in the
water in an effort to climb on top of the
floating horse

  now indeed the situation was critical
shorty ducked beneath the striking forefeet
of petes horse and with every ounce of his
strength jerked at his hackamore rope
pete did likewise the melee of struggling
horses and men drifted apart to the left
a narrow ribbon of light cut the dark wall of
the bank

  the trail thank - muttered pete

and with a jerk that seemed to tear the
ligaments in his arm wrenched at the hack-
amore rope an agonizing moment then
his horse lunged shoreward and found
footing

  the weight of shortys horse swim-
ming once more hindered the puncher
greatly as he fought the current his eyes
fixed on that strip of light that meant
safety loath to let loose his horse he
fought off the temptation to turn the ani-
mal loose the horse was becoming pan-
icky now snorting and lunging pawing at
the man ahead of him in the water flinty
steel-shod hoofs broke the water a scant
two feet behind shortys head

  pete in the saddle now dallied the slack
rope around his saddle horn his stock-
inged heels pressed the heaving sides of his
tired horse

  back in the water shorty felt the rope be-
neath his arms go tight both his hands
grasped the hackamore rope of his strug-
gling horse the noose beneath his arms
tightened till it seemed to be cutting him in
two he clamped his jaws and gripped the
hackamore rope his arms seemed to be
stretching until they loosened in the sockets
seconds seemed eternity then he felt
himself being dragged along the clay bank
of the trail that led upward he dimly
saw his horse flounder ashore and stand with


adventure

wide-spread legs and lowered head on the
bank with a grunt of utter relief he let go
the hackamore rope

      stick em up bawled a
      hoarse voice from above

          a spurt of flame and the roar
 of a gun then petes voice
trembling a bit

  got him shorty are you all right

  a violent choking gasping sound from
shorty and pete gun in hand cast off the
rope and leaping to the ground slid down
the trail to his companions side

  good gosh man whats wrong he
whispered loosening the rope and peering
into shortys writhing features

  shorty scrambled to his feet reaching
for his gun

  my chaw swallered er lets go
he gasped and lunged forward to throw
himself upon a dark blot that moved along
the bank

  the dull thud of a gun barrel sounded as
it struck something

  your shot jest winged him pete hes
out fer a spell now gimme the rope and
well hog-tie him then lets git outa
here

  yore covered-yuh called a hid-
den voice plug em if they make a move
bill stick them-hands in the air

  two rapid shots cut the darkness and
shorty felt the air of a lead slug pass his
cheek

  whupped he grunted and raised his
hands ive laid down my hand feller
he called foller suit pete they got us
foul

      ix

a killer is with mighty few
exceptions a killer because of his
own desires black jack fore-
man for the lf was no exception
he did not even secretly or openly offer the
plea that he was a victim of circumstance
he had killed men he would kill more
men his past was a sealed book his
future a gamble and thus he met each day
as it came making no prayer he branded
as weak any man who believed in a god
a half-breed and the blend was dangerously
bad for he had inherited the baser traits of
both races

  now as he looked along the barrel of his
winchester to find pete basset at the end of

it his white teeth flashed in a smile that was
unpleasant to see the bushy black beard
hid the cruel lines about his mouth but the
narrow slits of black that were his eyes
glittered as the moonlight struck them a
brown finger pressed the trigger then
paused uncertainly

  the taint in his mixed blood thrown back
to some breech-clouted ancestor now stayed
his hand he hated pete basset and a bul-
let between the boys eyes would be too
mercifully quick an end his trigger finger
eased off

   pete basset shocked and not a little dis-
appointed at shortys easy surrender hesi-
tated uncertainly gun lowered making no
move to raise his hands nor return the fire
he realized with a sickening feeling in the
pit of his stomach that black jack and his
men were well hidden and on higher ground
that prevented a rush he and shorty on
the other hand stood in plain view re-
sistance meant death shorty had shown-
judgment not a yellow streak he dropped
his gun and raised his hands

   shorty the lariat still in his hands ele-
vated his arms skyward and grinned weak-
ly the soft drip-drip of water from their
soaked clothes on to the hard clay was the
only sound that broke the quiet of the night

  behind the willow clump black jack lay
aside his winchester and drew his  

   the little un brung a rope bill he an-
nounced in a jeering tone as he stepped into
the open mebbeso itll come in right
handy to string em up ketch ropes is
scarce and hangin a man spoils a rope fer
use bad luck to use one thats snaked a

man tuh-

  followed by another man he stepped
carefully down the incline

  howdy black whiskers said shorty
glibly when yuh go through my pockets
after youve made a corpse outa me yuhll
find four bits in my off flank pocket buy
yoresef a shave with it

  holding his gun in careless readiness
black jack stepped closer still on the in-
cline shorty noticed that the single action
gun was not cocked but that the breeds
thumb was on the hammer

  if yuh got ary more comical sayins in
yore system he sneered git shet of em i
understand as how hangin kinda interferes
with a mans voice bill tie basset up

ill	tend to this mouthy one

  black jacks hand slipped hipward and
paid off

i

produced a pair of steel handcuffs he
was clear of the incline now and on a level
with shorty standing but a couple of feet
distant	

  jest lay aside yore hangin rope little
man and hold yore lily white paws out fer
a nice pair uh bracelets

  shortys right hand flicked forward from
the wrist with a deft swift movement the
round noose shot out settled and tightened
with such abruptness that black jack was
caught off his guard shorty hurled him-
self backward jerking the breed from his
feet the   exploded harmlessly

  pete threw himself forward as bill shot
the youths hand clutched the gun on the
ground and rolliftg over with a catlike twist
he fired at the shadowy form that came
through the air at him like a mountain
lion springing on its prey his shot missed
bill by inches and their bodies met in a
thudding crash to writhe and twist in
locked embrace

  shortys wet socks slipped on the water-
soaked clay bank as he jerked the rope
black jack the shining handcuffs iiow a
nasty weapon was upon him the steel
manacles crashing full into shortys face a
grunt of pain and the little punchers hand
gripped the black whiskers and jerked his
other fist swung at the mans jaw

  again and again the steel cuffs clinked
and clashed against the cowpunchers face
they came away each time speckled with
blood shorty on his back underneath
the breed pulled the harder on the black
whiskers and his free arm went around the
sinewy brown neck muscles flexed and
tightened like a steel-jawed trap and the
blows from the handcuffs became less ef-
fective as shorty slowly pulled the breed
down to him

  then with a writhing twisting movement
used by professional wrestlers the little
puncher slid from under the others bulk
still holding the black head in the crook of
his arm a short arm jab vicious and
effective caught black jacks jaw bring-
ing a grunt of pain from the breed

  from the shelter of the high bank moved
the man whom shorty had knocked out
with his gun the man was crawling
toward shorty and black jack his eyes on
shortys gun that lay close by his hand
closed over the weapon and he sprang
forward his right arm dangling awkwardly
at his side the gun in his left hand

  shorty saw him and with a terrific effort
rolled over dragging the striking snarling
half-breed with him the wounded man
cursing methodically to fight off pain and
dizziness stumbled forward and flung him-
self on top the two his gun thudded
against shortys head once twice three
times shortys grip on the black-bearded
head relaxed and he went limp his bleeding
mangled features ghastly in the light of the
white moon

  pete and bill panting and fighting like
wild beasts fought without rules nor
thought of fair tactics not a word passed
their clamped jaws as they rolled to the
waters edge and under the feet of shortys
horse

  the horse frightened lashed out at the
struggling forms a shod hoof struck bill
in the ribs and with a groan he relaxed his
grip rolling free of the horses flying
hoofs pete staggered to his feet aiming a
kick at bills face the stocking-clad heel
caught bill on the cheek with a last
effort the outlaw clutched petes leg and
wrapped his arms about it jerking pete off
balance and bringing him to the ground

  black jack his breath coming in sobbing
gasps had regained his feet he saw pete
lurch to a sitting posture

  here called the wounded man and
thrust the  into black jacks hand
finish the-

  the half-breed jumped forward the
next instant the gun barrel crashed against
petes head and the fight was over

wwm ladd said joe kipp break-
ing a long silence that followed
rck their departure from the basset
l-ixljli ranch how long was you at the
lone cottonwood afore yuh let me see
yuh

  mebbeso half an hour kipp i laid in
the brush watchin yuh

  figgered yuh must a bin cold-trailin
me er youd uh ketched up with me long
afore yuh did id kinda like tuh know
jest how yuh figger me out

  thats a hard question pardner dang
me if i kin read yore hand even when ive
had a look at yore hole card the sign all
says that yore playin a double game
yet id shore hate tuh think it

im obliged ladd i hope tuh clear


adventure

some things up afore many hours sup-
posin i tell yuh that by cornin along with
me now yore hinderin instead uh helpin
things

  twouldnt keep me from cornin kipp
not when my shorty pardner is mixed up in
the deal i aim tuh see it through regard-
less

  tads tone and the look in his eyes for-
bade further argument

  you heerd me and black jack talkin
only some when yuh raised yore voices
i heered enough tuh sabe that you was aim-
in tuh lay fer fox that was about all
you got reason tuh want fox killed
yet yuh kept me from doin it why
because like i said i knowed you
want that sort uh man and it wouldnt hep
none tuh kill fox from the brush i reckon
yore goin tuh clear up things if yuh kin
and ill lend a hand if the play comes up
i hope yuh come out winners kipp

yet yuh wont trust me tuh go alone
not when shortys needin me no
again an uncomfortable silence fell over
them unbroken till they reached the edge
of the bad-lands

  therell be a man on guard farther
along this trail said kipp if i ride up
alone hell let me pass if you come along
therell be shootin and well lose a horse
apiece and go back afoot will yuh trust
me to go that far by myself ill signal yuh
from that bald knoll when ive cleared the
trail

  tad pondered this for a long moment as
he searched kipps eyes apparently satis-
fied with what he read in the older mans
face he nodded briefly

  ill wait half an hour kipp then ill
be cornin regardless uh ary signal them
that tries tuh stop me will find they got a
game

  kipp nodded and leaving tad squatted
on the ground rolling a cigaret rode on

  tad consulted a battered silver-cased
watch and shoved it back in his overall
pocket a squint at the sun told him that
dusk was but an hour distant smoke curl-
ing lazily from his nostrils he watched kipp
out of sight

  despite kipps apparent duplicity tad
liked the white-haired old man and felt cer-
tain that he was not being tricked there
had been an indefinable something in the
sheriffs eyes that puzzled tad he felt
certain that whatever hold fox and black

jack had on kipp it must be a terrible one
he knew that kipps momentary lapse of
physical courage was a minor point there
was something far greater than any fear of
physical pain that threatened the sheriff
now kipp was about to break that hold
what would be the outcome

  thusi pondering tad saw kipp ride to
the bare knoll and signal with his hat tad
was on his feet and in the saddle before the
hat quit waving across tads saddle pom-
mel lay his winchester a shell in the bar-
rel the hammer at half-cock

  kipp met him smiling thinly

  wheres the guard asked tad
gagged and hog-tied in the brush yon-
der he quit easy when i threw down on
him were safe now till we hit the river
bottom they only had one man on guard
today they bin brandin so the gent told
me well take our time now darkll
come on quick here in the canons and well
slip into the pocket afore they spot us
how many men down there

  hard tuh tell mebbe three-four meb-
be so a dozen they drift in and out if
they bin brandin like as not therell be
half a dozen

  kipp led the way along the narrow trail
that now led along the side of the shale
cliff tad understood now why it required
but one man to guard the trail a single
man could by hiding behind the rimrock
above drop as many men as he had car-
tridges in his gun if kipp were bent on
tricking him now was his chance

  tad felt a shiver pass along his spine
and glanced unesaily about him then he
shifted his gun to cover kipp grimly de-
termined to shoot if treachery showed in
the shape any movement near the rimrock

  kipp turning in his saddle to address
some remark saw tads gun covering him
the faint smile on the old officers lips could
not hide the pain of humiliation in his eyes
tad grinned uneasily but did not shift the
position of his gun

  the sheriff faced forward once more the
remark he had been about to make un-
spoken in the fading light tad gazed
at the tufts of snow-hued hair beneath
the battered hat the shoulders beneath
kipps faded jumper sagged as if beneath
the weight of some great load

  - muttered tad and shifted his

winchester so that the weapon rested across
his saddle muzzle toward the cliff
paid off



  ill borry the use of a chaw if yuh got
ary handy he called

  in the pocket of his chaps was a plug but
he somehow felt ashamed of mistrusting
kipp and wanted the old fellow to know
that he was no longer covered

  kipp tossed him a piece of tobacco no-
ticing the while that tads winchester now
pointed in another direction he grinned
understanding and they rode on down the
steep trail

  dark fell like a black blanket to be fol-
lowed by the pale moonlight from the
river bottom miles below the faint sound
of shots echoed reechoed and died away
leaving a silence charged witha sinister fore-
boding that caused tad ladds eyes to nar-
row dangerously

  cant we make better time down this

- trail kipp he growled i dont

like them shots

  goin faster might mean a fall ladd
the more haste the less speed right now
we cant do them boys much good if we gits
crippled up

  tad boiling with impatience realized
the truth of kipps assertion it seemed
hours before the trail widened and they
found themselves on level ground in the
deep shadow of towering cottonwoods

  the bawling of a cow hunting her calf
the distant crack of brush as a white-tail
buck broke cover the mournful call of a
horned owl then silence

  the corrals is nigh a mile from here
whispered kipp the cabins lays beyond
them a hundred yards it might be wise
fer me tuh go on alone they know that
pete basset broke out and there may be a
man er two scattered along the trail two
of us ud look queer if i was tuh go on
alone id sorter spring ary traps they had
set fer visitors savvy and not git shot
trust me

  them shots we heered kipp i dont
like tuh set here doin nothin while mebbe-
so shortys needin me bad

  if he was needin yuh tuh help out ary
gun scrap thered be more shots if that
shootin was sign of a fight the fights done
fit and won long ago best let me go on
alone iffen i gits in a tight ill shoot and
you kin come a foggin gimme half a hour
then come on keerful

  if kipp was bent on leading him into a
trap thought tad he would have done so
before they quit the narrow trail

  ill chance it sheriff he replied

  kipp nodded briefly and in a moment
was lost to sight along the trail that faded
into the tall trees

  the sheriffs horse made but little noise
as it traveled along the trail minutes
passed and his coming was not challenged
then without warning a sickening crash of
breaking timber under the horse kipp and
his mount dropped out of sight in the thinly
covered pit snorting with fear the horse
went down kipp striving desperately to free
himself from the falling animal the sher-
iffs head struck something solid and he lost
consciousness

  two heavily armed men stepped from a
clump of choke-cherry brush

  im right glad that-deadfall ketched

somethin grinned one of them i shore
sweat a plenty diggin her wonder how
this gent got past the guard

  i ketched sight uh his face as he
dropped in growled the other it was
kipp thats how-come he got down the
trail without bein drilled hope it didnt
bust the hosss leg

  ner kipps neck black jackll raise

-if he gits killed and a stranger gits put

in the sheriff office foxd have a shore
tough time of it if a hard man was put in
kipps place lower the ladder and well
look over the damage

  id give somethin tuh know what they
got on old kipp muttered the other as he
lowered a ladder into the pit

  one of them went down the ladder a
moment later a match sputtered and lit up
the inky blackness of the hole

  kipps knocked out and the hoss is
good as ever he called in guarded tones
better shove down the gangplank so we
kin lead the critter up

a cleated plank runway was
lowered and after some minutes
of work the frightened horse was
led to solid ground kipp still
unconscious and bleeding from a nasty
scalp wound was carried out

  you lead his hoss ill pack him across
my saddle

  thus joe kipp was carried to the lighted
cabin where black jack sat on the edge of
a bunk smoking cigarets and taunting the
two prisoners who were on the dirt floor
bound hand and foot their backs against a
log wall


adventure

  whered yuh git him asked black
jack

  he rode into the pit

  black jack picked up a water bucket and
threw the contents roughly into kipps
face the sheriff groaned and opened his
eyes the breed stooped and plucked the
 from kipps scabbard then resumed his
seat on the bunk behind his half-closed
eyes lay some nervous tension and his
brows knitted in a scowl as he watched kipp
sputter and struggle to a sitting posture on
the floor

  shorty and pete exchanged a quick look
but made no sound both were disheveled
and shortys face was swollen and caked
with dried blood yet his eyes blazed de-
fiantly and about his bruised lips played
a sardonic smile pete erect and defiant
strained cautiously at the ropes that bound
his arms both the prisoners divided their
glances between black jack and kipp

  wheres fox snapped black jack

  he aint dead if thats what yore driv-
in at returned kipp

  black jack seemed relieved at hearing
tliis bit of news

  miss him he sneered er lose yore
guts at the last minute

  neither kipp was gathering his ad-
dled wits how long have i bin knocked
out

  ten minutes rough guessin grinned
one of the men who had taken him from
the pit

  kipp thinking of tad calculated swiftly
fifteen minutes had passed since the two
had parted that meant that in fifteen
minutes more tad would be riding along
that trail into a similar trap perhaps

  got ary more uh them-holes around

here fer a man tuh fall into he growled
feeling gingerly of his head

  black jack laughed harshly

  nope ones a-plenty i reckon how
come yuh never lit no signal fire from the
rimrock like yuh was told to

  fergot

  kipp felt somewhat relieved to learn that
tad would not be trapped as he had been

  fergot eh black jack sneered
mebbe mebbe not looks tuh me like
you was aimin tuh sneak in and take a look
around you bin weakenin fer some time
when i left yuh last night you was doin
some nasty talkin lowed you was
through with me and fox by- ill

see about that afore yore a hour older
ill have yuh messed up so -- tight you
wont never make a peep see them two
skunks settin yonder theyre cashin in
their chips tonight savvy and yore the
gent tuh do the job then yuh kin go back

to hank basset and be - to yuh go

back and tell him how yuh hung his son
and the nosey runt of a would-be gunman
that come in here with him tell basset
that ill learn yuh to lay down on me
the breed was literally shaking with rage
now his ugly lips twisted in a leering
grin

  i aimed tuh shoot them two and dump
em in the river hangin beats that all tuh

- though specially with sheriff kipp

tuh lead their hosses out from under em
and leave em danglin to a cottonwood
limb

  - said kipp hoarsely reading full

well the cruel cunning in black jacks smol-
dering eyes you wont if ary harm
come to them two boys youll hang fer it
ill hang with em afore ill mix up in such
a low-down murder i told yuh id come
to the place where i was quittin i meant
what i said im givin you a chanct that
you dont noways deserve im givin you
twenty-four hours tuh quit the country
aftei that time im goin after yuh and by

- ill put yuh back in the pen where

yuh belong

  black jack calm again sneere insult-
ingly into the face of the sheriff

  i reckon yore drunk yore fegettin
who you are aint yuh

  no said kipp evenly i aint fergit-
tin ive left papers behind me which tell

the whole-story if i dont come back

in twenty-four hours therell be a hundred
men in here to see whats become uh me and
to wipe out as low-down nest uh snakes as
ever lived i never lied tuh you i aint
lyin now im givin you a fighting chanct
tuh make a getaway take it er leave it
you mean yore double-crossin me and
fox said black joe his words falling
slowly

  i mean that im wipin my slate clean
afore i resigns as sheriff wipin it clean
regardless uh what it costs im givin you
a chanct tuh leave me and these two boys
here and git out do yuh take it

  kipps eyes were fixed on a battered
alarm clock the half hour was up tad
would be starting even if he had a gun to
paid off



fire a signal would only be putting black
jack on guard tad would come cau-
tiously fate would decide

  a calculating gleam flashed in the breeds
eyes documentary evidence to a crimi-
nal is a dangerous weapon dead men may
tell no tales but a written statement is as a
voice from beyond the grave

  looks like yuh hold all the winnin
cards this deal he said flatly yuh shore
out-figgered fox when yuh planted them
papers in yore safe tuh cover yore trail i
suppose yore friend hank basset holds the
combination

  it was a shrewd bit of calculating and
black jacks acting was without fault he
was playing for the highest stakes a man
may wager life and freedom never did
a gambler play more shrewdly

  kipp physically and mentally worn to
the breaking point was caught off guard

  yes and hanks the man thatll see
justice done i-

  black jacks ugly laugh caught the sher-
iff up short too late he realized the mis-
take he had made

  bill ordered the breed quickly take
a man and ketch the fastest mounts in the
remuda ride tuh town and bust open that
cracker-box safe bring all the papers
thats in it tell fox tuh play safe fer a
spell tell him that alder gulchll be
needin a new sheriff kipps dead

  bill and another man slipped outside and
closed the door behind them there now
remained but two outlaws besides black
jack one of them was in a corner on a
bunk moaning from the pain of the broken
arm pete basset had given him

  where was tad that was the sole
thought in joe kipps mind now the de-
parture of bill and the other man lessened
the odds

  better hog-tie the blattin old fool
suggested black jack a moment later to the
man who squatted against the closed door
a  in his hand

  lemme roll a smoke first requested
kipp reaching for tobacco hoping to delay
things till tad showed

  the man who had gotten to his feet hesi-
tated

  tie him i said smoke be-

  kipp leaped forward a clubbed gun
caught the old officer across the jaw whirl-
ing him about another blow from the
mans gun while black jack looked on in

scowling approval kipp sank limply to
the floor

  neat work now tie him afore he comes
to ill learn him what happens tuh them
that loses their guts in this game

       xi

half a hour and nary a sign
uh kipp

  tad shoved his watch back in
his overall pocket and swung into
the saddle he mentally berated himself
for letting kipp out of his sight here on
strange ground on a dangerous mission
he had thrown away his only vantage when
he allowed the sheriff to go on alone kipp
had as much as admitted that he had been
playing a crooked game what was to keep
him from adding one more misdeed to those
of the past

  a shot from the brush well aimed and
no one the wiser these lf men were play-
ing a desperate game for big stakes they
would not hesitate to kill a cowpuncher to
gain their ends and avoid detection cap-
ture for them meant life imprisonment
kipp admitted being on friendly terms with
them his every action showed plainly that
this was not the sheriffs first trip into the
pocket

  with these annoying thoughts to bear
him company tad rode on rode with a 
in his hand and his eyes scanning every
blurred shadow beneath the cottonwoods
the big hand that held the gun did not
shake there was not a trace of fear nor
weakening in the keen eyes that swept the
trail ahead he faced his future without
flinching with splendid disregard of the
heavy odds against him

  years before goliad and the alamo had
known such men they came from that
heroic stock that followed moses austin to
the brazos river no braver men ever
lined sights amid spattering bullets than
these texans so as his sires had faced
their enemies so now did this son of texas
ride his trail

  the ears of his horse twitched forward
the animal halted and tad was on the
ground crouched in the animals shadow
ahead in the trail gaped the pit that had
trapped kipp on the edge of the black
hole lay a hat kipps battered old felt

  a moments cautious search proved the
pit empty tad left his horse in the brush


adventure

removed his spurs and chaps and win-
chester ready slipped on afoot avoiding
the main trail as much as possible

  voices and the creak of saddle leather
tad crouched in the shadow to put the
approaching riders against the skyline he
could hear them talking now bill and his
companion bound for town they spoke in
low tones barely audible to the listener

  black jacks carryin this too -far

tuh suit me bill i draws the line at mur-
der sheriffs especially once clear uh these
bad-lands im quittin the flats kipps
plumb right hes holdin a paw full uh jok-
ers even if he dies a-holdin em no more
breeds fer me theyre too danged cold-
blooded wait a minute while i tighten
my cinch this hoss swells up like a poi-
soned pup when yuh saddle him

  the two halted but a few feet from where
tad crouched one of them swung to the
ground

  supposin we skirt town complete pard-
ner suggested bill if we warns fox
we gotta go through with it er shoot it out
with that buzzard we know too danged
much tuh be let run loose over the range i
aint cravin none tuh match myself with
luther fox hes lightnin with a gun
say we drifts east from the edge uh the
pocket

  let this spread hold the sack black
jack ner fox wouldnt consider us if they
was in a tight that breed ud kill us the
same as he aims tuh kill kipp and pete bas-
set and that short waddie say them two
kin shore scrap mister only fer slim a-
lendin a hand men the apache would uh
bin whupped neat my hats off to em
dang me if i dont hope they gits away

  fat chance the injun is cornin out
in black jack i wouldnt give two-bits
mex fer their chances

  they moved on leaving tad grinning in
the darkness the thought of shorty and
the others being in danger but made the
lanky puncher the more cool he waited
impatiently until the two riders were out of
sight then moved on at a swifter gait

  the lighted windows of the cabin showed
ahead tad crept forward with the stealth
of an indian a few moments and he was
at one of the windows peering inside the
cabin

  shorty pete and kipp sat side by side
propped against the wall legs stretched out
in front of them kipps head sagged for-

ward on his chest for he was still uncon-
scious

  in spite of the bruised and blood-caked
condition of his face it was visibly appar-
ent that shortys left cheek bulged with a
huge wad of tobacco even as tad looked
a brown stream shot forth from the bruised
lips of the little puncher

  missed him pete he grinned gotta
raise my sights the range is plumb long
and that spiders crawlin kinda zig-zag like
he was dodgin bet another nickel on the
next shot

  better put in the next few minutes say-
in yore prayers hombre said black jack
crossing to the stove to pour himself a cup
of coffee a man as near the end uh the
trail as you gents are had or ter be lookin
fer a shallow crossin

  injun said shorty in his soft drawlt
when im cravin ary advice ill ask fer
it

  another brown stream that barely missed
the breeds boot

  owe yuh another nickel pete that
danged spider got plumb uta range if
yore honin tuh be of aiiy hep around here
whiskers herd that insect back this way

  pete basset marveling at the little cow
punchers superb nerve thrust aside his
worries and smiled faintly even the guard
at the door eyed shorty with approval

  slim of the broken arm groaned less
loudly as he watched shorty scan the dirt
floor for another spider

  a queer lump rose in tads throat as he
looked at shortys battered features and
saw the split lips twist in a grin

  the-lit ol game rooster mused

the big puncher racking his brain for a plan
of attack

  kipp groaned feebly and opened his eyes
black jack a cup of coffee in his left hand
leered into the sheriffs pain-shot eyes

  mebbe so that rap between the horns
brung yuh around to some sense he said
fixing kipp with narrowed gaze had ary
change uh mind while yuh was asleep

  no

  yore forcin my hand mind ive gone
too far tuh do any back-trailin in this game
and you know it im killin off these two
gents because they know too much they
come a-huntin trouble and they got it a
hull bellyful i sent word tuh fox that
youd be killed that was a lie im keep-
in yuh here till that basset deal is closed
paid off



and i sell out tuh fox then ill turn yuh
loose and men these boys is driftin to
fresh range im leavin yuh to settle with
fox if yuh got the guts tuh go through with
it ill be a long ways gone so yuh cant do
me no harm but you kin make it hot fer
luther

  black jack chuckled at the cleverness of
his plan he drained his coffee at a gulp

  want tuh be hung er shot you two he
asked the other two

  yonder comes another spider pete
said shorty ignoring black jack whats
the odds i dont hit im

  but a moment before while black jack
was talking to kipp shorty had looked up
at the window and square into the eyes of
his partner yet he had given no sign that
he had seen tad save that his left eyelid
had dropped in a covert wink he did not
glance again at the window lest he betray
tads presence he guessed that tad was
alone and was waiting for the right moment
to open the attack shorty felt sure that
black jack would put up a fight even if
tads gun covered him he had seen men
of black jacks breed before

  death to the breed would be preferable
to capture slim could still use a gun and
the guard would fight the light would be
shot out and tad would not shoot into the
darkened room lest he hit a friend it was
a situation that would require generalship

  - black jack put in the guard

hangins a lot uh bother lets knock em
on the head and throw em in the river if
their carcasses wash ashore theres no bul-
let holes in em and nobody tuh blame
they was drownded crossin the river
savvy

  mebbe yore right well pack em to
the river like they are time enough tuh
cut the ropes off em when weve got em
knocked out slim keep a eye on the
sheriff while were gone ill pack the little
un

  black jack his black eyes hard as flint
lips set in a thin line stooped to lift shorty

  a brown streak of tobacco juice shot out
catching the breed squarely in the eyes
with a howl of pain as the stinging nicotine
blinded him the outlaw leader sprang
erect hands to his eyes

  a shot accompanied by tinkling glass
stick em up bawled tad

  the man bending over pete whirled
shooting from the hip at the window tads

shot caught the outlaw in the shoulder
spinning him about

  watch the jasper on the couch tad
yelled shorty rolling across the floor in
twisting flops and striking the legs of black
jack who was groping for the table where
the lamp stood cursing in a monotone his
eyes blinded and hot with pain the half
breed fell across shortys form

  tad gun in hand sprang through the
doorway black jack shot desperately at
the least sound and tad felt the air of a
passing bullet tad leaped forward the
high heel of his boot crunching the breeds
gun hand into the dirt the small bones
cracked sickeningly and black jack cursed
as he groped for the gun with his left hand

  a streak of fire from the bunk slims
bullet tore through the crown of tads hat
tads gun roared tearing the  from slims
hand

  both wings busted snarled slim and
followed the statement by a string of curses

  the other man was in a heap whining
and begging

  kill the yaller coyote yelled slim

kill the howling - fight you -

polecat

  tad was on top of black jack now his
long arms swinging like flails as the breed
fought like a trapped cougar a terrific
swing and the breed went limp

  the powder smoke was stifling every
mans ears rang from the roar of the big
calibered six-shooters slim was shrieking
curses and begging some one to kill the
wounded outlaw who put up so tame a
fight

  tad cut shortys ropes first

  thanks ox grinned the little puncher
gimme that rope and ill tie that injun
wheres yore men big feller

  i come with kipp quit a runnin off
at the head runt and tie up that black-
muzzled skunk afore he comes alive and
makes me kill im

  pete and kipp were quickly freed they
grinned their thanks and set to work si-
lencing slim and the other man

  pete grinned the jubilant shorty

liern a muley cow but we cant all of us be
hansome yuh done got here jest about
time feller the injun was kinda goin on
the notion that all good cow hands was dead

tuh be at-

  fer gosh sake dry up runt grumbled
tad yuh dad-gummed lil locoed idjit
snuk off on me and overmatched yoresef
didnt yuh id orter a let yuh git yore
needins

  with a snort of disapproval he turned
to kipp

  the sheriff had moved to the open door-
way and was staring with thoughtful eyes
into the night he turned as tads hand
rested on his shoulder together they
stepped outside

 that-hole ketched me ladd the

fall knocked me out and they had me foul
when i come to i done my best which

was a-of a pore showin

  no man kin do moren his best joe
its over now lets fergit it

  tad shoved out his hand but kipp shook
his head

  it aint over fer me ladd i got my
work cut out fer me when ive done that
work ill shake hands if yore still in the
notion

  meanin fox and you locks horns
partly that when we bring this herd
up outa the brakes foxll know that his
game is lost itll be either run er shoot it
out and he aint the runnin kind itll be
me er him thats all the range is too small
tuh hold us both

  tad nodded

  im layin my bets on you joe

  im obliged pardner

  they turned and entered the cabin

there followed half an hour
of cross-questioning the outlaw
who had begged for mercy when
he had been wounded they
learned that there were no more men to be
accounted for tad told of the conversa-
tion he had overheard between bill and his
companion

  then we got clear trail ahead said
kipp billll pick up the gent at the
rimrock bein theyre sorter pardners we
might as well bed down and take it easy
till mornin well take turns standin
guard thered orter be beds out under
the trees sos them as aint on guard kin
rest come daylight well take the herd
out and ill take the prisners tuh hanks
place

  this plan met with hearty approval
not a man there but needed rest tad took
first guard

  black jack conscious now had lapsed in-
to a sullen silence his black eyes were
opaque his bearded features expressionless
no amount of questioning could open his
thin lips

  thats the injun in him grinned
shorty as he and pete followed kipp out-
side in search of beds

  my work is done sheriff smiled pete
basset when shorty was out of earshot
im giving myself up to you im ready
to go back to deer lodge

  better wait a day er so pete im
too danged busy tuh fool with yuh right

come in handy foxll have men with
him when we meet up with him at the lone
cottonwood to pay off yore dads note
this show aint over till it is yore plumb
free savvy

  thats white of you sheriff ive had
a hunch for a long time that you were in
cahoots with fox and his gang black
jacks recent talk clinches that suspicion
also its plain that youre breaking with
the lf i want you to know that im
for you

  beyond the cottonwood grove near the
corrals shorty was jerking the saddle from
his tired horse and staking the animal out
where the grass was high he sang as he
worked

parson im a maverick jest runnin loose an

        grazin

      big divide

xii

at midnight tad went out-
side to call kipp for guard duty
he found the old officer sitting
on a tarp-covered bed smoking
herds a layin peaceful joe i done
found a jug uh licker and slim and the yal-
ler un has drunk theirselves tuh sleep
paid off



black jacks the fust breed i ever run acrost
that dont tech trantlar juice

  kipp smiled absently and got to his feet
tad was pulling off his boots already the
sheriffs form was silhouetted against the
lighted doorway for a moment then the
door closed

  tad in the act of pulling off a second
tight-fitting boot paused his wide brow
furrowed in thought for as long as a
minute he sat thus then he pulled the
boot back on his foot and donned its mate
he listened for a moment to shortys
snoring then moving stealthily tad made
his way to the cabin crouching by the win-
dow the glass of which had been broken
earlier in the night

  hurry up and cut these ropes tad heard
black jack command in a low-pitched tone

  no came kipps answer

  the sheriffs voice sounded tired the
voice of an old man who carried too heavy
a burden

  yuh know what it means fer us both if
i talk

  yes ive done figgered it all out im
takin my medicine and givin you yourn
there aint no use talkin im goin
through with this i aim tuh come clean
with the hull story how you killed a man
when he ketched yuh stealin hosses how
yuh got life fer it how i filed the bars uh
the window on that los cruces jail and
staked yuh to a hoss tuh git away into
mexico yuh said youd never bather
me no more i come north changed my
name and lets the past lay dead then
you and this fox hunts me out and makes
me play yore dirty game im tellin all
that when the time comes they kin do

what jthey - please with me ill die

in the pen knowin ive squared my ac-
counts here on this side uh the big divide

  the breed made no reply tad peering
through the logs where a bit of chinking
had dropped out saw the sheriff squatted
with his back against the door a win-
chester across his knees

  black jacksback was toward tad he
could see the brown muscular hands one
of them swollen and discolored twist at
the tightly knotted rope

  youd bust the promise yuh made to a
dyin woman

  ive kept that promise replied kipp
slowly more than kept it i reckon you
know that as well as i do

  yes came the breeds answer i
reckon i do you done yore share and
more i aim tuh do mine

  one of those brown hands had so man-
euvered that it had slipped inside the waist-
band of the overalls and was hidden un-
seen by kipp it now came forth holding
a tiny derringer before tad grasped the
import of the breeds intention black jack
had pressed the muzzles of the little double-
barreled gun into his own back a dull roar
as the hammer fell and the soft-nosed 
slug ripped its way upward through black
jacks spine and into his chest a second
thudding roar then the smoking gun
dropped to the floor

  kipp was on his feet staring strangely
at the breed tad saw black jacks face
twist upward white teeth showing in a
twisted grin

  yuh see im keepin my word said the
breed through smiling lips  i wont bother
yuh no more im-goin now so long
the bearded head sagged forward the
body swayed sidewise kipp caught it
and lowered him gently to the floor dead

  tad entering the cabin saw dimly out-
lined in the blue smoke haze kipp squat-
ting beside the body of the dead outlaw
staring into the glazing black eyes of the
half-breed who had made the old sheriffs
life a living hell

  kipp looked up tad was amazed to see
the sheriffs eyes wet with unshed tears

 he was my son ladd said kipp
simply

  tad stared stupidly for a moment
stunned at the sheriffs words then he
nodded understandingly slim and the
other outlaw stirred in their drunken
slumber and slept on tad looked up to
see shorty gun in hand framed in the
doorway

  black jack done killed hissef shorty
tad explained pete awake

  awake and on the way tad yonder
he comes limpin bet he stepped on a
cactus in his sock feet

  i reckon joe wants tuh be left alone

pard tell-

  hold on ladd said kipp quietly
rising let pete come thg time has
come fer explainin off a few things come
in and set

  the three younger men awed into re-
spectful silence by kipps gravity did as
he asked

xiii

luther fox swung a long leg

across his saddle horn and thus
at ease in his saddle gazed at the
rudely lettered sign nailed to
the lone cottonwood a cold cigar jutted
from the corner of his thin-lipped mouth
the age-yellowed ivory butt of a long-
barreled  poked itself from beneath the
long tail of his rusty black coat he re-
moved the cigar from between his crooked
teeth and sprayed the sign with tobacco
juice one or two brown specks were added
to the already badly spotted white expanse
of shirt front

 barring - and high water he ad-
dressed his two roughly garbed heavily
armed companions who had dismounted and
squatted on the ground that sign will
come off that tree before sundown

 no more dead-line between bassets
and the lf eh boss

  fox nodded the corners of his mouth
twitching then he pointed with the butt
of a home-made quirt to a small dust cloud
slowly approaching from the direction of
the basset place

 what do you make of it boys how
many cornin

two two hossbackers nary steer
thatll be basset and his sweet-tem-
pered wife were due to receive a tongue

lashing boys - a man that cant

do business without his-- cat-of a wo-
man tagging along killings too good an
end for such females

  i wonder wheres the cattle and them
two waddies yuh hired boss

  quit the country no doubt i sent a
man over here yesterday to see em theyd
pulled out and basset was making no effort
to gather the few head uh stuff he has on his
range as a matter of fact bassets wife
had the old fool penned off in the black-
smith shop

  fox smiled faintly the two punchers
laughed coarsely

 yuh aim tuh make a dicker fer the
basset iron boss watch dost that ol
hank dont sluff the ol lady off on yuh
along with the brand

hank and ma basset came on slowly
their horses scuffing up puffs of yellow dust


adventure

the old couple looked tired and worried
ma dressed in bib overalls flannel shirt
and an old slouch hat filled her saddle to
the point overflowing her eyes were a bit
red as if from recent shedding of tears
of the two hank looked the more down-
cast as they approached the lone tree that
marked the boundary line low on hanks
thigh swung a  in a weather-stained hol-
ster across mas saddle pommel rested a
sawed-off shotgun

  looky here hank basset perk up
i dont aim that fox should see us down in
the mouth land sakes cant yuh scare
up a grin of some description to wear on
yore face you dont see me sittin my
hoss like a dogie in a blizzard

  at that moment her horse an old flea-
bitten gray stumbled and went to his
knees jolting the breath out of ma as her
saddle horn jabbed her hank did his best
to bide a grin ma red-faced and gasping
gave him an angry look

  if that aint a cowpuncher for yuh i
do believe youd laugh if i was to be killed
by this crow-bait of a hoss now whats
so comical what yuh grinnin at

  yuhlowed i was tuh perk up ma im
perkin

  hanks hand searching for tobacco en-
countered kipps sheriff badge

  joe kipp and the ladd feller lowed
theyd be here at noon to-day the sun
lacks half a hour uh thro win the short
shadder we aint licked yet

  if ary harm had come to pete id feel
it in my bones hank what was it joe
kipp said about that paper in his safe
he lowed it ud be useful to us

  huh he mighta said more yonders
fox lookin fer all the world like a turkey
buzzard drat him id like tuh give that
old skinflint a piece uh my mind set up
straight cant yuh goodness a person
ud think you was a hunchback if them
new galluses is too tight let em out a
notch

  the couple approached the tree fox
his long leg still crooked across his saddle
horn lifted his hat with an air of mocking
gallantry

  the dried up ol he school-marm
muttered ma basset freezing him with a
hard stare

  foxs head bare as a billiard ball dis-
appeared beneath the wide-brimmed black
hat

  i understood there was a bunch of
cattle to be delivered here basset he said
as if surprized to see no herd my two
boys are bringing them perhaps

  perhaps snapped ma basset  taint
noon yet

  on such a beautiful sabbath morning
we mortals should forget our quarrels mrs
basset i come on an errand of peace
ours should be a relationship of neighborly
friendship instead on enmity

  his bony hand indicated bassets sign
it is my wish that such things should
not exist madam in my pocket is your
note i would gladly destroy that bit of
paper and seal in that manner our bond
of mutual friendship in return i ask for
something that is of little value namely
the transfer of your iron into my name
it is evident that but a handful of cattle in
that iron exist i am offering to lift the
burden of debt from you in return for a
brand that has no value

  why snapped ma basset

  that such ill feeling as is shown by
yonder sign may be wiped away you will
be taken care of moreover i shall myself
make a plea to the governor of the state
for an absolute pardon for your son i
wish to prove to you that luther fox is not
the scoundrel you would have men think
him to be

  his bony thumbs hooked in the arm-
holes of his grease-spotted waistcoat he at-
tempted a yellow-fanged smile

  a buzzard chatterin like a magpie
was ma bassets audible comment to her
husband

  foxs yellow cheeks took on a pinkish
hue his eyes glittered venomously

  we aint askin no compromise fox
said hank the deal goes as she lays

  so be it

  fox bit off his words sharply pulling
forth a huge watch he held it in the palm
of his hand

  you have exactly twenty-eight minutes
to produce those cattle basset

  and thats a plenty luther fox look
yonder cried ma basset

  out of a long draw came a moving mass
of stock the faint sound of bawling
cattle came to them the brownish spot
widened quickly taking form as the herd
spread out across the prairie

  fox went pasty white the crooked
smile on his thin lips vanished a man
paid off



seeing a ghost could look no more startled

 somethings wrong as --he mut-
tered as his leg swung to catch the ox-bow
stirrup beads of moisture stood out on
his cheeks his claw-like fingers shook as
they wrapped about the ivory butt of the
low-hung  he gazed as if fascinated
at the oncoming herd

  with those cattle came ruination and
defeat the absence of kipp tad and
shorty was now accounted for somehow
they had gotten into the pocket killed or
captured black jack and his men and were
bringing out the stolen herd the swift
vision of a prison cell made him wince
he shut his eyes against it and his chin
dropped to his chest when he looked up a
moment later the color had come back into
his lips he turned to his two followers

  youll find fresh horses at the corral in
town its a forty-hour ride to the cana-
dian line youd better lose no time

  the two men gazed at him for a moment
then whirled their horses and were gone in
a cloud of dust without a word of parting
fox now turned to hank basset and his
wife who acted like people who moved in
a dream stupefied with steady hand
fox brought forth hank bassets note and
slowly tore it to bits the scraps of paper
fluttered to the ground

  it would be better if you rode back to-
wards your ranch madam i bid you good
day

- ma basset hesitated her eyes moving
from fox to her husband something in
foxs bearing silenced her usually ready
tongue

  better drift ma mumbled hank

  she turned her horse and rode away
the old horse headed on the homeward
trail voluntarily quickened his pace and
she gave him rein

  hank licked his dry lips and stared at
fox who had taken the  from its holster
and was spinning the cylinder his eyes on
a solitary horseman who had quit the herd
and was riding toward the lone tree

  that will be joe kipp said fox his
voice flatly emotionless for a man who
has spent his life in the saddle he sits a
horse badly

  the white-handled gun went back in its
holster then fox rode to the cottonwood
and with an abrupt movement jerked
hank bassets sign from its place on the
tree trunk

  youll have no further need of it basset
and the thing was an eyesore the spelling
was miserable should kipp shoot better
than he rides bury me on the lf side of
the tree

  midway between the tree and the herd
joe kipp came on his horse at a running
walk fox riding to meet him halted for
a moment to call over his shoulder to hank

  a man may be a scoundrel basset but
still not be a coward

  then he rode on

  those that watched saw the two men ride
toward each other saw the gap between
them lessen two puffs of white smoke
appeared at precisely the same instant
both men swayed drunkenly in the saddle
the horses startled leaped forward the
riders slipped to the ground to he quietly
but ten feet apart

  tad was the first to reach the spot he
swung from his saddle to bend over kipp
fox a red smear oozing from the hole be-
tween his eyes lay face upward his gun
still clutched in his lifeless hand

  is kipp dead panted shorty riding
up

  tad looked up shaking his head

  creased hell come to directly foxs
bullet done parted his hair the sun
musta somehow spiled the buzzards aim

  hank rode up panting as if from a hard
run

  toss me kipps badge hank called
tad hes done earned the right tuh
wear it

from ma bassets kitchen came
the savory odor of roast turkey
baking pies and coffee

  in the front room cotton
covers had been removed from plush seated
chairs and the place buzzed with conversa-
tion generously punctuated by laughter
holiday spirit prevailed

  shorty carroway scrubbed shaved re-
splendent in a suit of store clothes was
gradually becoming more red of cheek due
to the confines of a shining celluloid collar

  that red tie uh yourn has slipped up
under yore off ear runt confided tad also
in holiday garb in a voice that carried the
length of the room

  shorty rescued the truant tie and grinned
wickedly

  is it the style tuh wear one sock draggin
low thataway when yuh got low water


adventure

shoes on ox swap yuh this here los
cruces letter uh joe kipps fer pete bassets
pardon paper dang me if i ever knowed

dont go spilin joes dinner talkin about

the breed wheren - yore manners

and mind yuh act purty when miz basset
sets yuh alongside thet school-marm at the
table

  shorty squirmed his glance darting to an
angular maiden lady across the room
tad chuckled softly

  joe kipp exonerated from the los
cruces killing and recently returned from
the border town was in a corner with pete
basset who had that morning made his
triumphant return from deer lodge

  ma basset and the school teacher were
fluttering about the room collecting vacant
chairs and setting the table the school
teacher taking advantage of a lull in the
operations headed like a homing pigeon for
the vacant place on the setee alongside

shorty the little puncher grinned in a
sickly fashion and swallowed hard

  well have a chance to finish that thrill-
ing tale of yours nowmister carroway
she cooed

  shorty catching hanks eye sent a look
of desperate appeal that might have
brought results had not tad interfered

  if theres anything mister carroway
loves its relatin them hair-brained es-
capes uh hisn git him tuh tell yuh about
the time he stumbled over lafe tuckers
tame polecat in the dark maam

  ma basset sensing shortys agonized
frame of mind came to the rescue

  hattie if yuh dont mind will yuh put
on the red napkins im gettin that hefty

plowmen pioneers

by s omar barker

    otrong men have gone adventuring
       since adam saw the sword

     and some have died to serve a king

     and some to serve the lord

     and some to serve their own red blood
     that knew the wayward call

     and answered it and found it good

    from wrangel to bengal

     and we have roused good songs for lads
     who whether young or old

     have entered lifes olympiads
     adventuring for gold

     so have we sung the sons of war

    and so we sing them now

     but who has twanged a ballad for
     the heroes of the plow

     west over prairies through strange hills
     calm pioneers fought on-

     what was it gold that thewed their wills
     and led to oregon

    long muskets hooked beneath their arms-
    afraid of none but god-

     they carried plows to virgin farms

     lean soldiers of the sod

    these were the men who saw wild grass
    with creeping death astir

     who fought red terror in the pass

    and braved the massacre

     they loved the smell of virgin soil

     the fertile feel of loam

     yet mingled daring with their toil

     and so at last came home

     their furrows down the field of years
     are straight and true and deep

    o	simple plowmen pioneers

     god rest you in your sleep

     and we who swell with lusty breath
     the ballads of the brave

     will rouse a chant for noble death

     and sing it oer your grave

ow is your appetite

  i have been thinking of the good
old days when i was younger i
often wonder what itwas that kept
my soul and body together aboard the old
fast and furious when i was young healthy
and forever hungry i sailed with her a full
four years and throughout that time saw
no change in her menus when meal times
came around

 when i was working for the army
ymca in camp i used to hear the sol-
diers grouse at the quality and at the quan-
tity of the food served to them little they
knew in what luxury they lived ive seen
men who would have fought for three stewed
prunes men to whom the word prune
would have spelt quite unbelievable delight
and luxury

  imagine having potatoes every day
not only every day but often two and
three times a day think of fresh meat

  well its all a matter of the point of
view i suppose an affair of circumstance

  when with the old fast and furious i
sat down each morning at sea to all the hard
sea biscuit that i could eat-to that and
nothing else except black and sugarless cof-
fee with no milk in it

  at supper the feast was precisely similar
save that the coffee was replaced by what
was said to be tea

  as often as not the sea biscuit was so old
so stale so moldering that it was full of
weevils of all sizes since there was noth-
ing else to eat we must perforce shake the

 weevils out and proceed with the biscuit

   when the hard tack was fresh it was so
 iron hard that to break it with the teeth was
 quite impossible it was often too hard to
 break with a strong knife-handle

   what was it made of do not ask me
 i do not know

   a biscuit soaked for a few seconds or
 rather dipped for a few seconds in salt wa-
 ter and then placed in the galley oven
 would swell to several times- its size it was
 a custom to do this sometimes to make
 variety for supper especially in fine weath-
 er just as summertime fetches the shore
 folks out door to sip their afternoon tea

 and to nibhk their cake and their cookies

   thus treated a ships hard biscuit was
 known as a midshipmans muffin they
  were exceedingly unpleasant in their after
 effects

   when broken into small fragments and
 fried in the oven with a few precious scraps
 of pork fat-which was either saved at
 great sacrifice from the midday meal or
 begged from the china cook-they became
 known as dandy funk or cracker hash
 dogsbody etc i do not recall quite
 all the names of the queer messes that we
 contrived in our futile endeavor to vary our
 food

   on sunday at sea we were allowed as a
 great luxury plum duff on good ships
 this plum duff was made of flour and of
 raisins on my ship it was made of hard
 tack beaten into a fine powder by a per-
 severing chinaman or negro with a very
what they ate



 very tiny allowance of flour then added and
 a few lonely raisins mixed with the mess
 like the midshipmans muffins our plum
 duff was of bad after effects

  i	recall a time when the old man gave
the cook orders that we should all be served
for a change cracker hash-the pork fat
actually provided by the old mans gen-
erosity every one aboard was taken ill
the cracker hash was at once called off i
do not know what was the reason of the old
mans sudden liberality or of our equally
sudden sickness but i suspect that there
was some rather unusually bad salt pork
aboard which it was necessary to finish and
which in the eyes of a british shipown-
er it would have been criminal to throw
away

  three times a week at noon we were
given salt pork and pea soup the pork
was always boiled in the pea soup to save
fresh water thereby making the soup so
salt as to be all but undrinkable the pork
was but a couple of mouthfuls apiece
often it was unfit for consumption ships
leaving liverpool expecting to be away
quite possibly for three years would sail
provisioned with the cheap food procur-
able in that port

  they would sail far and slowly crossing
and recrossing the equator many times
they would voyage through all manner of
climates and return on returning to their
home port there might be left a consider-
able amount of the old stores fresh stores
would be loaded atop of that old stuff
which when the ship was at last out from
home long enough would by and by be un-
covered and fetched out-and used as
human food i have seen-aye and smelt
-pork so rotten as to be nauseating
moreover i have eaten that same pork
here i am

  twice a week we were given salt horse-
said to be beef i daresay it was beef but
from ancient bulls indeed if one could find
a morsel that was neither bone muscle or
fat it was fairly good eating for a hunger-
perished young man of round twenty
years of age on salt horse days we were
given in place of pea soup bean soup the
bean soup was good fine excellent-or
would have been had they left out a lot of
the water and put in the beans what
beans one could find were very nice beans
indeed-and must have been also very
nourishing ones

  on the two remaining days we were
served fanny adams

  what you say is fanny adams no
relation to me i hope

  fanny adams was a strange stringy
mess that came out of tall blue corrugated
cans it was coiled up rope fashion and
intertwined and twisted like the wet hair
of an oily fat black-complexioned woman
who has been in swimming without having
first washed the pomade from her locks
fanny adams was supposed to be canned
beef i believe but i am a first-rate and
simple-minded believer

  why you ask the name

  well rumor has it that two ladies of the
underworld were long ago mysteriously
murdered in the port of sydney their
bodies were never found their names
were harriet lane and fanny adams
thus on some ships the canned meat is
known as one and on other ships as the
other-harriet lane and fanny adams

xps every monday evening at sea
        an apprentice of each watch
        went aft to the cabin door and

      	 there was served out the weeks
supply of marmalade or in cold latitudes
of butter for himself and his messmates
also he received the weekly allowance of
sugar

  the marmalade came from large corru-
gated cans precisely similar to those in
which harriet and fanny took their last
long sleep the butter so called came
from similar containers

  to each apprentice and to each sailor
also there was when the allowance was
portioned out just a short half-pannikin
of marmalade sugar or butter this was to
last until the following monday evening
of course we always made one good meal a
week-and that on monday evening now
and again a lad usually with scotch blood
in his veins would contrive to make his al-
lowance eke out till perhaps thursday or
even friday i was always done by the
end of mondays supper

  on three days a week we were given at
noon a minute rooty apiece-that is to
say a very small loaf of fresh bread it
was fair enough bread as far as it went but
it went only part way through one meal
that was on tuesday thurday and sun-
day

  every day at the noon meal we were


adventure

each given a third of a pannikin of lime-
juice this was served out as a scurvy pre-
ventive and was not served till we had been
eleven days at sea usually except in equa-
torial weather we tossed it over the side or
into the scupper now and then a boy would
be found who liked it and who drank the al-
lowances of his shipmates as well as his own

  when at noon the food was brought for-
ward from the galley by the apprentice
whose turn it was to fetch the food for we
took these things in turns it fell to the oldest
hand in the half-deck to whack out the grub

  the oldest hand who was not necessarily
the eldest but who had behind him the
longest experience would lean over the
mess-kit and frown knife or spoon in hand

  the ship with which i served my time
carried eight apprentices in her half-deck-
four in the mates and four in the second
mates watch

  the three of us who were the oldest hands
juniors would peer into the mess-kit also
keen to see that in sharing out our poor allow-
ance he made not the very slightest error
in dividing the food into exact quarters i
have heard many savage quarrels over a
twentieth part of an ounce of pork or of
plum duff of marmalade or margarine
there is nothing like hunger to bring out
the old original angry cave-bear in human
beings many a bloody fist fight has been
waged aboard the deck of a lime juice ship
just because one apprentice thought that
he was being robbed of his due share-a piti-
ful half-spoonful of coarse brown sugar or a
rooty not quite so large as that portioned
to his neighbor

  this seems a shameful thing to write
about but the truth is very often a shame-
ful thing and all too seldom told the
blame surely lies at the door of not the skip-
pers of the old lime juice ships who like
ourselves were at the mercy of the owners
but at the door of the owners themselves
and of a government which permitted such
starvation to exist in its merchant fleets

  of course there were happy times times
when we were fed to the limit i refer to
especially christmas day

vyhow well i recall my first christ-
mas at sea we were running be-
fore a hard westerly wind toward
the horn bound eastward and she
had a big press of sail set she was boom-
ing along the bit in her teeth the ocean

pastures songful all beside her and the white
clouds high above her fast mastheads

  for dinner on that great day we were
served out all the boiled rice that we could
eat and not only rice but boiled beans also
true there was no spanish sauce or fancy
dressing but who at sea in a half-deck
cares for frills such as they we ate to our
hearts content and had both rice and boiled
beans to save for supper-supper usually
the poorest the most hungry meal of all

  at supper we again ate to repletion the
ship was staggering a little her sail almost
too much for the wind that came after her
quarters after supper we were barely
able to sit erect so full of beans and rice
were we those of us who were off duty lay
in our bunks and thanked god for christmas

  we recalled the old carol singing that we
had known so long ago when we were
younger and sang verses of christmas
hymns with grateful hearts and with very
full bellies we spoke of j the beautiful
things of shore-of the giving of gifts at
christmas wondering should we now that
we were sailors ever again be ashore at
christmas time

  the second mate came in to visit with
us for a little while and told us how once he
had sailed from home on christmas eve-
on the very night when every shop and
every window was bright with holly and
with mistletoe and hung with candles

  ah its a hard life the sailors the sea
takes you whether you will or no once you
have become one of her kinfolk

  the four of us who were on duty kept
looking out of the half-deck door staring
aloft to the royals which stretched their
white arches to the cape horn wind won-
dering would it fall to our lot to have to
go aloft and furl those far-up sails with
our stomachs now so filled with boiled rice
and with beans

  that is of my forty-four christmases one
of the most memorable though there have
been many memorable ones among them

  the wind held fair and strong and we
were left to our sailors peace until eight
bells was struck and all the crew swarmed
out upon the deck for the mustering of the
watches and the relieving of the wheel and
the lookout

  hard tack and moldy pork scant plates
of soup and rancid margarine were all for-
gotten for we were homeward bound and
it was christmas day
the anti-weapon law of charles vi



  it doesnt take much of human kindness
of human cheer to make a man forget his
past miseries and to make him freely for-
give whatever of injustice he has endured
thank heaven for that for were it not
so this earth could not go on

  we on those far away days blamed our
old man in that we were so ill fed so shab-
bily treated but we were young and judged
with the quick impetuosity of youth those
of us who lived long enough learned not to
judge too hastily

  it was hard when close to the equator
sweltering under a tropic sun one came
away from the wheel at noon to find noth-
ing to eat but a scrap of salt pork and a piece
of hard tack with a small plate of salty pea
soup it was equally hard when far south
off the desolate cape to go from a similar
scant meal to stand for two or sometimes
three hours at the wheel in a drive of snow

  the hurricane blasting sea and sky and ship

  those days are done the day of the
sailing ship is past we who knew those
days those ships look backward with
amused memories wishing we had the same
days here to live again for after all hard
though it was life was good we were
often little but barbaric fighting amongst
ourselves over scanty allowances of food
jealous over a few spoonsful of soup or of
marmalade we worked hard with no thanks
save the knowledge that our job was done

 we served the hardships of a hard nation
-the limejuice ships of britain we saw
an empire built upon the efforts of poor
mens hungry bodies held by the starved
limbs of simple people yet we gave injus-
tice but little thought and forgot our hun-
ger when the pay days came laughing to-
gether ready for the next ship and the next
voyage-the next adventure

the anti-weapon law of charles vi

                      by f r buckley

there is nothing new under the
sun and even anti-weapon laws
have been tried before-in 
for instance a greedy and wit-
less king of france charles vi attempted
to re-impose on the people of paris what
would now be called a sales-tax the peo-
ple of paris arose in their might-armed as
it happened with mallets the insurrection
was quickly put down by the disciplined
forces but to prevent further troubles of
the kind a rigorous disarmament law was
passed and very strictly enforced paris
was regarded as the pivot of the kingdom
it must not be split by internal fighting and
obviously-to the feeble mind of charles vi
--fighting would be absolutely prevented by
the removal of the inhabitants weapons

  time passed about thirty years a gen-
eration of parisians arose which knew not
weapons then under circumstances it is
not necessary to detail a certain duke of
burgundy wished to have command of the
city it was politically impossible for him
to take it by force of arms but it was pos-
sible as it would be nowadays for him to

  engineer the election of a friend of his to the
captaincy of the city had all the inhabi-
tants been armed this move would have
been without effect a captain can only com-
mand and to order the whole body of the
citizenry to fight against its own interests
would be useless

  but under the circumstances the count
de st pols course was clear one class of
citizens had of necessity been exempted
from the disarmament process-the butch-
ers the butchers had knives axes and
bludgeons galore-just as after a modern
disarmament plumbers would still have lots
of lead pipe and miners plenty of dynamite
and one class of citizens can usually be in-
duced to betray the other classes for its
own benefit

  so the duke of burgundy controlled paris
much against the desire of the parisians at
large by means of a parisian militia

  the powerful but unarmed university
and the indignant but weaponless pop-
ulation protested violently but it has not
been recorded anywhere that their protests
ever did them any good

tie plaza of santa clara was
filled with the rattle of rifle-fire
and the hot motionless air was
rank with the stench of smoke-
less powder the little caribbean seaport
had seen more than one battle since the
buccaneers first pounded the limestone walls
of the harbor fort to powder with their muz-
zle-loading brass cannon and then sacked
the town

  the twin gray towers of the old cathedral
lost none of their air of drowsy repose don
miguel beola and his friends might feel that
swarthy presidente pelayo had fixed the last
election and that it was their duty and
privilege to resort to arms all this meant
nothing to the cathedral which continued
to dream of the past

  by a bold stroke the beolistas had that
morning managed to seize most of the city
but the simultaneous attempt to surprize
the fort had failed the federal garrison
had since been reinforced by some troops
rushed down from the capitol on a special
train and had driven the rebels out of the
lower part of the city they still clung stub-
bornly to everything south of the avenida
del cuatro de junio which runs into the
plaza and bisects the city

  the rattle of an old-fashioned machine-
gun sounded at intervals distinct amid the
scattering rifle shots this gun was em-
placed in the glorieta or band-stand that
stood beside the statue of cristobal colon

in the center of the plaza and was the trump
card of the beolistas in their slow retreat

  richmond the consul and young stevens
of the fruit company watched the fighting
from the roof of the consulate the rebels
were firing from the roofs and windows
a dozen white-clad soldados of the federal
forces showed where the last attempt to rush
the band-stand fortress had failed 

  	the machine-gun was under the tender
care of a young man with fiery hair who
cursed the antiquated mechanism in mixed
english and gaelic while he tried to elevate
the piece enough to reach the roof of the
casino espanol across the way the federal
rifle fire seemed to slacken for a few minutes
and then the doors of the casino suddenly
opened and a close packed mass of troops
surged across the plaza at that moment
the machine-gun jammed as is the way of
machine-guns its operator poked at it
furiously but futilely for a few seconds and
then drew his revolver as three soldados
simultaneously climbed the rail of the band-
stand he shot the first two but the third
stunned him with a gun stock and the at-
tacking wave rolled on toward the barricade

  well i guess that settles their hash
said richmond with a sigh lowering his
binoculars to rest his eyes for a while it
seems too bad in a way don miguel isnt
a bad hombre at all at least hes better
than pelayo

  yes theyre in full retreat replied

stevens nervously there is that chap on
horseback again he has managed to get to-
gether some sort of rear guard i swear he
looks like a girl

its not impossible said richmond

thoughtfully i wonder-

  that rear guard is putting up a -

good scrap continued stevens excitedly
i swear id like to lend them a hand
none of that chico richmonds voice
was stern youre new in this fry pan of a
country and i feel sort of responsible for

you youre too - romantic mind

your own business and let this here war
alone

  only the stubborn rear guard kept the
retreat from becoming a panic-stricken
search for shelter for numbers of the beolis-
tas deserted at every cross street scurrying
away to discard their arms and appear a
little later as peaceable non-combatants
the hundred or so that remained when the
edge of the town was reached found further
retreat cut off and barricaded themselves
in a large house that stood by itself on a
small rise coronel perez commanding the
garrison drew his lines close about the house
and waited till one of the old krupps from
the fort could be brought to force the door
that is beloas own house

  richmond was using his binoculars again
big old place i used to know it well
theyre fools to stop there though they
might hold it against infantry alone but
perez will have a gun there pretty soon
intervening houses cut off much of the
view and all the watchers perched on the
roof of the consulate could see was the
upper part of the house where the revolution
was rapidly passing into history occa-
sional puffs of smoke drifted from upper
windows about three seconds elapsing be-
fore the sound of the shot came drifting to
their ears about half an hour later they
heard the thrice repeated heavier note of a
field piece and smoke began to curl up be-
tween the roof tiles of the beleaguered house
the rifle fire ceased the revolution was
over

  as the firing died away richmond and
stevens left the shelter of the consulate and
headed for the europa santa clara was
rapidly returning to its usual state of sleepy
contented quiet occasional bodies still lay
sprawled here and there and in some places
the soft pastel colors of the house walls were
slashed with gleaming white where a bullet

had laid bare the limestone beneath the
paint ragged urchins were gathering up
the empty cartridge cases for playthings

   the stores were opening up again and a
corner bodega-combination grocery store
and wine shop-vas crowded with excited
citizenry discussing the glorious victory just
won by the beloved government some of
those who were loudest in their rejoicing and
most outspoken in their praise of the
strategy of coronel perez had been in the
rebel ranks earlier in the day

of the two americans walking
by richmond was nearly twenty
years the elder he was long and
lean and shriveled his frayed tan
linen suit wrapped itself around his bony
frame like a wet sock on a stick his skin
had that curious combination of tan and
sallowness that comes from weary years of
tropic sun and dengue fever but his eyes
were still clear

  young stevens who walked beside him
was fresh from the north having only
arrived in santa clara some ten days back
for him the tropics still held their charm
and romance he liked to listen to the
garrison band that played in the plaza three
nights a week he thought the dirty narrow
twisted streets picturesque and the flash of
dark eyes beneath a mantilla still thrilled
him in spite of richmonds acid comments
upon the probability of negro blood and the
certainty of obesity after the age of twenty-
five or thereabouts

  they found the owner clerk manager
and head-waiter of the hotel europa stand-
ing in front of his just-reopened place of
business gazing tearfully at the splintered
remains of a number of his cafe tables that
had been used in the barricade

  que pasa don faustino asked rich-
mond as the two sat down at one of the un-
injured tables why so peeved didnt
the little war suit you

   why should i not be peeved as you say
it spluttered the plump faustino in fair
english look at what they do to my
hotel eight tables of such a splinteredness
they are useless many bottles and glasses
broken by bullets my side door smashed
where the sold ados entered por dios why
should i not be triste

  slow and easy drawled richmond
avoid excitement mental or physical
thats rule one forget your wrongs don


adventure

faustino and bring us a couple of agua de
coco if the army didnt use all your coconuts
for hand-grenades

  richmond turned his back on the plaza
and watched faustino slash the ends off a
couple of green coconuts ith deft strokes
of a heavy knife produced from some mys-
terious hiding-place in his garments and
pour the colorless liquid from the coconuts
into two tall glasses the younger man
continued to watch the aftermath of battle
taking place in the plaza small bodies of
government troops were passing through on
their way back to the barracks smoking
and laughing with little semblance of dis-
cipline a few bound and discouraged
looking beolistas were in the midst of each
group

  the moral of that said richmond when
stevens called his attention to the prisoners
is revolute in haste repent at leisure
if don miguel had waited a month or so he
might have had a show the army was
beginning to get dissatisfied not having
been paid in eight months and it might have
joined him instead of smashing him

  what will they do with the prisoners

  oh theyll shoot a few-the leaders and
any one that coronel perez happens to have
a grudge against they will let the rest
go in a few days after the excitement has
died down and theyve all sworn allegiance
again

  a squad of soldiers was beginning to re-
move the bodies from the plaza laying them
on the floor of the europa stevens had
never seen a dead man before-that is one
who had died by violence-and the sight
fascinated him the irishman who had
worked the machine-gun was among them
his face covered with clotted blood from
a gash on the side of his head richmond
surveyed the bodies commiseratingly

  poor - he said it seems like

a-of a waste just because don miguel

beola got sore at the way pelayo fixed the
election and talked about justice and pa-
triotism these pobrecitos lie dead in the
gutter day after tomorrow they and the
whole thing will be forgotten and the only
difference will be a new door on the opera
house and some new tables in the cafe
here

  who is the irishman at least he looks
like one interrupted stevens

  no idea replied richmond with a
cursory glance probably some romantic

fool like yourself you would have been
in this two-spot revolution if  hadnt talked
to you like a dutch uncle young un avoid
excitement mental or physical-thats the
first rule in the tropics it applies to every-
thing even when it may not seem to take
the matter of taking a chance and drinking
some unboiled water its the excitement of
wondering if youll get fever that youve got

to avoid there now take this case-

  say look over there stevens inter-
rupted the other mans drawling harangue
upon his favorite subject to point at another
detachment of soldiers passing through the
plaza what do you make of that

  this squad was under the command of a
much be-medaled officer who preserved bet-
ter discipline than the others had shown
in the center of the detachment walked a
lone prisoner a girl she wore the non-
descript skirt and blouse of a low class wo-
man of the poorer part of the city but it
needed no second glance to show that she
did not belong in them

  every inch of her five and a half feet
spoke of family good breeding and edu-
cation she held herself haughtily erect
staring coldly past her guards her clothes
were somewhat disordered as if she had
resisted her captors and her long hair-hair
of a particularly beautiful and lustrous
black-fell down behind her hands were
tied hard together behind her back with a
piece of rope the end of which was held by
one of her guards

  the squad halted for a moment and the
girl drooped wearily and closed her eyes
richmond whistled softly

  well ill be -he said its

bianca

  bianca

  the one and only daughter of old miguel
beola himself the hombre who started this
four flush of a revolution if you want my
guess i think she is that young mounted
officer you admired so much in this after-
noons fracas

  you mean that that girl commanded the
rear guard

  yep she has done lots of worse things
than that you dont know her little ways
take it from me chico bianca is a very
unusual girl

  richmond studied the bottom of his glass
as though wondering whether to say more

  they say she is the real head and brains
of the revolution she certainly has the


el carcel



empire complex if you get me has a great
desire for power and wants to rule and all
that sort of thing

  good- shes beautiful exclaimed

the impressionable stevens staring hard at
the girl who drooped so wearily in her bonds
say old-timer find out for me what they
are going to do with her

  slow and easy drawled richmond
without moving why all the rush and
curiosity youll find out eventually

	well if you dont go and ask that general
or whatever he is commanding her guards
i will i feel sorry for the girl

  look out for that feeling its treacher-
ous and stay right where you are chico
ill go

  richmond drew his lanky frame protest-
ingly upright and ambled across the plaza

bianca raised her head and
glanced around moving her
bound hands in an attempt to
ease the tightness of the encircling
cords her eyes met those of stevens and
he read the entreaty in her glance the
blood rushed to his face and he found him-
self blushing unreasonably he tried to
make reassuring signs but stopped and be-
came suddenly interested in his cigar when
a couple of the soldiers noticed and began
to stare at him

  the detachment moved on bianca look-
ing back at stevens as she was lead away
richmond returned and told the other what
he had been able to learn don miguel had
escaped into the mountains with a few com-
panions bianca had been caught because
she delayed to change into womans cloth-
ing she was to be tried for treason along
with the rest of the prisoners

  and what then asked stevens

  oh shell probably be found guilty and
sentenced to be shot sometime tomor-
row

  good- man we cant let them do

that we have got to help her

  slow and easy i said she would be sen-
tenced but i didnt say she would actually
be shot her old man got away and be-
sides they have rich friends el presidente
will probably issue a stay of execution or
something and give them a chance to
ransom her

  further conversation was interrupted by
another voice speaking in english a sort
of hoarse whisper

  do you boys feel inclined to win the
undying gratitude of timothy burke

  the two stared at each other and then
looked around without being able to locate
the speaker then stevens happened to
glance at the body of the red-headed ma-
chine-gunner and saw that one eye had
opened

  yes its me whispered burke moving
his lips with difficulty because of the clotted
blood little tim isnt dead yet not quite
how about helping me get somewhere before
the soldados come back for my carcase
sure its a man of your own race i am and
a good poker player too i can even do
some card tricks youll not be leaving
me here to be picked up and shot by a
bunch of dirty spigs

  burke had not moved a muscle except for
his lips and none of the few other people
in the europa or strolling through the plaza
had noticed the whispered dialogue rich-
mond gripped stevens shoulder with his
bony hand

  you sit still ill manage this

  his tone was crisp and incisive for once
stevens saw him lay aside his habitual poise
of lazy indolent cynicism

  richmond strode quickly over to a row
of battered coaches that stood in line in
front of the casino espanol picked one that
had its top up and shook the driver into
wakefulness the coach drove up at the
side of the europa stopping at richmonds
direction directly in line with the spot where
burke was again giving his best imitation
of a very dead corpse richmond again
seized stevens by the shoulder

  go out there in the middle of the street
he said in a fierce whisper and attract their
attention- act drunk or crazy or preach
a sermon or kill yourself or something but
attract their attention vayase

  stevens walked out in front of the europa
and began to shout and stagger around
drunkenly don faustino and the few pa-
trons in the cafe glanced up in surprize a
moment muttered borracho americano
and turned away

  stevens realized he must do something
more startling in his college days he had
been considered a fine cheer leader but
there in the gathering dusk in the plaza of
a little central american city that had
never heard of cheer leaders he surpassed
himself

  he gave in rapid succession all the cheers


adventure

 of his college accompanying each with the
 regulation motions and adding a number of
 original ones thought up on the spur of the
 moment not the least of these latter was
 to stamp a perfectly good panama hat into
 a shapeless mass faustino and the rest
 came to the edge of the side walk to watch
 in amazement and even the driver of the
 coach twisted in his seat and craned his neck
 to watch

   this gave burke his chance he got to
 i his feet staggered quickly over to the coach
 with richmonds assistance and climbed
 into the back seat where he immediately lost
 consciousness again richmond climbed in
 beside him no one had seen except the
 watchful stevens

   the coach was of the type to be found in
 any small latin american city which are
 presumably manufactured second hand at
 the start at least a few men living have
 ever seen a really new one it had two
 seats facing each other and when burke
 collapsed on the seat in the back he was
 well concealed in the shadows of the hood
 particularly since it was beginning to get
 dark richmond shouted to the driver and
 the coach drove rapidly away

   when the coach had gone from sight
 stevens reentered the europa leaving the
 wreck of his panama in the street he
 passed through the cafe conscious of the
 stern glance of don faustino and realizing
 that his heroic measures had probably lost
 him the respect of that worthy and climbed
 up to his room

   he threw open the tall shutters and went
 out on the balcony for a final smoke before
 dinner the short tropical twilight was fast
 coming to an end the street lamps in the
 plaza were lit and a few stars had appeared
 a gentle breeze blew in from seaward and
 carried the deep note of some steamer
 whistling for a pilot at the bar

   the rich-toned bronze bells of the cathe-
 dral began to peal softly chiming with a
 rapid beat very different from the tolling
 of northern church bells a few women in
 light dresses strolled slowly arm in arm
 around the center of the plaza and an old
 crone selling lottery tickets hobbled toward
 the europa an itinerant vender of yumi-
 tas-little balls of coconut meat with raw
 sugar poured over them-walked slowly up
 the street of the fourth of june crying his
 wares from time to time in a high-pitched
 droning sing-song it was one of those mo-

 ments when time seems to stop and the
 pulse slows down and the mind is content
 to stop functioning and merely drink in the
 surroundings the moss-covered bronze
 bells continued to chime softly

  stevens was possessed by a great feeling
of contentment he felt that in spite of
cynics the tropics had all that was claimed
for them they had beauty romance and
adventure the dirt and disease and cor-
ruption were there too but it was possible
to overlook them

  he felt a great sympathy for the un-
fortunate girl he had seen led to captivity
or worse sympathy of that dangerous sort
that is likely to grow into a stronger feeling
it should be mentioned that stevens was
really very young plans for her escape
began to form in his mind vague nebulous
plans that were abandoned while still half-
formed he wondered how old she was if
she spoke english what she was like in
short stevens was rapidly losing that calm
aloofness so greatly esteemed by richmond

         s 

     ea stevens ate dinner in the eu-
 sr ropa with the collector of cus-
toms who happened to be one
larue a frenchman larue
found him poor company silent and self-
engrossed one minute talking excitedly the
next stevens finished his meal in a hurry
declined an invitation to play vingt et un
and walked down the avenida indepen-
dencia to the consulate

  the consulate a former private house
was a limestone one-story building similar
to any other house on the street its par-
ticular color scheme was purple and green
with fancy brown tiles set in the front wall
for a distance of about four feet up from the
pavement the place looked deserted but
after stevens had knocked softly a few times
the small door that formed part of the big
one was opened by richmond himself he
warned the newcomer to be quiet saying
that the wounded burke was asleep in one
of the back rooms

  how is he asked stevens

  oh hes right enough a bullet through
the fleshy part of one arm and a mere knock
on the head dont mean much to a young
hombre as husky as he seems to be i
washed his wounds and put him to bed and
he slid right off to sleep

   did the cab driver see you bring him in
   no as soon as he stopped in front of
el carcel



this place i sent him around the corner to
buy some cigarillos and carried burke in
while he was away nearly wrecked me
too the young irisher weighs more than
i do

  stevens looked thoughtfully at rich-
mond and then grinned

  how about that avoid excitement stuff
you are always pulling here you have
sheltered a man for whom the whole army
is probably searching right now is that
the restful caution you preached to me

  richmond seemed somewhat embar-
rassed he refused to meet the other
mans eye and began to fill his pipe after
a pause he spoke without looking up

  pues he drawled we all do-fool

things now and then i couldnt quite sit
there and let the soldados come along and

find out that the poor-wasnt dead and

then complete the job what are you grin-
ging at anyway

  sure answered stevens grinning even
more broadly dont apologize i under-
stand now i have got something else for
you to do something youll enjoy

  yeah

  stevens was suspicious they had come
into the patio and he now slouched into a
chair and put his feet on the coping of the
long-dried-up fountain

  what is it

  you are going to help me rescue the
beautiful senorita bianca beola from what-
ever castle cave or dungeon she is con-
fined in

  tell that to the rurales growled the
other ive been a fool once today and
thats enough i knew those dark eyes of
biancas would have that effect on you
they always do i suppose you think youre
in love with her already they ought to
shut that girl up somewhere shes dan-
gerous

 how do you mean	r

  i mean youve not the first young hombre
to start feeling sympathetic and protective
toward her shed twist you around her
finger young un what that girl wants
she gets and she doesnt give a hoot in

-how she gets it either now she

wants to be the big push in this country
so she started a war to put her old man in

power and rule through him - help

pelayo with her against him dont worry
about her chico have a drink and for-
get it

  youre a sour pessimistic cross-grained
misanthrope i dont believe it

  youll learn chico youll learn
considering this warning as more of
richmonds habitual pose stevens laughed
forgot it and renewed his request after
half an hour of eloquent persuasion he final-
ly got richmond to admit grudgingly that
he might help if the other could think up a
plan that looked practical stevens was
satisfied that this meant he could count on
richmond to see it through and they im-
mediately went into a conference on ways
and means

  naturally the first thing was to find out
where bianca was imprisoned and what was
likely to happen to her richmond started
off to the military headquarters in the fort
to interview coronel perez as american
consul richmond might conceivably ask
questions without arousing undue suspicion

  stevens was smoking and trying to make
something out of a spanish newspaper when
he heard a noise behind him he spun
around to find burke in the doorway the
irishman was very weak and hung on the
door frame for support but he grinned
cheerfully 

  you go back to bed commanded
stevens

  not till i give ye the thanks of the
worlds most curious man i mention the
curiosity so that youll be telling me who it
is that has sheltered me and what it is you
would be after doing with me

  what do you think we intend doingwith
you asked stevens with a smile

  the other feigned deep thought

  well he said if its cannibalism youll
find im too tough to be of use and if its
ransom youll find im too poor to be of use
and if its that you want murder done youll
find im too chicken-hearted

  stevens reassured him on all three points
and again tried to persuade him to return
to bed

  i hope you dont mind my asking said
burke as he turned away but i wanted
tobe sure i once had a man help me in
new york when some police were after mt
and when he had gotten me safely away he
stuck a gun in my ear handed me a bomb
and started to march me off to blow up the
government or something i threw him in
the river but it made me a cautious man
with his fears at rest burke went back to
bed where he fell asleep again in spite of a


adventure

slight fever from his wound nearly two
hours had passed and stevens was beginning
to worry when he heard richmond unlock
the front door on entering the consul
threw his hat in the corner sat down ele-
vated his feet to the table and reached for
the inevitable pipe

  well what took you so long demanded
the younger man

  went first to the fort learned that el
coronel was at the car cel-the jail yknow-
and chased over there he kept me waiting

twenty minutes-his hide

  well

  well i saw him and inquired about
bianca he said she had been tried and
sentenced to be shot at noon tomorrow i
asked him why the departure from the con-
ventional sunrise but he only looked blank
guess he never goes to the movies

  and then what

  then i protested in the name of human-
ity and chivalry and so on and asked for a
stay of execution because bianca has ameri-
can blood in her he granted it all right
but he made it out such a favor im sure he
was going to do it anyway he wouldnt
shoot a girl with such rich friends perez
is no fool

  did you find out where they are keeping
her

  yes he even let me see her for a
couple of minutes i found her pretty well
tired out but otherwise in good shape she
is in the sixth cell on the upper floor i
can spot it from the outside

  there was a pause and then richmond
spoke more slowly

  i think el coronel suspects something
hes a wise old bird and its seldom anybody
gives him any flannel pesetas when we
went to her cell she wasnt fettered but as
we left he remarked that he was going to
put her in chains tomorrow dont believe
he had thought of it before from the way
he smiled i think it was just his way of say-
ing he didnt trust me we have got to
look out for him

burkes temperature was
down and he was in fair condi-
tion the next morning but it
was decided he had better stay
quiet inside the consulate for at least an-
other day before any attempt was made to
smuggle him out of santa clara

  they found him light hearted and talk-

ative willing and able to discourse for hours
on almost any subject except himself he
would talk of his adventures but not of his
home or origin he also did innumerable

card tricks and other sleight-of-hand stunts
and was even given to reciting poetry at
times

  once he started to sing but after one
stanza richmond threw a pair of boots at
him and said that he was getting old and
that his nerves were not very strong
burke took this in good part evidently he
was used to having his singing received in
that manner the other two talked him
over and decided they could count on his
help in the affair of bianca although they
had not as yet spoken to him about it

   about the middle of the morning stevens
and richmond started out to look over the
eared the restless burke having sworn pic-
turesque oaths that he would keep his red
head indoors they strolled along the
avenida independencia richmond seeming
rather preoccupied once he took advan-
tage of the act of fighting his pipe to glance
over his shoulder and another time he took
a bunch of keys from his pocket and deliber-
ately dropped them glancing back as he
stooped to pick them up

  when they reached the plaza he sug-
gested a drink at the bar of the europa as
they leaned on the tall bar of light native
mahogany he suddenly pointed to the mir-
ror in front of them

  dont turn around he said quietly
just look in the mirror see that particu-
larly soiled peon in a blue shirt leaning
against the third lamp post

  yes

   he has been following us ever since we
left the consulate guess perez put him on
our trail i was right about el coronel sus-
pecting something the sooner we think
up a plan and carry it out the better we
will have to lose that bare-footed sleuth
before we do anything else though

   they drained their glasses of bacardi and
turned away passing close by their shadow
without a glance instead of heading to-
ward the carcel which was in the upper part
of the city they walked down calle simon
bolivar toward the water front arriving
at the docks they began to walk very
quickly circling around or dodging through
warehouses and twice doubling back on
their tracks at the end of fifteen minutes
of this hide and seek their peon was not to
el carcel



be seen and they immediately headed up
toward the part of the city beyond the plaza
the quarter where the houses straggle up the
hill sides and the streets run steep and nar-
row

  in the early days of santa clara the con-
vent of santa eulalia had been a prosperous
thriving nunnery set on the hill side above
the town when the buccaneers sacked the
town the more fortunate nuns fled back into
the jungles where most of them died of the
fever some of them stayed but they did
not live the sea wolves used the roomy
walled building as their headquarters the
walls of the convent rocked to the lilt of
coarse ballads where before there had been
only softly chanted psalms and the chapel
saw scenes of horror that are best forgotten

  the buccaneers stripped the place of
everything of value and left the building
little more than an empty shell after
this desecration the pious citizens consid-
ered the convent unfit for further religious
purposes and it became a barracks for
the last sixty or seventy-five years it had
been the prison el eared its original purpose
almost forgotten

  the slow tread of the jailers echoed in the
long corridors and many civil and political
offenders disappeared behind the high en-
circling wall and never reappeared the
blank north wall of the patio was pitted by
the impact of many volleyed bullets and
the dark cells of the underground tier had
held the answer to more than one puzzling
mystery of central american politics

  with the passing of the years the city had
extended up the hillside until it now reached
well beyond el carcel the houses en-
croached close upon the outer walls along
the east ran calle altagracia a bare fifteen
feet wide from the wall of the prison to the
fronts of the houses on the opposite side of
the street these houses were mostly one
story in height narrow but long the front
forbidding with their big wooden doors and
two or three barred and shuttered windows
the life of the inhabitants centering around
the long patios inside now and then there
was a house of a newer type of construc-
tion-two storied with a sort of columned
portico in front

  as the two americans strolled slowly
along calle altagracia they could just see
the tops of the windows of the second tier of
cells everything below that being hidden by
the outer surrounding wall the street

seemed deserted except for a few children
playing in the dust and a chinese vender of
vegetables going from house to house with
his two baskets slung on a pole but they
were careful to avoid seeming too interested
in the prison richmond spoke softly
her window is the sixth on this side that
one right there theres about a ten foot
space between this wall and the building
itself the sentries patrol that space inci-
dentally this wall has a lovely crop of
broken glass set in mortar at the top

  the two men had reached the end of the
prison wall at which point the narrow street
made a sharp turn

  looks like a pretty tough nut to crack
chico drawled richmond set that ac-
tive brain of yours to work and forget
all about the main front gate its too well
guarded

  yes it looks bad agreed stevens but
there must be someway out-i mean in
he glanced around

  nobody seems to have noticed us lets
walk by again on our way back

they walked slowly past the
s long gray wall of the carcel once
kl more and then started back to
the consulate they went in
silence both busy on the problem and
about half way back stevens stopped sud-
denly

  i have it he said excitedly listen
the house directly across the street from
her cell is the two-storied type and the bal-
cony of the second floor is right on a level
with the top of the wall the street is so
narrow that we should be able to bridge it
easily with a couple of long planks or a lad-
der that house was shut up and looked
as if the people were away we ought to be
able to burglarize our way in

  carrying a couple of ladders in your hip
pocket

- dont be a wet blanket we can get
around that some way

  richmond offered some more objections
but finally agreed that the plan might work
if they could devise some way of getting a
ladder or some long planks to the house it
would cause suspicion if they tried to do it
themselves and they didnt want to take
anyone else except burke into their confi-
dence

  on returning to the consulate they told
burke of their plans and he instantly agreed


adventure

to help he seemed to find some secret
humor in the situation and was observed
chuckling to himself at intervals he sug-
gested that they take the chance of finding
something to use as a bridge after getting in
the house but they decided this was too un-
certain at last richmond wrote a note to
a local hardware merchant using a page
torn from a note book as might be done by
a man in a hurry he disguised his writing
making it look as much like the ornate
latin style as possible and signed himself
miguel espinosa

  he wrote that he don miguel espinosa
had just rented a house in calle altagracia
and desired a ladder he inclosed the
money saying that he had called when the
store was closed and that the ladder was to
be left on the front porch if no one was
home they did not know whose house it
was but the risk of its belonging to a reg-
ular customer of the merchant in question
seemed slight stevens carried the letter
around about noon at which time the stores
were closed for the mid-day interval and
pushed it under the door of the hardware
store the plan had its disadvantages
but they were unable to think of a better
one and the fact that perez was having
them shadowed indicated the need for
quick action

  richmond and burke ate dinner in the
consulate but they thought it best for
stevens to dine at the europa as usual
immediately afterwards he went over to
the consulate he had eaten little the
thrill of approaching danger having robbed
him of his appetite the irish in burke
had made him react in the same way but
richmond seemed to think no more of jail
breaking than of a trip to the cine

  they sat around waiting for it to get late
for a while they tried to play poker but
were unable to keep their minds on it and
quit when stevens threw down four kings
under the mistaken apprehension that three
deuces would beat them after that they
simply sat around and talked burke told
an endless string of adventures claiming to
have been everything from a chinese river
pirate to a new york cop as each yarn
was more striking and as he could not pos-
sibly have crowded so much into some
twenty-six or twenty-seven years the others
were unimpressed

  about ten oclock richmond knocked out
his pipe remarking that it was time to get

ready all three put on ragged clothing
and large battered sombreros secured that
afternoon they could not have passed in
the daytime but it was a good enough dis-
guise at night street lighting in santa
clara is mainly conspicuous by its absence
and the moon was past the full

  half an hour later they slipped quietly
out the door they were prepared to lose
any of perez men that followed but they
soon became convinced that they were not
shadowed whether this was because of
the failure of the attempt to shadow them
earlier in the day or because of the lateness
of the hour it was impossible to say all
three had flashlights and stevens carried a
couple of coarse files and a jimmy wrapped
up in an old gunny sack burke had a re-
volver and a coil of light rope while the lean
richmond was unrecognizably fat with the
bulk of a half-dozen empty sacks wrapped
around his body beneath his outer clothes

  they circled the plaza where there was
the most chance of meeting some one and
followed devious back ways toward the
carcel no one was passed on the way ex-
cept a solitary policia who gave them no
more than an idle glance as they went
by at last they stood at the foot of calle
altagracia the street of high grace it
stretched before them like a shallow canon
with the blackness of erebus in its depths
and the light of a waning moon still shining
on the upper parts of the houses on the side
opposite el carcel

  neither light nor movement was there
only the breeze rustling the palm fronds and
the occasional rattle of a shutter the
thick dust was a soft unseen carpet beneath
their feet it was as unreal as a dream and
the three stopped in their tracks rich-
mond was the first to throw off the spell
and then he started on the others followed

  ahead of them loomed the dark bulk of
the carcel when the street intersection at
the near end of the wall was reached burke
stopped and leaned against the wall in the
shadow the other two continued in si-
lence and when they came to the house op-
posite biancas cell they saw that a long
ladder lay against the front wall
f stevens stopped at the house while rich-
mond continued to the turn of the street at
the far end of the prison wall where he took
a quick look around and then pressed the
button of his flashlight for an instant

  seeing this alls well signal stevens
el carcel



took the jimmy and inserted the edge in the
crack of the door prying at it and trying to
get the most force with the least noise in
a little over a minute something gave way
and the door swung open a couple of inches
he pushed it wide wondering if the prison
guards could possibly help hearing the creak
of the hinges and waited

  nothing moved either inside the house or
elsewhere so he stepped out into the street
and gave a single flash of his pocket lamp in
each direction burke and richmond came
up on the run their sandaled feet making
no sound in the thick dust

  they lifted the ladder and carried it in-
side closing the door after them the
screws of the lock had been ripped loose
when stevens forced the door but there was
an extra bolt and this they slid into place

the circling beam of rich-
monds flashlight removed any
lingering doubt about the house
being unoccupied as the furni-
ture was covered with white cloths and the
dust lay thick on everything immedi-
ately before them was the vestibule cut
off from the rest of the house by a white
painted iron grille work the gate in which
stood open

  beyond was the parlor and then the
patio the house was rather large and the
pieces of furniture though of tropical few-
ness were expensive while burke held a
flashlight the other two carried the ladder
out into the patio and leaned it up against
the second floor windows this being an
easier method then trying to navigate the
stairs with it they then climbed the
stairs and went into the front room that
gave onto the upper balcony this balcony
being supported by the columns of the por-
tico richmond peered between the slats
of the shutters

  the moon still hits the upper part of the
house he said we had better wait ten
minutes or so

  they squatted on the smooth tiles of the
floor occasionally talking in low tones
while burke smoked nervously as he
ground out a cigaret stub with the handle of
the jimmy he muttered-

  - it i dont like the feel of this

place

  why not

  there is somebody else in the house
  have you heard anything

  not a sound but i can feel them

theres somebody here

  bunk irish imagination

  irish- i can tell

  bunk

  suit yourself im going to look around
burke catfooted down the stairs and
they heard faint sounds from below a few
minutes later he returned

  find anything asked richmond

  not a thing i guess theres no one
there but this place sure feels funny

  they sat in silence for the rest of the
time it was dead quiet except for the
sighing of the night wind and they could
even hear the sentry go by in the prison
yard across the way richmond timed
him noting that it was about ten minutes
before he went by again when the slow
lagging tread of the guard had died out for
the second time they softly folded back the
shutters of the front windows

  they got the ladder from the patio car-
ried it through the house to the front and
began to push it over the porch rail end
first this was accomplished without noise
but not without difficulty near the end
all three had to keep their entire weight on
the short end to counteract the leverage of
the twelve feet or so that extended out into
the air panting and straining they shoved
it forward inch by inch and at last the far
end rested on top of the prison wall fifteen
feet away across the street the wall was
less than a foot higher than the balcony rail
and the ladder was nearly horizontal

  they had agreed that stevens was the
one to cross the ladder he had insisted
on it from the first as the whole expedition
had been his idea and he seemed the logical
one aside from that

  burkes wounded arm prevented him from
doing anything quite so active and rich-
mond was well past his first youth stevens
thrust his flashlight into one pocket and
the two files into another took the pile
of empty gunny sacks which had been
made up into a bundle and climbed onto
the ladder pushing the gunnies in front
he crawled across the ladder creaking
slightly but showing itself plenty strong
enough for the task

  the ten-foot space between the wall and
el carcel itself was lighted by a couple of
smoky lanterns hung from iron spikes
these lanterns having little effect on the
deep gloom left by the setting of the moon
o

adventure

there was no one in sight nor were there
any lights in the prison windows

  stevens squatted on the ladder and piled
the gunny sacks on the wall beside him
thus forming a thick protecting pad over the
jagged broken glass that was set in the
mortar climbing over on to the pad he
began to pull on the ladder the other
two had tied one end of their rope to their
end of the ladder and they paid out slowly
as he pulled preventing any sudden jerk
as the end slipped off the balcony rail
it was ticklish work but stevens was able
to slide the ladder across the wall till its
far end rested on the sill of the barred win-
dow of the girls cell he crawled across
to the sill and listened

  everything seemed quiet inside the prison
except for a man muttering in his sleep in
one of the nearby cells there appeared
to be no guards in the corridor stevens
called softly

  miss beola senorita

  there was no answer and he called again
a little louder

 senoritai bianca

  he heard the creaking of a bed spring and
then a soft voice replied

  que pasa quien es

  he thrilled at the sound of her voice
rich clear and musical

  we are friends come to help you escape
can you come to the window

  no i am chained to the wall here now
i know you you are that nice young
american with the sympathetic eyes i saw
in the plaza

  this showed a remarkable power of per-
ception of biancas part inasmuch as it
was certainly too dark for her to be able
to see his features as richmond had re-
marked she was a remarkable girl in more
ways than one

  i have a file here that you can use on
your chains will there be danger of any-
body noticing if i turn my flashlight on
you a minute so i can see where to throw
the file

  no there are no guards in the hall-
ways

  stevens wrapped the extra file in a piece
torn from his shirt and then turned on his
flashlight bianca was standing near the
far wall rubbing the sleep from her eyes and
smiling adorably what little of stevens
affection she did not already have went out
to her when he saw that smile he noted

the gleam of metal at her wrists and then
the fight flashed from the slender steel
chain that joined them he threw the file
the cloth-wrapped metal falling soundlessly
at her feet and immediately snapped off
the light a moment later the soft rasp
of her file told him that she was at work on
her fetters

the window bars were closely
placed and he saw that he would
have to remove three to get her
out the bars were as old as
el carcel itself and the coarse file bit deep
at every stroke he passed his left arm
around one of the bars to steady himself and
filed away with both hands

  the minutes went by and his eyes grew
more used to the blackness little by little
his file cut through the bar and the rasp of
biancas file kept pace with his

  stevens had just cut through the base
of one bar when he heard a jingle inside the
cell and a low exclamation from bianca
the next moment she was at the window

  are you free he whispered

  not entirely she replied feel and
she put her hands in his

  stevens found that she was still chained
wrist to wrist an eighteen-inch piece of
chain connecting the steel cuffs

  i filed the chain holding me to the
wall she continued now i will help
you with the bars we can remove these
others later

  as she put her file to the bar stevens saw
the sentry appear around the distant corner
of the building they stopped filing and
stevens crouched motionless on the sill
bianca slid one of her hands into his and
he felt her trembling with excitement the
sentry sauntered carelessly along with his
rifle under his arm he was evidently in
the habit of enjoying a smoke on this por-
tion of his beat and the close attention he
gave to his cigaret kept him from noticing
the ladder stretched across above him or the
still figure on the window sill

  when the sentry had passed the two files
again began their work bianca continued
the whispered conversation

  what do we do when the bars are out

  use this ladder to get across the street
into that house two friends are waiting
there we will hide you in-in the house
of one of us until we get a chance to smuggle
you out on some friendly steamer
el carcel



  that will be fine

  she was silent for a few minutes

  you are very brave to do this

  stevens denied the accusation in a violent
and somewhat incoherent whisper

  oh yes you are she continued i
will not forget and my friends will not
forget for i still have friends friends
who had not been hunted down by that
evil-hearted vulture

 she spat on the floor stevens was
startled this did not quite fit in with the
gentle-natured girl he had been imagin-
ing

 who

  el presidente jose maria pelayo she
oronounced the name with deep bitterness

  the man who is at this time president
of my unfortunate country you are a
new-comer you do not realize what a
fiend he is i hate him i hate him more
than i thought it possible to hate anybody
i would not trust myself to see him for i
should probably try to kill him woman
though i am

  to stevens there again came the vague
realization that bianca was not quite the
gentle helpless girl he had expected to find
her seeing her in battle should have
meant more to him than it had

  the sentry came around once more before
they were through and again passed with-
out noticing anything they were nearing
the end of their task when they heard the
roar of an automobile driven fast and with
open cut-out it shot down calle alta-
gracia turned the corner with a squeal of
brakes and apparently came to a stop in
front of the prison gates whether or not
this was because the occupants of the car
had noticed the end of the ladder protrud-
ing over the prison wall they did not know
they heard the hoarse stridency of the
motor horn followed by the cry of a sentry
calling out the guard

 quick quick whispered bianca
someone has come something is happen-
ing hurry 

  all three bars were cut through at the
bottom and one was nearly severed at the
top stevens laid down his file and grasped
that bar just above the lower cut pulling
with the combined strength of arms back
and legs the weakened bar gave easily
and bianca took it and laid it on the cell
floor the second bar was another matter
and bianca lent her strength to his the

soft old metal gave way slowly under the
strain and the bar bent upward and out-
ward the corridor lights were suddenly
switched on the glow from the door fighting
up the cell

 hurry hurry bianca whispered
again stevens hands were bleeding and
his vision was blurred the terrific strain
set the blood pounding at his temples the
last bar was the hardest it seemed made of
tougher metal than its fellows somehow
they bent it enough for bianca to slip out
onto the ladder

  they crawled along to the wall and
crouched on the pile of gunny sacks rich-
mond and burke watching from across the
way had seen the corridor lights go on and
sensed the danger as stevens and the
girl left the ladder for the gunnies the other
two hauled in on the rope till the end of
the ladder again rested on the balcony rail
the rungs rattled noisily as they were
dragged over the jagged glass on top of the
wall but speed was now more important
than silence

  bianca crawled across to the house
slightly hampered by her chains stevens
gathered up the sacks and heard a shout
behind him as some one opened the door of
the rifled cell he ran across the ladder on
the rungs without holding on and jumped
down beside richmond who immediately
shoved the ladder off the rail so that it fell
clattering to the street below the two
of them ran inside slamming the shutters
as they did so and found bianca and burke
in each others arms

  they told me you were dead amor
mio she was saying

  not a bit of it acushla burkes
brogue was strong under the stress of emo-
tion their whole - army couldnt

kill me with you in trouble

  stevens stopped short and the joy and
excitement of adventure faded leaving
him conscious of his torn and bleeding
hands and feeling tired and somehow old
he now understood burkes secret mirth
when asked to do them a favor by helping
rescue bianca

  for -s sake let that stuff wait

snapped richmond its pretty dark
but they probably saw us come in here
our only chance is to get out of the house
before they can send a squad out the gate
and around into this street come on

  richmond leading they went down the


adventure

  stairs at full speed and came to the vesti-
  bule grille-work the gate in the grating
  was closed and locked

    this was wide open when we went up-
  stairs richmond swore under his breath
  and its not a snap lock somebody has
  been here

    i told you there was some one in the
  house put in burke

    how about the back door if there is
  one

    stevens turned toward the back of the
  house they crossed the patio jerked
  open a door and stepped through there
  came the click of a switch and they found
  themselves standing in a brightly lighted
  room a thick-set man in uniform rose to
  his feet smiling with apparent cordiality as
  he covered them with an automatic

    come in senorita and you caballeros
  he said my house is honored by your
  visit

    there was mockery in the tone and words
  bianca was staring at him wide-eyed

    coronel perez she gasped is this
  your house

    it is that of my wifes brother-at your
  service continued the swarthy command-
  ant of the garrison i have been expecting
  you for some time i pass by every day
  to be sure the house is undisturbed and the
  presence of an unexpected ladder was-how

	do you say-food for thought i flatter
  myself i guessed your plan very quickly

    stevens suddenly laughed burke swore
  and bianca glared in silence at this point
  stevens realized that richmond was not
  with them that he had not entered the
  room at all and this gave him new hope
  perez was enjoying himself immensely
  he continued in the same mocking tone
  you will be wondering why i allowed you
  to escape from el carcel at all i will be
  frank with you so that there will be no mis-
  understanding if there is to be a ransom
  i prefer that it come to me he noticed
  the blood dripping from stevens hands
  are you hurt

    nothing to speak of i tore my hands
  a little pulling at the bars when we heard
  that auto arrive and things began to happen
  in the prison

   auto what auto

    amazement showed plainly on the face
  of el coronel amazement and fear but be-
  fore stevens could answer him there came
  the crash of many rifle butts on the front

door of the house perez jaw dropped and
he looked around wildly the door al-
ready weakened by stevens earjier efforts
with the jimmy gave way almost at once
and the invaders attacked the inner grille-
work perez hurled aside the table and
leaped for the door but burke tripped him
neatly saying-

  were in the same boat now my lad
just as perez got to his feet again a half
dozen soldiers led by a tall black-bearded
man in civilian clothes burst into the room
there was a moment of silence and then
perez pulled himself together and saluted

  i-i di not know you were coming
senor he said

  so i have gathered replied the other
grimly i did not intend you to have
the kindness to hand me your pistol

  perez was evidently considering a refusal
but the rifles of the soldiers menaced him
and he obeyed sulkily

  i learned of the plot to rescue the girl
and wished to do my duty by preventing
it myself

  as to that we shall see you are under
arrest

  perez shrugged his shoulders

  as el presidente wishes

  at the entrance of this man bianca had
started so violently that her chains rattled
and stared at him with parted lips if she
had been surprised at seeing perez she was
now infinitely more so

  presidente pelayo she said at last
  he bowed gravely

  i have the honor-or should one say
misfortune i take it that you are that
rebel leader of whom i have heard so much
and whom i drove down from the capitol
to see

  bianca did not reply but continued to
study him thoughtfully

  it was four days later and
stevens and burke had shared a
t cell in the carcel during that
period without seeing anyone
except the guard who brought them the
rice and fried plantains they received once
a day opinion about richmond was
divided

  im telling you he got away burke was
saying he wasnt with us when bianca
and you and i went bursting on perez like
a pack of baboons

  but if he got away why hasnt he tried
el carcel



to see us or help us in some way and
how could he have gotten away anyway
as to the latter my lad youll remember
that he was still trying to open the grating
when the rest of us walked into perez little
trap it would have been easy for him to
slip upstairs when the soldados arrived

  i suppose so

  sure and as for not trying to help us
how do you know he hasnt is it that you
expect him to sing ballads outside our
window maybe they wouldnt let him
see us

  conversation lapsed for a while and then
stevens said thoughtfully-

  i wonder what they have done with
bianca

  take no originality to yourself for
that i have been doing some wondering
myself

  we heard the sound of a firing squad
day before yesterday

  thatd be perez not bianca

  how do you know

  because there was death in the eyes of
el presidente when he looked at perez and
there was something very different when he
looked at bianca the skunk

  i am worried about her though she
seemed terribly bitter against pelayo as
much as said she would try to kill him if
she got half a chance its a bad thing
when a woman hates like that burke
she may try to kill him or something and
you cant tell what they may do to her
burkes position was simple he loved
bianca he had joined the revolution be-
cause of her he believed that she loved him
and as soon as he got out he was going to
make another attempt to rescue and marry
her this he maintained with arguments
profanity and fists

  stevens position was a trifle more com-
plex but equally deep-seated in his heart
he felt that he had a prior claim as having
almost certainly loved bianca generations
ago when the world was young of this
however he did not speak to burke he
contented himself with maintaining that
he had loved bianca since he first saw her in
the plaza and that their conversation be-
tween the bars indicated that she felt the
same way toward him

  sometime the next morning their cell
door opened and richmond walked in
making sure that the guard who admitted
him had retired out of hearing the two be-

sieged him with eager questions he an-
swered some of them briefly ignoring others
with a curious reserve

  as they had guessed he had been a little
behind and had not walked into perez
trap when the soldiers started battering
down the door he had retired to the second
floor staying there till things quieted
down he had come to the carcel inquiring
about stevens saying that don faustino of
the europa had reported his disappearance
but they had denied all knowledge of the
young americano he could not do more
without incriminating himself and had had
to be content with inquiring twice a day for
trace of the missing man this time they
had admitted him

  but how about bianca inquired the
other two eagerly

  bianca is all right said richmond
slowly staring at the floor she has been
released

  hot snakes then all i have to do is
get out of here find her and hunt for a
priest

  b urke was joyously effervescent stevens
regarded him sourly

  yes try and get away with it our
truce is off when we get out remember

  well you both get out in half an hour
interrupted richmond youve both been
released on condition you take the first ship
out which happens to be the carib empress
sailing this afternoon

  but suppose im not wanting to leave
said burke

  that wouldnt affect things in the slight-
est

  but i cant leave protested stevens
the fruit company-

  the company has already ordered you to
jamaica at pelayos request its no use
chicos youve both got to go

  in about half an hour the gate of el
carcel opened to let burke and stevens out
blinking in the bright sun they climbed into
a coach where richmond was already
waiting for them a squad of cavalry
closed in around the coach and it started
down toward the water front

  the city had the look of a fiesta the
houses being hung with flags and flowers
and the stores being closed there were
very few people on the streets but when
they came to the plaza they found their
way blocked by dense cheering crowds
a wedding was evidently taking place in


adventure

the cathedral and even as the coach
halted at the edge of the crowd the doors
of the cathedral were thrown wide and
the drawn sabres of the military escort lined
up outside flashed to the salute out from
the cathedral stepped presidente pelayo
himself bowing to the crowds and leaning
on his arm clad in the white robes of a
bride was bianca

  the coach rolled on in grim silence till
almost to the water front finally burke
relaxed crossed his legs and observed to
the world in general-

  well im-

how the brown

by viet

wiy are there no kodiak bear
on kuiu island of the alexan-
der archipelago in  southeastern
alaska it is strange there are
none because these enormous brown beasts
-no doubt the largest and most savage of
all living bears-are numerous on the ad-
jacent islands of baranoff and admiralty
which lie dose to it on the west and north
probably no white man either layman or
scientist can give you a satisfactory answer
but there is one man in alaska who knows
all about it if he can be induced to talk

  he is an old tyee-chief of the tlinket
tribe who sells furs seal hide moccasins and
curios to summer tourists his dingy frame
shack squats on the beach at the edge of
indian town where the big salmon river
empties into the head of the cove on
pleasant days he sits in the sun like a
wrinkled bronze buddha his wares spread
about him at the foot of the totem pole
which is carved with grotesque images de-
noting his family tree he has no brown
bear hide among his stock of pelts if you
ask for one he will probably say in the
chinook jargon halo alta-klonas winipie
not just now-later perhaps if urged
and you know him quite well he may even
tell you how the brown bears were banished
from kuiu island

  long long ago-according to chief
charley-there were lots of these bears on
kuiu at that time there were also many
tlinkets living on the island in fact al-

   then he grinned and slapped stevens on
 the back

   cheer up my lad he said were
 both young praise be and the world is wide  

   richmond smiled a twisted smile and
 gazed into space

   the path to power he muttered
 theres more than one way of getting what
 you want in this queer world bianca de-
 cided that the vamp was mightier than the
 volley

    but she sure is one little fast worker

   i always maintained bianca was an
 uunsual girl said richmond gravely

bears left kuiu

or shaw

 though it is a large island there were so
 many tlinkets and so many bears that
 they crowded and jostled each other be-
 yond endurance there was much quar-
 reling and fighting many tlinkets were
 killed because the bears were hyas solleks-
 very angry-and they were even bigger and
 stronger than they are now it was hyas
 nasahchie-very bad

   the trouble grew worse finally every
 one on the island gathered for a hyas wawa-
 big talk-to see what could be done about
 it the tlinkets on one side and the bears
 on the other as a result it was at last
 agreed that each side should pick out three
 of their greatest fighting chiefs and the mat-
 ter should be fought to a finish between
 them the losers to leave the island for good

   that was a wonderful battle it lasted
 for days raging up and down the island and
 back and forth across it the sound of
 battle cries and roaring echoed like thunder
 for a long time the issue was in doubt for
 the bears were very strong but the three
 tlinket chiefs were also shamans and when
 the bears made magic they wove spells and
 incantations

   in the end the tlinket medicine proved
 to be the most powerful it at last prevailed
 over the supernatural powers of the three
 bear chieftans and succeeded in killing
 them the agreement was then kept to
 the letter and every bear swam across the
 straits to admiralty and baranoff islands
 they never came back

 chapter i

 os a french officer

it was now coming on to be dark and
i perceived to my great consternation
that the army continued its march to-
ward hanau and made no attempt to
pursue the routed and dispirited french

 a party of us had been combing the
woods on the side toward the mountains
the spessartwald as it was called and i had
been left somewhat behind both because of
the trouble i had had in beating off a black
musketeer who had tried to pull me from
my horse and the weariness of that same
beast he had had the poorest of forage
for the last month and all this cutting and
stabbing this hounding of french guards
through the main and scouring about be-
tween river bank and woods had wearied
him exceedingly

  so as i have said seeing the army was
about to abandon the field where they had
been so lately victorious and it being ap-
parent that by nightfall the rearguard
would have passed through dettingen i
turned my horses head toward the plain and
rode back at a slow walk to the road

  it was then that i perceived what i at
first thought to be a man of ours since he
came mounted from the woods but as he
came into the plain and the last light of the
sun was upon him for a moment i discov-

the bold dragoon copyright  by leonard h nason 
  

ered him to be a frenchman one of the
grenadiers a cheval by his headgear and
an officer by the richness of his trappings
he rode slowly off away from me thinking
himself safe for our army was gone and he
had but to follow the road to aschaffenburg
where he would find the french for they
had a camp there to cut us off when we
should have been defeated before det-
tingen

  now monseer thinks i you should
have stayed holed in the woods a little
longer as it is you will shortly find your-
self lacking a horse for hugh bancroft
of ligoniers hath need of one

  thereupon i beat upon my horse with my
sword and dug him bravely with the spur
and got him into a shambling trot now
the frenchman must have perceived me
after a time for the failing light was at my
back and i black against it but he went his
way in peace for he thought to outdistance
me he showed no hurry nor did he seem
to urge his horse though in the last light i
could see him turn in the saddle and the
white of his face looking at me

  now he was upon the plain and i upon the
road and he thought that i could not come
up on him but i had passed by that very
road that morning with cannon-shot from
that same frenchmans guns on the far
bank of the main humming about my ears
when the discharge became heavy and we


adventure

began to go down horse and man i had
looked about me for a place of refuge and
had found one though happily had no use
for it but it was still there a deep ditch
through which flowed water from the hills
down to the main and the frenchman could
in no wise cross it but must follow it along
looking and hoping and cursing when he
did not find a crossing until he should come
to where i awaited him

  so it fell out it grew pit dark for the
moon was yet behind the hills and i could
hear him muttering and the grunting of his
horse and the creak of his saddle housings
and the jingling of his saber and aiguillettes
some time before he came out upon the
road here he stopped and let his horse
blow and so i came upon him

  hold said i and yield yourself pris-
oner surrender in the kings name

  i suppose i might have saved my breath
for he knew not a word that i said but
knowing that i was english he must have
got the sense of it howbeit he came at me
with a rush of hoofs and i being all una-
ware and dumfounded to find a monseer
with any fight in him-indeed they had
given themselves up all through the after-
noon as mild as meat cattle-could scarce
put my sword in guard before he was upon
me our horses shoulder to shoulder

  his being a heavier horse than mine and
stronger and better fed withall mine went
down and i with him rolling over and over
in the road my head covering over my
eyes and in fear of either a hoof through my
skull or the frenchmans sword among my
liver i was up at last choking for the
dust and all abroad with the darkness and
my fall but with my sword still in hand

  now had the frenchman the grace to go
off and be content with oversetting me all
would have been well but he was not suited
so to do and must needs come slashing at
me in the dark perhaps he had the taste
of my blood already in his throat or was
out of mind at the defeat we had given his
army and the spectacle of the french
guards squattering waist deep through the
main for which to this day they are called
the ducks of the main

  he heard my poor horse floundering to
his feet and went that way whence i heard
the sound of his sword questing me and do-
ing the poor beast to death this was more
than i could stand so that i gave a shout
and demanded of him that he dismount and

do battle like a man this he would not do
but turning about came at me again

  dismount i cried down upon the
ground if you have a rats courage

  here his blade zipped by my ear but i
gave him such a slash in return as nigh
unbalanced me it struck his horse and
the beast giving a mighty bound ran away
with his master bolting across the plain
the officer raging to the patient night
shortly i heard a cry and great floundering
and so knew my frenchman must have
fallen into the ditch whither i went as rap-
idly as i might his horse had indeed
tumbled into the ditch and the noise and
clamor of his flailing feet was so great that i
could hear no sound of the rider whether he
cried out or not

  hallo there ishouted yield and
you shall have my help to land surrender
fool your army hath retreated these three
hours

it w as i that was the fool for
he could not know a word i said
and my ass braying but showed
him where i stood so that he
crept up to me and made a mighty cut at me
with his sword he had come too near and
it was the hilt that struck me and not the
blade but i went down all the stars in the
sky spinning before me and standing on the
brink of the ditch as i was i rolled into it
and was near to drown before i had the
sense to seize the rushes and pull myself
upright

  and this greedy frenchman not content
that he had smitten me such a knock and
rolled me for dead in the ditch must hunt
up and down and prod with his sword for
my body that he might plunder it i hung
to the reeds until my head had a little
cleared and i found that i was not over-
much hint while the officer slashed and
swore at times he spoke aloud but did
not shout as i had done lest he bring some
of my friends upon him

  they are far enough away by now
thinks i and have left the field and the
wounded and the dead to the kind offices of
the crows and the plunderers and for all the
advantage we had made by the victory we
might better have been defeated and i
wouldnt have been brought to this pass
the officer had stood listening for some
time and must have heard my breathing
for he cried out as if in vexation and cut
the bold dragoon



down within an inch of my hand i there-
upon let go the reeds and felt about me for
my sword which had fallen from my hand
when i rolled into the ditch it was gone
and i could not find it and the man above
me hearing my movements began to do his
best to kill me cutting and storming at the
edge of the ditch and slashing down the
reeds like a drain cleaner

  the sides of the ditch were steep and i
could not come out and when i moved at
all were i ever so careful i was bound to
stumble a little bit and so make a noise and
have the frenchman above me hewing down
at me with his sword i began to weaken
for it was cold in the ditch and we had been
but poorly fed since we had left flanders
nor had i had any food all day i began to
perceive that sooner or later i must either
yield or be killed by this man and i cursed
myself that i had ever set upon him

  suddenly i found the ditch blocked i
was unable to tell what it was that barred
my way until happily my hand fell on a
saddle and then a horses mane and i be-
thought me at once that when the french
had first begun their attack some of the
austrian horses had bolted and had fallen
into this same ditch and that it was upon
their bodies that i had come

  hugh bancroft said i it was ever
your way to fall into a sewer in old clothes
and come out clad in a full dress uni-
form

  here were saddles and upon the saddles
were holsters and in the holsters pistols
immediately then i opened the holsters of
the saddle that was under my hand and
drew out the pistols that i knew very well
to be loaded for the austrians had run at
the first onset and had not fired a shot

  come on monseer i called here is an
end to this coil

  i climbed upon the horses bodies to await
him he came rapidly without further
urging perhaps thinking i had surrendered
i disabused his mind of that for when he
halted very near to me and called out i
fired a pistol so that the flash would show
me where he was

  he was not a foot away right at my hand
on the edge of the ditch his eyes blinded by
the flash and a great sword held aloft
ready to cut at me the instant he located me
so i let off the second pistol into his body
and had the satisfaction of hearing him go
thudding to earth before i went out how-

ever i hunted about for more pistols but
found only one set of holsters above water
that had in them nothing but two bottles of
wine

  so i went out and found my frenchman
and having taken his sword out of his hand
i found it to be a very good one this man
had been an officer and his uniform was
most gorgeous with buttons of gold which
i took and a jeweled gorget which i also
took together with a watch as big as an
apple and sundry rings and what-not so
that the plunderers should not have them

  then belting his sword about me i set
out toward the road and turned my face in
the direction taken by the army a little
weary and sadly hampered by my heavy
boots i bethought to search about for my
horse and found him lying dead so i re-
moved my valise from behind the saddle in
which i had a shirt or two and some small
things of necessity and then proceeded once
more

  i had gone upward of a mile and was
looking off toward the swamp where a
great many wounded both our own and the
french cried for water and i was think-
ing what an ill thing it was that the victors
of this field should not even care for their
wounded when a voice hailed me in a
tongue that i did not understand

  accordingly i came to a stand and kick-
ing the heel of my scabbard about lay hand
to the hilt of my new sword and stood ready
without answer he that had hailed was
on the side of the road toward the river and
must have several companions for i could
hear their horses stamping and snorting

  these are french said i speaking to
myself come to prey upon our wounded or
stragglers or else they are austrian hussars
and if either one then there is a trying of
this new sword

  the austrians though they had been our
allies were none too well thought of and
there had run a cry about the army toward
the latter part of the day that certain of the
austrians had set upon the duke of cum-
berland and had pistoled him so that he lay
near death

  if they were french then we must have a
fight with them for no man of the black
horse officer or soldier nor even any horse
of our regiment had yet been taken alive by
the french and i was not minded to be the
first one howbeit they made no further
move nor challenged me again so i moved


adventure

on at once hearing my feet on the road
they came at me a gust of hoofs

  i had out my new sword and with it pro-
tected my head but they were all about me
and it was only because they were many and
the night still dark that i was not killed at
once i spitted one of them upon my new
sword and heard him scream but at the
same instant i felt a blade sliding under my
arm and the next moment a blow on my
shoulder that i judged was some ones foot
striking me i swung about and gashed a
mans leg and running under a rearing horse
thrust upwards at his rider and so into the
ditch and found myself in the swamp

  here i knew i was safe for they could not
come after me mounted and let them come
on foot as many as they would i would be a
match for them one did essay to leap his
horse over the ditch and straightway
floundered in the marsh where i came upon
him and knighted him into the order of the
cloven skull

  then as i turned about my legs let
down from under me and i fell into the
water of the marsh and such was my weak-
ness that i was forced to drop my sword
and crawl still farther into the rushes where
finding a little piece of solid earth in the
midst of water and mud and flags i lav
down upon it

  blood of my teeth muttered i i am
done down

  and then i remembered the blow on the
shoulder i could not find the wound so
that i knew it must be in my back nor
could i tell where it was from the pain so i
lay back and wondered if i should be found
or die in the marsh or if i slept until day-
light would i have the strength to continue
after the army here i bethought me that
the army must be miles away by now and
that the french would be pouring back and
that my least fate would be to be taken by
them but beyond this thought i did not go
for the stars swam and the ground swayed
and i lost what ettle sense i ever had

this battle of dettingen had
been a sad victory indeed the
campaign had been a sorry one
from the beginning for up-
ward of a week we had been eating nothing
but black bread and for two days before the
battle had eaten no food whatsoever our
magazines were at hanau but the french
were between them and us and our pillag-

ing upon the people had made them drive
away all their cattle into the hills my
boots were through to the ground so that
my stirrup iron rested against my bare foot
and not a palms breadth of my uniform but
had a patch or a sewed tear upon it

  meanwhile the french appeared in
strength and it seemed that nothing could
save us from the most shameful and horrible
disaster howbeit at this moment our
good king george arrived in person and
took command so that we plucked up our
hearts and put on a review for the king and
his son the duke of cumberland who had
been our commander that was as good as a
man would care to see in a years journey

  now then having renewed our courage
though not broken our fast we determined
upon battle and to move up the river to
hanau where our food and clothing were
let the french stop us if they dared ac-
cordingly leaving our fires burning we set
forth but the french had their eye upon us
and no sooner had it come day than their
batteries across the river began to play upon
us and the cavalry being upon that flank
the guns wreaked terrible destruction

  we were in sorry straits for we were on a
narrow plain bounded by the spessert hills
on one side and the river on the other and
there was no room for the proper maneuver-
ing of our army moreover our baggage
was between the two parts of the column
and the cavalry which was in the advance
could not retire but must stand the brunt
of the enemys artillery from the far bank
or else fall back all among the wagons and
redouble the confusion there

  however the wagons were finally drawn
forward to a wood and the foot got into its
position somehow and the battle joined
the advance of the french cavalry forced
their guns to cease firing and we having
beaten off some of their attacks began to
have more hope

  i had been side by side with one nick
dashbaugh who was my corporal and we
had trotted about and shot off our pistols
and cheered and halloed ourselves hoarse
and hoped that we would not get the order
to charge for if we did our horses would un-
doubtedly fall dead they having had so
little forage in the shank of the morning
however the french maison du roi their
finest cavalry made an onset upon our left
where was only two squadrons of blands and
we received an order to go there hurriedly
the bold dragoon



from the right which we did as fast as
might be

 have a care said dashbaugh beating
his horse with his sword to get him into a
trot we must skirt the morass to get
there and an unwary rider may fall into it
curse this horse the crows would have had
him long ago only no crow with any respect
for name and family would so much as stoop
at him

  in this state of affairs when the balls
were rushing about and whole ranks going
down like swaths of corn before them the
french cavalry and grenadiers  cheval
with great howling of trumpets moved out
and bore down upon us to crush us there-
upon the french batteries across the river
ceased firing

  now then cried dashbaugh who rode
at my side if the batteries beyond the
swamp will but quit we will have a breath-
ing space and give those fur-topped french

a good account to take home - their

livers what would i give for a good ball
of rhenish

  split me i cried their infantry have
appeared why they spring from the
ground like jasons teeth

  spring from the ground shouted dash-
baugh there is a ditch there they
have been in the ditch now is the philis-
tine delivered into our hands death of my
life see they meant to lay us by the
heels between the river morass and ditch
and now their own folly tripped them by the
neck

  here the trumpets began to blow and we
bore down gaily upon the french horse but
they outnumbered us by a good deal and
their horses had been fed with regularity so
that they would respond to the spur which
ours would not and the upshot of it was
that they received our charge and charged
in turn upon us and overthrew us and
hounded us with whoop and hallo down the
river bank whither we had taken our
bloody noses

  two of the french hussars of berchiny
by their green dolmans set upon dashbaugh
and would have done him down save that i
came up at the moment and split one of
them ito the chin and the other fled
whereat we set out once more

  draw rein draw rein called dash-
baugh after a time they have checked
hold up now lets not flee like the wicked
when no man pursueth

 we have come upon them from the
wood said i pointing with my sword to
where the red lines could be seen at the
bottom of a cloud of smoke my lord
stair and the duke have brought some order
out of the foot and we may give them a
stand yet

  so it went for some time the french at-
tacking with success and anon hustled back
again my own regiment had now a chance
to reform which they did and joined by a
squadron of the third we formed fine and
loosened our sleeves for another go at the
monseers our foot now debouching from
the wood upon the french left the french
began to give ground and we could see them
running by two and threes out of the smoke
and toward the village

  they are the guards cried dashbaugh
and away we go to prod them

 away we went indeed as for me i
could not tell what regiment it was that was
breaking my sole interest being to spur or
club or induce by any means the crow-bait
that i rode to a trot as for a gallop i
well knew it was beyond him he having
done all his galloping for the day in saving
me from the french after our first onset

  the rest of ours were in no better case so
that we arrived upon the french some at a
walk and a few trotting but none at the
headlong rush at which a charge should be
pushed home nevertheless the french
guards broke in all directions throwing
away flag gun pike and spontoon and
taking to their heels into the main which
being not over breast deep they crossed
with a great showering of mud

  we went for them and slashed them and
held their heads under water and had a
merry time of it after all until some of the
gray musketeers came to their assistance
and drove us away again after that we
went far down the road and coming up on
the other side swung in through the woods
after the guns there and spent the rest of
the day in harrying the french that we
found there

so the day was lost to the
french by the moving out of
their foot from the covered way
when the time was not ripe and
their own guns were masked thereby so
having driven the french from our road the
army went forward to hanau instead of
pursuing for which we have been taken


adventure

severely to task the truth is however
that horse and man we were near starved
to death and could scarce stand and the
one thought in our minds was to get to
hanau where there was food thither the
army arrived safe and sound and so should
have i save that i stayed for loot and was
so foolish as to pursue the grenadier officer
and so caught a fall

  now the army had gone away in such
haste being hungry that they had taken no
thought for the wounded which duty the
french took upon themselves but i was in
a swoon and so was left for dead and when
i came to myself and heard the french
searching i made no outcry for i thought
them to be plunderers who would slit my
whistle for me

  so i lay in the marsh now myself and
now in a swoon until the second day when
a party of our own who having fed drunk
and slept had come back to see if there was
anything valuable upon the field found me
and carried me to a cart and so to hanau
and i thought to have died fifty times upon
the way

  we stopped at last and the men coming
around to the rear of the cart we were lifted
out and laid down upon the stones of an
inn yard the galleries around became
thronged with people and a great crowd
clustered about us holding their children
up to see the wounded englishmen

  there were six of us from the cart and
they began to carry us across the yard head
and feet finally it came my turn and be-
seeching them not to leave my sword behind
and to be easy of my shoulder i was borne
away i had no doubt of the place they
were taking me to my nose was guide
enough some straw had been spread on
the floor of the stable and here we were laid
down our only light the flickering lanthorn
which was tied up outside the door lest it
set fire to the straw if brought within

  here i called out weakly some one
fetch me the surgeon i want a word or two
with him

  there was no answer when they came
in with the fourth man i repeated my re-
quest

   surgeon beant about said one of the
great louts cant zee un til marnin

   listen ass said i fetch me an of-
ficer or some man of authority i am
not a man to be left to die in a cow
byre

  cant zee un til mamin said the man
patiently

  here had i the strength i would have
cursed that stone-headed grenadier to the
tenth generation but as it was i lay back
until my head stopped swimming when
my sight cleared i beheld a man looking me
very intently in the face

  i have some skill in surgery said he
what is it you wish

  be-to the surgeon and you too

said i are you english

  no said he be -- to you for a
whining platelick but i thought i might
lend you some help hearing you bleating
for a surgeon

  well i want no surgeon only a clean
bed and i have the wherewithal to procure
it

  in that case said the man i can se-
cure you one and a very fine one too
have on then i cried and get me out
of this midden

  the man went away and presently came
back with a shutter and two ox-faced ger-
mans with whom he conversed as easily in
their own tongue as he had with me in en-
glish they hoisted me upon the shutter
and we went out of the yard and down a
street and after some turning and twisting
during which i swore profoundly though
the bearers were at great pains to make me
comfortable we arrived at a house and up
stairs here the man halted the bearers
and coming close to me looked at me by the
light of a candle

  you spoke a while since of payment for
better lodging said he and i would like
to make gentle inquiry as to the extent of
your funds at the present moment before
you dirty my clean sheets

  i would see you in flames first you
harpy i replied through grinding teeth
you have my word and will not lose a
penny by me

  he spoke to the bearers and they turned
about to go down the stairs with me when
they had come again to the house door i
called to the owner of the house and in-
quired of him whither i was being taken
back to the inn said he

  there being no other thing to do i put
my hand very painfully into my pocket and
took out one of the french officers rings
which i offered to the man he held it very
cautiously to the candle light and turned it
over and over
the bold dragoon



  very well said he at last this will
do and he made a sign to take me back
to bed

  return me my ring said i

  it will hardly do for the length of time
you will be here judging by your wound
said he putting the ring on his finger but
when its value hath been eaten out i shall
call upon you again

  i swore a little bit here but growing
weaker with each word i was fain to cease
altogether while the men who had car-
ried me were cutting off my boots and re-
moving my torn and muddy uniform the
man of the house spoke to me again

  my name is gulf said he a surgeon
and well thought of hereabout now if you
wish me to care for you i will-for a price
of course-and if not say so and have done
and your regimental surgeon may help you
to your grave which is all that may be ex-
pected of one who can command no greater
salary than a guinea a week

  i made a sign that he might have the care
of my wound whereat he grinned and
going out returned with basin napkin and
divers other things then i was put to bed
my wound which was a deep one under the
shoulder was washed i was bled and a
fever coming upon me both from the weak-
ness of my body having had insufficient
food for so long and having lain in the
swamp i was very ill and for a long time
thought the-would have me after all

chapter ii

of wounds healing

lay on my back for a long time upward
of a month and at last i began to have
the better of the fever and could get out of
bed and sit by the window the house was
on a mean street in the lower part of the
town and there was little enough to inter-
est a man looking from the window

  the window of the house opposite was al-
most near enough to touch but the room
into which it opened was a garret filled with
hides belonging to the bootmaker who
owned the house farther down was an inn
from whence at all hours came a raucous
cry that had disturbed my slumbers many a
night but which i now discovered to be the
cry of the maid of the chamber hearing
the call one morning when i sat at the win-
dow i looked out and perceived a wench

leaning from an upper window of the inn
then out with a great bucket full of water
into the street dousing a countryman and
his cattle in right royal fashion whereat the
countryman cursed her to the stars but
had nothing for a reply save the banging of
the window

  after that when i heard her cry look
out below as i conceived it to be i would
listen and often hear the cursing of the
passerby who had been drenched

  there was another amusement i had
watching the passing of a cart that dripped
black liquid into the mud of the way and
slopped and splashed and bedewed all that
was near it i had many a laugh to see the
voyagers in the street take to the shops and
doorways tol escape the cart and often
enough its liquid mud found them in their
retreat and they raised long wails and spoke
their minds freely which made me regret
that i had not the german so that i could
understand what they said

  now when i was well enough to become
argumentative i demanded of the man gulf
where were my clothes

  they were burned said he they
were all mud and blood and full of i know
not how many noxious vapors so we had
them burned i have other clothes for you
when you are able to bear them

  did you find anything in the pockets
i asked looking at him carelessly

  nothing said he but some moldy
bread and a pistol bullet or two

  you lie i cried there was a watch
jewels and the gold buttons and silver gor-
get of my dress uniform

  um grunted he i did not find them
some one had been in your pockets before
you came here

  that i might have believed except that
you will remember i got out a ring to pay
you you being in great fear lest your sheets
be dirtied by a penniless man

  well he muttered what of it
now look you doctor gulf you have
saved my life perhaps or perhaps you have
done what you could to kill me but our
troops are still quartered here and a patrol
passes this window on the hour i have
known men hanged for a small trifle such as
this and so will you be if i cry out to
them

  for a man whose life hath been recently

saved you are a - ungrateful viper

replied the doctor i am no thief your


adventure

jewels are safe enough you may have
them and your cursed long sword and cram
them down your throat for aught i
care

  he then went out and presently returned
with the jewels and buttons in a little bag
and my sword with its belt wrapped
about it

  i thought you were an englishman
said the doctor watching me from the cur-
tain of his eye but you must be french
how so

  why these buttons that you say are
from your dress uniform are french but-
tons of that regiment known as the grena-
diers a cheval

  that may be said i not having any
other reply

  i have a friend went on the doctor
who will not only turn these buttons to
gold money but the jewels as well and
that great globe of a watch you have
there which i doubt is of little use to
you

  i told him that i did not care to sell them
for i knew very well i would not get a quar-
ter of their real value so then he grinned
and put back the little sack of buttons and
other things and going toward the door
caught up my sword and made to go out
this however he could not do for i had
him by the neck weak as i was

  how i cried how is this that is
my sword noble doctor put it down

  he squeaked under my hand and dropped
the sword

  hi cried the doctor an assault an
assault on an honest citizen he hath laid
hands on me me that saved his life the
provost shall hear of this my fine dragoon
the provost shall hear of this and a fine
young man be drummed from guard to
guard and beat upon the back for it
out i said taking up the scabbarded
blade and laying it across his back doc-
tor you may be and my life you may have
saved though i have my doubts of it but
you have been well paid for it and he that

touches my sword is in peril of-s fire

now out

  so he went out and i what with excite-
ment and exertion fell back upon the bed
and the fever returned again so that it was
a week before i got out again but all the
while i kept the sword in bed with
me so i was much easier in mind than
before

in a day or so the doctor brought
me some clothes a very modest
suit of black which i put on and
was for going to the part of the
town where the troops were billeted but i
was too weak and could not go beyond
the end of the street

 here i stopped and sitting down upon a
doorstep drew my sword and examined it
for this was the first time i had had an op-
portunity to test its balance since i had
found it it was a very fine blue sword
made by one picinino according to the
name on the blade and of the pattern used
by the french horse the hilt was of
basket work inlaid with silver with a most
excellent covering for the wrist and hand

  the sword was quite heavy and broad
more so than our sword but the balance
was excellent and it was not difficult to
wield i had never seen a weapon of this
pattern before so closely though there were
one or two in our army come by in the same
manner as mine these swords are also in
much use in scotland whither they were
first taken by members of the scotch archer
guard and then i believe the clans were
armed with them by the french in the
fifteen indeed a very fine sword so fine
indeed that my good doctor gulf would
have stolen it had i not seen him in the act

  thus thinking i turned back to the
house but coming near the door i happened
to note the great boot that hung over the
shop opposite and to remember that i was
without boots mine having been cut off me
and being well nigh ruined anyway now
was a time to have some made so that by
the time i was well enough to rejoin 
would be properly prepared

  with this in mind i went into the boot
shop and having made clear to the boot-
maker what i wanted we went together to
his loft so that i might have my choice of
leathers it was hot there and the smell
of the leather making me faint i stepped to
the window to breathe a bit of air his
window was right against mine in the house
opposite and there i beheld the doctor and
another man an ensign of handasydes
regiment deep in conversation some of
it i could hear and other parts of it i lost
but the ensign urged and the doctor shook
his head

  i will not have it said the doctor i
have now a great ass of a dragoon here in
this house that i thought would have died
the bold dragoon



long ago but he is still alive and insolent
and while he is here i will be no party to
such a plan

  the ensign thereupon muttered some
more

  ah and is that so cried the doctor
is it true indeed and when this day
week ah say you so indeed say you so
indeed he chuckled to make the blood
run cold aha come again to me my
merry viscount we shall do business on
this day week we shall have an affair this
day week i assure you we will have a
sticking of pigs to delight you

  then they went down and shortly after-
ward i saw why they had gone up into my
room for some four or five men came out
of the house and went up the street their
heads very close together and still bob-
bing as if they continued to talk

  the bootmaker now touched me on the
shoulder and led me to where he had laid
out some fine hides but i har ther things
on my mind than boots so stmade some
excuse and gave the man a  in then i
went into the street	

  this day week i muttei this day
week now what will hapre  then
whatever it might be pnew it boded
me no good or the doctor ad not been so
overjoyed i went down fa he tavern hop-
ing to find some soldier there but there
were none for it was th-tenour for exercise
which made it all the fapinger that an offi-
cer should be in the hie across the street
i was forced therefoct to linger about un-
til the patrol came y when i asked them
if there was any ns of the camp explain-
ing that i was an asvalided dragoon

  we move f they this day week
this order of mah is out

  so the army was to move what then
would become of me i was so weak that
it was as much as i could do to walk from
one end of the street to the next so it was
clear that i would be unable to march with
the troops i went back to the house and
having eaten a meal of meat for the first
time in as long as i could remember and
had some wine into my stomach i plucked
up heart

  that very afternoon an officer came to
the house with a great scroll on which the
names of the wounded who were quartered
in the town were set down and having
pricked off my name thereon he inquired of
doctor gulf if i would be able to march

  not he said the doctor looking very
sternly at the officer i have had the care
of many a wounded man in my hands and
sick ones too but he is as doubtful a case
as i have seen i promise you the wound
see you being of three needles depth and
the fever on top of that all after a poor diet

and the inaction of a fixed camp-

  enough said the officer he shall be
set down as unable to go this is hot work
to dry the marrow out of a mans bones
the doctor thereupon set out some wine
so good that it surprized me and the officer
having bounced his against the back of his
throat he went his way

  i gathered my strength very rapidly now
and began to go out much more each day
the army marched away horse and foot
and i was exceedingly lonely after they had
gone i was going back to the house after
watching the last victual wagon out of
sight when i bethought to step into the
tavern near-by my house and have a little
something for my nerves

  there was a window there built out from
the wall that commanded the street and
from it one could see the door of the doctors
house seated in the bow window was a
man in gray clothes watching up the street
with great intentness he looked at me
startled as i came in but seeing i was in
citizens attire he greeted me in german
and went back to his watching of the street

  i sat down and had me a glass and looked
from time to time at the man in the bow
window suddenly he jumped up and seiz-
ing his stick from a corner dashed out i
went myself to the window to see what had
excited him three men had just come
from the door of the doctors house and
were walking away the man in gray hur-
ried after them but when he came to the
door turned sharp and went in and i could
hear the door slam after him

  ah thinks i here is robbery or some-
thing worse and thinking of my good new
sword which i called the picinino after its
maker i dashed in pursuit of the man in
gray

the house door swung open to
my touch and there was the doc-
tor and this man in gray their
heads already together across the
table there was a candle between them
for it was already growing dark and by the
light of the candle i had a very good sight


adventure

of the gray mans features he was the
handasyde ensign that i had seen in my
room the week before when i had been in
the bootmakers garret he and the doctor
looked at me like two dogs caught in the
henhouse and so struck were they that they
could give me no greeting i mounted the
stairs to my chamber and took the picinino
from its hook on the wall

  this quoth i to myself is the last
time that i go abroad without my sword
about me there are too many thieves
about to either steal this sword while i am
gone or to cut my throat if i go upon the
street unarmed

  then i set down the sword against the
edge of a chair and looked out into the
street it was very quiet now that the army
was gone and i was quite lonely and cast
down it was clear to me that i would not
be able to fight any more that summer and
by the time i was fully recovered the army
would be again in winter quarters mean-
while i must live on the frenchmans jewels
and when they were gone i had no idea of
what i should do

  suddenly there was a crash i had out
the sword and leaped half across the room
at the sound of it and then i espied a great
stone still rolling across the floor that must
have come through the window that i had
still left open

  some one will smart for this i mut-
tered running to the window and looking
cautiously out lest i get another stone be-
tween the eyes

  across the street before the boot shop
was the man in gray looking very anxiously
up at my window no sooner had he seen
my face than he made a gesture of silence
to me and pointed to the inn by this i
understood him to mean that he had some-
thing secret to communicate to me and that
he wished me to meet him at the inn
thereupon very mystified i nodded but
he held up eight fingers by which i under-
stood eight oclock so i nodded again and
he went away waving his hand

  i was at the inn at the hour named and
long before but little good it did me i
heard the clocks all about the city booming
and still no man in gray i began to wonder
if it had not been a ruse to get me from the
house but it would avail them little since
my jewels i had upon me and my sword
about my waist and as for the few things
in my valise they were welcome to them

  however the man in gray came in at
that minute and seated himself before me
at the table with a smile being a little out
of breath from rapid walking or running
he panted a little and took snuff and
ordered something to drink while i won-
dered what an ensign of handasydes wanted
with me and what he was doing behind the
army and in citizens clothes being neither
wounded or sick for i had seen him in his
uniform a bare seven days before

  i suppose began the man in gray
that you wonder why i have brought you
here i would have told you before even
this afternoon but i did not know you were
english nor did i know that you were a
wounded dragoon until today when the doc-
tor there informed me by the nails of st

andrew but he is a-

  i have thought so myself i answered
but he has cured me of my wound and i
must be grateful to him for that

  aye said the other absently chewing
upon his fingers like a man undecided what
to do

  well what is your pleasure with me
i asked after he had sat for some time in
indecision

  i am trying to come at it he answered
you say this doctor has cured your wound
well he is like to give you another one that
will be quite incurable

  ha how so

  listen you have marked that his name
is gulf and that he speaks english as well
as any man also that he professes to be a
doctor well so he may be but that is not
all he is an agent for jacobites and he

lives here making a living-knows how

but mostly by forwarding money and help-
ing this one and that one out of the coun-
try and selling news of the british army to
the french one expects to find jacobites
in france and in italy but not in bavaria
and so he is the more dangerous and
among doctors men can come and go at all
hours and in numbers or singly and no
one will think it odd

  but what has this to do with me

  i am coming to that i was desirous of
borrowing some money from the doctor
that is in a way of speaking but he would
not lend it me i was in desperate straits i
warrant you by the bones of paul but i
was in need of money he would not listen
to me well after i had run myself dry-
the--strike him blind-he suggested to
the bold dragoon



me that in his upper chamber lay a dragoon
that he had expected to die but that had
gotten well you see he probably brought
you to the house thinking you had means
that would fall into his hands if you died

   now this dragoon says he is a most
unmannerly cursing ungrateful fellow a
true damme-boy quick to take offense and
overready with a great sword that he car-
ries about with him then he continues
looking at me very wise this dragoon has
about him quite a store of jewels and such
which if i could induce him to part with
might go far toward making up this sum
that you wish to borrow 

  i suppose said i that he was to keep
me indefinitely in his house under pretext
that i was too weak to travel and meanwhile
possess himself of the jewels one by one
under pretext of taking room hire and his
fee for caring for me

  ah no said the viscount that would
have taken too long no the doctor had a
better plan than that which was that he
and i were to lay in wait for you that a
dispute would be begun and that i was to
put a foot or two of steel through you he
standing by to witness that i had but
defended myself

  having said this the man in gray smiled
and had himself a drink while i sat with
open mouth the back of my neck cold at
the thought of such treachery

  a very fine plan indeed i cried finally
except that i am not the man to let any
one put steel into me simply because he
hath a desire to do sol

  umm said he but you are something
weak from your wound and the doctor was
to stand by with a bludgeon to caress your
skull with in case you proved obstinate
and your need for money was so great
that you were willing to do murder for it
he laughed and made a grimace waving
his hand in the air

  have i not told you the plan said
he have i not shown you the snare in
your path does that look like murder
and yet the need of money is very great
with me very great indeed

thereupon feeling a certain
amount of gratitude toward this
young man in gray who had told
me of such a dastardly plot and
knowing full well that the store of jewels
and buttons was more than sufficient for my

needs i pressed him to tell me what it was
that required money so hastily

  why this said he i am a younger
son and am called by courtesy the viscount
of barnet now my elder brothers have
died off or had their throats cut one by one
and so i find myself suddenly the head of
the house it only remains for me to get to
england and claim the estate going through
certain formalities you know and then i
am a rich man and may have my coach and
six to the door at any hour of the day aye
and outriders to the number of half a
score 

  and what prevents your going

  why man what i have been telling
you a man can not fly from bavaria to
the sea it costs money to travel overland
and then there is the matter of shipping
into england to be thought of and of travel-
ing to my own country when i have reached
the far side of the channel and truth to
tell i have not a penny

  have you vacated your commission
at this question the man in gray reddened
and looked hastily about the room

  shshshsh he whispered in great con-
sternation no this it was that i wanted
the doctor to do i wanted him to get me
out of the country and trust me for his fee
until i should come into the estate he does
a goodly traffic in getting deserters away
and in helping officers who are straitened in
their accounts to find freedom and all such
matters as that but he would not do it
and my colonel would not give me a leave
so i must een stay behind when the army
marches and take off my uniform

  and you have no friends who will lend
you

  not one it is a strange thing but still
it is true a man makes friends in the army
by drinking and dicing and he will find
many who will accompany him in either or
both but when it comes to the loan of
money and such a sum as i require that is
another matter

  well what was your purpose in telling
me all this

  teeth of solomon why because you
are one englishman and i another and i
will not stand by and see you harmed by
any rascally german doctor if it makes
me an enemy of the doctor and the estate is
lost for lack of claimants well and good
my honor is still clear

  here he looked at me with such frankness


adventure

and open-hearted good will that i could
have wept

  now look you said i one good turn
deserves another i have about me it is
true some few rings and geegaws but
whether they are worth much money or not
is another matter now if i should make
you a small loan of some of these what se-
curity should i have that i should be re-
paid

  the word of a gentleman cried
he bringing his hand down upon the
table

  at that i laughed in his face a viscount
he might be and i but the son of a seller of
books but that made him no better than i
war is a wonderful thing to show that all
men are clay a dukes face can blanch and
his kps pale as well as a drummer boys a
bit of lead will go as easily into the duke of
cumberland who is a kings son as into the

lowest grenadier who is the son of-

knows who and both of them will cry out
as lustily under the knife that extracts the
ball so i and my comrades had little re-
spect for birth and for titles as such unless
they were borne by our own officers of
whose bravery we had no doubt when i
had laughed then the viscount looked a
little abroad but he took no offense

  now attend said he you do not know
me it is true and it is a difficult thing to
collect debts when the channel and half of
england is between the debtor and creditor
but listen you have about you some small
jewel or button which you think is of no
value give it me and tomorrow i will re-
turn to you a sum of money that hath been
realized upon it that will astonish you i
have a friend here in the city who is a money
changer and i promise you that i can get a
nearer value for such as you have than you
can get yourself

  give me something anything and see if
i am not sincere and for the loan that
you make me taking into effect that i have
saved your life i will give you a note of
hand a wadset as it is called in my country
against the estate for the value a hundred-
fold of what you see fit to lend me

  i thought this matter over at some length
if he gave me a paper on the estate it
would do very handily if i should come into
a commission and if i did not i could dis-
count it at any jews meanwhile we would
try him and thus thinking i took out the
french officers watch for i carried my

jewels with me always for safety and
passed it across the table

  i will trust you thus far said i meet
me here tomorrow morning at say ten
oclock and let me see what you can do with
this and when was it that the doctor was
to do away with me

  there was no time set said he be-
cause i would not agree to such an arrange-
ment

  well i will have my eye on that old

- and meanwhile change my lodging

if he tries any chancey work let him look
to his head

  at ten oclock said the viscount i
will be here and for this clock this bel-
lowing ticker i warrant you that i can get
you seven pounds

  so then we struck hands and he went his
way and i mine when i was come to the
doctors house i cleared the skirts of my
coat from the picinino a bit for i was
minded to have an accounting with doctor
gulf i went in and there he was reading
by the light of a candle or two before i
had time to speak he reached out a paper
to me

  this was brought here by the provosts
officers said he this afternoon and i
would have given it to you only i did not
see you go out

i took the scroll meanwhile
bending my eye upon him in a
very chilly manner and held the
scroll to the candle i ran hastily
over it for it was closely written and the
light was poor but the upshot of the paper
was that one hugh bancroft of ligoniers
regiment of horse to whom greeting being
by reason of hurts and sickness unable to
do his duty with the army was hereby dis-
charged with honor by these presents and
to his home and to any shipowner or sea
captain to whom they might come he was
hereby commanded to carry the body of the
said hugh to any port in england to which
they might have business and set him
down dryshod and look for the defrayment
of any expenses by reason of said carriage
to my lords the commissioners of his
majestys exchequer god save the king
by his servant william duke of cumber-
land

  this is a pretty state of affairs cried i
to cast me aside like a broken blade
and what pray am i to do for a living now
the bold dragoon



and as for hurts i will be as well as any of
them this day month

  the doctor said no word but sat looking
at me and seeing an object for the anger
that was in me i beat my fist upon the table

  meanwhile i have a crow to pick with
you my wielder of tortoise-shell my basin
holder so you would murder me for my
money-the wounded man within your
doors and so you brought me here
hoping that i would die on your hands and
so you would be my heir well i did not
die and i am not to be murdered and any
heirs that you may have let them look
to their estate for they are shortly to come
into it

  then i unsheathed the picinino and let
the candle light run up and down the blade

  the doctor however showed no fear
only sat looking at me with great disgust

  what a great dunderheaded fool you
are said he what a booby of a dragoon
hath the viscount barnet been trying to
borrow money from you this tale sounds
like one from his fertile brain i brought
you to my house to cure you for a price
since a doctor must live by custom as well
as any tradesman and as for being your
heir if you die that is but the perquisite
of any army leach else wherefore follow the
army

  and as for your fine friend the viscount
for i see by your face that it was he that
set you by the ears he is the most arrant
scoundrel in the armies he came to me
with a long-winded tale of an estate that
he had come into and i would have nothing
to do with him and i having mentioned
the fact that you were in the house he was
for my poisoning you and our sharing your
money

  do you think ass that i a doctor
would have set with you at night and worn
myself to a rag caring for you had i in-
tended to kill you probably you do for
you have little sense well beware of this
viscount for he is a liar and a thief and a

gambler and a wastrel rake--dog and

as for this leave of absence that they would
not give him it is because he hath more
debts than a dog fleas and his creditors
would not let him leave their sight and
went to handasyde and raised such a coil
that the colonel refused him permission
to go to england so he hath now deserted
and skulks about the town in disguise like
any lift-purse 

  now this was a plausible tale enough but
i had my doubts of its truth and i remem-
bered what i had heard the doctor tell the
ensign when i had been in the bootmakers
loft i would know who to believe in the
morning for if the viscount kept the ap-
pointment and met me with money well
and good and if he did not it was no large
loss for the night i would be on my
guard so leaving the doctor i went to my
room and barricading the door set up the
unsheathed picinino ready to hand and
so went to bed

  i needed to have no apprehensions on
the score of the viscounts honesty for he
was before me at the inn

  good morning he cried cheerfully
good morning we have done well in-
deed for this watch that we had i have
been able to get a matter of seven
pound

  now this was so much more than i had
expected that i was quite speechless for a
moment and was only able to mumble my
thanks

  notat all said he not at all and
now do you think i am to be trusted with a
small loan secured by a wadset on my
estate

  hmmm said i bearing in mind what
the doctor had told me have you any
present debts

  why yes a few what man of mettle
hath not the price of a main or two here
a pair of boots here a few yards of lace for
my uniform somewhere else all small
had he denied it and mumbled and
looked blushingly at the table i had known
him to be a liar but his face was so open
and frank and his smile so pleasant that
i was forced to believe him and know the
doctor for a liar

  i can not said i loan you a very
great sum or even much of a sum at all
for the reason that i shall have need of
perhaps all that i have i have been dis-
charged from the army and must make the
best of my way home and find some occu-
pation that will give me a livelihood all
of which will take money

  aha said he here is a scurvy trick
why you are as well as the next man i
suppose the duke wants no string of wound-
ed left behind to be fed and cared for while
the army is in the field and so hath cast
them all aside to go home and die
probably


adventure

  and i wager that you are no very ex-
perienced traveler to make your way alone
across half of europe

  that is true enough said i sadly
it is one thing to travel with a marching
column where every nights stage is clearly
marked and the victual wagons parked
there and nothing to do but water horse
eat and fall down on the ground and quite
another to go alone and battle with thieving
landlords in flea-ridden inns

  i was coming to that point cried the
viscount now then i can get you for your
jewels three-fold what you can moreover
i am an experienced traveler and have
been up and down the highways of europe
for many years harky a moment you
shall give me your jewels to melt into good
gold getting three times what you could
get yourself and we shall set out in com-
pany you loaning me half of the sum we
realize against the wadset and not only
that but accompanying me to england to
get your money when i have secured my
rights is anything fairer than that

  i said nothing but thought upon the
matter if the viscount secured for me so
much money more than i could get myself
it would only be fair to lend him a part of
it then i would have a man to help me
all the weary way to england one who
knew the ins and outs of the road and who
could bargain with the innkeepers aye and
curse them too and one who would be a
companion for me

  in truth i was not looking forward with
any great joy to such a lonely journey
moreover in case we were set upon by
robbers that roamed about the country or
any of the bands of masterless men and dis-
charged soldiers we could set our backs to
each other and show the rogues a good front
which one man could not do

  and added to all this the vibcount had a
merry open countenance a frank and danc-
ing eye and my heart warmed to him
here i bethought me what a tremendous
liar the doctor was and that i would quit
his roof without the delay of a single minute

well said i when will we
start

  good cried the viscount
slapping me on the back good
what a fine fellow you are indeed let us
start this very night why linger we
can go by diligence to mayence and either

get horses there and go overland or con-
tinue by diligence

  you forget said i that i am a sick
man but lately risen from a bed of pain
and that i could not stand a journey on
horseback of such length nor even one by
diligence which by the look of it i think
would be worse than horseback

  by the bones of judas ah true
enough wither my marrow i forgot that
you had been wounded

  here the viscount fell to chewing his
fingers and beating impatiently upon the
table

  ha he cried i have it oh i am a
man of resource i promise you why if
we can but get to mayence or to coblenz
we can go down the rhine on a boat
there are all kinds of boats trading boats
market boats and i doubt not boats for
the carriage of passengers all down the
reaches of the rhine what better could
you ask a soft bed no jolting roadway
but a smooth rolling river a sea voyage in
fact a very cure for all your ailments

   it will be a little slow said he ruefully
but that we must put up with well
all the more reason for an early start
do you go and pack up your effects give
me the jewels which i will change into
money and meet you here at four oclock
or so we can then go to the inn from
whence the diligence starts and be ready
to leave at daybreak how is that

  it suits me very well because i have
little enough to prepare having indeed only
my valise for baggage and in it a change or
two of linen i am minded though to
have this doctor before the justices for
trying to murder me or at least crowd a
foot or two of my sword down his rascally
gullet

  no no exclaimed the viscount do
nothing of the sort we could not prove
a thing and next to jail there is no better
place to stay out of than a court of justice
no no speak your mind tohim perhaps
give him a taste of the flat of the blade
even for the lying hound he is but let it go
at that you owe him no money now

  not a farthing he had of me a ring
that was sufficient to keep me for a year
for which consideration he has given me
a hard bed and a suit of old clothes and let
my blood regularly which i could ill afford
to lose having been fed on very thin soup
since i was brought in
the bold dragoon



  so then give me the jewels and farewell
until tonight

  i took the bag from my pocket and tipped
out on the table all the rings and the silver
gorget and the gold buttons of which i
had not cut off the half but it had been
dark and i hurried now of this store i
took two rings and put them upon my fin-
gers for i was a little vain myself and in
addition these would be a goodly reserve
which no soldier should ever be without
the rest i gave to the viscount

  now listen said i you must remem-
ber that no one is allowed to leave the city
after nightfall and that if you are not here
i shall raise such a hue and cry as would
hunt you out of the deepest cellar in the
city you have my jewels but i have your
life for there are many officers of the army
still in the city and they would be most
pleased to find a deserter to try the strength
of the first piece of rope they could come by
by hanging said deserter up to a tree with
it

  the viscount jumped a bit at that like
a horse at the touch of a whip his fingers
went to his mouth and his eyes here and
there so that i thought i had him and that
he was a traitor indeed i could feel the
quick rage of a sick man sweeping over
me and i thrust forward the picinino with
a movement of my haunch at the clank
of the scabbard the viscount turned to me

  hold my bold dragoon cried he
by the hair of pilate you are a silly fellow
i am not overset in mind because i medi-
tated you any wrong but because you
have reminded me that there is a rope for
my neck if i am caught and the longer i
stay in this city the worse it will be for me

  that was true enough so apologizing
for my suspicion of him i bade him fare-
well and went home to the doctors house
i went in and to my surprize found three
men in the room seated about the fire-
place but they civilly arose and touched
their hats to me they were men of con-
siderable dignity calm-faced and majestic
though they were very quietly clothed
with no lace upon their hats and with but
little jewelry

  good day sir said the one who seemed
from his face and bearing to have the
greatest authority the doctor is from
home and we are awaiting him your
face is not known to me but i perceive
that you must be an honest man here

he looked very hard at my sword you
will forgive me if i dont present these
gentlemen to you they are something
careful of their names being spoken in this
town of long lugs even in this house of our
mutual friend and i know that you must
have the same feeling but have a drop
of brose with us while we are waiting for
the doctor come a mug here

  one of the men passed a mug and this
being dipped into the bowl of brose was
handed me

  i will give you a toast proposed the
leader of the three the king

  the king said i god bless him
we showed the bottoms of our mugs to
each other and having done so i set mine
down and excused myself pleading that i
had affairs to care for thereupon i moved
toward the stairs

  -death cried one of the three his

face quite white are you the dragoon
vwhy yes said i startled that this
man whom i did not know should be so
upset

  the leader smiled calmly

  we are gentlemen of the medical pro-
fession as you may presume from our
being in this house and having heard some-
thing of your unusual case from our good
friend the doctor my companion here is
quite astounded to see you walking about
like an ordinary person your wound was
quite severe was it not and complicated
by an unusual exposure afterward

  it was indeed said i but i have fully
recovered save for this leanness that you
see and a slight dizziness and stiffness of
the arm but happily it is not my sword
arm that is affected

  but might i ask how you came by that
sword asked the third man who up to this
time had not spoken a word

  i took it from a french officer

  ah jto be sure said the man i
should have known surely i should have
known no other would have worn it
so openly

  i now bade  these gentlemen farewell
and went to my room there was no con-
versation from below stairs and very shortly
i heard the door softly open and the three
go out they must have tired of the wait-
ing and gone before the doctor came back

  i wondered for a little time why the sight
of my sword had upset them they knowing
very well by what the doctor had told
o

adventure

them that i was english and not french
perhaps they were only curious never hav-
ing seen one of that type before and indeed
they were rare enough in the army at that
time though later they came into more
general use many troopers getting them
in the same manner as i had gotten mine

  when i had packed my valise and made
sure that nothing was forgotten i went
down again and the doctor coming in from
the street at that moment we met face to
face

  ha said i

  the doctor said no word but looked at
me sourly enough after a time he spoke

  so this is my thanks is it you quit
my house the instant you can walk and
leave me your creditor with as clear a con-
science as if i were the richest man in

hanau and not a poor-of a poverty-

ridden leach

  you have my ring said i and i have
not the slightest doubt that you are still
the gainer on my account and will be the
more so since i am taking so early a leave
of you

  if you are going in the company of
that rakish viscount i warrant you you
will wish yourself back here soon enough
before you go have you in mind any
occupation

  no

  there are few that a soldier can find
unless he has some manner of trade that he
can work at

  i am wondering what affair it is of
yours

  well it is none i promise you said the
doctor acidly but i have some compunc-
tion about seeing you starve to death or
turned hedge-rover for a living after i
was at such pains to save your life and drag
you from the grave in spite of whatever
lie your friend hath told you i am no mur-
derer nor a scoundrel either and so you
could see if you had aught in that thick
head of yours except galloping and sword
rattling and throat cutting and i have
seen somewhat more of the world than you
having been a little longer in it i tell
you frankly that you will starve to death
even so said i a little helplessly i
can see no remedy for it i can starve to
death here as well as in england

  there is an occupation began the doc-
tor looking at me very steadily a soldiers
business that a man such as you are might

find to support himself at a service where
there is little money bur much glory and
where a man might win himself a commis-
sion in fact- a long pause- he might
be commissioned when he took the oath
if he were such a man as you

  is that so where tien but i can
take no service under any of these two-for-
a-shilling princes that run about this coun-
try of europe i have no language but
english which is good enough for an en-
glishman and i have no stomach for risk-
ing my life which is the only one i have in
another mans quarrel

  such a service as i had in mind said
the doctor is none of these but the ser-
vice of an englishman the service of one
who hath sustained great wrongs but who
is now in a fair way to have them righted
now who do you mean i asked for i
was entirely mystified

 have you never heard of charles
stuart asked he

  at that i was filled with rage

  charles stuart i cried i have
heard of him for he hath some pretensions
to the crown of england and if he had
any brains at all he would see from the
experience of his father in the fifteen that
we will have none of him a poor foolish
family with more bar sinisters to their
scutcheon than there are lozenges to a tap
room window

  the doctor leaped to his feet and his
chair went crashing to the stones of the floor

  this is my house he roared and
no man may insult my sovereign beneath
its roof begone

  he looked wildly about for some weapon
but there was none to hand and there was
i facing him very easily for he was old and
no match for me weak as i was

  be - to your sovereign and you

too said i and at that i swung about and
went out of the house

chapter iii

of an officer and his four troopers

we got away the next morning in
sheets of rain there was a diligence
from the upper main that inned at hanau
and this we purposed to take as far as
frankfort where the diligence stopped for
dinner it taking half a day to make the ten
miles we had not gone the first mile
the bold dragoon

before we mired and then perforce we
must get down and help the men who rode
the horses that drew the diligence to pry
and pull and shove the wagon out of the
mud

  if this is the way we are to continue our
journey said i then i am for going
horseback this is far from my idea of an
easy way to travel

  it might be worse said the viscount
looking over his shoulder we may be
able to go by boat from frankfort if so
we have not long to bear with this sort of
thing

  at last by dint of great cursing and a pile
of rocks we managed to get clear the
lanterns were hung up and the horses al-
lowed to breathe it should have been
daylight long ago but the clouds were so
lowering and the rain so heavy that a man
could see but a little better than at night
the horses stamped and sniffed and jingled
their harness while one of the drivers
knocked the mud from his great boot
against a wheel i thought the horses
made considerable noise for their number
and said so to the viscount

  i think we have company said he
and began to chew his fingers

  the driver by the wheel ceased to scrape 
and straightened up to listen there were
horsemen approaching no doubt of it for
we could hear them quite plainly now
the viscount and i made some slight prep-
aration by loosening our swords and the
drivers thrust their hands into their bosoms
where they no doubt had horse pistols
secured against the wet

  the oncoming horsemen were within an
arms length before we could see them and
then they suddenly emerged from the fog
the pale light gleamed on the bright parts
of their horse furnishings and the rain
dripped from their cloaks they were
soldiers and it did not take more than two
looks from me to make sure that they were
hanoverian horse

  a wet morning friends cried the
leader of the party by which token i
judged him to be english

  the drivers answered never a word for
being germans they did not understand
but i replied and said that it was and that
it must be disagreeable riding

  aye said he it is that and dry work
for all the wet

  here he laughed at his own joke he

kept his hands upon his horses withers the
while he talked and i judged he had his
holsters open and kept his hands over them
to save the damp from his pistols

  are you going far he continued

  a way said i and might i ask where
yonder beer-spoiler thinks he is going with
that horse

  one of the horsemen had been passaging
his horse through the mud and was swinging
around to get between the viscount and
myself where we stood in the road

  halloa cried the officers geht atis with
that pferde ill do the needful here

  he waved his hand and the trooper
backed off to the side of the road and bent
his head to let the water run out of his
bucket-shaped head-dress

  the long and short of it is gentlemen
that we neither of us want to stand in this
rain for any length of time and so if you
will just show me a paper or two for authori-
ty to be traveling about behind the army
i will not inquire your names nor your
business but will just be trotting

  i perceive that you are a british officer
said i but you will not object i know to
telling me why you are holding up travelers
who have not been one stage from the city
now i cared little enough why he was
demanding our papers but seeing that he
was a young man much more so than i
i thought i might get him in talk and so
lead him to let us pass without further
question for while i had my discharge to
show the viscount had none and his jour-
ney would most likely end immediately

  i am asking all and sundry for their
papers said the officer because i am
ordered to do so and i am ordered to do so
because we have news that there are spies
and certain french agents about and when
it comes to our ears that a man wearing a
sword of very frenchy pattern hath lain
at the inn and taken the diligence before
daybreak it falls within our duty to follow
him and have a look at him and if it
appears to us that he is indeed a french
agent then we have a bit of rope and i
doubt not can find a tree to hang it upon
you need carry no rope for me i
replied this is sufficient for my pur-
poses and i handed him my discharge

  all the while he was puzzling over it
by the dim light i was thinking rapidly
of what we should do if he seized the vis-
count he had with him four troopers
adventure

which with himself made five and we were
but two and dismounted however i
was not going to see the viscount hanged
more by token that he had half of our
store of money upon him

  good enough said the officer handing
me back my discharge they have done
you a dirty deed  meanwhile a word as
one friend to another get rid of that two
stone or so of iron that you wear about
your waist it will mark you as a french-
man or a scotch heather jumper wherever
you go now then said he turning to
the viscount are you a wounded veteran
too

  no said the viscount i am a mer-
chant and have been to the headquarters
to see about selling some cloth for winter
covering for the troops

  and your safe conduct

  here it is said the viscount calmly
holding out a paper so that i near fell in
the mud from surprize

  uh grunted the officer handing it
back a man of your healthy brisket
should be wearing a sword and spilling
blood instead of ink the merchant ser-
vice is no place for a pretty lad like you
there was a pause and the drivers mut-
tered impatiently the horses of the
patrol drooped their heads and the water
ran from them and from their riders muf-
fled in their fur trimmed jackets the
officers body seemed to stiffen and i could
see his lips come together in a thin line

my merchant said the
officer suddenly his voice cold
and harsh it sticks in my mind
that i have seen your face before
and not across the counter of a shop but
across a table you perhaps remember me
danby is my name of duroures

  you are mistaken said the viscount
i never saw you before

  he was quite calm and had not even
changed color the officer made a slight
sign to his men who moved forward a little
and began to spread about us at that i
laid hand on sword

  i might have believed you said the
officer sneering only your friend here
hath been fidgeting wild these five minutes
and now is ready to draw and have at us
though there is no occasion save in his own
mind

  the viscount threw a glance at me an

angry startled glance and the officer
thereupon knew that he had us he lugged
out a pistol but one of his troopers got be-
tween him and the viscount and reached

over t to seize my companion the vis-
counts sword leaped and the man drew
back howling trying to draw sword with
his left hand the others rushed forward
with a great scattering of mud and one went
to his knees in the wallow in front of me
nor did he ever mount horse again

  i had scarce plucked my sword out of him
and his horse was plunging to his feet when
there came a wild yell from the field be-
side the road and the driving of hoofs
i could hear steel clashing where the vis-
count was holding off two troopers and
the other and the officer who could not get
at me because of the mired horse stopped
to listen

  there was a shout from the two that
fought with the viscount and i saw that
they had him down and were slashing at
him from the saddle immediately mad-
dened by the sight and thinking that i had
little longer to five and regretting that i
should die in this reckless brawl instead
of on a field of battle i went for the two
men before me with the picinino uplifted

  there was no further sound of voices
from the field nothing save thudding hoofs
i had no time for thought as to what they
might signify for the third trooper was
upon me and his first slash very near dis-
armed me after that i was a little more
on my guard and somewhat apprehensive
as to how my wind would last and as to
the state of my wrist after so many weeks
on the flat of my back

  i had little work to do however for the
man that was fighting me had no skill with
his sword only to lash and smash and try
to beat my sword out of my hand by the
very power of his own arm his sword
was of that curved pattern such as their
horse use and was not so long as mine nor
perhaps as fine steel

ms however as he was mounted and i not
he had the advantage of me and i was
enough put to it to save my head also and
beyond the footing was extremely poor
like standing in glue but i was lucky
enough to sever his bridle rein by a lucky
cut so that he had to gather the short end
in his hand and get his horse in control
again before he could attack me

  i had my back against the diligence as
the bold dragoon

 much as i could to keep the officer from
 taking me from behind and i had some
 thought of the other two and expected to
 hear them chopping down on me any min-
 ute for the man that fought with me i
 could not reach him with my sword for i
 was too busy keeping him from reaching
 me however having got up the end of his
 rein he spurred forward against me once
 more and i putting the picinino in guard
 awaited him of a sudden he gave a cough
 and i saw two blades of steel shoot out of
 his breast and cross each other for all the
 world as if he had folded his arms

   it was a long moment before i had the
 sweat out of my eyes and my dull mind to
 work and then i perceived that there was
 a horse lying dead on the far side of the
 road and under him the officer of the patrol
 my own enemy was in the mire and his
 horse gone into the ditch where he was
 cropping grass the two that had fought
 with the viscount lay one atop the other
 and it needed no leach to tell that they had
 drunk their last mug of beer it was much
 lighter and across the field one could see
 wet woods and the roofs of a village as
 for the newcomers they were six horsemen
 who were plucking their cloaks about their
 faces and pulling down their hats

   good morrow to you sir said one
 who seemed to be the leader i thought
 yesterday that you were no friend of ours
 but since you seem to be unfriends with
 the british also i begin to think i was
 wrong

   i said nothing in reply but continued to
 watch him

   we are not after your purse said he
 we were going our way peacefully for
 we are not men that poke our noses into
 every comer where we hear swords clashing
 but your officer was eager enough to see
 what made so much noise when we were
 only hurrying to be shut of you and seeing
 us cried out and there was nothing to do
 but battle with him

   i am grateful enough to you for saving
 me though the battle was none of my
 seeking i answered him

   would you care to join us suggested
 one of the men catch up one of these
 loose horses and come along

   the others frowned heavily upon him
 and muttered that their party was far too
 large now and the like but i cut in

i am an honest traveler said i a

wounded soldier going to his home by the
best means that he can and i have no need
to fly like a thief because i have been set
upon by some drunken germans i am
thankful for your offer most thankful but
i can not ride with strangers and i have
a companion who is perhaps wounded to the
death who must be looked to moreover
if i may say it i will be much safer by my-
self than riding in the company of a band of
horsemen who set upon a patrol of the allied
troops and slaughter them with no apparent
reason

  this is fine talk for one whos wizened
would have been slit had we not rescued
him cried one

  i am always ready to make good any
word of mine on foot or horseback i
replied

  so cried this one whipping a sword
from beneath his cloak ye ha come to
the right shop for a comb cutting my
cockerel

  not another word shouted the leader
spurring his horse forward you forget
yourself he said sternly to his follower

  now turning to me where is this
companion you speak of it is possible
that we might give him some assistance

  without a word i led them to where the
viscount had lain when i last saw him the
roadway was all stamped and torn and
pools of rain had collected already in the
hollows with little threads of blood in
them the two hanoverians lay as they
had fallen but there was no sign of the
viscount

  one of these was dead when we came
up said the leader looking solemnly at
me did you see any more when you
engaged

  two of the company who had the ap-
pearance of servants shook their heads
and one spoke in what i took to be french
though it was most harsh and unusual
sounding for that tongue

  you say you had a companion an-
other of the party asked and you are
very sure he was wounded

  i saw him on the ground and these
others thrusting at him i answered
but where he could have gone unless they
stamped him out of sight under the mud i
have no idea

  it is time we were on our way said the
leader and i can give a shrewd guess as
to who your friend is i would be more
adventure

than passing glad to see him but he would
get himself out of sight like a fox to his
earth the instant he clapped eye on us
ill mind this meeting

  here he gave me the very barest sort of
a bow and leaving the road for the field
where the going was easier rode off fol-
lowed by his company as for me i
was so weary from the fight and so per-
plexed as to what had come of the viscount
that i could scarce stand and went over
toward the diligence to lean against it
the drivers were sitting very white-faced
on their horses and indicated to me by
signs to get in and they making prepara-
tions to move on if i did not i clambered
on no sooner had the wheels made their
first turn than a bale of goods went one
way and a roll of hides the other and the
viscount peered out at me very ruefully

  now what i cried in astonishment
are you alive or dead how did you get
here

  i am alive said he sure enough
by the skin of bartholomew i am very near
death though i was in the mud and
those louting beer swillers poking at me and

one gets down to have a better cut and so
gave me the chance of a thrust

  were you there when the six came on

the field

  i was there when they started to come
on but not when they came i know
them furthermore i know when i have
had enough i got me under a roll of
hides

  i had to laugh at this though i was
rather angry for if the newcomers had
seen fit to pick a quarrel with me and had
we had a fight the viscount under a roll
of hides would have been little help i said
as much to him

  ah there would have been no fight
said he they were all goggling at you
and one was patting the dead hussars
pouch to see if it contained aught to drink
so i just got up into the wagon as fast as i
might

 do you owe those men money i
asked

  well not money but something of the
sort said he and then would speak no
more to me but held his peace chewing
upon his fingers

punchers fancy

by harold willard gleason

theres jest one spot on earth for me

  no shady nook beneath no tree

    no city nor no quiet town

    no woods nor desert red-an-brown

    no hearth nor home-though home is fine-
    this spot i nominate as mine

    the one spot that all others fades

    is this-the well-known ace of spades

    a puncher most folks will agree

    is small shucks in societee

    these dinin-room-an-marble-hall
    affairs dont make me yearn a-tall

    but sometimes when ive got my pay
    an ride to town up yuma way

    one club would be a savin grace

    but only one-and that the ace

    i	aint an hotnbre mad for show
    like faro mike an utaw joe

    a fancy saddle well an fine

    but rings an sparklers-not for mine

    and yet beneath the karsene lamp
    that lights the board in murphys camp

    one solitaire would suit me grand

   a dimond ace-within my hand

    theres many fellers cant abide
    this life of roamin high an wide

    a red-lipped smile a blue-eyed look

    their hats are hung--upon one hook

    now female women sure are sweet

    to dance with them i call a treat

    to kiss sometimes is no disgrace

but heart-stuff no sir-cept the ace

and so you see my wants aint grand

    four little items in my hand

    a single club not swell or smart

    one little rosy lonesome heart

    the only dimond ill abide

    the modest ace o spades beside

    but if these wishes should come true

    ill bet my shirt to see them through

certain codes have at us more
swiftly in the solemn places of the
earth-the sea the forest the des-
ert as an instance retribution
in the world of men complex forces arrest
and ofttimes abrogate the doling out of
justice while the solemn places are pretty
generally good pay

  it lacked ten minutes of nine oclock in
the morning when gedge stopped in the
street between the two school buildings
gedge was a state highway patrolman he
was a young fellow of twenty-eight with
sandy hair and keen blue eyes eyes that
had as much to do with a ready smile as
had his lips

  he smiled now at the school children and
they smiled in return for to them he repre-
sented an authority even higher than the
teachers with his brave gold star and his
sleek whip-cord uniform even as gedge
smiled a huge green roadster its pilot the
sole passenger flashed like the shiver of a
palm leaf from a side street there was a
scream of burning rubber and the vision
quite blurred and incredible of a hurtling
white figure that stopped at the curb in the
strange ungainly posture of abrupt death

  all of this in a twinkling life seemed
suspended but in all the monumental in-
ertia there was one point of movement
that the green roadster it wavered for a
moment uncertainly then with a wail of
gears shot away

  the driver of the roadster had the ad-
vantage of gedge who was obliged to

start his motorcycle and to exert caution
in threading the street teeming with ter-
rorized children

  hence the roadster was two blocks dis-
tant and rounding a corner before gedge
had a clear street the officer did not
attempt to track the other but cut across
town and his acuity was rewarded in three
blocks by a glimpse of the other gedge
then closed in but reached the outskirts of
the city before the murderer was again in
sight the roadster crossed the santa fe
tracks and took to the cajon pass high-
way

  this was precisely the decision gedge had
hoped the other would make not that the
man in making for the mojave desert was
running into a dead-set trap perforce the
hour fairly assured him an unobstructed
road and the pace was so swift that for
gedge to pause and telephone ahead was
perhaps to lose his quarry on a side road

  the officer fired three times but it was
difficult to get within range the roadster
was a super-car several times gedge noted
that the driver was clipping off a deadly
seventy on the straightaway stretches

  it is twenty-eight miles to cajon pass
summit and fifteen more to the end of the
pavement at the little desert town of
victorville there the transcontinental
highway swings north to barstow but
another road takes a course southeast cross-
ing the trickle that is the mojave river
flinging itself over gaunt twin peaks and
out upon the immeasurable desert floor
good pay



  the barstow highway with its railroad
towns meant to the man capture or flight to
the inhospitable mountains-the other com-
manded he had cast the die irrevocably
he might have stopped at the school and
taken two years but with the newspapers
crusading with public opinion aroused it
was win now or meet the end fortunately
these were stolen license plates the man
thought smiling coldly in the winging
moments

  in victorville he slewed from the pave-
ment into the sand of a side street to avoid
the main corner of the town and elude

pursuit from more than this -dogged

officer

  gedge attempted to follow and spilled
breaking a collar bone he was up in a
moment and saw his prey crossing the
bridge at the narrows and climbing the
serpentine road up the twin peaks gedge
was sick and dizzy but he mounted his un-
damaged motorcycle before the few strag-
gling townspeople caught the significance of
the chase he had meant to pause a mo-
ment and enlist automobile aid but the
force of his fall had stripped him of ordered
thought save the one obdurate mind that
he was on an inexorable mission

  gaining the pass between the gaunt twin
peaks gedge beheld the roadster leaving
the winding hillside road and hurling a
cyclone of dust behind as it fled out into the
desert the dust settled reluctantly save
for that gedge might have done better the
road was fairly hard with few sand holes
though it wound through the manzanita and
buckthorn without apparent purpose

  the rider clung precariously to his handle
bars savage thrusts of pain in his shoulder
seemed to infect him with their own mad-
ness white-hot stabs of pain in his eyes
seemed to illumine the dust-choked roadway
that he might stave off ultimate disaster

  one dry-lake bed and gedge was done
but the roadster turned to the left at a fork
in the road gedge caught glimpses of it and
its furious dust cloud winding up a sloping
mesa he saw by his motorcycle clock that
it was ten oclock he was astonished at the
dragging of time

  the road grew worse even as gedge
despaired he fought desperately on the
cylinders of his machine smoked in the
morning heat and seared the flesh of his
knees but he would not quit he could not
quit-a sob shook him-he could not quit

  this seemed a fearful dream this smoth-
ering blanket of yellow swirling torturing
like tongues of yellow flame forced by a
hurricane blast under a vellow skv

  gedge sobbed again in agony but he
thought of the mother of the little girl in
san bernardino he thought of the world
of men of the complex forces that arrest
and ofttimes abrogate the doling out of
justice-yellow dust for instance and the
failing sinews of a man and a super-car
streaming through the golden morning

  he did not think it in just that way but
all of those words were in his simple speak-
ing of gods name

  suddenly the dust was dissipated and he
saw the roadster a quarter of a mile ahead
they were crossing a hard lava outcropping
madly gedge turned the throttle bar he
gained drew within fifty feet of the roadster
and again opened fire with his automatic

  his shots were wild they were making
perhaps thirty miles an hour abruptly the
big car seemed to reverse its movement
gedge in a twinkling perceived the illusion
saw the man had applied his brakes to
wreck him

  gedge could not stop but he could do
better for his adversary than hit his tire
rack he saw that in a flashing moment
and swung slightly to one side there was a
deafening crash as the motorcycle tore the
right rear wheel from the roadster and
there was a flash of light in gedges brain
more dazzling than any desert sunlight

  gedge regained consciousness some hours
later to behold the man lying not far distant
he blinked stupidly for the man was dead
not until he had bathed his head with
water from the radiator did he divine the
truth then he saw the crushed form of a
homed rattlesnake

  the man gedge thought must have
been so terrified he had even neglected to
kill gedge

  then gedge stared at the sand and
laughed crazily it was of course absurd
this imagery that came to him for the bite
of the rattler must have been only incidental
to molestation-mother love is not an ophi-
dian trait yet he knelt unsteadily and in-
spected more closely a rock which had been
overturned and blinked his eyes at the
imprint of a foot which had inadvertantly
ground into the earth two tiny sidewinders
no longer than pencils young of the serpent
which had visited death upon the vandal
author of to beat the band heads in a noose etc

disappointment contended

with elation in the bosom of peth-
bridge barclay apprentice nat-
uralist it was a regular main
bout of a soul-struggle mirrored in the pair
of frank blue eyes in horn-rimmed show-
cases and proven by the slump of the usu-
ally well-squared back and muscular young
shoulders

  pethbridges adequate feet pressed long-
ingly on the terra firma of british guiana
he shuddered as he gazed out across the
harbor of georgetown upon the bounding
the awfully bounding main he had so re-
cently quit must he put to sea again so
soon half hoping he had misapprehend-
ed he moved farther out of the suns glare
and read through again the dispatch from
his idolized chief

   you can not therefore join me at this time in the
interior the fruits of the first expedition rare
specimens indeed of south american mammals
reptiles and birds may not long survive their
cramped temporary quarters in georgetown ad-
vices from the zoos which are the consignees report
them anxious to receive the fauna and we have
good reason to fear the rivalry of harbeck who is
said to have made some very successful collections
and may anticipate us in the markets

  secure shipping at once my boy and escort the
specimens to new york with all the care for which
your training qualifies you improve your mind
with study of them en route and be assured that you
shall form a part of the next expedition which coin-
cides with a leave of yours i place this consider-
able scientific and monetary responsibility on you
with confidence

  believe me

your friend and mentor

joab estill

  the reader crumpled the letter into a
pocket of his linen suit he eyed the de-
merara river that trail into the mysteries
and fascinations of the jungle and again he
eyed the obnoxious ocean disappoint-
ment scored a knock-down blow on the
solar plexus of the elation of responsibility

  drat it swore young mr barclay fer-
vently and moved off on still uncertain sea
legs toward a cafe for something medicinal
to settle his stomach and his disappoint-
ment

  secure shipping-that was the matter he
must first attend to he mused as he sat at a
table and sipped a beverage recommended
as sure to settle anything after all there
could not be a whole lot more to that than
hiring a taxi you just went down to the
waterfront and picked out a steady com-
fortable-looking craft asked the captain if
she rode easily and what the charges were
loaded on your baggage got in and sailed

  pethbridge prepared to go and to do so
he gulped the rest of his drink hastily it
burned distressingly

  at the pained expression upon the coun-
tenance of pethbridge a voice croaked from
the next table-

  beware of rum

  pethbridge saw a small slight man with
a weatherbeaten face grown sallow he
wore a goatee a sad expression and nau-
tical attire

  beware of rum young feller he croaked
again

  thanks awfully i will next time the
apprentice naturalist replied gratefully


capn noah takes command



  rums ruining me confessed the
stranger i was goin to take on a cargo
of it here planned to put out loaded to the
scuppers couldnt have held another
barrel

   and you were just warning me against a
glass of it pethbridge gasped

  i dont drink i meant ship it the
other said sadly but i sez to myself
capn riker if you load the ossa with
guiana rum with that crew you got aboard

her therell be - and homicide on the

high seas for you rightfully and wisely
know-and youve plainly informed the

crew emselves that theyre the most-

  at the flow of red-hot invective and
masterly characterization that ensued
pethbridges ears burned worse than his
throat had finally the conflagration
ceased the little man stopping for breath

   you mean to say they are tough peth-
bridge ventured

  the captain answered even more sadly-
  that was my general drift

for several minutes young mr barclay
was lost in reflection then he asked-
captain are they kind to animals

  the little man took a deep breath he
seemed about to enter on further reference
to his crew and pethbridge drew back
nervously but he remarked laconically-
maybe thats a good point i overlooked
i ask because i need a boat the young
scientist explained

   the ossas as trim a little schooner as
youll find

   id like to encourage a good boat

  my ships free as i told you i
wouldnt load a rum cargo now cant get
nothing else ill sign reasonable

  all right im in charge of a load of
animals collected by mr estill the noted
zoologist to be delivered as soon as pos-
sible in new york but are you sure your
crew wont give trouble

   the captain drew his small frame erect
im not feeling at my best-touch of the
fever you get in these parts and im not
heavy-fisted he acknowledged but with
no rum aboard but jest a cargo of perfectly
nachural animules that aint pink striped or
purple polka-dotted ill guarantee to con-
trol my men by word of mouth young feller 
i dont doubt it for a minute sir peth-
bridge hurried out let us make the ar-
rangements

  they did and soon were on their way

through the sun-baked streets to the
wharves where the prospective supercargo
desired to inspect the broadness of beam of
the ossa and note her promise of stability
before closing the deal

ii

          the good ship ossa was working
up into the caribbean after some
very handy sailing aided by
sr - winds which were favorable but
almost too boisterous in the opinion of mr
pethbridge barclay naturalist that or-
dinarily hale and husky young man found
himself exceedingly indisposed at the slight-
est motion of the ship and spent all possible
time flat on his back in his bunk with
heroic devotion to duty he roused himself
ever and anon and drove himself down into
the hold to see to the welfare of his
zoological charges from that ordeal he
emerged pale and wan but with a sense of
pride for thus far in the voyage he had lost
only a toucan and a pair of swimming mar-
supials that he estimated as a creditable
performance for any naturalist who felt as
unnatural as he did

   pethbridge also attended the bedside of
captain riker who had succumbed to the
ravages of the fever he had contracted in
guiana while the little man was not
dangerously ill and seemed to know what
remedies to use he was very weak and his
recovery slow however he would oc-
casionally summon the boatswain bean
bracket to his cabin and roar forth a vivid-
ly garnished order

   just to let em know i aint lost my
voice he explained to pethbridge mr
storrs is a capable mate when it comes to
navigatin hell bring you and your zoo
to new york all right but hes too con-
founded mild and soft-spoken to put the
fear of a righteous wrath to come into the

sin-sunk hearts of this- bent and long

overdue collection of cutthroats of a crew

  i trust you overestimate their ten-
dencies pethbridge assured worriedly
but i must confess i have my misgivings
too that fellow they call red and that
spanish joe- i fear they are hard char-
acters and i doubt that they like my
animals

   you doubt right they dont like em
a little bit for why because they keep
thinkin of the rum that might have been


adventure

stowed in the place of all them watch-you-
call-ems

  i simply ignore them i dont enter
into conversation with them

  hold close to that course young feller
youre as soft-spoken as storrs only worse
keep em away from the medicine-chest
rum and watch out for bean bracket the
bosun whos got some brains well what
is it mister

  storrs the mate had entered the cabin
he spoke up hesitatingly

  capn a committee of the crew has been
to me to complain say they cant get any
sleep what with the howlin monkeys and
the screechin what-nots makin the night
hidjous 

  it is -s own racket the captain

admitted cant pipe em down none
young feller can you no i spposed not
well mister you tell that committee to tell

the crew with my compliments to-

  the mate hastily interposed they say
theyd like a little medicine to make em
sleep capn

 medicine huh rum

  the captain rose on his bed of sickness
and commenced a smoking sizzling biog-
raphy of his crew he fastened on them the
seven deadly sins in rapid succession he
affirmed there wasnt a law of god or man
that had not suffered a compound fracture
at the impious hands of each and every one
of them he cast sinister reflections on
their genealogy for generations back he
inferred that a snakes stomach was a lofty
affair compared with their mental and
moral characteristics he conducted them
on a sort of cooks tour of dantes inferno
and proclaimed they would distinctly lower
the tone of the place

  and dont let em get at that rum in
the medicine chest he finished as he sank
back exhausted on his bunk

the little captains voice had
been stentorian to reach a pos-
sibly listening crew and regulate
their morale accordingly but
he had neglected to pipe down in time
when he referred to the dangerous item
in the medicine-chest forgetting himself
in the artistry of his invocation he had as
good as issued an invitation

  pethbridge feared the worst and con-
fided his fears to storrs who only shrugged
his shoulders helplessly and bent over his

charts that afternoon after the mess-
boy had reported the skipper weaker the
crew made bold to realize the fears of the
naturalist for him

  the first intimation he had of the ca-
lamity was a hubbub forward which resolved
itself into a chant by the educated boat-
swain bean was howling gleefully

         fifteen men on a medicine-chest

      yo-ho-ho-

  mr storrs began bawling querulous orders
at the crew who paid them not the slightest
degree of attention but began broaching
more of the kits stimulant evidently ample
and lusty the captain tossed fitfully and
impotently in his bunk and nothing pre-
venting high carnival was held on the high
seas

  the seas were certainly too high for the
comfort of young mr pethbridge barclay
he felt disinclined to interfere with the crew
for more reasons than that he was with-
out authority besides what ever could he
say to them if he should speak out how
could he vie with that vocabulary of the
captains

  the sound of revelry by afternoon in-
creased and then the mischief in the drunk-
en crew began to break loose they went
below to the animal cages soon the rig-
ging was full of howling monkeys and
equally howling sailors bean and red
mounted llamas and attempted to race the
creatures around the deck spanish joe
clutching his sheath knife was in full pur-
suit of a rhea proclaiming aloud his desire
for a chicken dinner

  it was a most distressing sight from the
zoological standpoint which met the startled
eyes of pethbridge as he stared out of a
cabin port

  what could he do what could he say
that those wild men would listen to they
knew him as a silent fellow he had purpose-
ly kept his scholarly language very quiet
no use asking the captain what to say
his delivery wouldnt be convincing

  suddenly a loud chorus of squawks
bleats and screeches made pethbridge the
master of his mal de mer and the captain of
his tongue he leaped through the cabin
door and placed himself between the terri-
fied rhea and the bloody-minded spanish
joe dashing up on a llama bean bracket
gave a yell of delight

  why its capn noah himself he cried
capn noah takes command

i

come on cap make this-circus of

yours do its tricks

the naturalist expanded his husky chest
unhand that llama you he roared
you pied wagtail you talamanca jay
you you spectacled parrotlet and pink-
necked fruit pigeon of a barbary ape

  bean gasped and fell off the hama to the
deck where he seemed unable to rise peth-
bridge thrust his face toward the gaping
spanish joe took another long breath and
began again

  you black-headed manniken he in-
sulted you gray shrike and kankajou
if youd harmed that bird id have knocked
you for a row of common macaques you
son of a cereopsis goose you havent got
the sense of a groove-billed ani

  spanish joe gave- way muttering warm-
ing to his work pethbridge turned on the
surprized red

  there you are you reddish seedeater
he stormed you crimson pileated finch
you mexican red-bellied squirrel speak
up you chattering chachalaca you blue-
footed galapagos booby youre nothing
but a yellow-faced grassquit-thats what
you are and if you dont like the name
ill classify you further

  pethbridge felt storrs at his elbow

  rake em with just a few more of them
wonderful cusswords mister begged the
mate in admiring tones if theres any
argument left after that ill end it

  he laid his hands on a pair of heavy re-
volvers in his belt

  the crew shrank back sobered sheep-
ishly

  the rest of you wombats bandicoots
and white-faced bulbuls get those animals
back in their cages and handle with care
pethbridge finished strongly

boatswain bracket rose from the deck to
lead the work of recapture on his hard
face was stamped deep respect and wonder
he touched his forelock to pethbridge
aye aye sir capn noah he said

hi

jfk the ossa sped rapidly on her

	voyage northward rapidly and
smoothly to the good content of
her zoologist - supercargo he
spent the long days in the care and study of
his dumb charges and none of them was
dumber than he he had spoken to the

point and was generally acknowledged to
have said several mouthfuls wherefore he
rested on his laurels and preserved a most
golden silence

  evenings he immersed himself in books
from a long black box placed in the main

  captain riker now up and about bent
on the student a look less friendly a regard
decidedly jaundiced this youngster had
beaten him at his own game true he had
risen nobly to an emergency but he need
not have hog-tied and horse-whipped the
kings english in such a completely superior
and original manner that the crew shad no
respect any more for their skippers old-
fashioned long-tried cussing this voyage
with a lot of freak animals wasnt paying so
much that it was worth the loss of prestige
maybe that cargo of guiana rum would
have been better after all

  what are you all the time readin for
young feller the captain asked sourly

  to improve my fragmentary knowledge
of the animal kingdom captain peth-
bridge answered serenely now heres an

interesting bit about the giant whydah-

  to-with the giant what-is-it the

skipper fumed

  why captain its a very interesting
bird perhaps you are keener though on
something like the tasmanian devil those
little fellows may bring as high as three
hundred dollars in the zoo market
they-

  i aint strong for your outlandish ani-
mules young feller

  perhaps if you knew a little more about
them captain pethbridge suggested gent-
ly now theres the lapland lemming
extraordinary creature ive made up a
little rhyme about him-at once amusing
and scientific allow me to quote

   lets not be too quick in condemning
     that queer little creature the lemming

          he migrates till he

         goes and drowns in the sea

    without any hawing or hemming

do you like it

  no the captain snorted


adventure

  he had the look of a man who has swal-
lowed a lighted stick of dynamite and is
endeavoring to smother the detonation

  but i would like it if you would come
out on deck and support me he said

this-crew takes no stock in what i

say any more unless their capn noah i
around to back me up a fine state oi
affairs

  pethbridge followed him on deck they
were not far off the new jersey coast now
a fleet of ships hove to had been sighted

  the rum fleet the captain exclaimed
incautiously

  the word flew around like wildfire the
crew crowded to the rail restlessly and
thirstily the man at the wheel gradually
veered the ossas course toward that ribald
sisterhood riker looked craftily at peth-
bridge who stared back at him speechless
soon the ossa was within hail

  ahoy the schooner halooed a buc-
caneer from the nearest sloop

  the captain answered the hail the
crew licked their lips at the sight of the cases
piled high on the deck

  wanta make some money invited the
genial pirate just lie to for a couple
days and serve as a store ship yachts due
in here from the bahamas tomorrow loaded
deep with stuff she cant stick around
let her transship to you all you gotta do
is hold it for a day or so till we kin run it
ashore what say

  the captains eyes glinted

  youre on he shouted back then be-
gan to bark out orders

  with an outburst of frantic cheering the
crew sprang to obey in a trice the ossa
was hove to admitted to membership in the
rum fleet

  poor pethbridge only found his tongue
when he was alone again in the cabin with
the captain

  this wont do he protested indig-
nantly youre getting us into all kinds of
trouble remember the rum outside of
that it isnt fair to delay a day longer mak-
ing port ive lost several mammals and
birds already in this long voyage more
will die every day more at sea my chief
trusts me to get them through this will
ruin my reputation

  the appeal in the eyes behind the horn-
rimmed glasses was pathetic but the cap-
tain only cackled

  go jump in the ocean young feller he

urged whatchuh goin to do about it
huh capn noah

  the not inefficient fists of young mr
barclay clenched but he held his peace
he was well practised in that

by dusk the crew had bor-
rowed a supply of the liquid re-
freshments which so copiously
surrounded them and were begin-
ning to let er roar after a long abstinence
adopting a laissez faire not to say a let-
her-rip policy captain riker retired to the
smug seclusion of his cabin

  in the shelter of a companionway the
highly worried pethbridge met the reticent
and retiring mate storrs from the deck
rolled in the raucous racket of a sea-chantey

  this is terrible mr storrs peth-
bridge declared it isnt square

   youre right its not was the comfort-
ing reassurance of the mate the old
mans gone back on the articles he signed
we all stand to land in the brig or worse
its splendid to have you feel this way
about it the naturalist said

  but what can us two do the mate
groaned even with your command of
bang-up cusswords riker skippers this
ship and the crews fast gittin orey-eyed
well fix the cap tain first pethbridge as-
serted with sudden determination come
on

   the struggle in the cabin was brief the
little captain was helpless in the muscular
arms of young mr barclay storrs devoted
all his attention to the gagging

   id better make it three layers of gag
the mate grunted what he wouldnt say
if he could whew

   im tying him up tight the other ad-
ded if he ever gets loose hell have every
rum runner in the fleet down on us

  they laid the trussed-up riker close
against the outer wall near the door so that
a glance in would not discover him peth-
bridge moved his big black box pver in front
of him

  now for the crew storrs urged and
quick while theyre still conscious and can
work the ship in you tell em mr bar-
clay im comparative tongue-tied
squaring his shoulders the naturalist
strode out among the roistering crew and
opened on them the floodgates of his scien-
tific vocabulary not neglecting the latin
it was masterly and withering and the crew
capn noah takes command



tat silent under it while it played about
heir heads

   but in the first pause bean the boat-
swain broke in with a crafty leer

    sall right ol man noah but we got

orders from the real capn who the--

are you anyway - animul keeper

-zoo-ol-zoo-ol-zoolgust what call

you got to call us names like that wheres
capn wheres real capn cmon boys
they put him away

  my - i forgot my guns storrs

muttered in pethbridges ear beat it
for the cabin

  they ran for it and would have made it
with time to spare but spanish joe had
been behind them he was there first
grinning he placed his bulk in front of the
cabin door and raised one hairy arm like a
hammer

  very deliberately pethbridge removed
his horn-rimmed glasses then he stepped
in and swung

  spanish joes head snapped back he
slumped to his haunches on the deck like a
trained bear an expression of dazed sur-
prize spread over his face it was dupli-
cated by one on pethbridges

   pethbridge and storrs leaped inside but
in the gloom the hooked-back door could
not be released before the rush of the crew
had wedged bean and red in the narrow
doorway

  then pethbridge thrust forward the big
black box grasping its lid

   get out he yelled or ill let every
snake in here loose

   seemingly from the box a terrific hissing
and sputtering arose

   with a shriek of terror red flung him-
self back into the press of the crew behind
him they tumbled over each other in
wild disorder

  but bean bracket the educated boat-
swain stood his ground his still keen
eyes had pierced the shadows of the cabin
he bent a sinister knowing look on his
adversaries

  you cant fool me he jeered in a
sobered voice thought i was boiled
didnt yuh not yet not yet i want to
tell yuh i know a snake when i dont see
one-if you get what i mean say whats
that heap there

  the heap proceeded to identify itself
having bitten through his gags captain
riker became loudly and luridly articulate

bean stepped forward and unbound him

  lock up those two - the captain

commanded hoarsely theyll hang for

 mutiny

  aye aye sir the boatswain replied
 and now sir perhaps something to revive
 you after that experience-

  the cabin door slammed on the naturalist
 and the mate the key grated in the lock
 sounds of redoubled conviviality rolled in in
 waves the captain and the crew were
 toasting each other

  this is terrible pethbridge groaned
 storrs nodded a sad assent

  the racket without increased they had
 reached the singing stage again above it
 all rose reds bull bellow

       i went to the animules fair

all the birds and the beasts was there

the ole baboon by the light of-

  mr storrs pethbridge cried in ago-
 nized tones that means theyll soon be
 at my animals again

  evening wore on into black night the
 uproar increased decks were pounded by
 feet in a bacchanalian rout somebody
 took up the song again-

i went to the animules fair-

   they danced to it chanted it at the top of
 lusty lungs

      the monkey he got drunk
      and climbed up the elephunts trunk-

  to the listening prisoners came the rau-
 cous shout of the educated boatswain

  what ho m hearties below below
 belay monkeysh not drunk yet cant
 climb elephunts trunk thout a drink
 below decks to animals fair

  the creaking of hatch covers came to the
 ears of pethbridge he strained in vain at
 the stout cabin door

  but the key turned in the lock in the
 doorway stood the captain frightened so-
 bered

  stop em he begged weakly gone
 too far awful sorry

  pethbridge sprang on deck at his com-
 mand the captain and the mate flung on
 the hatches battened them down peering
 through a ventilating shaft he saw the one
 lantern of the roistering crew wink out
 the blackness of the hold caused a sudden
 hush except for the noises of the various
 animals


adventure

  in a stentorian voice the naturalist
hailed

  below there he shouted careful of
those cages i wont be responsible for
what happens to you you laughed at the
idea of snakes in the cabin but its the
truth youre keeping company down there
with fine specimens of an anaconda and a
boa constrictor

  the boas have no poison fangs but their
powers of crushing are great they are
able to swallow whole animals the size of
a goat or so i wonder whos going to be
the goat down there the boa constrictor
attains a length of twelve feet or more
but the anaconda is much larger the

anaconda with its prey-

  from the terrifying darkness rose a few
whimpers of terror then some maudlin
cries for mercy some thick-voiced promises
to behave but bean bracket laughed

  that you mr bracket pethbridge
spoke up quickly you wont fail to ap-
preciate meeting the little family of vam-
pires in your midst i noticed their cage
was not so secure the other day you know
the old superstitions about their being the

ghosts of terrible women who rise from the
grave and drain the hearts blood of men
a fool there was eh just superstition
of course these are only blood-sucking
south american vampire bats they only
fasten on your throat when youre fast
asleep everybody down there feel good
and wide awake

  with the moans and pleas of the crew
mingled the weird eerie jungle cries of the
animals again the voice of pethbridge
broke in and dominated it all with some
nerve-wracking bit of his naturalistic lore

  after an hour a pale and shakey crew
were released unsteadilythey worked the
ossa into port

  her master captain riker next day en-
tertained ship news reporters who came for
the story of the valuable zoo consign-
ments

  all credits due to the young feller in
charge of the animules the captain an-
nounced magnanimously it was him
tamed one of the roughest crews that ever
sailed why the night fore we made

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

prank ellis woke up one bright morning in
california gultch to find himself a total failure
through the winter of  he had trailed from one
holding to another until the gold mining season was
at a close he was penniless and he had a sister
back east who believed him a great success there
was nothing left for him to do but take a job over
the lunch counter of the great western hotel
under the hand of george skillings boss

  as he was serving his first meal to a group of
miners traders and mine employees he uncon-
sciously burst into a plaintive song

  stop that-racket the boss roared

  from that time on he was the singing pilgrim

  the pilgrim became a drawing card nate goss
the gambler rabbit the indian doomed to death
by his tribe on a charge of killing a brother tribes-
man ancient days an old-time placer miner
bones a man with a delusion of great prehistoric
beasts in the gulches-all fell into the lure of the pil-
grims voice

  whip king reputed to be the best wagon-train
boss between the river and the coast arrived in the
gulch with a starting crack of his monstrous whip
he had no special destination no special enemies
and he cared little for firearms but he proved to
be the friend of many restless men who fought
constantly many was the time that his long lash
sent men armed with six-shooters cowering in the
corner

  with the season almost ended and too many men
finding almost no gold things in california gulch
became a bit thick goss had a fight with charlie
dodge the monte gambler as a result of unfair
play and finally the pilgrim fought with his boss
the fight itself was inconsequential but a threat
loomed in the background when the pilgrim swore
vengeance

  that night skillings the boss was found with a
knife in his heart and the singing pilgrim was mis-
sing from california gulch

examinations of skillings effects brought to
light counterfeit money amounting to twenty
thousand dollars the mob almost in a frenzy
shouted-

  hang the pilgrimi hang the singing pilgrim

  and added to this they accused goss of being
implicated in the counterfeiting gang giving him a
chance of leaving town immediately or risking the
circumstances if he stayed he left

  with the aid of rabbit the pilgrim stole away
in the night an innocent outcast for many days
they wandered until the pilgrim lost the rabbit
when pursued by the utes the tribe of indians to
which the rabbit belonged certain death threat-
ened the pilgrim he was saved miraculously by
the reappearance of rabbit whom the tribe
worship as a god calling him the walking dead
man

  an outcast by the name of lomson who had
affiliated himself with the tribe also came into the
camp trouble began anew by mistake the pil-
grim and lomsom went into the sacred medicine
tent to smoke a pipe of tobacco out of the rain
the indians found them there and in his excite-
ment the pilgrim put a small idol in his pocket
which he had in his hand at the time of the indians
entrance

  the discovery of the loss of the idol put the camp
in a turmoil the pilgrim was gain accused and
threatened with death court was held and rabbit
promised that the idol would be restored with the
release of the pilgrim he was unsuccessful and
only through great stealth and cunning did the pil-
grim finally escape from the camp of his enemies

rut his escape only threw him into more violet
hands exhausted from travel and want of
food the pilgrim came to the cabin of jonathan
leaper an outlaw who offered to keep him over
night bill waggle also spending the night there
recognized the pilgrim but was turned out




adventure

  the reason for this came to light the next morn-
ing when leaper robbed the pilgrim bound him to
a mule and turned them both loose on the wild
rocky passes

  after a long period of intense suffering the pil-
grim was rescued by united states marshall farn-
ham and together they went back to the cabin and
captured leaper

  during this time goss arrived in denver where
he met whip king waggle

  before the pilgrim reached the city his sister
annie arrived from the east unexpectedly when
the pilgrim arrived he was sought out by goss who
made all arrangements for sister and brother to get
out of town before the pilgrim should be discovered
by the deputies whip king offered his ranch sev-
eral miles from the city and the pilgrim and his
sister were guided there

  goss following them strayed from the main trail
and came to de louges cabin where four men were
playing cards he was permitted to join in the
game and soon had most of the winnings en-
raged by defeat burt damon cheated and was ac-
cused by his pal snap damon stabbed snap
and started for goss who shot him through the
head goss collected the money he had won and
keeping himself covered from de louge and the
other men went out into the night

joss finally found his way to canon city from
where he hastened to pueblo stopping for a
brief call at the ranch where the pilgrim and annie
were living

  shortly after his departure delouge and his
two understudies snap and seth arrived searching

brother and sister stared in si-
lence at him as if scarcely sensing
 his words the girl was almost
incredulous as she slowly said
and i neednt ever be afraid again that
every horseman i see has come to take
frank away and i neednt keep awake
at night listening to learn if a rider is turn-
ing in here or going up or down the
valley

  frank found his tongue and excitedly
cried-

  think of it annie i can hold up my
head among folks tell who i am and where
i came from i can sing a song and not care
if they know im the singing pilgrim im
just ordinary folks again hooray

  and in his exuberance he threw back his
head and broke off to sing bright fields
beyond the swelling flood

  with her blue eyes blurred with tears the
girl turned her flushed face away and in a
scarcely audible voice asked-

  when did you go to canon city
night before last early in the morning
when i passed here replied goss

  and i heard your horse and was awake

for him annie sensed troubleand hotly said that
she did not know goss later on the same day
vince moore called and upon the first insult was
thoroughly beaten up by the pilgrim this proved
to be the turning point in the pilgrims weakness
of character

  i fear no man now he declared

  shortly after goss arrived in pueblo he met
lomsom who had deserted the utes for the season
he tried to interest goss in some placers that he
claimed to be known only to himself during cne
of their conversations they met a man who was
known as black bill cards followed black bill
cheated and a fight ensued during which bill
escaped into the darkness

  directly on top of this incident delouge ap-
peared and told goss that a duel would be the only
way to settle the trouble between them while
they were making plans for the fight they learned
that vince moore and a gang of his followers were
planning to attack ellis at his ranch to get revenge
for the beating he gave vince

  goss and delouge immediately forgot their own
quarrel and set out to cut off the plotters before
they came to the ranch

  out on the plains not far from the ellis place
the two factions met and open battle ensued in
which several of ellis enemies were slain a few
escaping

  delouge then declared that the duel with goss
was off maintaining that goss was licked already
when he let one of his men get away un-
scratched

  goss then turned his thoughts from the gambling
table to prospecting

fearing the old fear and you went by
without stopping

  youre a shrewd one annie cried her
brother id never had brains to think
of that after hearing nates good news of
course he went by without stopping what
made you do that nate

  trip was unexpected had to make it in
the night saved my call for this morning
and if id stopped i might have missed
whip king and wouldnt have learned you
are no longer wanted glibly answered
goss

  say nate babbled ellis i feel like a
prisoner for life whos suddenly been turned
loose never knew till now what a hold it
had on me

  and nothing now would suffice to express
his feelings except a stanza from sweet
betsy from pike

the girl faced goss and tried to explain
when i worked i tried to keep my face
to the window so i could look out if i had
to turn my back i was nervous till i could

face around in the day and at night-

  she hurried into her room and dosed the
door
pards



  ellis ceased his singing and gazed after
her for a moment then said

  hit the old girl pretty hard queer how
women cry when theyre happy but happi-
ness cant hurt any one

  and he returned to his song and sang
it with much feeling finally he broke off
to say

nate you brought me good luck from
the first talk we had up the side of the
gulch im much obliged you knojv that
shyness overcame him then he was
running on

  itll seem good to be called the singing
pilgrim again when they called me that
i used to think i was almost somebody
and yet who could have killed skillings
hush shell hear when do you two
want to start first travel in the spring i
suppose ill buy out your interest and put
some one on here to run the ranch you
have a paying proposition started your
share is worth good money id say as a

guess-

  the door of the girls room banged open
and she was before them her eyes blazing

  we have not a paying proposition
started she fiercely told them you
started it its your money weve been
living out of your money our share is
nothing yet

  but we three are partners insisted her
brother with a side glance at the account
book

  partners after weve done something to
make up for the money hes put in

  with a suddenness that astounded the
gambler she was out of her dramatic mood
and was smiling broadly and was marveling
to think of it its like being hit on the
head with a club to be cured of a sickness
everything was wrong with frank with me
with the world we went into hiding down
here you put in money mr frazer
helped with advice and out of what we
believed to be the worst sort of misfortune
weve really started to do something for our-
selves if we stay here and develop this
place we will have an interest in a paying
proposition but one thing is sure mr
goss youd never develop it i dont be-
lieve youd ever bother even to find some
one to take up the work so frank its
for you and me to get mr goss money
back with interest after thats done well
think about going back east

  ill be darned muttered her brother in

  

  great surprize how many times youve
said you wished we both were east the mis-
sissippi i was sure youd be the first to
toss up a hat and hurrah why annie im
not keen to pull out nothing in the east
for me of course well stay and not leave
old nate to pocket a loss

  just forget me and my loss goss re-
quested its seldom i take a loss i
shant on this place land values are sure
to go up here im sure to take a good profit
if never a crop is put in

  nonsense scoffed the girl you for-
get you dont own the land youre just
talking frank and i are agreed to remain
and carry out our plans

  goss face became very mobile and it was
a decided grin and not a smile that showed
his teeth he eagerly said

  if you two feel that way im confident
youll make this a handsome paying piece
of property ill guarantee i can arrange
with ancient days to sell on terms that can
easily be met now ill be jogging on
why youve just come cried the girl
im always just coming or going was
his whimsical reply but ill try to be
more neighborly i want to keep an eye on
those accounts im just remembering to
mention the fact im still thinking strong of
prospecting a bit next season down in the
hills south of the river perhaps that
country hasnt been overrun yet and from
talk at pueblo ive got the notion theres
gold to be found down there

  neither gold nor silver has been re-
ported down there gravely warned ellis

  none reported in california gulch until
a discovery was made there are lots of fat
lodes in the territory that a white man
hasnt struck a pick into yet i dont doubt
but that lomsom the white chief of the
utes could lead us to a dozen that no other
white man ever saw

  the wicked truth nate as sures youre
born readily surrendered ellis and if
you go im going just one more try
annie and im sure ill strike it rich
thats to be talked about she evaded
just now im interested in inducing mr
goss to stay to dinner

  but goss insisted he must be traveling
and invented several fictitious reasons for
an immediate departure as he talked she
studied him throughfully and for once his
poker face failed as a mask after he had
finished she quietly told him


adventure

  i dont know why you are in such a
hurry you havent said but go some
time youll feel like staying

  he mumbled further excuses and went
outdoors and mounted ellis eagerly called
his attention to the few improvements and
then remembered to inquire-

  hows luck these days

  so so if you mean cards if you mean
other things luck is bully i have an idea
that im slowly very slowly working out
of the card business perfectly honorable
you know perfectly moral but perhaps
too uncertain unless a man can always re-
main young

some farmers in the valley
sowed wheat in february and
march brought planting weather
for all frazer and his wife and
three neighbors gave two days work at the
ellis place mrs frazer and annie ellis
not only cooked the meals but found much
time to care for the many hens and to help
with the planting this kindly assistance
made it possible for ellis and his sister to
complete sowing all that frazer deemed
advisable for this their first year

  with the sun climbing higher each day
and the arkansas steadily rising as the
snow-water poured down from the moun-
tains there came the surge of spring opti-

mism to brother and sister the winter had
been like an indian summer a pleasant re-
lief from the stern cold of white months east
of the mississippi

  yet the voices of running waters the
budding and leafing of the trees and the
genial warmth of the sun supplied to each of
the young pioneers the belief that something
extremely good was always about to happen
this confidence mounted with the sun old
fears were forgotten the tragedy enacted

close by the ranch house was something

very far off

  then one day when the planting was
finished goss and an indian rode up to the
house annie eyed the swarthy complexion
and prominent cheek bones askance her
brother gave a yelp of joy and ran to shake
the indians hand and exclaim 

  the rabbit annie come here and meet
my friend the man who saved my life
how did you happen to meet him nate
the girl shook hands and wondered if the
man understood english

   it is good to see you miss ellis i like
your brother the rabbit told her

  she faltered a welcome taken aback by
his excellent english goss remarked
seems i am nobodys friend i might
as well be out in a snowstorm without any
blankets

  we are glad to see you partner she
demurely greeted after frank has shown
you about the place you both come in and
have something to eat

  she left them and frank proudly ex-
hibited the extent of their planting he
tried to learn the cause for the gamblers
coming but goss would say nothing until
they were indoors then he explained
the rabbit brought me a message from
lomsom white chief of the utes i told
you about lomsom trying to break away
from the indians last fall and being recog-
nized by pete dotson in pueblo and com-
pelled to run for it he went back to the
mountains and his indians now hes
broken away and is ready to try his luck
at gold mining he wants me to meet him
somewheres down on the huerfano the
rabbit knows just where hes waiting and
will guide me im also asked to bring
ancient days and joe hasty along

  you remember hasty as big bones only
he isnt crazy anymore and doesnt remem-
ber anything of california gulch frank
and youre included in the invitation lom-
som left it to me to pick the men he
insisted there should be no more than six
of us all told now the question is will it
be wise for you to make the trip after getting
such a fine start at farming if id known
how much land youd broken up and planted
i dont know as id have asked you

  land is good said the rabbit no
hunting for gold where corn and vege-
tables are planted its there where the
seed comes through the ground
pards



  id never forgiven you if youd passed
me by declared ellis ive said right
along id have one more try at prospecting
that lomsom ought to know where gold
can be found by your tell hes had the
run of the mountains for going onto three
years and knows places where white men
dont dare go if the rabbit thinks well
enough of it to quit hunting game to hunt
gold why shouldnt i try it while crops are
growing

  im to have two dollars a day as guide
and a sixth interest in whatever is found
explained the rabbit i wish to earn some
money for my folks

  annie was recalling her brothers gro-
tesque story of a man voluntarily returning
home to be executed and she fell to trem-
bling because of the inexorable tragedy of
it all goss perceived her emotion and said
if your sister is willing you can go if
not you cant

  the crops are in its simply a matter
of waiting and hoeing a bit insisted ellis
the girl asked goss

  is there any danger in this trip i mean
danger aside from the natural risks of
mining

  there shouldnt be any he readily re-
plied were going where no gold dis-
coveries have been made its far enough
among the hills to be away from the plains
indians the man lomsom is a white man
yet chief of a band of utes we should go
and do our work without meeting any one
really i cant see as its any more risky
than shooting prairie chickens but no one
can foresee the unexpected

  then frank shall go she decided i
will stay with the frazers mrs frazer is
a dear when will you start how long
will you be gone

  we must start a week from today as
my idea is to sell and not attempt to work
any lode we find id say we should be back
inside of six weeks if were lucky well
be back much sooner well start from
pueblo to escape being followed by those
who think every man with a pack-mule has
struck it rich the rabbit goes from here
to canon city to pick up ancient days and
joe hasty on his way to pueblo hell stop
here and get frank youll need your gun
and a horse frank im riding back to
pueblo today to arrange for the outfit
well take two pack-mules and the horses
we ride if youll be good enough to feed

 us the rabbit will be on his way hes in a
 hurry if ancient and hasty have left
 canon hell have to follow them

   you can eat very soon but just why
 are you anxious to have those two men
 inquired the girl as she began preparing
 a meal

   goss flushed and confessed

   joe hasty is said to be lucky im
 superstitious i fear and hasty wont go
 on any trip unless ancient is along while
 waiting for the rabbit to return you two
 will have time to make arrangements with
 the frazers

   but youre not riding to pueblo today
 objected ellis

   that was just talk added his sister
 he can stay here a few days or long enough
 to get acquainted with his third of the
 place

   goss compromised by agreeing ill wait
 over until morning my horse has earned
 that much rest

   the rabbit ate and without a word ran
 out to his horse and rode away he knows
 the white mans ways he reads ovur books
 and talks our lingo as well as we do and yet
 he is all indian mused goss looking after
 the receding figure i really believe hes
 rather fond of me i know he likes frank
 but off he goes without a word hes
 pleased you had him to dinner but off he
 goes without so much as a thank you

   he may be part white at times but he
 was red when he talked to the utes re-
 minded elhs with a little shiver

   that afternoon the three of them rode
 over to the frazer place and quickly ar-
 ranged for the girl to stay there early
 next morning goss started for pueblo the
 high spring sun bringing new hopes to him
 as it had to ellis to all colorado those
 who had fared poorly in  were now confi-
 dent of largesses from  veteran pros-
 pectors with three years of failure back of
 them renewed their faith and outfitted for
 another endeavor firmly believing that this
 season their luck would turn

   in crossing colorado this season the

 corps at the farmhouse known in history
 as chancellorsville saw stonewall jackson

adventure

 spring was creating the belief that the
 national dissension was nearing the end

        on the arkansas river ranch
l young ellis was lifted up and he
relieved his exuberance with much
singing his sister not so light
of heart believed he was thinking about
the prospecting trip but it was the spring
air that made him sing and hope one
morning while he was indulging in the
pathos of my old kentucky home his
mellow voice climbing like the lark his
sister came to the door and called out
three horsemen from the west one of
them looks like the indian you call the
rabbit

  he ran toward the road waving his arms
the indian lifted his open hand and came
on at a furious gallop ancient days gave
a wild whoop and tore madly by the in-
dian he was wearing new buckskins
heavily fringed and thoroughly looked the
mountain man freshly outfitted joe hasty
riding sedately as one who approaches
strangers kept back of the rabbit

  ancient had a practical purpose in racing
ahead of his two companions for his first
words to ellis were

  dont call him big bones hes his old
self again aint had a spell since you see
him last dont remember nothing about
you or about being in the gulch youre
meeting him for the first time pilgrim
howdy do maam you must be the
pilgrims sister mighty purty young
woman

  he dismounted and shook hands with
them and eyed the girl in open admiration
and declared

  purtys a picter lawdi but id move
beyond the river if id ever known they
grew em so purty back there

  the girl showed almost all her teeth as
she laughingly made him welcome then
turned to meet the indian and hasty the
latter gave no sign of having seen ellis be-
fore like the red man he was taciturn
ancient days did the talking for the three
of them the girl left them for her brother
to entertain while she hurried food to the
table the men wandered over the ranch
and ancient marveled at the plowed ground
and declared it beat all and that he never
dreamed stuff would grow there at the
end of an hours inspection he was talking
as volubly as ever ellis surmised the old

 fellow had fortified himself for the trip with
 several drinks in canon city for he talked
 almost unceasingly hasty told him-
 you oughter hog-out that voice of yours
 before long

   a purty gal always starts me talking
 loudly declared ancient im hungry to
 look at her again shes that pink-and-
 white

   he led the way to the house and immedi-
ately on entering he told the girl-

   takes nate goss to know a good bargain
 when he sees it

  he amused her and she liked him on
sight but his assertion caused her brows to
rise questioningly joe hasty muttered
something at ancients ear and the latter
quickly amended meaning this ranch
maam

   meaning this ranch she prompted soft-
 ly but with her gaze quickening

   just so here ive been pitying him for
 buying it and now ill be darned if he didnt
 know what he was up to and if he didnt
 make a mighty good bargain

   -- fool softly hissed hasty

   the girls gaze was a bit wild as she looked
 from him to her astounded brother hasty
 growled worked yourself half a mile deep
 in cap ancient realized he had talked too
 freely and was alarmed and confused he
 would have turned the conversation had not
 the girl pinned him down by demanding
 just when did mr goss buy this place
 of you

   in a way of speaking maam i wouldnt
 go so far as to say that he ever bought it
 he desperately replied

  ellis caught him by the shoulder and
whirled him about and warned

  none of that ancient we know all
about it my sister asked just when did he
buy it

   oh -- joe hasty read the signs he
sent up a signal smoke and i wouldnt look
at it last fall a night when he was buying
a mule load of grub for you

   of course softly said the girl bought
 it last fall

   ancient hopefully added

   joen me drunk up half the money with-
out scarcely stirring from our tracks every
round of drinks must a cost me an acre of
 impfoved land leastwise it remembers
like that

  he promised goss hed never yip a
word gloomily informed hasty now
pards



hes busted his promise because he would
hist in more drinksn he needed

  ancient was now much worried and he
lamented

  it was the whisky hall give me a
different kind of a bottle gossll cut my
throat when he hears ive let the cat out the
bag pilgrim you ask your purty sister to
keep her trap closed about my talking
ellis did not appear to hear him but
dazedly exclaimed

  good land nate has owned this land
all the time besides putting money into it
and we thought it was even-stephen three
equal partners

  lets not talk about it any more broke
in his sister what we have to eat is on
the table draw up and help yourselves
frank and i have eaten and as she
bustled about to get them seated she picked
up the account book and tossed it into the
box that served as a cupboard

  ancient continued to be uneasy he ate
in silence and watched through the window
fearing lest the gambler put in an ap-
pearance finally he said

  hope youre ready for the road pilgrim
were oughter be riding at once

  ellis looked at his sister wondering if the
disclosure was to change their plans she
read his question and told him

  mr goss wishes to start as soon as
possible all the more need to find some
gold ill go along with you as far as the
turn to frazers mr frazers man will
take the cows over to his place and some one
will be over every day to look after the
hens

  with the meal finished and the dishes
washed and the rooms swept ellis went to
harness the horses to the light carriage the
indian and hasty followed him but ancient
days timidly lingered and told the girl

  i hope maam you wont ever let on
about goss buying this place i cut open
a big dog when i mentioned it meaning
maam i put my foot in and sprung the
trap goss will be most powerful angry at
me so if you can manage to do what i
couldnt keep your trap closed

  ill make no promises i cant keep she
sternly interrupted

  dejected and mournful of mien he started
for the door and was befuddled to find her
hand clutching his fringed sleeve and to hear
her whispering-

  oh im so glad you told me

  pinkn white purtys a picter he
mumbled as he hurried to his horse

  for most of the way to frazers the party
kept together when it came time for the
girl to turn off the road the men waited
while ellis escorted her to the ranch in a
short time he galloped back and the journey
was resumed ancient immediately pleaded
with ellis to say nothing to goss about the
broken promise

  ellis quieted him by saying

  im under promise already to my sister
shell be the one to do the talking

  the rabbit rode some distance ahead and
ended the thirty odd miles of travel half an
hour ahead of the others the three whites
found him helping goss to complete assem-
bling the outfit the gambler greeted them
and bruskly announced

  we start early in the morning every-
thing is ready except packing the loads
theres nothing more to be done except to
see that ancient has no more liquor if he
takes another drink well have the whole
town trailing after us

  he told every one in canon about
bowens mine and there was so many chas-
ing bowen that no one could keep him in
sight weplumb lost himgrumbled hasty

  thats harsh joey mighty harsh to
say about an old pard mildly rebuked
ancient but iainthoning for more liquor
its taught me an awful lesson then
catching ellis accusing gaze he added-
feel now like id never tech the stuff
again

  he was imprisoned in one of uncle tommy
suttles rooms until an hour before sunrise
when he joined his friends at breakfast he
learned the mules were packedand that the
start would be made at once

  the initial step the fording of the ar-
kansas was disagreeable as the stream was
a hundred feet wide and held nearly three
feet of icy swift flowing water the town
was asleep when they pulled out and still
slept when they made the southern bank
and entered the broken mesa country that
stretched away west and south to the foot-
hills of the sangre de cristo range

up came the sun to warm and
cheer them and dazzle their eyes
whenever they glanced at the
snowy peaks they were travel-
ing over the bed of an ancient sea that once
stretched from what the last tick of times


adventure

clock permits mortals to name iowa to the
wasatch mountains

  and this eons before the mighty rocky
mountains came into existence the im-
mensity of the thought appealed to none
of the travelers although marine shells were
common enough in the exposed rocks along
the lower reaches of the river when a
short distance from the river bank ellis saw
what he took to be an embedded shell and
was pointing it out to his companions when
ancient tugged his arm and glanced at joe
hasty and shook his head he motioned for
ellis to allow the others to draw a bit ahead
and then whispered

  dont say nor do nothing thatll make
joey think about what used to be here
back as early as bible times a shell might
set his mind to thinking about them big
animals

  the rabbit as guide had nothing to do
in this early stage of the journey for ten
miles their way led to the st charles and
the path was well established by pete dot-
son and a few other settlers between that
stream and pueblo they passed through a
flat treeless waterless stretch of cacti and
sage brush and halted briefly on the bank
the clear rapid stream two feet deep and
forty feet wide was locked in its course by
hundred-foot bluffs

  the bottom varied from five hundred to
fifteen hundred feet in width the river
was soon forded and a course taken that
skirted the eastern foothills of the green-
horn range if not for the visions of wealth
somewhere ahead they would have found
the country depressing as there was no
timber except the thin growths of cedar in
the flat mesas the rabbit laconically in-
formed that the country was good for shel-
tering and raising stock because it was
broken into deep narrow valleys and
ravines

  at the end of eighteen miles of leisurely
travel they halted in the half-mile wide
valley of muddy creek ancient days was
eager to start prospecting at once but joe
hasty eyed the black slate and dark blue
limestone out-croppings in disgust while
the rabbit reminded they were to waste no
time in finding lomsom

  fuel was supplied by the creek growth of
box elders and the dead limbs of the scat-
tered elms and cottonwoods they made
coffee and ate their dinner and were told
by the indian they must push on for an-

other nine miles to the little greenhorn

before camping for the night

  then we will be almost half-way to the

place where we are to meet lomsom he
added

  that depends on just what point on the
huerfano hes waiting for us observed
goss

  not on the huerfano corrected the in-
dian the white chief talked as a timber
hunter walks very carefully i promised
to lead you men to him and not to tell you
just where you are going the white chief
trusts a red man but not white men

  i allow we can be trusted with a secret
just as much as an injun can be sternly
remarked ancient

  if lomsom knew you as well as i do he
would know how far you can be trusted
gravely replied ellis ancient days felt his
face burning under his whiskers and turned
away to busy himself with saddling his
horse

  the remainder of the days march was
made slowly through a broken country and
the night was passed in a creek bottom
where there was thin grass and poor water

  the sun was still abed when the pros-
pectors finished the morning meal and
started for apache creek some seven miles
they paused at the apache only long
enough to water their horses then held due
south with the foothills of the greenhorn
on their right sparing their animals they
made another dozen miles and rounded the
southeastern spur of the range and halted
on the huerfano for two hours the rabbit
told them that two miles south of their
camp the river emerged from the moun-
tains flowing southwest through a canon
of brown sandstone it was up this canon
that goss had expected to travel to find
lomsom he said as much to the indian
but the rabbit shook his head and ex-
plained

  you will know when we find him you
will see him and hear him speak

  goss made a wry face at this bit of irony
ancient days warmly approved

  thats the way to stop prying questions
rabbit you gave your word and its for
you to keep it enough for me to know
were most there

  the red hunter told them

  lomsom wont wait for us at the heads
of the huerfano for a very good reason his
utes will be looking for him up there
pards



would be too near the sand hill pass one
of the favorite passes of the utes the
white chief doesnt dare be found by his
utes hunting for gold in the high valley
of the huerfano they are young men who
wouldnt listen to ouray it doesnt take
much to turn them against any leader
while ellis and hasty were cooking sup-
per ancient days got the indian aside and
anxiously asked-

  do you know if theres any bones of
queer looking animals down this way

  the rabbit shook his head ancient was
much relieved and explained

  its along of joe hasty i ask if he see
any of them big bones hes likely to go crazy

again if he does then only the good-

knows how we could handle him probly
have to tie him up

  i havent seen any big bones down this
way but its a new country to me the
white chief drew a map in the dirt with a
stick i looked at it and he rubbed it out
i carry it in my head he said nothing of
bones we should be finding him tomorrow
but its bad medicine to bring a man like
hasty along

  no siree hes the biggest medicine
that ever was when it comes to stumbling
onto ounce diggings seems to smell gold
leaving the river and traveling south-
west they rode for two miles and crossed
the shallow fork of a small tributary and
entered between two spurs like gaping jaws
and commenced the fourteen-mile ascent
which if persisted in would carry them over
the top of the sangre de cristo pass they
were on the most direct route for a wagon
road between pueblo and fort garland and
the upper rio grande

  with the indian setting the pace they
moved very slowly for four miles then
their guide halted and gave the word to
unpack the mules and make camp for the
day the ascent had been steady but no-
where near as steep as the remainder of the
grade to the summit they had followed
along the west bank of the brawling stream
and although snugly inside the huge jaws
there was sufficient grass for their animals

  then we dont pass over the summit
queried goss

  we will wait here a day replied the
rabbit

  ancient days lost no time in procuring
a pickax and spade he called on hasty to
join him boasting

  we two can locate a mine before lom-
som shows up git your eagle eyes to
working joey

  but hasty shook his head and remained
cross-legged before the flat rocks arranged
for the fire and continued breaking twigs
for kindling ancient penetrated the broken
surface of the western slope ellis felt the
impulse only his choice was the bank of the
little stream with shovel and pan he
worked along the edge of the water and be-
came excited on washing out several colors
goss produced a pack of cards and became
absorbed in a game of solitaire as he was
shuffling the cards for another endeavor
hasty reached across his knee and cut the
pack

  black he muttered death

  goss stared at him in amazement then
chuckled and bantered

  surely joe you dont nurse any foolish
superstitions whos going to die

  i cut the cards

  well well all cut black some day lets
see what i cut

  hasty glanced at the diamond and quietly
said-

  you cut gold youll find gold

  its mighty more likely than that youll
find death play eucher

  thanks dont feel like it wish that
white injun would show up and we could
make our strike and hustle back to the
arkansas

  youre in a state of mind joe shake it
off well have the pilgrim give us a song
hasty looked at ellis busily washing
dirt and mused

  seems if i use to hear him singing years
and years ago course i didnt hes too
young

  ancient days came back highly dis-
gusted

  id just quick think of finding pay dirt
in a cottonwood tree as in this darned coun-
try he complained

  ellis came up and threw down his pan
and shovel and announced- jg
found color every time

  thats nothing said goss george
earle on a wager washed color from the
kansas river near lawrence in  got
about the same as you have here you can
find color almost anywhere in colorado
ellis glanced at his companions in turn
and said

  a grumpy looking lot were here


adventure

alive a mans coming to show us where
to shovel it out start the fire and lets
eat and see if this outfit cant show a little
gumption

supplies were overhauled and
hasty volunteered to act as cook
the rabbit promised to start
hunting on the morrow and sup-
ply them with fresh meat the surrounding
heights brought early dusk it was quite
dark when they finished eating and the
rabbit was the only one to discover a figure
approaching from down the summit path

  whiteman tell by the way he walks
said ancient days

  its lomsom said the rabbit

  in another minute lomsom washed of
his paint and clad in new buckskins stepped
into the firelight and said

  hope you saved some grub for me
been watching you from up above

  as he squatted in the circle between
ellis and the gambler the latter remarked
your way of saying good evening i
take it we welcome you how much
farther to these hidden diggings of yours
and why didnt you come to us when you
first saw us

  that makes two talks i thought i saw
a smoke up in the north and stayed up the
slope to make sure must have been mist
or something my placer begins within a
few rods of here i dont know anything
about mining but the surface looked good
six miles below the summit on the other side
is five-dollar diggings the gold comes
in flakes or scales but this is richer im
thinking

  i was hoping youd struck a big bonanza
where one could git it out in big nuggets
said ancient days

  i wouldnt need any help if it was like
that the white chief reminded

  between mouthfuls of food he continued
but i know where you can find nuggets
only youd have to leave your hair in a ute
smoke im chief of a band of utes and i
never dared to work it but you fellers can
go there after youve worked this place
this place will do fine i know quickly
assured ellis his thoughts darting back to
his captivity and the time he stood on the
edge of death and i wont go near any
utes for eighteen billion dollars

  what are the plains indians doing
queried the rabbit s g colley the
indian agent for the upper arkansas says
the cheyennes and arapahoes are getting
ready to fight the utes

  the mountains are filled with signal
smokes moodily replied lomsom the
utes can lickem if they come into the hills
itll be bad for the white folks for when the
plains injuns fight the utes theyll take a
whack at anything they happen to meet
hide and tallow hunters have killed buffalo
by the thousands bands of young kiowas
are demanding presents from small trains
my utes are blamed for horses stolen by
the rapahoes and cheyennes who come to
the mountains to steal and dont want to
go back empty-handed your injun agent
colley perhaps dont know that the sioux
already this season have offered a war-pipe
to a camp of rapahoes on cache la poudre
rapahoes wouldnt smoke but it shows
how the sioux feel

  not only the hungry injuns along the
arkansas and platte are making war medi-
cine but those at the heads of the republi-
can and the smoky hill are gitting fussed
up they still have buffalo but white
hunters were busy in their country last
season killing buffalo for the hides and
tallow therell be a full hundred white
hunters on the saline alone this season
let the utes and arapahoes fight itll
keep them from finding us said goss

  if we dont happen to wander between
two war parties yes agreed lomsom

  the morning brought impatience to the
seven men each was visioning what he
would do with his share of the gold lom-
som lost the stolid bearing he had acquired
among the utes his hands trembled as
he bolted his breakfast and he talked inco-
herently about his plans for making eastern
cities rar up and take notice

  ancient days smiled much and softly
hummed an old tune and visualized the gold
as so many gallons of monongahela and
kansas double rectified

  and of course therell always be a few
snorts of taos just for old times he told
hasty

  hasty alone seemed too preoccupied for
speech

  the seven men proceeded to the diggings
on the run lomsom leading the way

 	later called the grayback gold mine employing fif-
 teen men

 	there were a hundred such hunters on the saline in
  see grinnells the fighting cheyennes
pards



when lomsom halted and pointed to where
he had taken scale gold from the rocks an-
cient days saw the saloons of all his day-
dreaming vanish he tugged his whiskers
and stared blankly goss took his cue
from him and was much depressed ellis
had had enough experience to realize the
difficulty of carrying the dirt to the stream
and as the stream was down the slope this
task would be necessary

  joe hasty examined the ground carefully
and then without a word walked back to
the camp goss hopes went up a bit for
he relied on hastys judgment more than
he did on ancients but hasty after se-
curing a pan and a shovel walked down
the bank of the little stream and disap-
peared in a clump of willows

  ancient sadly announced

  joeys plumb agin it wont have
nothing to do with it

  but golds here angrily insisted lom-
som ive dug flakes out of cracks in the
rock with my hunting knife i tell you
you fellers oughter find a lot where ive
found a little

  well give it a try assured ancient
goss was willing to aid him the rabbit
caught ellis eye and shook his head and
forthwith started off trailing his rifle to
find some game for the kettle ellis went
back to the camp and procured his pan and
went to find hasty

  at midday they returned to the camp
goss exhibited the result of his mornings
work enough tiny scales hasty estimated
to amount to two dollars the gambler
stared at his scratched and bruised fingers
and growled his disgust

  not enough to open one jack-pot with
he bitterly said

  it comes to five-doller diggings de-
fended lomsom

  maybe but i wont have any hands
after two days replied the gambler
ancient days remarked

  i had in mind lomsom something more
chunky rich dirt on water or pockets of
nuggets if id stick here all the time and
work all the time id git almost enough to
pay for my whisky which i cant buy with-
out going to canon or pueblo no use to
peg out claims till we strike it richer we
aint even found rock that would pay to put
through a stamper what did you find joey
the young mann me have done a little
better

  and he carefully opened his handkerchief
and displayed several dollars worth of gold
and some samples of galena the latter
was black and uninviting in the estimation
of goss and lomsom

  lomsom insisted

  i tell you theres a mother vein of pure
gold near here we can find it but it
aint down in the river gravel its up
there in them rocks

  ancient days remembering bowens
find leaned forward and gently stirred the
black lumps with a finger and softly cried-
silver

  fifteen hundred ounces of silver to the
ton quietly said hasty only trouble is
itll cost twenty-five thousand dollars to
put up a furnace building and furnaces

  then it aint worth a- angrily

declared lomsom first sign of a train
fetching all those contraptions would bring
a cloud of utes through sand hill pass and
down the valley of the huerfano what i
git i must git quick and run for it and ill
be lucky to keep an arrer-shot ahead of war
whoops

  best way to make money mining is to
locate your mine and then sell it to eastern-
ers mused goss lets take another
look at that black stuff

  they walked down the creek to where
hasty and ellis had cleared loose earth
from a vein that was very wide the
gamblers enthusiasm was intense until
hasty explained that the ore itself was to
be found only in the small seams streaking
the vein

  lomsom insisted

  i want gold silvers no good mexi-
cans hang it on their clothes

  go find your gold mumbled hasty
trails broke out ellisn me will dig
down into this vein and see how things look
we claim discovery rights you fellers can
claim on either side of us discovery
rights hold good whether worked or not
ancient hesitated and fingered his beard
and then decided

  its the yaller stuff were after ill
hunt for it a while longer

  never was a treasure expedition more
quickly disintegrated than this one goss
and ancient continued prospecting for gold
although the formers high hopes were
dashed to pieces he worked doggedly
determined to give even a lost cause a
thorough trial


adventure

  ancient was blithe and gloomy by turns
after the first day lomsom developed great
uneasiness and gave but little heed to pros-
pecting he was continually watching the
heavens to the north in the direction of
sand hill pass for a smoke at the close
of the second day he told goss that the utes
were hunting for him and might kill him for
running away not only did he cease
laboring with pick and shovel he left the
party and climbed high above the camp to
watch for smoke signals he would leave
the camp after breakfast and did not return
until dusk

  goss knew nothing about mining except
as he had observed men at work in the
gold camps he toiled doggedly under
ancients directions but soon became irri-
tated by his companions shiftless behavior

  you sort of paw this ground over while
im taking a peek up beyond ancient
would direct after this had gone on for
a time goss rebelled and demanded

  see here ancient im no slave if
this stuff is worth pawing over you stay
and help youre forever going some-
where to take a peek at something youve
led me to half a dozen places and left me
while you wander off to a new place if
you found gold in bushel lots youd quit
to find it in barrel lots

  man would be a fool who wouldnt quit
a bushel of gold for a barel agreed an-
cient

  the rabbit was no miner and spent his
time hunting he kept the camp supplied
with game and was absent most of the day-
light hours like a shadow he came in at
night and made but little talk he never
asked how the prospecting was progressing
doubtless he read the situation with one
quick glance at the downcast faces

           ellis and hasty stuck to their
ask original task and laboriously
picked and shoveled until they
had followed the cropping down
for some fifteen feet or far enough to un-
cover a vein of pure ore that measured
twelve inches in width and gave every
promise of becoming wider when this
result was obtained hasty became talkative
long enough to announce the vein com-
prised argentiferous galena brittle silver
glance and cupreous sulphuret of silver
he concluded by advising

  time you all were staking your claims

our shaft proves the lode is widening rapidly
and the pay streak is growing bigger every
foot we go down

  silvers all right agreed ancient ill
peg a claim tomorrer but ive had my
mouth made up for gold gossn me will
come to supper one of these days with
samples of ore thatll make your silver look
like so much common lead	

  that day must come mighty quick an-
cient warned the gambler

 then to lomsom-

  is this the best you can show us

  the best unless we lose our hair
glumly replied lomsom who was keenly
disappointed that his companions had not
already unearthed more gold than the pack-
mules could carry

  tomorrer ill take you to a place higher
upn weve been nathan lazily promised
ancient it looks likely what ive seen
of it

  im through chasing you around an
cient ill help frank and joe work the
silver lode and take a claim on it replied
goss

  that shows a poor spirit cried ancient
well i aint as young as you but ill keep
on hunting with the light that the good
lawd has given me

  claims were taken on the lode next morn-
ing by all except lomsom who refused the
gambler kept his word to ancient by assist-
ing hasty and ellis ancient wandered
alone up the heights at sunset the rabbit
came back but brought no game he
startled his companions by announcing
two smokes one to the north and one
to the west of us

  lomsom who had returned earlier drew
a deep breath and faintly exclaimed

  my utes hunting for me in the north
tother must be some of the plains injuns
trying to sneak into the hills to make an-
other kill like they did when they bagged
benito head chief of the utes mebbe
trying to bag ouray

  i believe that agreed the rabbit
we must make no more smoke for a few
days but do our cooking at night with the
light hidden

  when the rabbit moved nearer the small
fire to receive his ration of meat lomsom
inquired-

  whats the thing hanging to the back of
your belt

  a queer bone part of the head of an
pards



animal thats never found alive in these
days something told me it would be
strong medicine

  and he unfastened the fragment of a
dinosaurs skull and wrapped it in a blanket

  no good said lomsom lots of em
near oil creek bones of the whole critter
moren twenty foot long big one was
found near denver some say it was them
that made the three-toed tracks id seen in
the sandstone must a been reglar old
hellions

  hasty lurched forward and stared steadily
at the blanket hiding the fossilized piece of
bone ancient days groaned and muttered-
now youve done it rabbit

  hasty said nothing and ate his supper
calmly enough but the men noticed he
kept casting his gaze at the massive heights
of the range ellis endeavored to engage
him in talk about the days work the one
subject he showed any interest in hasty
answered a few questions with his usual in-
telligence but forgot to light the pipe he
had carefully filled for the rest of the eve-
ning he continued silent and participated
none in the conversation yet ancients
worry lessened and he whispered to goss
give him something of a jolt but hes
all right hell be better in the morning
at the first opportunity the hunter took
ellis aside and gravely said

  that bone is bad medicine for hasty
that means its bad medicine for me i
forgot it might make his head queer i will
try to work him out of it

  he left the camp-fire to repeat some
sacred formula

  when he returned his eyes glinted with
pleasure hasty was sleeping quietly an-
cient declared

  hes all right just give him a jolt
he wont have any spell this time

  yet hasty aroused them early in the
morning by leaping from his blankets and
screaming

  look enough of them up the range
to chaw up this whole gulch see em
crawling over each other

  he did not attempt to ran away but
hurriedly threw fuel on the fire and crowded
so close to the flames as to scorch his cloth-
ing and there was an awful fear in his
face as with teeth partly bared he point-
ed toward the snowy crests and hoarsely
muttered

  see em big as a herd of buflo look

one two three all in line and leaving the
rest to come down this way each as big

as a ranch house oh - something

awful is going to happen

  ancient placed a hand on the shivering
shoulder and talked to him soothingly and
managed to quiet him for a bit

  theyre all heading over the range
joey he repeated over and over there
the last one of them has gone from sight
now

  waving and slapping his tail strong
enough to knock a stone house over mut-
tered hasty he was relieved but per-
sisted theyll come back theyre cun-
ning they pretend to go away but they
always come back theyre waiting for
some of us to move away from the fire only
thing that scares em is fire

  he would have heaped on more fuel had
not the rabbit stopped him to the
others the rabbit said

  go up or down the slope a little way
and youll see the smoke bn the plains a
smoke from here can be seen far off there
must be no more fire

  but now hasty was engaging their atten-
tion by exclaiming in amazement he
turned to ellis and asked-

  when did you pull out of california
gulch pilgrim

  last night joey hurriedly broke in
ancient

  he didnt come with us he must-a
follered at our heels after skillings jumped
us and i killed him

  goss wheeled and glared at the rabbit
the hunter nodded ancient piteously
begged of them

  keep shet about it joey had to stop
skillings or be knifed by him

  not joey corrected hasty big
bones everyone calls me that

  of course bones we skipped out the
gulch last night

  we oughter traveled farther while it

was dark those big - was thickern

spatter round the gulch id rather a
stayed to face the killing of skillings than
to meet em down here they didnt dast
come down into the gulch too many
fires too much smoke

  all gone joey-bones we can all go
to work cheerily said ancient

  but there was no more work for hasty
he crouched by the fire and kept his gaze
on the heights the rabbit told ellis
io

adventure

  stay with him and see he doesnt make
a smoke ill scout and hunt but it wont
be safe to shoot off many guns

  goss was thoroughly discouraged lom-
som angrily demanded of ancient

 whatn - you mean by fetching a

crazy man along now we cant look for
gold or silver

  you havent found any gold or silver
and you didnt have nothing to show us
after gitting us down here returned an-
cient hasty did find something all
thats been found youve put in your
time hiding up the slope and fearing your
injuns would git you at least joey want
afraid of anything when he was hisself
and youre scared of your shadder pil-
grim go and dig if you want to ill stay
here i can handle him best

  what he said was true about skil-
lings demanded ellis

  we was asleep explained ancient
days joey was in your place under the
wagon skillings was crazy drunk he
must a thought joey was you first i
knew he come over the tail-board knife in
hand and vowing hed cut a throat the
light from the fire showed him plain he
made for joey under the second wagon
joey rolled out tween the wheels and grap-
pled with him i was hunting for a knife or
a ax or anything but before i could git
along it was all over the rabbit came up
just as skillings got his

  we lit out joey n me we got clear
of the gulch and a short way down the val-
ley when morning came it found my pard
to be joe hasty again he didnt know
hed just quit the gulch and wanted to go
there i had to pretend it would mean
trouble for me now you know it all and i
cant bear to talk about it

  ellis tried to work on the claim aided by
goss but neither had any heart for the
task there remained the problem of get-
ting hasty back to a town lomsom went
up toward the summit early in the morning
and the rabbit was out on a scout

  goss threw down his pick and held up his
blistered hands and surveyed them ruefully
and complained

  whats the use i was a fool to bank
so heavily on this game the cards were
stacked against me from the start the
quicker we start for canon city or pueblo
with hasty the better it will be for all
of us

  we havent failed entirely said ellis
hasty told me this was a rich proposition
we ought to be able to sell even if we cant
work it no question about the stuff being
there

  then lets be getting back and be about
selling it said goss

  they picked up their tools and started
up the creek they had covered but half
the distance when goss gave a yell and
commenced running ellis then saw the
thick volume of smoke rising from the camp
as the gambler panted up to the fire hasty
tossed on another armful of green stuff and
explained

  those big-cant see us now smoke

hides us only thing that scares them
smoke and fire

  goss kicked the smoking mess apart and
with ellis proceeded to stamp out the fire
as they finished the gambler wrathfully
asked-

  wheres ancient

  hasty sat down and bowed his head and
would not speak but ancient soon came
running down the pass

  good land he yelled that smoke
can be seen for eighty miles why i just
left him for a minute he seemed to be
asleep there was one spot up the slope i
was keen to look at but now the mischiefs
been done

  he had barely finished before lomsom
plunged on to the scene his face distorted
he snarled-

  do you folks hanker to be killed-in the
ute or cheyenne way

    shut up  curtly retorted goss  hasty
made the smoke

  but why didnt you watch him

  we watched him more than you did
we got here first your hairs in as much
danger as ours you wont work why
didnt you stay and watch him

  they could see it in denver gritted
lomsom

  well pull out as soon as the rabbit
shows up he must have seen it hell
be here soon said goss

  he began rolling his blankets and gath-
ering the supplies ready for the packs

  the rabbit had seen it by the time the
two mules and the horses were brought up
from their poor grazing ground the indian
appeared with a glance he perceived their
purpose and nodded with approval

nit may be too late he told them
pards



indians from the plains will soon be cross-
ing our path it will be a race

chapter xii

riding through

hasty gave no trouble when his com-
panions started down the pass to
strike the huerfano before the plains in-
dians could cut them off he was so eager
to get out of the mountains that it was
with some difficulty he was restrained from
riding far ahead he fully comprehended
the danger of encountering a war party of
cheyennes and arapahos who were bring-
ing a fight to the utes but so great was
his fear of the imaginary the real appealed
to him as being insignificant

  lomsom was full of fight so long as he
knew cheyennes and arapahos were the foe
but he was frank to admit he would ride
hard and far to escape meeting the utes
there are different kinds of mad he ex-
plained to his companions i aint scared
of any injuns war-mad i wouldnt care a
couple shoots of powder for a ute if i hadnt
lived with em and been took in as one of
em and they do have a mortally strong
medicine let white folks make as much
fun as they want to

only a foolish man will make fun of a
strong medicine remarked the rabbit

  ancient days regretted his inability to
make one more prospecting trip high up the
heights

  id a struck it rich tomorrer he de-
clared now them --- have busted all
our plans and stopped me from being a rich
man

  the rabbit scouting a short distance
ahead after they were well under way was
thoroughly a red man with aboriginal
cunning he watched the path dropping be-
fore them and carefully estimated the
chances of making the huerfano before the
war party from the east came in sight also
the chances of throwing off pursuit if dis-
covered the possible danger threw goss
back into his professional imperturbability
ellis face was eloquent with excitement
fear and resolution

  the six horsemen advanced at a rapid
walk down the long slope the eyes of each
keenly watching the mouth of the pass
where the eastern spur ended not until
they had reached the end of this ridge

could they learn the degree of their peril
when the rabbit wheeled his horse and
motioned for them to halt they became im-
patient a brisk ride of less than half a
mile would take them beyond the spur
but the rabbit insisted

  keep back while i ride on alone and see
if the way is clear if i wave my hand
come on riding fast if i wave both hands
leave the mules and ride for your lives
this is a waste of time complained
hasty his eyes more concerned with the
long ascent to the summit behind him than
any danger ahead

  he trembled and clinched his hands con-
vulsively as his gaze beheld something in-
visible to all the rest of the world ancient
used to his weird fancies murmured

  easy easy pard you know they never
git down this far you know it would be
the death of them down this low airs
so heavy down here it would plumb kill
them

  by godfrey theyre down lowern i
ever seen them before muttered hasty
and he wiped his wet forehead and glared
up the pass look same three that
hung back when tothers of the cussed herd
went over the ridge to the west

  yes but theyre turning round there
now theyre slowly going back cried
ancient -- but see them pick up
their heels why joey theyre running
like deer to make the top of the pass

  but this time the sick mind refused to be
beguiled although influenced by the power
of suggestion

  running nothing hasty muttered
they ran for about ten rods then slipped
off to one side to hide in the rocks waiting
just waiting for us i tell you i want to
git out of this

  in a minute watch the rabbit be-
fore you can count twenty hell be waving
a hand soothed ancient were all
right see hes nearly beyond the spur
now hes slowing down see hes tak-
ing it easy not an injun in sight now
hell wave a hand and well be jogging along
the others were as fully confident the
rabbit would signal to them advance
goss spoke to his horse and the little caval-
cade got in motion but the rabbit still
refrained from giving the expected signal
lomsom was the first to take alarm he
reined in and with an oath fiercely de-
manded
iio

adventure

  whats the matter with the-fool

what makes him so slow we either go
ahead or dont

  we dont exclaimed goss as the rab-
bit suddenly wheeled his horse and bending
low came flying back as fast as the animal
could make the grade

  but what does it mean asked ellis
if very near we were to leave the

mules-

  lomsom cut him off barking

  means theyre nearer then very near
means were cut off and at the best must
wait for them to cross the mouth of the pass
and swing into the huerfano valley hope
they meet the utes and that all of them
both bands git wiped out

  the rabbit a few rods away called out
to them

  turn back at once their scouts saw
me

  fool had to show hisself snarled lom-
som now all we can do is to ride up the
pass and make the crossing down to the
rio

  not if the utes are near said the rab-
bit theyre after utes when they see
only white men they may pass on if they
were coming from the mountains after
losing a fight they would chase us

  looks like we are in a trap unless we
cross the summit decided the gambler
im not going to wait for them to make up
their minds whether theyll attack uor
leave us

  lomsom leaped from his horse and cried
out

  ill fool em some of you git green
stuff nough to make a good smoke
ill make ute smoke theyll think a big
band is here while theyre chawing on
that well skin up the pass and travel south
this strategem appealed to all as being
very much worth while all with the ex-
ception of joe hasty he remained on his
horse staring up the slope and imagining he
saw a terrible three-horned head peering
from behind a huge boulder lomsom
quickly had a hot fire of dry branches he
proceeded to throw on grass and green
boughs supplied by the others the rab-
bit aided him in manipulating a blanket
they held back the smoke for a moment
then sent a puff high in the clear air after
completing the ute signal for the discovery
of an enemy the two men kicked the fire
apart and lomsom announced

  thatll hold them back now we can
take our time in making the summit and
we wont have to leave the mules

  with the rabbit he rode ahead the pack
mules coming next they moved along
leisurely the confidence of the two being
shared by ellis goss and ancient days
over his shoulder lomsom explained that
the last third of the ascent was very steep
and that the animals should be saved for
it

  there were no signs of indians below
them they were nearly up to the silver
lode when ellis raised an alarm which was
quickly seconded by ancient days joe
hasty riding in the rear beside ellis had
yanked his horse about and was now gallop-
ing at break-neck speed down the path
nonplussed by the mans sudden flight
directly into the face of danger goss ellis
and ancient could only stare after him
the rabbit however flashed from the head
of the little procession and rode reckless-
ly to overtake the runaway the others
would have followed had not lomsom very
sensibly warned

  if he cant catch him we cant if he
does catch him we may have to cover the
two of them coming back

  the sun was several hours high for the
outside world but down between the two
mountain walls the day was drawing to a
close the light was excellent while it
lasted and the figure of hasty could be
clearly followed as it rapidly decreased in
size in the mad rush to the mouth of the
pass the rabbit seemed to be a part of
his horse as he skimmed after the unfor-
tunate man despite hastys lead it did
seem he would be overtaken

  then almost in the face of hasty there
bloomed a puff of smoke followed by the
heavy rumbling detonation of a rifle
hasty unharmed kept on the rabbits
horse slid on his haunches more puffs
of smoke rose from the rocks near the
mouth of the pass hasty vanished from
view the indian rode back up the path
shouting

  they are in the pass the white man
rode among them we cant help him

  then lets run for it cried lomsom
and he started for the summit in his
anxiety to place as much distance as pos-
sible between himself and the war party he
rapidly drew ahead of his companions who
were accommodating their pace to the
pards

hi

rabbits tired mount he came abreast
of the spot where ellis and hasty had
found silver and impatiently glanced back
at the four men plodding slowly after him
an arrow slithered across the big mound of
dirt and rock thrown up by hasty and
ellis it had been fired at him from his
right and had flashed close to his head
reacting automatically he slipped off his
horse and cast a second glance at the arrow
then he hoarsely told himself-

  utes

he glared at the rocky slope
his rifle ready but the hidden
marksman did not shoot again
once he thought he detected mo-
tion but held his fire then came a thin
wailing cry and he knew a ute scout had
discovered him and was announcing the
fact to more of his people the rabbit had
seen and correctly interpreted lomsoms
pantomime and urged his horse into a gal-
lop and soon was standing beside lomsom
the cry was repeated farther up the pass
and faintly answered from the same
direction

  lomsom licked his dry lips and hoarsely
said

  dont need tell you what that means

theres the arrer bottled up by-

  what band does the arrow tell
asked the rabbit and he recovered the long
shaft and examined it curiously

  one of my own men shot that whis-
pered lomsom that settles me if im
caught last fall they thought i was try-
ing to duck out when i left them now
theyre sure of it theyre after my hair
red crow never liked me for leading a
band of young men hed be the first to

light a fire on my belly -him

  the road to the summit is blocked we
must stop here get the horses down by
the creek behind the rocks and dirt dug up
by the crazy man and the singing man
its as strong a place as any we can find
well have a talk with them maybe the
scout didnt know who you are

  well stop as we cant go on but that
injun knew me all right muttered lom-
som but what gnaws me worsen any-
thing is to know its the smoke signal i made
that brought em down on us they was
up the pass high up as the only way they
could git there without traveling this way
was to follow up the creek that flows north

by sheep mountain just beyond the west
ridge this water were on heads near the
head of that creek they come through
sand hill pass and down the valley of
huerfano for a bit then swung south up into
the range and must-a been planning to
cross the summit and down toward the rio
then they saw my ute smoke and knew no
utes were down here and sent a scout

now-s to pay

  whats the row snapped goss riding

up	iph

  were jumped by utes who are up the
pass were in a trap savagely explained
lomsom

  the gambler promptly announced

  im through ducking and dodging we
have five rifles and plenty of belt-guns if
they want a fight they can have it lets
get things ready before the light fails

  and we mustnt forget the indians be-
low reminded ellis in a trembling voice
as soon as it gets dark theyll be stealing
up

  back behind the rocks and dirt the white
men dug up ordered the rabbit i will
scout the utes i will try to learn if theyll
let us pass over the summit

  thats a good talk but make em say it
on a pipe urged lomsom his voice grow-
ing more confident they wont hurt you
if you call your name still if they lay
paws on you theyll hold you with them
until they can finish us off

  no man will put a hand on the walking
dead man assured the rabbit better
for him to put his hand on a ghost

  oh poor joey hastyl groaned ancient
days

  ill scout down the pass and learn about
him promised the rabbit but first for
the utes

  he turned his horse over for goss to lead
to cover and swiftly crossed to the opposite
slope and disappeared among the rocks
where the ute man had hidden when taking
a shot at his former chief then he turned
and slowly advanced up the slope once
he paused  and curiously examined the
ground with his hands then he left cover
and walked openly chanting

  the walking dead man goes to speak
with friends ghosts walk beside him but
will not hurt his friends where are the
young men who followed the white chief
where are the warriors who follow red
crow


adventure

  repeating this over and over he held on
until above the spot where he and his white
friends had pitched their camp sudden-
ly a voice called out

  we hear the voice of the walking dead
man it is very hard to see him our
hands are empty let him come among the
rocks and smoke and talk

  the rabbit halted and replied

  there are ghosts beside me they tell
me to stay here we will talk with the
rocks between us those ghosts will not
hurt me but it is not good for red crow
and his men to have them too near now
they are whispering that one of your young
men feels death very close

  there was a few moments of silence then
red crow admitted

  there is a young man here who has lost
his medicine and his heart is heavy we
will make a new medicine and make his
heart glad

  it is bad the young man has lost his
medicine voices whisper in my ear that
new medicine is weak

  did the walking dead man come to tell
us of the lost medicine asked red crow
after another brief interval of silence

  they told me to come and speak of a
man who has turned red he is called the
white chief of the utes the walking
dead man is leading him over the moun-
tains

  again a silence then red crow was
saying

  when he goes over the mountains he
goes as a ghost or he must grow wings
like a bird and fly very high through the air 
that is a strange talk for the walking
dead man to carry back to a chief to the
utes gravely replied the rabbit

  he is no longer a chief among the utes
he led a band of young men foolish men
who would not listen to ouray we took
him in and fed him and kept him from white
men who would kill him before the last
snow he ran away then came back with his
mouth filled with lies on the pipe he
promised to stay after the sntfw left the
valleys he ran away again he promised
on the pipe and lied now he brings white
men into the mountains now he has made
a ute smoke he must die

  only a man whose head has been
touched by a very strong medicine would
make a ute smoke after running away from
the utes argued the rabbit

  this seemed to make a deep impression on
the indians for nearly five minutes passed
before red crow answered saying

  if his head has been touched by a big
medicine he can not be hurt by the utes
but let him come to us the walking dead
man is very wise no man whose head
has rot been touched would run from the
utes and then make a smoke to call them
to him

  this satisfied the rabbit that as yet the
utes did not suspect the presence of the
plains indians at the mouth of the pass
he replied

  i will tell the white chief but he may
not understand my words his head is
queer is the mountain top open for me
and my white friends

  there is a man with you who stole a
stone-medicine and who smoked a medi-
cine-pipe there is another man with you
who rode a medicine-pony those two
men must be given to us

  that leaves one man and the walking
dead man summed up the rabbit

  red crow promptly promised

  the other white man and the walking
dead man can walk out of these mountains
and will not be hurt red crow will say
this on a pipe f but we must have the two
white men and the man who is not red or
white

  now the rabbit was convinced neither
band of indians knew of the others pres-
ence in the pass he also believed he and
his friends were about halfway between the
two camps he called back to the ute chief
i will carry red crows talk to the white
men tell the young man who lost his
medicine it is very bad for him

  with that he rapidly stole back to the
shaft on the silver lode and softly called his
own name satisfied he would not be shot
by mistake he advanced behind the pile of
debris and abruptly reported

  they are willing for ancient days and
me to leave the mountains they say goss
and the singing man must die they say
lomsom must come to them

  by- ill die hard cried lomsom

they do not know the cheyennes and
arapahos are down the pass they will not
make a strong attack on us till morning
finding lomsoms hand he pressed some-
thing into it and said

  i picked it up among the rocks it
must have been dropped by the young man
pards



who shot an arrow at you i told red
crow one of his young men was near death
he said a medicine had been lost

  i know what it is eagerly said lom-
som running the article through his fingers
close to death i should say he was
hes sharp lance and the young fool has
lost his medicine necklace thats why his
arrer missed me hed dropped the neck-
lace the shells came from the pacific
coast from the gulf of californy as near as
i could figure out traded from tribe to
tribe if he aint killed mighty soon hell
die of fear

  he continued gloating gleefully as if the
loss of the necklace was some distinct ad-
vantage to him and his companions

  the rabbit advised

  open a pack and get out some food but
dont light a fire keep a sharp watch i
am going down the valley to scout the
other camp

he crossed the creek and
vanished among the scattered
fragments of limestone that dot-
ted the climbing valley the
sun was below the western ridge but it
was yet day on the high peaks that flank
the eastern approach to the summit of the
sangre de cristo pass with the rabbit
between them and the plains raiders the
four men gave their attention to possible
danger from up the slope lomsom sur-
prized his companions by suddenly throw-
ing off his clothing until he was clad only in
his dark woolen shirt and moccasins armed
with a revolver and a knife he curtly
warned

  when i come back ill come on the
jump dont shoot no ute will run up
to this place

  what are you about demanded goss
the rabbit is scouting he wont like
your going out

  it happens that the rabbit is just an-
other injun all his sugary white-talk
dont change his color so its none of his
business where i go or what i do i said i
was going out and take a look the utes
know we cant sneak away without hosses
and they know theyll hear us if we try it with
hosses so im going out while my medi-
cine feels strong

  and they heard the rattle of the shell
necklace as lomsom secured it around his

brawny throat

   

  go to the-as far as i care growled

goss but if you come on the jump with
a pack of utes yelping at your heels youll
probably get potted well fire mighty
fast and its too dark to tell you from a
redskin

  lomsom said nothing but dodged among
the rocks and was lost to view goss
suggested-

  hes going to make a break and jeave us
to pay the fiddler

  hed a kept his clothes on and took along
his rifle and a chunk of grub if he was up
to that caper murmured ancient days
and hed took a hoss but i wish hed
stayed here the rabbits the one to do
the scouting

  ellis possessed the average amount of
courage but there was something fearfully
sickening in the thought that the morrow
might find him a captive among the utes
for the second and last time when he
dramatized himself into such an awful fate
and added as the most exquisite torture
the thought of his sister waiting waiting
for his return he was fair beside himself
goss heard him groan and whispered
what is it frank

  for-s sake nate talk to me he

muttered between clinched teeth

  i know how it is soothed the gambler
nerves get on the jump a bit at times
and what you imagine is always worse than
the thing you have to meet and go through
with

  its the blackest - what ive tjeen

thinking of

  then forget it in the morning with
good light well make a fine fight good
position here why four white men ought
to stand off a hunched indians the rab-
bits good as another four dont lick
yourself before the injuns begin their cat-
wauling and wild shooting then again
how are the utes and those fellows down the
pass going to get along together when they
find theyre stalking the same game a
bloody fight and we walk away

  thanks if it hadnt been for thinking
of annie it wouldnt have been so bad
whispered ellis

  then thank god your sister isnt here
murmured gross

  i believe im all right now at the
worst we can stop them from taking us
alive nate

  of course but we wont draw to that
h

adventure

hand until we have to im still set on be-
ing a vegetable grower and hen raiser
keep your mind on the next minute watch
the creek

  with his courage refreshed ellis sat with
his back to a rock his rifle across his knees
and stared into the darkness that surround-
ed them goss crept to a boulder above
the shaft ancient took a similar position
below the shaft the light was gone from
the peaks the stars took over the care of
the heavens and brought into cold relief the
snowy heights but revealed them as being
bluish-white

  another hour passed and the rabbit
jumped ellis into a rare fright by sudden-
ly fording the creek directly opposite his
position

  fortunately for the indian he called out
his name before entering the stream goss
heard the slight disturbance and crawled
back to the shaft ancient days keen of
hearing this night also joined his com-
panions

  where is the white chief whispered
the rabbit	-

  they told him and he disapproved
saying

  he can do no good that way he may
do harm the man hasty is safe in the
camp below his head has been touched
and turned soft by a great mystery the
cheyennes and arapahoes will not touch
him i saw him in their camp i hoped
to get a peace-road through the camp i
crawled dose but from the talk between
two scouts i learned we must fight for it
they believe we are friends of the utes for
we made a smoke to call them in they
dont know the utes are so close they
believe they will come down the valley
of the huerfano they have scouts out
that way they will come after us when
it grows light the utes will come down
after us when it grows light when they
discover each other and are fighting we must
fall back to the ridge to the east and follow
down the flank to the mouth of the pass
but our horses asked goss

  we must leave them horses cant go
among rocks as men can they would soon
overtake us

  looks darned serious muttered an-
cient days if they dont happen to ar-
rive at the same time itll take tall fighting
to keep from under their little fires

  i will make a medicine for those going to

war i will go to water to be a strong
medicine the prayer should be made for
four nights stay here and keep watch
while i go to water i will say the prayer
four times that is the best i can do

  he threw off his clothes and walked to
the bank of the creek and stood facing the
east after the immemorial practise of his
ancestors then he stared down at the
little stream and in a voice that carried far
began his petition to the red spirits of the
east even ellis forgot some of his fear as
he marveled how one who had taken on so
much of the white mans culture could have
faith in pagan practises ancient days
was more optimistic and hoarsely whis-
pered

  its got to do some good some red
medicines are powerful strong

  deuces and fours muttered goss

  hayil yu listen the rabbit was
invoking now instantly we have lifted
up the red war-club quickly their souls
shall be without motion there under the
earth where the black war-clubs shall be
moving like ball sticks in a game there their
souls shall be never to reappear we cause
it to be so they shall never go and lift up
the war-club we cause it to be so there
under the earth the black war-clubs and
the black fog have come together as one for
their covering the black fog shall never
move from them we cause it to be so

  instantly the souls of my people and
friends shall be moving about in the sev-
enth heaven their souls shall never break
in two so shall it be quickly their souls
shall move on high where they shall be
going about in peace let them shield
themselves with the red war-whoop in-
stantly grant they shall never become blue
yu

  by godfrey that oughter rip the hide
offn the redskins whispered ancient days

  goss told him to be silent for the hunter

hoping the red spirits in the east would
heed the prayer four times repeated red

whoop the club and the shield the peti-

came four times he loudly voiced his
appeal then stepped into the water

on regaining the bank he
jkff took a piece of root from his shirt
phwt and gave a piece to each of his
friends and told them to chew it
and spit the juice on their hands and legs

  thats a powerful strong medicine
youve made rabbit earnestly declared
ancient as he vigorously chewed the bit of

root it ought to yank - out of a

stubborn mule

  it will help but how much i dont
know somberly replied the hunter but
those who would lay down a blue path for an
enemy should go to water for four nights
tfce red spirits in the east heard me but
i dont know how much they will help when
the medicine is made in one night if you
white men have any medicine call upon it

i will not chew the root as my day of death
has been named

  i know of no medicine thats as unselfish
as yours rabbit slowly said goss im
banking on it and no other

  ancient chewed the root and caressed the
haft of his long knife ellis chewed the
root and bowed his head and gave way to
despair as he estimated the odds against
them when in the ute camp they had had
something to trade for life and a storm had
come to conceal their flight now the
heavens were majestically serene and ut-
terly indifferent to the biological tragedy
awaiting the first light

  a gasping cry somewhere among the rocks
west of the silver lode brought them to sharp
attention then all was silent until they
heard the soft footsteps of a man running
slyly the steps crossed to their side of the
valley path and the panting breath of the
unseen became audible ellis picked up a 
heavy fragment of rock the rabbit an-
nounced

  it is lomsom no indian would come
to us like that

  in another moment lomsom was among
them lying on the ground and puffing for
breath the four listened for sounds of
pursuit but could hear nothing when he
could speak lomsom explained

  got the feller who lost his medicine-

him i knew hed sneak down into those
rocks and hunt for it and i got him
sharp lance was the skunks name rode
with me on many a hoss-stealing i heard

him softly crawling among the rocks using
both hands in brushing the ground for his
shell necklace

  i was on him and had my knife through
him before he reckoned any one was near
tried to yell out but he couldnt make his
last sound carry one of my own band
and turned against me to catch up with red
crow thats gratitude for you let the
crow lead em mebbe theyll build a fire
on me but ill be dead before they do it
and ill die hard and take some along with
me

  the rabbit silenced him and briefly ex-
plained about the medicine and gave him a
piece of the medicine-root but lomsom
elated at having killed a man tossed the
root away and boasted

  my own medicine seems to be working
pretty strong if the night was longer id
sneak up there and git red crows hair i
can feel my medicine working in my fingers
and toes mix it with another medicine
no siree

  you will need a very strong medicine
very soon murmured the rabbit i see
black fog near you

  then to goss he whispered

  if i am killed some one must take a talk
to the indian nation my people must
know why i do not come

  you are the walking dead man to the
utes they wont harm you

  in a fight bullets and arrows dont stop
to ask a man his name and there will be
cheyenne and arapaho bullets and arrows
my soul would always be blue if the talk
doesnt reach my people

  if you cash in and i escape ill carry
your talk the gambler promised

  if i cash in and ellis escapes he will
take the talk if ancient days is the only
one to get clear he shall carry it and if
the mine is ever sold your share shall go to
your people

  that is good we have two hours be-
fore the utes commence stealing down and
the plains men begin coming up the slope
when they discover each other we can fall
back to the ridge behind us

  youre medicines all wrong grumbled
lomson we have something to hide be-
hind here as good as any rocks along the
ridge we have water grub and guns
well stick while the two bands fight it out
then well lick the winner winner aint
going to feel like bringing a fight to us
n

adventure

  were well fixed to make a fight right
here agreed ellis what do you say
frank	

  the rabbit is running this game the
gambler answered ill admit i havent
much stomach for crossing the creek to
climb part way up the ridge just to turn
and work along the flank to the end of the
spur your vote ancient

  im following the rabbits medicine
was the sleepy response

  goss you almost made a real war-talk
grunted lomson an injun always thinks
first of running away im for sticking and
giving em a fight

  you shall give them a fight whispered
the rabbit you shall show them and us
how a brave man should die

  - you youre riled because i

wouldnt chaw that piece of root

  shut up lomson goss sternly told
him save your ugliness for the morning
the rabbits all right he can steal safely
away any time and leave us to play our
hands hes sticking to help us out

  all right let him stick as long as i do
then mumbled lomsom

  i will keep close to you slowly said
the rabbit you are neither red nor white
but you shall have your fight if you are
not afraid when the light comes prove it by
fighting at my side

  see here i aint no crazy kiowa leader
of the ka-itsenko to anchor myself by a
medicine lance and be killed in my tracks
rather than to run for it lomson ex-
plained i aint going to git killed just to
prove im a brave man but ill show you
im both white and chuck full of fighting
if i aint at your side injun ill be near
enough for you to hear me hooting

  this is all talk said the rabbit an-
cient days is very wise he sleeps and
grows strong let us rest while we can for
the red spirits in the east will soon kick
off their blankets and rise and bring us a
new day dont shoot at me when i re-
turn

  before any one could remonstrate he was
stealing from their hiding place to scout up
the pass

  it seemed abnormal to ellis that ancient
could sleep with perhaps only two hours
of life left how could a man slumber ellis
kept his eyes fixed on the east as he listened
to ancients snoring there was no sign of
the coming light but like one under a spell

he stared at the well-defined crest of the
eastern ridge he fell to wondering where
he would be at the end of another day

   it seemed such a pity that mortals could
not leap over the pivotal moment of danger
as one jumps across a narrow chasm so
many hours he had wasted now there
were two or three times sixty minutes left
for him as an escape from such a distress-
ing mood he endeavored to work himself
into a savage hate against the indians
but he could not keep the gentle sister from
his thoughts

   if i dont get through tell annie what i
thought about her you know he whis-
pered to goss

  shut up nate muttered goss and
to relieve his feelings he shook ancient and
requested will you stop that-snor-
ing

  just a little cat nap must a felt
sleepy apologized ancient

   lomson lighted his pipe goss objected
but was told

  why not they know were here i
aint fool enough to upset my own dish even

if that-rabbit thinks i be

   if we break even well have the rabbit
to thank im thinking replied goss

  no worse for two to smoke than
one and he lighted a cigar smoke
frank

   i dont feel like doing anything id usu-
ally do explained ellis in refusing the
cigar

  lomson laughed mirthlessly and re-
minded

  maybe your last chance i figger that
the ute medicine-pipe has reached out to
catch you two fellers down here

  ellis shivered goss remarked

   maybe a white medicine has reached out
to catch you lomson for the man you
knifed in pete dotsons wagon train i
wont count the man you killed through the
window of allens saloon

  bah there aint no such thing as a
white medicine

   yet the seed of a new fear was planted in
the renegades mind by the gamblers sug-
gestion he began to wonder if the dead
mans ghost had arranged the situation
and his pipe went out and he did not bother
to relight it

   ellis rubbed his eyes and stared incredul-
ously at the east and with a catch in his
voice whispered
pards



  skys reddening i watched it every
second and never see it when it began to
change lord i wonder whats going to
happen to us

  well pull through flying encouraged
goss still mouthing the stub of his cigar

wtwkm there was a distinct touch of
rose alon the skyline as the
jri four men stared the color deep-
ened to a bloody red the rab-
bit standing behind them announced his
return by saying

  a ute or a cheyenne scout could have
brained you all make ready the red
gods of the east are coming up the sky
hayi yu listen now instantly we have
lifted up the red war-club the black fog
shall never move from them we cause it
to be so

  ancient blinked his eyes at the red east
and asked-

  times come for us to do something
theyll be here any time nervously
warned ellis we ought to pick our places
and make ready

  bring the horses from the creek com-
manded the rabbit

  horses wont help us much among all
those rocks we can make faster time
afoot remonstrated goss

  were going through them through
the cheynnes and arapahos bring the
horses said the indian

  we dont take to the rocks or wait
here for them cried ellis

  we ride through them my medicine
tells me some of us will get through and
some will ride into the black west where it
is always growing dark bring the horses
for those who will reach the arkansas and
those who will end their ride in the darken-
ing land

  well im game for that muttered
lomson and he quickly stripped to the
skin wearing only his belt of weapons and
carrying his rifle

  goss and ellis brought up the horses
and a minute was spent in satisfying each
rider that the animals and accoutrements
were fit for the mad dash the rabbit was
naked except for the shirt he wore as a
breechcloth each man stood by his horse
behind the high pile of dirt and rock exca-
vated from the silver lode under his breath
the rabbit repeated some formula a
slight rasping sound such as a gun barrel

might make in scratching against a rock
came to them from down the slope

  they are nearer than i thought mur-
mured the rabbit this will be a very

good fight

  the utes stealing down the slope heard
the sound and supposed it was made by the
whites retreating this was evidenced by
the loud cry of discovery they raised then
they came on yelling madly and with no
pretense at concealment

  the rabbit was first in the saddle to
goss he cried

  tell my people here by my side lom-
son you shall race me into the mouth of
black death let the singing man sing
it is good medicine to fight singing to die
singing

  and with the former white chief of the
utes beside him the rabbit dashed from
behind the ridge of dirt and into the rough
path and wheeled down the slope and as
he rode he sounded the fierce war-cry of his
people the ancient defiance his forefathers
had hurled at the iroquois more than a cen-
tury before along the great warriors path

  ellis rode behind the two and at his heels
pounded ancient days and goss ellis
sang albeit his voice quavered at times
ancient screamed like a wild animal goss
was silent the fragment of a cigar still
clinched between his teeth

  the cheyennes and arapahos were
amazed to be attacked by white men and
utes an arapaho had talked with hasty
who readily betrayed the strength of his
friends his deranged mind failing to com-
prehend any danger except from the twenty-
foot dinosaurs equally surprised were the
utes on sighting their old foes coming to
meet them neither band could under-
stand the status of the shouting cursing
singing white men and the indian riding
down the valley at a mad gallop and to
give a more deadly finale to the bit of drama
the sun boosted itself above the ridge and
flooded the sloping valley with the morning
light

  hayi yu listen thundered the rab-
bit

  and he opened fire on the mixed band of
plains indians with his rifle there was
some thirty of them and the bullet broke a
mans leg and he attempted to drag him-
self to cover while his companions darted
to each side in something of a panic lom-
son shouted a ute defiance and commenced
n

adventure

shooting ancient days turned in the sad-
dle and gave attention to the utes and with
a string of shots sent them scurrying to the
rocks

  now that they had frantically with-
drawn to both sides the foe ahead emerged
from their amazement arrows whizzed to
meet the five riders then criss-crossed their
path as they dashed between the hidden
lines lomsons horse was shot in the flank
by an arrow and got out of control with
a mad leap he cleared a boulder and landed
among eight or ten of the crouching savages
instantly the rabbit was after him but
yelling to goss-

  go through

  so goss became the leader and he spat
out the cigar butt to hold the reins in his
teeth as he rode furiously with ellis al-
most up to his stirrup he raked the rocks
with two hand-guns ellis was singing
hoarsely a bit madly and was shooting his
revolver at random ancients guns were
empty and he rode flattened out on his
horse the long knife clutched in his hand

  now the utes were firing guns as well as
arrows and were shooting at the plains war-
riors as well as at the whites the three
riders were nearly outside the hidden lines
and cheyenne and arapaho discovered the
utes were too great a menace to be even
partly ignored they concentrated all their
attention on the utes

  as the fire from the rocks dropped indi-
cating the three riders had passed through
the dangerous lane goss glanced back
anxious to learn the rabbits fate the
next moment he was bringing his horse to a
halt and swinging him about to race back
up the slope

  ancient shouted-

 on on

  and he seized the bridle of elliss horse
and restrained the half-crazed young man
from following his friend back into the
danger zone

tthe gamblers purpose was ap-
parent the rabbit was riding
from behind a pile of rocks and
was waving something above his
head lomson was not with him scarcely
a shot was fired at goss as he mounted the
slope and gained the indians side

  for the time being the plains indians
were ignoring the white men they knew
they were in for a stiff fight with their

hereditary foe and would need a powerful
medicine to escape from the pass alive
never dreaming the utes were near they had
left their ponies near the mouth of the pass
while they paused to collect the white
scalps they could laugh at the utes in the
open but meeting them in the mountains
was never a smiling affair

  practically unhindered the gambler
wheeled and rode down the slope beside the
rabbit the rabbit reeled in the saddle
and continued to wave the bloody scalp
offering it to the inspection of the red gods
in the east as he laboriously shouted his
prowess as a mighty warrior the two over-
took ancient and ellis but neither of the
white men could discover just how badly the
red hunter was hurt he seemed to be cov-
ered with blood

  now the rabbit was all red in his mind
the white mans culture was sloughed off just
as the white mans clothing had been dis-
carded he was back to red fundamentals

  i am riding into the darkening land
white men he gasped tell my people-
lomson died a very brave man he killed
three before they dragged him from his
horse the walking dead man killed three
and wounded another two were alive
when i rode from the rocks a cheyenne a
arapaho- soon i will tell lomson how
you men got away

  the indians are fighting among them-
selves rein in while i plug some of those
wounds cried ancient

  ride on ride on gather up the ponies
at the mouth of the pass let the singing
man sing make the huerfano and pueblo
ho ho i see many dark houses lomson
would not chew the medicine root now he
is ahead of me he and the friend i killed
are waiting a man must go to water for
four nights

  he jerked his head far back and opened
his eyes very wide then with a supreme
effort to obey the command of his dying
mind he faintly cried-

  tell my people

  and he would have fallen from his horse
had not ancient and goss pressed close on
either side

  for another mile the living and the dead
rode madly and slowed down only when
they came to the camp of the raiders an-
cient days gave a veil and leaped from his
horse and ran to where joe hasty sat with
his back to a rock goss directed
pards



  ellis help me with the rabbit he
must be hidden where they wont find him
theyll be coming soon ancient bring in
all the ponies

  and he pointed to the herd

  hasty was staring blankly at his friends
as though completely bewildered ancient
ran to the herd goss and ellis lifted the
rabbit from the saddle and rolled him in a
cheyenne blanket to prevent a trail of
blood revealing his hiding place they car-
ried him among the rocks east of the camp
and placed him in a niche much as the utes
bury their dead and left him

  he was the best one of the lot mut-
tered ellis his throat aching

  --knows he was a man agreed the

gambler but hurry i hear firing

  they raced to he camp and found an-
cient and hasty mounted each ready to
lead half a dozen ponies they sprang into
their saddles and took their share of picket
ropes and started off to the north faint
yells caused them to glance back up the
pass a dozen indians were running madly
pursued by the utes

  tried to trap us and bagged them-
selves shouted ellis for the first pausing
to realize he had bridged the fatal morning
hour and in all probability would live to see
the little ranch house on the arkansas

  ancient turned and winked expressively
to the gambler and ellis and cried

  joey cant remember a thing about
being clouted over the head by a injun up
above hes just come to his senses

  with no danger of being overtaken the
four rode more slowly and hasty ex-
plained-

  cant remember nothin- he gently
felt of his head to locate some wound-
last thing i remember i was down in the
mouth along of not finding a pile of gold
we was at the fire talking must a been
lambasted from behind

  crept up and busted you on the head
from behind said ancient you up and
run like a madman injuns didnt pay no
tention to you as the rest of us was keeping
em busy

  yes yes we understand said goss
now theyre fighting at the mouth of the
pass well pick up a bit ancient lead us
to the huerfano

  faint yells and occasional puffs of smoke
caused many a backward glance tiny
figures could be seen making for the open

country where the plains indians always
fight their best

  its all so queer and uncalled for mut-
tered hasty to think i lost all that good
fighting

  good fighting for you yet joey as-
sured ancient beaming like a proud par-
ent and it was youn the younker who
found the silver vein all we did find
hasty glanced wildly about and de-
manded-

  but wheres lomson and the rabbit
they went on ahead tersely called out
goss do we follow along this creek to
the huerfano

  ancient replied in the affirmative and
riding wide they rushed their ponies until
all sounds of the fighting ceased an hour
later ancient was crying

  by godfrey joey now youll git your
belly full of fighting theres a big band
and theyve seen us

a large number of horsemen were ap-
proaching from the huerfano hasty
quicker of gaze than his friend exclaimed
soldiers i see a flag that hogs out all
the bad luck

  as the two bands drew nearer together a
man spurred ahead and came on at a gallop

  whip king yelled goss old whip
king

  good land bawled whip king in
greeting always find you in a fighting
corral heads to the center youve had
a brush youve licked some hoss-injuns
a lieutenant came up and to him and
whip king the gambler rapidly told of the
fight in turn he was informed that the
forty horsemen were detailed from the first
colorado cavalry to discourage fighting be-
tween the plains and mountain indians and
that whip king was taking advantage of the
expedition to look for gun-runners in sangre
de cristo pass the lieutenant gave a hur-
ried order for rations to be supplied to the
four men and then the cavalry swept on
hoping to catch the warring bands at the
mouth of the pass

chapter xiii

waiting

speculation in mining property in-
creased while goss and ellis were mak-
ing plans at the ranch and holding annies
horrified interest by relating fragments


adventure

of their adventures eastern capitalists
with plenty of greenbacks were rapidly
seeking more investments in colorado where
gold was plenty a representative of one
such group came to canon city he hap-
pened into halls place while joe hasty and
ancient days were celebrating on credit
their return to the arkansas the man lis-
tened to their boastings and made inquiries
ancient submitted for his inspection the
samples hasty happened to have in his
clothes when escaping from the pass

  at first the easterner refused to be en-
thusiastic over silver gold was what he
wanted but after reports came in of rich
silver finds near the heads of the south-
western tributaries to clear creek and men
began talking of assays from other silver
districts that ran as high as two thousand
dollars a ton the newcomer displayed in-
terest he took the samples to an assayer
and was told they showed eight hundred and
twenty-seven dollars per ton he promptly
changed his attitude and expressed a desire
to meet the surviving partners

  goss and ellis were notified and hurried
to canon city and as a result of the con-
ference it was agreed the easterner should
visit the lode the espinosa murders had
alarmed the valley more than an attack by
a tribe of indians but profits call as loudly
sometimes as bugles the danger of visit-
ing the pass was slight however now that
the cavalry was patrolling the huerfano
and foothills goss and ancient went with
the easterner escorted by a strong body-
guard ellis gave the gambler power to
dispose of his claim and returned to the
ranch

  it was tedious waiting and annie an-
noyed her brother by stressing the desir-
ability of ranch profits over mining profits
he never suspected she was trying to for-
tify him against disappointment but he
had his day when goss galloped up to the
ranch and loudly shouted

  sold out fifteen thousand dollars on
the way to kountze brothers bank in den-
ver to be deposited to your credit heres
the express companys receipt we ac-
cepted ninety thousand and divided it into
six parts although lomsom didnt stake a
claim hes dead but he may have folks
somewhere he failed to lead us to gold
but if it hadnt been for him we wouldnt
have found silver and he died game his
share will be held by the bank while they

search for heirs failing to find any its to
be distributed among the four of us and the
rabbits people

  then he was off his horse and taking the
girls hands and shaking them and greet-
ing

  howdy do miss annie hows it seem
to have a man of property for a brother
i always said old frank would strike it
fifteen thousand is far from a fortune but
it isnt to be sneezed at

  fifteen thousand dollars she slowly
repeated then she burst into tears and
frantically flung her arms around her
brother and cried

  why frank we can go back with our
heads up we can go anywhere and now
we can pay mr goss pay him what he
paid for the ranch and the money he ad-
vanced for everything

  good land really sold that hole for
ninety thousand gasped ellis then he
added therere some things i cant ever
pay nate for

  goss nonplussed exclaimed

  pay for the ranch why miss annie

this place is owned-

  dont she commanded its owned
by you that man ancient told me all
about it just before you started on the trip
now we can square accounts

  ill wring that old fools neck then
were not partners any more frank and i
have been pards miss annie id hoped to
be a partner with you two in running the
ranch

  partners yes so long as we stay here
she agreed but first well pay back all
you put in and start with a new account
book

  thats the talk nate annie always
did have a head come in and well draw
up a new agreement

  nonsense you cant pay me now a
check will be no good till the money reaches
the bank that can wait but heres some-
thing that cant wait- he patted a saddle
bag-im riding to the indian nation to
tell the rabbits people and im fool
enough to think i can carry his share in
gold and greenbacks to them i must be
going at once by the way youll be glad to
hear one of the bloody espinosa murderers
has run out of chips john mccannon of
caufornia gulch struck the trail near red
hill and followed it to a camp in a canon
on oil creek southwest of pikes peak he
pards



shot one tother man and a boy escaped
this should have been news of momen-
tous comfort for the series of mysterious
and brutal murders committed without mo-
tive had upset the nerves of the valley and
various camps the girl scarcely heeded it

  youre on your way now to tell the in-
dians people how he died she said

  i promised the rabbit was a great
man theyll be glad to know he made a
fighting finish and can not be executed
you surely are not leaving until youve
eaten she said frank take his horse
away

  her brother was quick to obey and while
he was gone the girl asked

  but youre not going to gamble any
more getting this money wont make you
do that youll come back and be our part-
ner in running the ranch

  goss stared at her steadily and finally
replied

  ill quit cards for cabbages ill come

back if-

  if what she asked as he paused
well miss annie thats what ill tell
you when i come back

  she turned to the door saying

  i must see about something to eat you
must settle down and be respectable what
young men are left us by the war shouldnt
waste time at card games youll find us
here if you return before winter

        but he did not come before
winter he wrote from the in-
dian nation telling how he had
-made his promise good of the
pride of the rabbits people he said noth-
ing about the running fight he made in
taking the money through when he was
forced to shoot his way through charlie
harrisons band of guerrillas just before the
osage indians fell upon them and killed
them to a man

  in part the letter ran

   ive been doing a lot of thinking since i met the
rabbits people the war seems very close to me
now im out of the mountains i cant get rid of
the notion its my business and not something
merely to get news about from the old california
crossing

  ive lived the last two years shut up in gulches
and with a shut-up mind think of my surprize in
running into delouge hes enlisting a company
for the south keen to have me join had to tell
him my sympathies were north of the line it would
have been death to have said this to some men down
here but delouge is a real man

  he told me the best way to travel and got me a

fresh horse it was mighty nice of him to say he
hoped wed never meet until after the war so im
going in but id rather be a rancher on the upper
arkansas than anything i can think of maybe
thats another reason why im going in

  ive lived selfish now i must practice what i
like second best but if my medicine holds good i
shall come back i dont expect to find you two
there maybe youll leave word in canon city with
mr hall as to where youll locate in the east both
of you will understand i dont like to do what im
going to do i dont believe the war can last more
than a year yet its a bad mess i seemed to be in
excellent position to chip in no brothers sisters
nor folks im thinking wars ought to be fought by
men like me who havent any relations hows
that

  annie folded up the letter carefully
placed it inside the discarded account book

and said

  hes gone frank we shall never see
him again ive driven him from gambling
into the war

  then she ran to her room her face no

  the summer passed dully for the young
couple frazer and the neighbors contin-
ued to help with advice annie bought an
account book in canon city and frank
grew accustomed to being the possessor of
fifteen thousand dollars goss name was
entered as an equal partner and the girl
was very exact in her bookkeeping her
brother was eager to enlist but she dis-
suaded him

  that summer was hard on ranchers an
unprecedented drouth dried up the west
stocks of merchandise and provisions in
colorado were thinned out almost to the
vanishing point and the demands made by
montanas new mines cut into even this
slender margin

  one night after the harvesting was fin-
ished and annie was busy with her accounts
her brother interrupted her by asking
why bother annie weve made no
money this season

  but i must have a record to show mr
goss

  annie nate wont come back he may
be dead no letter all this time no nate
wont come back

  she collapsed with her head on her book
as he tried to comfort her she piteously

moaned my - frank cant you

even let me pretend cant you let me try
to fool myself if it helps me just a bit to get
through a day

  well quit here well go to canon city


adventure

annie youre broken up its too lonely
here

  id rather stay here she replied

  no frazer was saying only the other
day that the plains tribes are in an ugly
mood im afraid were not safe here
this lie served his purpose and once she
had consented she could not start soon
enough when they closed the house and
were about to ride away she wrote on the
door-

gone to caiion city

  the winter set in about the middle of oc-
tober and proved to be the worst in the his-
tory of colorado hundreds of heads of
stock froze on the plains where heretofore
thay had thrived and fattened trade with
the east was cut off by deep snows fuel
went up a hundred per cent for months
hay and grain sold steadily for from fifteen
to twenty cents a pound eastern foun-
dries were busy along with the machine-
shops in making war material and but little
mining machinery could be manufactured
this shortage made but little difference to
colorado in the spring of  for the plant-
ing season opened with disastrous rains
towns were overflowed denver was dev-
astated by a great flood rivers cut new
channels ranches and crops disappeared
the plains were impassable

  annie insisted they ride down and see
what was left of mr goss ranch as she
persisted in calling it to their surprize it
had escaped the fury of the high water
but planting was an impossibility yet
she was strangely perverse and insisted
they stay there a while just as it became
possible to freight the keenly needed sup-
plies across the plains there came a culmi-
nating disaster the plains indians smoked
for war and commenced destroying trains
and attacking stagecoaches for two
months all communication with the river
was cut off

  when the black news of the general red
uprising reached the ranch young ellis re-
belled against fate and cried

  what a country what a life to be liv-
ing you wont agree to my enlisting but
life here is worse than fighting

  she was examining his account book when
he began his lament she closed it softly
and said

  life isnt pleasant for me dear and i
cant even fight and forget to be miserable
from what mr frazer said the war must be
most over but theres some fighting left
go if you want to as soon as we can well
go back east i could have lived out here
after i got used to it i began to like it if
things had been different id preferred stay-
ing out here but i wont keep you frank
im sorry annie i didnt mean to
make you feel bad but everything seems
so useless were good pards youn me
there would have been three of us all good
pards well well too bad sometimes
i had the notion you liked him a little even
if you didnt like his ways

  i like him now frank she whispered
and she rose from the table id like him
now even if he came back a gambler ive
been in poor business to judge him good
night

  he would have detained her but she flung
off his hand and ran to her room

  that night the wind prowled and howled
around the ranch house and kept the two
awake long into the morning there was
a savage exultation in its cries that made
ellis see the utes again as they were when
he was a prisoner it was near sunrise when
they finally fell asleep and they slept late

  the girl was the first to hear the soft rap-
ping on the door drowsy with sleep she
wrapped a blanket around her and went to
the window thinking to see one of the
neighbors a man was limping from the
door to a horse

  frank frank hes come back hes
comeback get up get up she screamed
goss turned and called out

  hurry up and open up your sign on
the door says youre in canon city and i
rode through there in the night dont
keep a man waiting whose right leg is
scarcely mended

  she did not wait for her brother to hear
her cry for she foolishly feared that goss
might ride away so it was she who opened
the door draped like an indian girl as
he limped across the threshold she saw his
face was thin and lined and much older
their eyes met in a steady gaze then he
picked her up and was muttering

  good little pard true little pard
waited for me let frank have his sleep
out

author of handsome isnt stummicks etc

old bill stevens pushed his canoe in
toward the bank at the stoppin
place it was late autumn he
noticed as the bow grounded that
a fringe of ice lay on the margin of the river
though the sun had been up for two hours
old bill stepped out drew the canoe up on
the shore and started for danbys the only
store indeed the only habitation in the
stoppin place

  danby himself was lounging at the door
and at sight of old bill he turned toward
his barn where his old indian man-of-all-
work squatted idly

  hey there two blanket danby called
spade up some earth and bank the store
old bills here on his last trip and winter
aint far behind him certain sure

  two blanket whose ancestors had got
through countless northern quebec winters
without undue labor grunted rose and got
to work

  old bill stevens was the local weather
prophet and when he made his last trip
down from the portage to get his winter
supplies danby always figured the freeze-up
as coming close behind

  old bill came up to the store building a
rough structure of logs

  whats new he asked he had been
up at his cabin in the woods for three
months with never the sight of another
man

  got company danby told him

  do tell what sort the old man
asked

  i aint pestered him danby told him
i dont get curious with strangers till i got
em sized up member once up near
dawson before i come east i was settin in
a saloon when a guy come in and after hed
bought a drink all round for the nine o us
that was there he up and asks where be
you-all from 

  danby paused for effect old bill fidg-
eted a moment but knew better than to
prompt him

  well sir danby concluded after
theyd picked that there curious guy up
they found eight bullet holes through him
the ninth sour-dough had a grudge agin
the bartender an took his chance to work
it off since which day i dont ask fool
questions

  and where did they come from chum
a voice asked from behind him

  old bill peeped into the door of the store
and saw a big man squatted on a bench be-
fore the stove

  where did them blighters all come
from asked the big man pleasantly

  huh danby turned you feelin
better when a man can make jokes like
that he aint as bad as you looked when you
come stumblin off the trail from end o
steel

  old bill nudged him

  he aint jokin he means it that
there fool question reckon the pint of
your annegote dont percolate through his
head he whispered

  then he raised his voice




adventure

  he dont look like the shootin kind
danby anyways im a curious fool an
was born with questions on me lips

        he stepped inside the store
and thrust out his hand
flhb im bill stevens he an-
nounced shake stranger
name o hawkins-corpl hawkins o
the guards

  the stranger rose stood gingerly in his
sock feet and shook hands

  old bill saw that despite his fatigue his
shoulders were well back his spine was
straight his chin in he didnt know much
about guards but he liked hawkins
looks

  hawkins saw a thin short little man
with iron-gray hair twinkling blue eyes and
skin like leather a cocky little man who had
the appearance of being able to look after
himself anywhere especially in this new
country of forest and stream

  corpl hawkins of the guards old bill
repeated dubiously

  and his eyes traveled across the uttered
counter to the wall where hung a litho-
graphed calendar it depicted several red-
clad figures in busbies grouped around
the regimental colors standing at attention
woodenly

  guards hey he objected thems
guards yonder for it says so underneath
you dont look like no guardsman
ex-corporal hawkins face flushed

  strike me - well pink chum he

complained indignantly is it my blinkin
fault that i got flat feet

  you dont expect him to come prancin
in here with his red jacket an fur hat do
ye bill danby laughed reckon he left
them behind somewheres king george
aint going to let no lad lug them expen-
sive garmints into the bush not if hes got
a head on him

  mebbe so mebbe so bill sat down
on the bench now corpl hawkins we
dont use them military titles hereabouts
im general nuisance from the portage and
this grinnin idjit yonder is a field marshal
him owin the only field hereabouts but we
aint proud i answer to the name o bill
and if ye yell danby hell overcharge ye

forget the corpl part and since we dont
take without givin in return hereafter yell
be known as flatfoot hawkins and now

if yell give us line and verse where ye come

from and why-

hawkins cuddled his sore feet in his hands
and balanced precariously on the bench

  im from lunnon lunnon in the bloom-
in smoke lunnon thats half the -

world the biggest town god ever made
and i come here because i was tired o it
tired o crowds sick o sleepin an eatin an
livin with a thousand men fed up with

be no worse place than here says i so i
started marchin twas a sizable bit i

terrupted hell apply for a situation

big man pityingly flatfoot this here

agreed

  not that the stoppin place aint a siz-
able burg at that bill went on theres
a couple of barns behind the trees that ye

stoppin place an its only suburb the
portage cept for that wuthless injin two
blanket

  if i cant get no situation to suit flat-

foot told them simply i shall- well

fant he ups and leaves london an never

here cause he seen a road goin some-
where an follered it cause when that

him danby me ill hire ye flatfoot and
if ye have the stuff itll show before spring
and ill stake ye to an outfit the prac-
tical danby promised  them bloke clothes
aint proper for the bush

  thanks chum flatfoot said i dont
want no charity mister bill here can stop
the price out of my screw that is if im
worth more than prog

  he bent to draw on his boots

  now mister bill corpl-beg pardon-
flatfoot hawkins reports for duty 

  the first thing is to set easy and hearken
to me

  old bill grinned he was beginning to
like his hired man

  bein fair minded i got to warn ye ive
my faults lots o them in the first place
a city man i guided claimed i uster lick
my knife before helpin myself to butter
course that wont hurt for well see no but-
ter this winter then im a mite pertickler
about keepin clean had to fire the last
man i holed up with cause he wouldnt
wash his face saturdays course i dont
hold with no continuous-now-ablutions

but once a weeks not too frequent-

  strike me-well pink mister bill i

been in the guards and when it wasnt
washing it was spit and polish till i was
fair sick of it flatfoot broke in

  ye have the look of a man that done
your share o such bill calmed him and
ye wont find me onreasonable but theres
more cornin i aint fussy about some
things but i aim to keep my own toothbrush
strictly private mighty handy them little
things is for cleanin a gun-breech had a
feller once that kep lookin longingly at my
toothbrush one day i cotched him
cotched him cold and what do ye think he
was doing with my toothbrush an the gun
oil

  i-i cant say mister bill

  he was brushin an slickin his mous-
tache with it

  old bill rose

  well aside from them queer streaks in
me im easy to get along with and now
danby you throw my stuff together right
prompt its fifteen mile o paddlin an
polin to my cabin flatfoot an ye can de-
vote the time to one thing ye must learn
dont tack any mister onto me i answer
to plain bill when a mans labeled mis-
ter hereabouts it means hes a tenderfoot

         the trip up swift river demon-
strated one fact ex-corporal
hawkins of the guards was no
canoeist not that he wasnt
willing but after the first experiment old
bill gruffly told him to ride passenger

  hes good for something the old man
pondered staring at hawkins broad shoul-
ders ahead of him stands to reason every
mans got the power to do something
proper but canoes and him dont agree
not in november anyways

  they reached old bills cabin late that
night together they carried the supplies
up the slope from the river

  the cabin was a peeled log structure
well-built weather proof big enough for
two men but no bigger below it the land
sloped downward a hundred yards of
natural meadow to the brawling rapids
that made the portage necessary gave it
its name above the hill was pine-clad
and more abrupt a barrier against the
north wind

  inside were two bunks a small stove
rude benches hand-hewn plank table and
old bills trapping outfit he ushered ex-
corporal hawkins in proudly


adventure

  reckon ye wont find no better shack
this side o montreal he boasted course
i dont know for sure me i aint no trav-
eler when i get so far south that i see
a dozen folks at once i get skeered of the
crowds and come back home

  tidy bit of all right flatfoot agreed
and now whats the job

  and he threw off his coat rolled up his
sleeves and waited for orders

  take that there hand ax and chop me
a bit o kindlin old bill suggested me
ill rustle grub right off

  righto

  hawkins grabbed the small ax and went
outside

  even if he cant do no more for the
present than chop wood and lug water
decided old bill even if this here pio-
neer ive hired dont do no more than such
chores hes worth his keep for hell be
dumned interestin will flatfoot and hes
got guts too

  he paused for flatfoot was returning
the big man was cuddling one hand in the
other blood dripped to the floor

  ax bit ye

  old bill scowled then examined his hired
mans hand

  well there aint no harm done but yed
better leave them dangerous-edged tools
alone for a bit i see that choppin
aint one o the things ye do best
flatfoot

  the cut was luckily superficial old
bill bound it up

  wait a bit chum and ill get that there
wood

  hawkins made for the door again

  wait a minute wait a minute bill
grinned as he stopped the other ye are
a daring cuss but ye are lucky to have your
toes with you still them axes like nothin
better than loppin off little things like toes
you set there and rest

  he went out in a moment he was back
his arms filled with wood

  theres a trick to it flatfoot he re-
marked kindly

  youre a bloomin magician hawkins
conceded

  old bill smiled modestly and set about
getting supper

  when they had eaten when pipes ligthed
they pushed their benches back from the
table old bill stevens unfolded his philos-
ophy

  reckon ye wonder why i hired ye he
remarked

  that i do hawkins answered morose-
ly for i see now a man needs to know a
bit up here

   well since ye aint conceited ill tell
ye the answer being dumned if i know 
old bill paused to arrange his thoughts
i seen ye at danbys an i liked ye an i
hired ye which being done and final till the
break-up next spring we got to find out
what ye are good for dumned if ye aint
good for somethin but it aint canoeing
and it aint wood-cutting and so from
now on forever more well sort of try ye
out flatfoot with one thing and another
first and foremost what did ye do in them
guards and before ye answer make up
your mind not to boast none lots o folks
talk pretty at the end of steel and act foolish
in the bush i mind one sport claimed to be
the best paddler ever stepped into a canoe
and he dumped me in still water five
minutes after we pushed off

   nother tongue merchant swore twas
his habit to shoot a lion or a grizzley before
breakfast just to keep his hand in and not a
hundred yard from the stoppin place he
shot my hat offn my head attemptin to
massacree one o danbys chickens he
figured on patridge for supper he did but
he got language mostly for i was riled so
when ye answer speak careful flatfoot for

this is the - of a country to call a

mans bluff now what did ye do in them
guards besides wear a red coat and a
fur hat

  flatfoot tried to select some worthy
activity out of his military past something
that would impress his employer

  i-i mounted guard at buckinm pal-
ace he replied at last

  can ye put it clearer like old bill
begged me im a poor ignorant bushman
and aside from them red-coated fur-hatted
lads in the picture back to the stoppin
place i know no more of guards than ye do
of canoes

   its like this chum flatfoot explained
im walking my beat as you might say and
his gracious majesty comes a-riding past

and i present arms so-

  and he grabbed hills shotgun to demon-
strate	i

  go as far as ye like it aint loaded
bill remarked and was that there mon-
key-on-a-stick business all ye did
the guardsman



  no chum ex-corporal hawkins as-
sured him when his gracious majesty
god bless him come a-riding back i pre-
sented arms again

  ye did old bill sought vainly in this
hectic guardsman life for some sign of
sense and doubtless george was grati-
fied

o course that was when i was a pri-
vate corporal hawkins went on and
in them days i done kitchen fatigue too
say no more flatfoot say no more i
see somethin

  old bill jumped up and grabbed a dirty
dog-eared paper book

  if ye done kitchen fatigue ye must be
able to cook and if so be ye can throw grub
together proper theres hope for this outfit
yet but since i dont take no mans word
for what he can do ye must show me first
can ye bake a cake

  im no great hand at it flatfoot told
him modestly

   tis simple if ye are a real cook and hard
if ye are not

  bill flipped the cookbook open

  course we got no butter but theres lard
and i aint much on sweet stuff either but
makin a cake is as good a test as anything
ill keep the stove going good and that there
box ovenll cook her right throw her to-
gether and if anythings missing thats
printed down here put in somethin else
thats what a good bush cook has to learn
to do else his customersd starve

 righto

  flatfoot rose and commenced operations
by reading the recipe then he paused
doubtfully

  this here calls for eggs he complained
put in lots o baking powder bill com-
manded and dont hint that ye are a
daylight cook and must wait till tomorrow
for i aims to drop asleep tonight feelin joy-
ful because ive hired me a bang-up cook
start things moving now me ill hot up
the oven for ye

  twenty minutes later flatfoot had fin-
ished his batter it filled to the brim the
tin pan he had used it was chalky-white
and it certainly looked as much like an
embryonic cake as like anything else old
bill came over to the table to examine it

  tarnation he remarked its to be
hoped shes done rising cake is cake but
if she swells more therell be a winters sup-
ply ot not that i cant -

  he stopped suddenly for as he spoke
his pipe dangling from between his half-
opened lips slipped striking the edge of
the pan it spread a film of ash over the fair
white surface of the cake

  shucks old bill remarked least
said soonest mended tis a bit soiled that
cake flatfoot you chuck in a bit o
cocoa an stir it round it wont show them
ashes then besides i always did like a
chocklit cake theres tricks to woods
cooking as ye may observe

  flatfoot obeyed then he stuck the cake
into the oven a sickly brown mess it was
by then too

  and to think of me wonderin what ye
was good for

  old bill filled in the time required for
baking the cake with a sort of monologue
wonderin and puzzlin why ye was let
loose upon us and all the time ye are a
cook never saw nobody throw a cake
together quicker no sir never did

  i-i just follered the bloomin book
hawkins wasnt looking for praise be-
sides it isnt cooked yet chum

  give her time give her time bill re-
plied

  half an hour later they drew the pan out of
the oven the cake seemed to have shrunk

  thats the chocklit bill diagnosed the
case itll be one o those heavy solid
cakes they make round christmas time
wish id thought to have ye stick a few
raisins into her dump her on the table
upside down and shake her free of the pan
hawkins obeyed the pan fell solidly on
the rough table but nothing happened
the cake remained stuck tight

  hand me that skinnin knife bill
ordered flopping the pan over

  hawkins handed him the keen blade he
thrust it boldly into the mysteries of that
cake or tried to but it skidded on the
surface and slid over the tin side of the pan
bill shook his head

  gimme the ax he commanded gruffly
he drove the blade of the ax at the cake
it sunk a bare half inch when he sought
to lift it for a second blow the cake and pan
came with it old bill let the ax fall
again then turned to flatfoot hawkins

  you go make three notches on that there
bunk post he directed 

mystified his new hired man obeyed
one to remind ye that ye cant paddle a
canoe old bill explained patiently as


adventure

hawkins cut into the post one to indi-
cate ye cant chop wood and a grand deep
one to say ye are no cook and every time
i find out somethin ye cant do yell cut
another notch i heard o these princes
and dooks that sleep in their richly carved
beds concluded old bill stevens but
come springtime they wont have nothing
on me

jumft for two weeks no further notch-
es were cut in that bunk-post
ibfjijmi old bill contented himself with
studying his hired man in such
spare time as he had and spare time was
scant for snow was overdue ice was be-
ginning to shove out its tiny needles from
the banks of swift river and the time was
at hand when he must set out his traps

  he found flatfoot a willing worker the
big man could at least fetch and carry for
him and there was no doubt that aside
from his general inefficiency ex-corporal
hawkins was a pleasant enough companion

  but with the first deep snow bill decided
to make another effort he rummaged in
the pole-floored loft under the cabins roof
and produced snow shoes danby had
outfitted the big guardsman completely and
now clad in mackinaw and moccasins he
came out to learn the difficult art of the
webbed shoe

  five minutes later old bill desisted

  ye can go and cut another notch flat-
foot he declared disgustedly 

  strike me--well pink chum flat-

foot protested is it my blamed fault

how the - can i tell which foot im

standing on the other with and both of them
under the snow

  take them off and cut that notch

  old bill stared gloomily down the slope
of the natural meadow then had an in-
spiration

  why not he thought theres a lot
in common between this here tenderfoot and
that thick-headed swede timber cruiser
what give me the danged things

  and at once went to rummage anew in
the loft this time he drew out a pair
of skis long polished wooden blades with
strong harness

  shuck them moccasins and slip on
boots he commanded

  and more or less patiently flatfoot
obeyed but he was beginning to have
suspicions

  i trust you are not making game of
me he voiced his doubts as old bill bent
to adjust the ski harness for him im
signed on for duration i am and ill stick
but if you spoof me chum i will take it out
of your hide come spring

  ye are suspicious old bill grinned

  now what do i do with these-bed-

slats asked flatfoot

  ye travel

  bill rose and slipped behind him he
pushed hard and flatfoot slipping over the
crest of the slope legs locked rigid his tall
body balanced precariously started down
the slope towards the open river with all
the speed a wtell polished pair of skis could
yield

   i say-i say-how do i stop these
blinkin things he called as he swayed and
slipped down the slope

  fall durn ye old bill made for the
cabin unconcernedly and afterwards see
ye climb back up here with them still on to
ye

  a shower of snow told him he had been
obeyed flatfoot had fallen he watched
from the threshold till the big guardsman
had struggled to his feet again right at the
rivers edge he grinned as he eyed the
long slope its snowy surface marred only
by the single ski track then he went into
the cabin

  hell be hungry when he gets up here
concluded bill but im gamblin hes
got the guts to push them skis over the top
if it takes all night cant cut no more
notches in yonder bunk-post or ill be failin
to the floor one o these nights

  two hours later he opened the door and
looked out the hillside was criss-crossed
with ski tracks here and there huge hol-
lows in the snow loomed up like buffalo
wallows

  halfway up the slope flatfoot was pa-
tiently making his twentieth attempt he
was edging sidewise and even as old bill
watched he slipped the back of one ski over
the other put his weight on it

  he learns slow and british bill de-
cided but aint he the persistent cuss

  the ski slipped flatfoot waving his
arms wildly shot backward down the slope
to a staggering fall

  take them toys off and come home
bill cried

  like ---i will flatfoot sat up

ill walk these-bed-slats over the top
the guardsman



of this hill if it takes till spring to do it

im beginning to like that cuss old
bill thought as he started towards the stove

  i know i like the cuss he decided an
hour later when he heard the slip-slip of
skis outside the door

  flatfoot hawkins stood there snow from
head to foot

  theres a trick to it id say he crowed
triumphantly and swelp me chum
ive got it

from that night flatfoot stuck
to the skis he acquired none of
the graceful accomplishments of
the art knew nothing of telemark
or christiana swing and when he wanted
to stop he sat down but he learned enough
to make winter travel possible and so
when two weeks passed with no further
notches on the bunkpost old bill decided to
try him with something else

  feel a mite tired he complained craft-
ily one afternoon yed best slip down
river and look over them traps put on
the swede seven league boots and be care-
ful the rampagin squirrels dont get a free
feed off ye and mind that a skin with
holes beat in-it dont bring in the money
kill a trapped animal gently for its worth
money

  righto agreed flatfoot cheerily

  i hope tis a prophecy that bill re-
plied for hitherto when ye say righto
ye mean wrongo 

  then he watched as the big man slid off
down the slope towards the river

  make a trapper of him yet bill
thought he handles them skis better
every day me i wouldnt trust myself on
them things if i was paid for it

  then he settled down to wait

  in an hour flatfoot hawkins was back
empty handed

  nothin stirrin bill asked

  hawkins seemed elated

  nothing but trouble chum do you
know what i found in that third trap i
found trouble

  unless it was a elephant or a tiger which
same aint strictly native id presume yed
have brought it back dead bill com-
plained animals hereabouts may trap
themselves but they dont deliver their
dead bodies at the door they got to be
lugged

prime luck i didnt lug this one

	

 hawkins grinned happily for he felt that at
 last he was earning his keep

 manys the lad ive seen in trouble for

cotching them little - of foxes back

home with the master of the hunt and
all the gentry in the county down on him
no chum tis dangerous to kill a fox

a fox-a fox ye big idiot ye didnt-

ye wouldnt-

yes a fox i let him go here he was
in the trap and says i nobodys seen him
for theres no tracks about-and that was
woodscraft chum me rememberin to look
for ski marks-heres this fox and if any

 bill came closer and shook his fist under
 the big mans nose

what do you mean by off color

 it was a sort of black and old too for i

seen white hairs on it-

 flatfoot was prepared to describe the fox
 completely but old bill had stopped listen-
 ing he had grabbed the hand ax

 sort of off color screamed old bill
 with silver hairs amongst the gold like
 chop-chop-chop as he attacked the bunk-
 post

flatfoot hawkins for i let him go

adventure

know how they treats them foxes in your
country-a lord i guided once told me but
shucks whats the use youll be little
johnny-mind-the-fire for a bit from now
on and any time you get conceited you go
count the notches in yonder bunk-post

         it was a week later that the
bull moose came plowing through
bp the heavy snow toward the
cabin he was a rangy brute
new to that district unused to man for he
came from the barrens to the north and
through thick falling snow he did not see
the cabin till he stood half way up the open
meadow right where the wind had piled the
snow deepest

  hawkins spotted him and called old bill
the great brute was standing stock still his
back level with the snow head up and nose
working

  old bill was in good humor his traps
had yielded another fox the day before and
this time it had not got away

  no use wasting catridges on him hes
snowbound he remarked as he slipped on
his snowshoes over five foot o soft snow
where he is and i aim to keep him there he
continued

  you arent going to tackle him with that
knife hawkins asked incredulously

  seein that my teeth is dull i reckon i
got to bill started down the slope be-
sides if i bit him he might get peevish
ive known em to flatfoot

  at his coming the moose turned and tried
to flounder back toward the river but old
bill headed him off on snowshoes he could
easily outstrip the huge floundering animal

  the moose turned again toward the
cabin making slow progress of it as he
plowed through the deep snow old bill
went round him again he was trying to
get in position for what he had in mind a
swift stab of the long keen knife at the
great beasts throat on any other footing
it would have been impossible even here
there was the chance that the moose might
break for firmer going and make it

  the bull seemed to read his purpose and
swung down-river keeping however to the
deep snow of midslope old bill turned
with him running along beside him wait-
ing his chance had he been alone he would
have ended the business then and there if
indeed he had ever started this hippodrom-
ing but from the corner of his eye he could

see flatfoot goggling on the hilltop as ap-
preciative an audience as any old white-
headed show-off could ever hope for hed
show the greenhorn a bit of woodscraft hed
remember would old bill stevens

  so he kept pace with the wallowing fran-
tic animal and herded it along with loud
cries until they were near the edge of the
pines then and then only with the art-
ists nice instinct for the proper climax old
bill put on speed came up along the heaving
back of the animal and bent to drive home
his knife

  it was at this moment that his left snow-
shoe came off

  he fell the moose as if sensing what
had happened as if realizing that this pur-
suer was now at his mercy stopped then
turned old bill fumbling frantically
could not get that webbed shoe on again
and as he gripped the half-frozen thongs of
the harness his knife slipped from his grasp
he was as helpless with the one snowshoe as
a one-legged man on skates worst of all
the big moose seemed to know it

  he came slowly deliberately toward bill
stevens bill could see his great eyes fixed
on him could almost read the purpose in
them

  he was not however the kind to give up
easily walking let alone running was
impossible in that deep snow but he could
roll and like a great snowball bill stevens
started down hill toward the river and
the moose as if playing some game kept
pace with him

  up on the hilltop flatfoot hawkins ex-
corporal of the guards to whom a moose
was a new and terrifying animal turned and
dived for the cabin when he came out
again old bill was near the bottom of the
slope and the moose angling round him
and found firmer footing old bill tired
by his strenuous progress sought to slither
away as the bull edged closer to him but
he knew that he was done except for a mir-
acle  knew that the big bull overcoming his
last doubts and fears was about to strike

  the huge brute came closer rose on his
hind legs his huge bulk towered over old
bill his forelegs working like pistons
struck at the trapper prone there on the
snow

  by a supreme effort bill stevens clawed
out of reach the moose bounded forward
rose again and again those sharp hoofs
struck
the guardsman

  and then crack-crack-crack old bill
stevens wondered why they had rifles in
heaven wondered what that sticky hot
stuff was that first dripped then spurted
over him wondered as the great bulk and
its black shadow on the snow slipped slowly
sidewise and disappeared

  then crouching there in the snow bill
stevens saw the bull lay in the snow be-
side him thrashing out his life over its
heart was a bullet hole

  bill staggered to his feet he had lost
his second snowshoe during this frantic
progress down grade he stood there hip
deep

  up on the crest of the hill at the edge
of the hard-trodden snow around the cabin
lay ex-corporal hawkins of the guards
his body at an angle to the line of fire his
elbows firmly planted in the snow legs out-
spread a smoking rifle in his hands had
old bill been a military expert he would
have known this for the prone position in
musketry and he would have admitted
that like everything else military a guards-
man did it well

  he turned to the moose it was dead
already

  lucky shot he concluded and lucky

bill stevens one o them other bullets
might just as well ha winged me

  and he bent to examine the wound
then he whistled for the bullet hole re-
sembled a three-leaf clover

  three hits at two hundred yards he
shook his head whod ha thought it

  then started up the slope

  ex-corporal hawkins was methodically
cleaning the rifle when he entered the cabin

 where the dad-burned - did you

learn to shoot like that asked old bill a
trifle pettishly in spite of his gratitude

  in the guards flatfoot told him
you see chum when things gets a bit hct
anywheres they sends out the guards to
mop up

  will you talk sense pardner old bill
requested humbly will you take pity on
an old bushman that finds he dont know
nothing after all will you say simple
what you was and what you shot in them
guards

  i was a sniper replied flatfoot haw-
kins squinting down the rifle barrel and
sometimes i shot at targets but mostly i
shot at men

  do tell whispered old bill stevens
weakly
  a work of art

        by earl h emmons

 ou can have your foreign artists with their temperament and such

but these soul interpretations dont get me excited much
though i give them fellers credit for the way they play their part
still a makin scenes and statues aint the only form of art

i contend it doesnt matter what a fellers job may be

if hes got the thing perfected to a really high degree

and hes far above the average in his craft why then i say

hes an artist just as much as them as works with paint and clay

as a bright and fair example of an artist like i mean

i would place in nomination sheriff jackson j mckeene

theres a man that made a record for the ages i opine

and youll never find his equal in his own respective line

he was not exactly cultured but he had an honest heart

and the way he done his work was simply nothin less than art

he was good in all the branches he could ride and trail and shoot
but the times he showed his genius was at hangin some galoot

like a pearl from out an oyster what was raised in mud and slime

he would take a common hangin and hed make the thing sooblime
and i claim the same was art with all the handicaps he had

for at times his raw materials was pretty blasted bad

take the case of buzzard kelly who was stretched for rustlin steers
why youd never see a sweeter job in seven hundred years

as a work with style and finish it was really rerkyshay

and i recollect it just as plain as if it was today

there was first a rangy rostrum on a shady stretch of ground

and a center dinin table with some small ones herded round

and the socially eleete from near and far was gathered there

for to cheer the buzzards journey when he dumb the golden stair 

and the tables they was loaded with a fodder fit for kings

such as pie and puddin cake and fruit and all them tasty things
while a juicy yearlin steer was kept a roastin on the coals

which the same had been a member of the herd that kelly stole

at the center set some deputies and sheriff jack mckeene

with the honored guest of honor mister kelly in between

all partakin of refreshments in a manner blithe and gay

while a band of seven pieces tooted joyfully away


             a work of art

and the only thing youd noticq that would maybe strike you queer
was a rope that looped the buzzards neck and knotted by his ear
while the other end was fastened to an over hangin limb
that pertruded from a shady tree direct in back of him

and the rope around his guzzle had been padded soft and wide

so the thing would not annoy him none or scratch his tender hide
then a roomy pit was shoveled out beneath the buzzards chair

but the hole was covered with a trap so no one knowed its there

they was kegs of flowin liquor for to give the party zest
and a many merry toast was drunk unto the honored guest

then a puncher sung some ditties with the music soft and low

and the parson got aboard a keg and said a prayer or so

then the buzzard made a speech and took occasion to declare
how entranced he was to be the guest at such a swell affair

it was quite the greatest show hed been invited to in years

and he said he wouldnt missed it for a half a hundred steers

he declared the sheriffs thoughtfulness he never would forget

said mckeene was sure the finest man that he had ever met

and the only thing that saddened him about the party was
that he didnt have a dozen lives to give in such a cause 

then the sheriff thanked the speaker and he said the blasted town
sure was honored for to honor such a rustler of renown

then he bowed to kelly while the crowd began to cheer and clap
and when kelly rose to bow in turn the sheriff yanked the trap

and the buzzard left the party through the hole beneath the floor
and the trap swung back and everything was peaceful as before
then the band it played the endin of a blasted perfect day

as we drunk to our departed guest who had been called away

and when kelly finished kickin and the rope was straight and still
then we pulled him out and planted him on cemetery hill

and the band it broke into the tune of hot old times tonight

as it led the way to caseys bar the buckaroos delight

and i claim its art to hang a man in such a pleasant way

leavin him and everybody pleased the which is why i say
that the hall of fame aint finished till it honors jack mckeene
as the greatest hangin artist that the world has ever seen

author of god of the sakoi the secret of the timor lout etc

ihe eggs that the old malay
womans sellin you these days is
somethin brutal on bein rotten
remarked port light johnson
as he got down on his knees to blow the
coconut-coir fire over which he was cooking
breakfast among the rocks on the beach

  having only one eye and that the left he
had long been known as port light to the
sailors and beachcombers from sydney to
vigan

  thursday smith was sitting in the edge
jungle and much concerned with mending
his old dungaree trousers

  you cook them eggs and keep your trap
shut he remarked pleasantly holding up
what was left of his trousers and scanning
them critically in an attempt to decide
whether the contemplated patch should go
on with a bias which would simplify sub-
sequent sewing

  port light turned and trained his marble-
white dead eye on thursday the other eye
was squinted from the smoke

  dont you try to lord it over me thurs-
day just because its my turn at bein cook
fix your breeches if you like but mind what
im tellin you of-the eggs is bad that
malay  womans chickens is stayin out
nights and layin eggs in the jungle thems
what she sells to us-and keeps the fresh
ones for the swells at the kota baiun hotel
me i aint goin to eat dud eggs

  he swung to the fire again taking care of
his bare knees as he got down in the sand
his trousers of dirty canvas were cut off at

the knees and he wore shoes with elastic
tops that curled down over his sockless
ankles giving him something of the appear-
ance of a wood-sprite or the fairy shoe-
maker that is always pictured in books of
fanciful people for children

  his old gingham shirt still had the vague
traces of a red pattern running through the
faded fabric his bare head had a yellow-
ish thatch of hair that curled in ringlets
about his ears and neck his blue eye and
his white one looked most startling in their
setting of sun-browned skin

  then go down to the kota baiun and
eat on the restaurant veranda and have
native flunkeys to hand your grub to you
said thursday you dont cook them
eggs right-you boil em too long to have
em soft and not long enough to have em
hard that makes em sticky

  he looked out over the rosy sea and the
salmon sky for the sun was well up and the
morning too lovely to bother about sewing
patches on trousers he set aside his needle
and cord and put the trousers on-tomor-
row would be time enough to worry about
patches

  thursday smith was a big-framed man
burned red instead of black by the sun
his face was covered with a reddish beard
that had a way of growing naturally into a
peak on his chin this gave him a look
of distinction in spite of his old dungaree
trousers his bare feet were soled with
pads of canvas that were tied across the in-
steps with bits of leather his wrinkled


king of the beachcombers



old pilot cap had probably once adorned
the head of some steamship mate before
thursday salvaged it from the sea the cap
had floated some thousands of miles in
the pacific the rusty top that had once
been white had absorbed perspiration from
thursdays overlong hair but he wore
that cap with a jaunty tilt over an ear
just as his rough and untrimmed beard
suggested an unkempt medical man the
battered framework of the old cap gave
thursday an air of command

  he carried his chin forward and there
was something in his steady gray eyes that
was pleasantly aggressive-and mildly chal-
lenged whoever met them it was quite
within possibility that if thursday smith
had chosen to do so he might be in a posi-
tion of command he had undoubtedly
controlled something before he had turned
beachcomber

  on the score of what thursday had been
his companions had long since let their
curiosity die out-mate of a finer or skip-
per of a schooner they had never decided to
their own satisfaction he had been some-
thing in ships that was plain enough-he
had the seamans eye for all rigs but he
had never taken his friends into his confi-
dence and they had never worked them-
selves up to the bold point of asking for in-
formation

  it is not good form to ask friends in the
south seas who are on the beach what they
were before they came where they hailed
from and what they intend to do next
when beachcombers tell of themselves of
their own accord they are generally lying
so nobody found fault because he called
himself thursday smith his name being
neither thursday nor smith the thurs-
day part of it came from his having
joined fortunes with port light johnson at
thursday island at that time neither of
them had any fortune and little prospect
of having one either jointly or singly in the
future

  both men were chronic beachcombers
they were most successful at the profession
there were few islands of the south pacific
they had not combed and now they had
invaded malaysia they avoided every-
thing in the form of honest work though
they always managed to pretend to be
making a fairly good go at trepang fishing
and the board on which port light was
laying out breakfast for six persons was

fitted with eating utensils not to be expected
from beachcombers-silver egg-cups silver
spoons silver-topped glass saltshakers a
silver coffee-pot and delicate chinaware
cups with blue bands

  all these things were marked kota
baiun which was the name of the dutch
hotel at port retzenborg a half a mile or so
around the bend of the point of rocks in
which port light was doing his cooking

  thursday stood up and scanned the
smooth sea thoughtfully as if he might find
something on its surface which would be of
vital importance he yawned comfortably
looked back toward the rim of jungle and
walked down to where port light was boil-
ing the eggs in tin cans

  there was a great barrier of rock that ran
out of the hills of the jungle that barrier
shut off the sea in the direction of port
retzenborg and behind the ridge of rocks
the cooking was done it was impossible
for any one to come up the beach from the
hotel without being observed through the
holes in the rocks along the upper ridge if
a man stood beside the rock wall he could
just see to the warehouses and wharf of
port retzenborg and make out a corner of
the front veranda

  behind this barrier the beachcombers
cooked and ate their meals when the
weather was dry and pleasant with sil-
verware for their meals they did not want
anybody to drop in on them unexpectedly
the beaches in both directions assured them
of this needed privacy-and no one could
come along the jungle trails without being
heard so their outdoor kitchen and din-
ing-room was a flat stretch of sand with
rocks ranged around it for seats one side
being formed by the rocky barrier which ran
down into the sea and formed a reef that
jutted out from the island

  hello remarked thursday as he leaned
against the rocky ridge and looked in the
direction of the hotel the palembangs
coming in

port light was cracking an
egg with all the care to be ex-
pected in an experiment of vast
importance to scientific progress

  sure i heard her whistle a bit back he
remarked blowing his fingers to cool them

  thursday surveyed the squatty little
steamer as she drew in for the wharf her red
funnel visible over the top of the warehouse


adventure

   its getting so a man could set his watch
by them dutch boats he remarked

  port light hurled the egg into the sea
you and your blasted worryin on them
dutch boats he exclaimed disgustedly
your jobs to buy eggs-we aint runnin
no hatchery here but a eatin joint

  oh shut up about the eggs retorted
thursday without turning around

  youll hear from the dude if his
eggs aint fresh warned port light you
know how he is he looks to us to see his
grub is fit to eat

  aw he can go down to the kota baiun
and eat which we cant said thursday
im getting tired of hearing what the dude
has to have-its dude this and dude that
i dont want his swell airs around me if i
hear anything out of him about the eggs i
buy u jump the gang and you close
your trap too im as good as dude fen-
ton-and better than you belay

  you better look out what you say like
that-out loud warned port light with a
nervous glance back to the jungle you
got style ill admit or i wouldnt have
joined up as chum and come to the dude
i aint so sure you couldnt do as well as
him-or mebbe better-at the game he
plays with the swells at the kota baiun

hotel and-

  dry up porty broke in thursday

  he was pleasant about it but he meant
what he said and port light knew orders
when he heard them his allegiance was
more to thursday than to dude fenton
who bossed the gang in more than one
port where fenton had operated and had
been suspected or known as the head of a
gang of beachcombers he was known to the
police as king of the beachcombers he
had a way of drawing about him all the
shiftless neer-do-wells and instructing them
in knavery

  well im talkin for your own good-
and mine thursday went on port light
dont git shirty im for you-and if you
jump the gang count me in i know a good
pal when i have one

  all right all right said thursday ir-
ritably he seemed to have something on
his mind that he wanted to consider far
more than his relations with dude fenton or
port light for there was a dreamy look in
his eyes as he watched the palembang draw-
ing in to her dock

   it was likely that as he had given up more

of the good things of life than port light in
order to live the lazy life of a beach vaga-
bond thursday was lusting for respecta-
bility and companions more suited to his

tastes

  its them blasted eggs that got my foot
into it with you mourned port light pres-
ently i aint meanin to grouse so if
youll be a bit chummy ill-

  thursday swung round on him

  im sick of this porty he admitted
with a queer ferocity in his look and his
cautious tones youre all right-but the
dude gets on my nerves with his high and
mighty ideas and what have i come to-
a rank beacher mixed up with a murdering
cockney a slick thief like the dude and that
slimy phil jones whos only waiting his
chance to double-cross the lot of us with
the dude when things fall their way

  yes ive mistrusted phil some time
admitted port light as he began to put the
eggs into the silver cups he glanced over
his shoulder at the jungle again fearsome
now

  but you keep your gloves on thursday
my boy and dont let em see the claw
youve got well slip our cablesyou and
me on the lot

  drop it for now cautioned thursday
glancing to the jungle himself suddenly
wary as if he had heard some suspicious
sound from the greenery the dude may
be listening-and wed better talk this out
when were sure were alone

   maybe its the nigger thats listenin for
him whispered port light

   the niggers the best of the lot outside
of ourselves said thurdsay drawing close
to the other the elephants honest-
hes a vagabond and he doesnt care who
knows it-and if i was to lose him and his
mandolin-id jump out quick in the first
dirty trader thatd take me foremast for my
passage

  he turned back to the wall of rocks and
gave his attention to the palembang once
more

  look as if shes brought any passen-
gers asked port light in a loud tone
signaling that he understood that the con-
versation from now on should be on safe
grounds

  cant say yet replied thursday in
kind but the palembang generally has
good pickings

  them eggs is done as much as theyre
king of the beachcombers



goin to be done said port light from
a cairn of rocks he drew out an old oiltin
which was banded round its middle with a
smear of sticky stuff to keep insects and
rock prowlers of various kinds from crawling
up the sides of the tin and getting into the
food supplies he lifted off the canvas top
and took out rolls a pot of jam and a tin
of scotch biscuits from london

  coffee up-and hot called port light
to the edge of the jungle come and git
it you swells that sleep while the cook
ruins his blasted complexion in the smoke
and gits freckles on his neck chow-take
it or leave it me im ready to eat

  you-all dont have to call me but one
times came a melodious voice from the
jungle them is sweet words pot light
ah does love mah hens-aigs

  thursday sat down on a convenient rock
while port light went for the coffee-pot
it was standing on hot sand and the
remnants of a second fire in among the
rocks

  here you are mlord said port light as
he poured a blue-banded cup full of the
brown liquid for thursday hotel coffee
just as good as if you had it on the veranda
of the kota baiun-and cheaper when
youve got the galley job next mind what
im tellin you of and let the coffee be made
first and then stand on hot ashes-separate
fire i make from the eggs the fire that
boils the eggss too hot for the coffee and
the eggs do better cooked last on a quick
fire

  youre a nifty stewards department
complimented thursday as he sipped the
coffee with appreciation thats the real
stuff port light ill never be able to make
coffee as well as you do extra fire or no

  port light chuckled and grinned glad for
the compliment thursdays sharpness had
worried him stick to me thursday me
boy and ill put fat on your ribs anybody
can make good coffee with the storeroom of
the kota baiun to draw it from-its rich
stuff ill say the word

  better give that lot of loafers another
call suggested thursday as he reached to
the board for his silver egg-cup and a spoon
theyll give an awful growl if they find
their grub cold and he winked at port
light

  rise and shine mates called port
light loudly to the jungle if you dont
lay forard and put on the old feedbag

youll find your coffee cold and the cook

cross

  theres something afoot in that little

party whispered thursday you watch
my words-theres crooked work among
em and thats why they hang back on us
ill bet the dude is lining up the three with
him to skip out and leave us flat on our own
maybe its the palembang they intend to
give us the pier-head j ump in i know-the
dudes been waiting for something to hap-
pen thatll give him his chance to leave us
in the lurch

  mebbe wed do better to go it alone
whispered port light in assent lay off-
here comes the dude

  there was a rustling sound from the
near-by jungle then subdued voices
something twanged musically and was fol-
lowed by a mellow good-natured laugh

  a tall white man broke through the wall-
like edge of the jungle and stepped out on
the sand he was dude fenton leader of
the gang

h

fenton walked straight across
the sand carrying a small black
box in his hand he was fairly
well dressed in comparison with
thursday and port light having on a
suit of old white clothes complete though
frayed at the edges stained and dirty

  he had on a white shirt and old low shoes
his garments proclaimed him as a man
lacking funds and apparently without any
regular means of making a suitable living

  but one thing marked fenton apart from
the two men at breakfast-his hair was
neatly cut in every other detail he might
easily be taken for a man who spent his time
loafing with these others who wore long
hair and untrimmed beards and seemed to
be in the hopeless poverty of unashamed
vagabonds

  he was naturally a fastidious man from
that fact had sprung his nickname of
dude for in spite of a three-day black
beard on his cheeks he looked neat and
clean so far as his person was concerned-
clean hands white teeth and a face well-
rounded and free of deep lines which
always mark the beachcomber who lives
from hand to mouth on improper food in
fact it was a jaunty figure which emerged
from the jungle into the sunlight of that
tropical morning


adventure

  fenton was a young man-probably not
more than thirty his eyes were brown and
soft lacking in the hardness to be expected
in a man who managed to live by keen wits
and slippery fingers

   but there was a shrewdness in his look
for all his outward softness-a gentle bland-
ness that considered and measured every
fact behind eyes which were filled with
lazy indifference to everything about him
dressed in good clothes dude fenton could
have passed anywhere as a spoiled son of
wealthy parents who regarded the world and
its work-a-day people with light contempt

   he wore no hat but his cheeks were not
sun-seared like port light and thursday
who were literally burned the dude
merely had that deep tan which is acquired
by the white man who is accustomed to the
tropics

  he strode across the flat sand which
floored the inclosed space where the others
were sitting at their breakfast he gave
them a nod remarking-

   coffee smells good port light

  he passed on to the barrier of rocks
where he put down his black box and stared
over the beach in the direction of the hotel

  palembangs in on time suggested
thursday

   so i see said the dude studying the
distant vista and passengers coming
ashore good

  the others stood up and ranged beside
him he moved away from them pre-
tending to seek a better vantage point it
was a little way he had this always keeping
out of reach of any grouping of his com-
panions

  two-four-and that man in the lead-
five id say said thursday

  ive counted nine walking up to the
kota baiun said fenton it looks as if
well have rich pickings this trip

  all in white-with sun-helmets went
on thursday that looks as if theyre not
ordinary trippers-but planters and traders
fenton grinned

  thats what we want-planters and
traders id say they intend to wait over
three days to catch the down steamer for
balik papan

thats fat for us said port light
yes it means theyll have plenty of
cash agreed fenton a shift of ships
here always means good business for us
we certainly picked a good place when we

decided to stay on here-nothing better for
what we want than a small port where

traders shift boats

  the tourist crowd comes ashore and
leaves the bulk of their cash aboard the
steamer in the pursers safe go back aboard
at sailing time and im lucky if i get a
watch or two and little good we get out of
watches and jewelry

  as they stood watching the passengers
walk up to the kota baiun three other
figures came from the jungle walking lei-
surely and talking quietly together

  toady harry was the one a little in the
lead-a short and burly figure he was
thick-set of body but not fleshy in the sense
of being fat rather his shoulders were
heavy and his short legs revealed by his
attenuated trousers were round

  on closer inspection his trousers were not
trousers at all but pongee silk pajamas
belted with a strip of the same material the
bottoms being hacked off he wore one
white shoe and one brown one both lacking
strings only the top eyelets having a thong
tied across them over the insteps

  his bare freckled arms were strongly
muscled and adorned with tattooed figures
of ships flags snakes butterflies-all done
with the gorgeous coloring and delicate lines
which betray the skilled work of japanese

  the cotton undershirt which lay open in
front for lack of buttons revealed more
colored patterns some of which disappeared
along the round of his body under his arms
his hairy chest was a veritable bulwark of
flesh and bone bulging out like the breast of
a pouter pigeon

  toadys head was round and set low on
his shoulders by a short neck his hair
was long and down about his ears while a
fringe of black beard covered his jaws a
tooth was missing in front his ears were
overlarge and the flesh of them lay in queer
bunches as if they were still in the process
of growing and had not yet fallen into their
ultimate shapes

  his black eyes had a humorous squint
he carried a bamboo pole a little longer
than necessary for a cane but it was plain
that he did not need this staff for support
for he strode along with light feet prodding
the sand with the pole

  the next was phil jones he was long
and gangling walking with loose joints and
a suggestion of daintiness which was not
the result of any desire to walk affectedly
king of the beachcombers



but was due to the fact that he wore heel-
less slippers of faded red velvet as the
sand had a way of getting into the toes of
the slippers he picked up his feet in a pecu-
liar manner to avoid the sharp particles
which otherwise would chafe his soles

  phils trousers were strangely new being
of a light seersucker material of light gray
he wore a waistcoat of checked material
dirty and lacking half its buttons and a
tailless stewards jacket of blue goods un-
buttoned with brass buttons down the
front these buttons he apparently kept
bright by polishing for they gave him a
strangely smart appearance

  he might easily be taken for a ships
steward who had rambled away from the
docks for a look round ashore and had
found the vessel gone when he returned
this idea was strengthened by his white
canvas sailors cap with brim turned up all
around it was cleanly white having been
washed countless times in salt water and
allowed to dry in strong sunlight

  phils face was thin and of sallow color
there was a look of sadness in his gray eyes
as if he mourned over some secret wo
his hair was sandy and though he was not
shaven his beard had little body to it con-
sisting of a few light and straggling hairs on
his jaw and upper lip as if the soil in which
they grew was too weak to produce hair of
virility

  he was a man who enjoyed bodily ease
but his natural laziness was counterbalanced
by a nimble and devious brain he knew
how to plan things that required subtlety
and caution though the others were not
aware of it phil jones and fenton were in
secret alliance it was phil who kept fen-
ton informed of how the others might be
handled to best advantage and how they
were inclined to regard him and his project
while he was out of their company

  the last of the trio was a big and soft
black man who walked like an animated
jelly roll his shoulders threatening to ooze
out of his coat through the seams

  it was a dungaree jumper that betrayed
engine-room antecedents being oily about
the side pockets in which some former
wearer had kept a supply of wiping-waste
it was a tremendous garment washed clean
except for the oil stains it flopped loosely
about the mountainous bulk of body which
gave to the black man his sobriquet of
elephant joe

  below the jacket he wore a pair of loose
and voluminous trousers made from that
rough and porous material known as
crash the trousers were a surprisingly
good fit and the mystery of the excellent
tailoring for a man beyond all reason in
size was due to the fact that elephant joe
had made the trousers himself when it
was known that the toweling used in the
kitchen of the kota baiun hotel was of the
same crash the source of elephant joes
cloth was no longer a mystery sea boots
with the tops cut off protected his elephan-
tine feet

  his big woolly head was round and shining
with cocoanut oil used as a pomade on
the hair his thick neck was scarred with
whitish slashes where knives or razors had
found their marks in previous years-scarred
he was like an ancient whale harpooned
many times but with the iron never driven
deep enough to hold the harpooners line

  his face was round and soft nose flat and
vibrant and his lips thick and cut on lines of
good nature-made for smiling and mostly
always set in a half-grin as if he had just
heard of something which amused him and
in time would laugh heartily when he could
give proper thought to the matter

  in his right hand he carried a small and
delicate mandolin fretted with strips of
ivory along its neck the left hand had
been mutilated-trimmed down to stubs of
fingers with a sharp instrument so that the
first finger was the shortest of all and the
little one the longest thus the hand had
the aspect of some triangular tool devised
for delving in soft material he had cut
the fingers away himself when his hand was
trapped in a hatch of a sinking ship

  wow called elephant joe as he drew
near the board just smell that cawfee
and hens aigs we suttinly is livin rich
and slippey white men

         the three looking in the direc-
tion of the hotel turned back and
sat down to resume the meal hail-
ing the newcomers with nods of
salutation

  phil jones scanned the board with the
egg-cups and the coffee-pot with sad eyes
he was the last to take a seat and stood
staring at the breakfast awaiting him

  whats wrong with the chow matey
asked port light dont it suit

  so youre at it again remarked phil


adventure

  whats wrong demanded port light
squinting his good eye always a sign of
belligerency if you dont like what ive
got kick out of your bunk early and cook
yourself

  the cookings all right said phil but
i tell you again-this handing out the grub
with the swanky hotel silver is dangerous
to the lot of us well be caught with it
and then were done for good and plenty
fenton nodded up at him

  maybe youre right phil he admitted
ive felt the same way about it but i dont
like to be at em all the time to be careful
his agreement with phil had been ar-
ranged between them for fenton was care-
ful to avoid an excess of giving orders so
that when he had to handle the gang for
some serious thing they gave heed to him
so he had primed phil to make it appear
that the objection to using the silver came
from phil himself when as a matter of fact
it was fenton who feared they might be
trapped by being caught with stolen goods

  aw no danger said port light easily
whos to see the silver we can hear any-
body cornin along the beach by the crunch
of sand under foot and the same with the
jungle on dry leaves-and as for boats who
can come near me-i likes a little swank
with my meals

  you luxury loving son of a sea cook
laughed the dude but phil is right just
the same

  tyke no chawnces thats my motter
said toady harry

  aw whats the row dude asked port
light with a glance to thursday takes
only a few minutes to eat and ive the hole
ready in the rocks to dump the silver if
theres danger-and cover it over with sand
whats the good of usin old tins to eat
when weve got this silver

  melt the bloomin stuff thats what i
says remarked toady as he sat down in
the sand near the board with its row of cups
and coffee its as phil ere says-too
much risk swankin it with the plyte no
chawnce i says again for the lot of us i
wants no bloomin jyle

  elephant joe lay down on his back along-
side toady and rested the mandolin across
his middle ah has mah say to say he
suggested talking to the pearl-colored sky
and this is it white men ah eats last-
and im hongry let loose with the grub-
ah craves mah aigs

  phil sat down and helped himself

  you said a mouthful elephant agreed
thursday if there was less talk and
more eating thered be less danger at hav-
ing the silver seen

  elephant joe when all the others were
eating roused himself and took an egg-cup
and his coffee ah knows mah place and
ah keeps it he remarked to the company
ahm independent because ah dont have
to be waited on ah takes mah turn on the
kitchen job but nobody waits on me no
time ah knows old man trouble by the
sounds of his feet and this boy knows no
good comes from havin a white man wait
on him-it suttinly strains me if ah cant
hep mahself

  he gurgled with laughter over his joke
and gulped his coffee appreciatively

  his hasty breakfast finished fenton got
to his feet and returned to the little black
box he had left on the rocks he opened
it took out a gold-plated safety razor bor-
rowed a little warm water for his brush and
lathered himself with a stick of soap using
a little mirror in the top of the box

  id take a whirl at that razor myself
if i thought it was good sense said phil
jones

  toady harry laughed scornfully you
leave the shyvin to dude the rest of us
keeps rough-lookin tyke no chawnces
thats my motter

  you is the cookinest man ah ever did
meet up with declared elephant joe to
port light them aigs pot light
what you-all needs to be doin-of is runnin
a ho-tel

  listen to the retired chef said port
light grinning i see through you-
that cracks to keep me wantin to have the
cook-trick right along every day

  the black gurgled with the laughter
which flowed so easily from him dont
you call me no chef-only on my cook-trick
in this ere place does i look at grub and a
fiah mah cheffin days is over

  no fruit with this breakfast grumbled
phil jones if id known you didnt in-
tend to raid the chinamans mango trees

   ark at the toff jeered toady harry
 is tucker aint good enough for im-needs

pawssenger me i opes as ow i dont

king of the beachcombers

ii

  you drink too much trade gin thats
why you cant eat fruit retorted phil

  drop the arguments advised dude
fenton youll need your wits for some-
thing else before the days over i dont
want to start out on this job and leave a row
behind me-eat drink and be thankful and
take your ease things are going to change
for us if i dont miss my guess ive a
feeling that well make a mop-up out of this
last trip of the palembang her passengers
look as if they might be plentifully supplied
with cash

   ear ear remarked toady harry but
without enthusiasm

  port light threw out a hand to seaward
and leaped to his feet sail ho he cried
a schooner-hull down-and heading for
port retzenborg or im a tailor

  they all stood up for a better view of the
strange sail on the glittering horizon

xcxb ho you blighter cried toady
harry in delight as he studied the
sails of the schooner i know
that beggar-id know her forty
mile awyl

  you big bluff said port light know
that schooner how could you know a ves-
sel that--

  mind wot im tellin you of persisted
toady i knows that packet when she
was blackbirdin some four year back
blinkin sydneyman er

  my aunt spurned port light you
know every ship that crosses hereabouts
toady you know too much dont pull
that stuff on us-we aint a lot of lands-
men

  and so i do know most of em that
passes ereabouts insisted toady that
there shes the-the-wots er nyme-
untong thats it out o sydney just
mind that oh for a sight o sydney
eads

  so you want to jump the gang eh and
go back to sydney asked fenton as he
turned to toady with a scornful look that
was made more withering by the fact that
his voice was low as he charged the cockney
with a desire to break away from his life of
ease

  wot of it asked toady aint i got
a blinkin right to go where and when i
likes am i a blinkin slyve not me
dude youre an american-i as my
rights and you mind wot youre a sayin of

one king is enough for me-dont throw no
royal blood in my fyce

  the cockney was ready for fight and
cared not at all who might know it

  you can go where you like said fenton
coldly only when you want to go say so
dont pretend you want to go and make
everybody else homesick and down in the
mouth shut up or get out

  look ere shot back toady i can
git out dude im a blinkin wet blanket
on this lot ill tyke my split o the swag
and op it come night ill be abord that
sydney packet as you sees cornin in and
ready to syle awy iner

  this was more than the dude had bar-
gained for it was the first time he had
failed to bluff down any insubordination
toady harry was too valuable a man to
have in reserve-too handy with a knife-
to let him go besides there was danger in
any attempt he might make to go alone

  his share of the loot that had been col-
lected at port retzenborg consisted in
addition to cash to sundry watches rings
and silverware lifted from the kota baiun
hotel and toady might be caught with
the loot on him before the schooner got
away a few drinks of gin and toady
might well bring ruin to fenton and the
others

  five pairs of eyes turned upon toady
fenton saw that he must change his tactics

  you listen to me toady began fenton
in deadly earnest dont go off your head
at sight of a dirty schooner well all see
sydney again and when we do well be
well fixed one good cash haul is all i want
and then weve got something to work with
plenty of cash thats the ticket you
cant take a sea-bag full of jewelry into syd-
ney and sell it without being caught you
may be caught with it before this schooner
sails with you from port retzenborg now
have some sense-and leave things to me
dude is right said phil jones quietly
we cant go to splitting up now let him
make a good cash haul as he says

  go aead and make your aul said
toady only dont myke me feel like a
crimson slyve

  fenton picked up the box with his
shaving gear and gave phil jones a signifi-
cant look he waved a hand at the silver
egg-cups and other dishes on the board

  put all this stuff away he ordered
bury it in the sand again port light


adventure 

and get out the tin cans for cooking so itll
look around here as if we barely kept our-
selves alive break a few coconuts and
mess the place up a little as if youd just
made a meal on the pickings of the palm-
grove down below it may suit my pur-
poses to bring some of the passengers from
the palembang up the beach to see some
real wild beachcombers and if i do get
one and hes plenty of cash- he
shrugged his shoulders and jerked his thumb
at toady give him the knife-we cant
spend the rest of our lives here waiting to
pick up cash out of a drunken tourists
pockets at the hotel 

  id say that lot off the palembang are
all traders or planters-and theyll hate the
sight of beachcombers said thursday

  there might be a tourist in the lot-a
regular griffin who wants to see beachcomb-
ers and all that said fenton now be-
have yourselves elephant you give this
sentimental crowd a song or two to lift
their spirits and port light-hand round
the best cigarets and see if a little more
luxuryll make the boys satisfied

  he strode away from them back for the
jungle and elephant picked up his mando-
lin he laid his maimed hand caressingly
over the strings snapped a bit of ivory out
from under the bridge and with a few pre-
liminary notes turned loose with a witch-
ing strumming he laid back on the sand
and opened his great mouth drew in the
morning air with a gulp that sounded like a
grampus that has come up to breathe and
began lullingly low

   ahm goin home some old day oh ba-a-aby

  ahm a-goin home

  the refrain was in a minor key that was
barely audible and suggested a nurse sing-
ing gently to a child about to go to sleep

  you goin to sing that demanded
toady angrily blawst you and your blink-
in ome you fair gives me the creeps

  you shut up snapped phil jones as
the mandolin wept out its soul on the re-
frain and died away in the prattle of the
surf through the holes in the coral reef

  yes let him sing toady said port
light

   same boat brought me erell bring me back

   oh ho-o-o-ny

chanted elephant joe with a new burst of
melody from the strings of the mandolin and

a liquid crooning of music from those great
gross lips the refrain was a ob softened
and made beautiful by the vaguest of music
from the strings toady turned his face
away from the others his eyes leaking tears

         pa said to go ma said to stay

         ahll have a dollar some old day

         blowed lak she never blowed befo

         oh ba-a-a-by

  once more the music of the mandolin died
away in melody that suggested the strum-
ming of the celestial spheres against a
breeze from heaven

   yoll shorely wait till ah gits home

  to feed you on a big ham-bone oh ba-a-aby

  the big black cast the mandolin aside
the vibrations of its strings seemed to
linger in the air and still to echo through
the sea-holes which countless tides had
cut through the reef the beating of the
gentle swells seemed to have drawn the
sic to themselves and oh ba-a-a-by in
tones as soft and vague as one might hear
in a seashell that had captured some fairy
music seemed to come lapping back with
the slap and sigh of the water elephant
joe had performed the miracle of imparting
the time and melody of his tune to the very
sea itself

i calls it brutal thats wot
gasped toady harry as he stood
up he walked off toward the
beach shaking his head sadly

  where are you going demanded phil
jones

  none o your blinkin business retorted
toady without looking back but if you
wants to know that music has spoiled my
breakfast

  whats the matter with the singin 
demanded port light me i calls it
good

  too blawsted good thats wot said
toady as he swung back toward them i
says as ow elephant joe shouldnt go and
fair break our earts with the likes o that

i	ad a ome once and this is all very well for
as far as it goes wot with livin easy but
some dy i wants to go back where a man
can live civilized he waved a hand at the
sun and blinked moistly at the sand under
his feet

  you all craves hard work mr man
remarked elephant joe to the sky fo
king of the beachcombers



    every year is a minute and ah never did
such easy times ony thing strains
ah cant live lak this fo ten thousand
ars

   oh its right enough this cushy life
admitted toady only that music of
yours makes me fair sick for a music all and
the lights o london

   this beach is good enough for me said
port light as he drew a tin box from the
cairn of rocks and opened it to lay out ciga-
rets in a small and fancy-labeled packet

   aw id swap fifty mile o this crimson
sun-blawsted beach for a sight o sydney
eads mourned toady

  sydney heads-and hard work man
chanted elephant

  you and your bloomin tunes abawt
ome sneered toady its you thet sat
me off to git a nippin o dudes tongue
singin that song of ome i awsks you wot

git back ome all very well to sing it-
but youd be a bloomin navvy with a
shovel or a cook in a blinkin restaurant-car
thats wot

  ah could earn mah food and sleepin-
kit declared elephant easily

   toady harry took the reply as an affront
and so can i you big black im no
curtail-dog-ive done my honest dys
work and i wants more than food to be
appy all very well for a kedge-belly to sit
ere and chow and loaf-but whats the
good of it

  do you-all means that remark as pus-
sonal at me demanded elephant as he
sat up slowly and frowned in puzzlement at
toady what you-all means by kedge-
belly it dont sound polite to me

  not as i means to offend you ele-
phant soothed toady not me i never
picks on a man for his color-but wots
the good o you pantin and weepin songs
on this blinkin beach abawt goin ome--
and then when i wants to go sayin as ow
is looks for ard work you looks for it
yinirself or you wouldnt be a-singin of
ome the whole bleedin time makes me
fair shck for a wet pavement and the sight
of a bowby and the lights o a pub through a
stinkin wig

  best imported egyptians said port
light as nte handed round the cigarets
these come from the portmanty of some
swell at the kfcpta baiun whos to make a
row about the way we lives eh mates

  ah stays ere till the world comes to an
endin said elephant joe as he scratched
a match on the sole of his short boot

  there ere aint no fair cigarets for a
man to be a-smokin of grumbled toady
harry as he lit a cigaret and then looked at
it with critical eye and an upturned nose
smells like a bloomin lady-maids air or
a shavin parlor i knows of in st kitts
back afore the war

  then as if his remembrance of the old
st kitts had started a new line of thought
with him he went on

  thems the chaps as knows ow to myke
rum i knowed a chap once as went to st
kitts-e used to come down our ouse in
bermonsey to ear our johnnie play the
flute-and-

  aw give us another tune elephant
said port light

  elephant joe reached for his mandolin

  chuck it joe begged toady no
more-not now when the moons up its
all right-when i can cry in the dark-but
in this mornin sun singins fair indecent

  and elephant joe laid down his mandolin
once more willing to attempt to please the
irritable cockney phil jones strayed away
to the jungle

iv

       fenton was sitting in the
       doorway of the little nipa shack
       which the gang occupied when
       phil jones entered the clearing

  what did they have to say when i left
phil

  phil shook his head in disgust

  nothing special-just the same old beef
of toady harry-hes sick of things and
restless

  fenton rubbed his freshly shaven chin

  the toads getting hard to handle
thats plain-and hell set all the others by
the ears ive a mind to let him take his
split-up and get rid of him

  phil sat down beside his chief

  no knowing when hell break loose go
down to some chink gin-shop in the port
and go swapping watches for a skinful of
gin thatll put the fat in the fire for us
sure

  yes the toads about ready for another
of his sprees when he gets irritable thats
the danger with him about five shots of
trade gin and he wants to tell the world how


adventure

rich he is-in stuff ive lifted out of the hotel
nice mess hes likely to get us all in

  got any plans asked phil quietly
nothing special-unless you and i get
out in the palembang and chuck the crowd
we could do it-weve got plenty of cash
between us

  ive been thinking of giving em the
jump myself said phil just you and
me alone from now on toady is dangerous
-and hell get the others restless and
theyll break loose on a big drunk in the
port they have it too easy-they cant
stand prosperity

  no they dont appreciate our doing all
the thinking for em-and take all the risk
it looks easy to em when i come back with
a haul of stuff

  of course said phil we dont need
em as long as things run along with us as
they have were just holding em until
we need em for some gang job if some-
thing turns up thats big and we need help
to swing it theyll all come in handy its
play along for some big game or jump out
on em

  fenton got to his feet

  ill go on down to the port and look this
palembang crowd over if they seem to
have anything in the way of pickings ill
get what i can-but only cash its no use
taking watches and rings to be cashed in
the future its all that kind of stuff that
makes toady restless he wants to get to
sydney and turn his watches and rings into
cash i wish id never lifted a piece of
jewelry but i felt it kept em satisfied to
know they were accumulating a pile of stuff
they promised not to dispose of any of it
here but theyre not keeping that promise

  toady has been sneaking into town and
selling some of his stuff-i know it hes
got a couple of quarts of gin staked out in
the brush and in the morning he always has
a head on him-and a sour on the world
im on dangerous ground in the port-i
know that-so ive got to see to finishing
things as soon as possible ill know by
night so meet me at the usual place and
ill let you know how the land lies im in
favor of a jump out if things look right
then im with you declared phil
whatever you decide ill play in

  fenton waved a hand of caution and
turned toward the narrow jungle trail
which led into the hills for the main road
to port retzenborg

  dont let em suspect theres anything
cooking up he warned

  phil nodded they listened for a minute
to the sounds of argument from the direc-
tion of the beach

  toadys voice uplifted in a disgruntled
wail came through the barrier of brush

  wot i wants to do is be ome in time for
chrismas and see a bloomin pantomime

  blast that toady murmured phil
jones and turned to go back to the beach

  dont find any fault with em no matter
what they say advised fenton well
want to give em the slip quick and easy

  with this last caution he pushed into the
trail and started for the port

  working his way slowly to higher ground
in half an hour he had reached the edge of
a deep cut which was blasted out of the
rocks athwart the hill he was climbing
it was part of the road from the inland
plantations

  it was ten feet or more to the hard rock
bed of the road below fenton stood in th
brush at the top of the cut and scanned the
road in both directions then sure no one
was approaching from either direction he
pushed back into the jungle again and
wormed through a tunnel-like passage
formed by tying back the brush with
rattans

  this secret passage was made without
the necessity of cutting the vines and
branches and leaving dead brush about to
mark the trail fenton could not stand
erect as he progressed from hole to hole
through the leaves

  fifty feet from the real trail he came to a
lean-to of thatch that was not more than
four feet above the ground and covered
with green vines that had been drawn over
it to conceal the brown dead fronds of the
thatch it was a rain shelter of nipa and
other palms bound to short bamboo poles
supported by the branches of trees

fenton crawled under the
shelter in the gloom he lifted
from a box a piece of oiled gaid
dirty tarpaulin the box had a
tin gable roof made from cans-like the
roof of a dog-house he lifted this roof
upward and put it aside taking care not
to get rust from the tin on his fingers

  from the box he took a gigantic and spot-
less white sun-helmet bound found with a
green silk pugri next came a perfectly
king of the beachcombers



pressed and clean white coat and trousers
silk underwear came next with a white
shirt of silk and a cravat of dull red round
the loose cloth collar

  he got out of his old garments and dressed
himself in the silks and whites new white
silk socks a pair of spotless white buckskin
shoes and a crimson cummerbund which he
wrapped about his middle over the belt of
his trousers then he fumbled in the box
until he found a gold watch with a black
ribbon fob-charm

  a roll of banknotes and some silver
coins went into his pockets his discarded
clothes were packed in the box the cover
and tarpaulin replaced and he stepped out
into a hole in the jungle and put on his sun-
helmet

  a beachcomber went under the shelter-
and from it came a young man dressed like
a millionaire planter

  dude fenton was ready to descend upon
the kota baiun hotel and mingle on
equal footing with the best of the passengers
from the steamer palembang

  he could fit in any gathering of prosper-
ous business men of the tropics-and not
one would suspect that this well-groomed
chap spent the most of his time hidden away
in a jungle shack with common sailors who
had turned beachcombers as for being a
professional thief-who could entertain
such an idea about the affable and success-
ful looking mr fenton

  carefully he made his way back to the
main trail taking precautions against get-
ting his clean shoes soiled on the rotten
wood underfoot and in the moist soil the
barbs of the lawyer vines reached out for
him and sought to tear his garments

  at the edge of the cliff he again surveyed
the road it was deserted he plucked a
few flowers from a blooming vine so as to
have a reason for being off the road in case
he was seen climbing down

  from a crevice in the rocks he took a
malacca cane and jumped to the hard
surface of the cut lighting an egyptian
cigaret he began to walk briskly in the
direction of the kota baiun

  he sauntered into the flats of a great
pacn grove on the near side of the hotel
wi th his sun-helmet on the back of his head
a-il the pugri falling over his shoulders he
wandered about aimlessly so that from the
ftntel it would appear that he was simply

tajling an idle after-breakfast stroll in from

   

a plantation to see the steamer crowd
steamer day was always something of an
event at port retzenborg

  at the hotel he always posed as a guest
or an employee of some vague plantation
back in the hills for more than six
months he had successfully carried out the
imposture that he was a machinery agent
making surveys for new equipment on
various plantations

  this plan made it possible for him to al-
ways be about to leave the island and when
he failed  to go to explain that another
plantation had asked him to remain and
study their equipment needs

  as he was always well-dressed quiet
and apparently had plenty of money no
one questioned him closely there was no
reason to probe into his pretended business
he only appeared when there were strangers
waiting for another steamer and then dis-
appeared again up the road toward the
plantations

  on these occasions when travelers were
staying over for another steamer fenton
always found an excuse for biking a room
at the hotel-it was raining or about to
rain or he had found an old friend among
the new arrivals thus he made reason for
staying over a few nights and he always
took one of the most expensive rooms
ate his meals in it except the regular rice-
table in the evening and loafed about on
the verandas or in the bar he knew best
how to insinuate himself into acquaintance
with strangers

  fenton was really a likable chap-or
could manage to appear likable he
knew how to mix with persons of wealth
and was capable of talking intelligently
on the usual subjects of tourists or traders
or planters he was an adroitly unobtru-
sive person and as the managers of the
hotel were mostly dutch and the servants
natives there was little chance that the
truth about his secret life with the beach-
combers would come out

  he was always careful to put his valu-
ables in the hotel safe over night-and get
a receipt for them not all travelers took
that precaution for while he used the safe
himself he kept the fact to himself

  now and then of course there were
thefts from the rooms-diamond pins
watches or purses or money belts with
considerable sums even fenton had lost
some of his things-generally at the same
	adventure

time that others reported losses from their
effects and now and then fenton was at
the hotel for a few days arid nothing was
reported missing-taken altogether dude
fenton knew his business

  sometimes baggage was rifled of valuable
articles after it was packed ready for the
departing steamer in such cases the theft
was discovered too late for the managers
of the hotel to hear of it-or the loss was
laid to some pilfering steward after the
sailing of the steamer fentons methods
had been developed into a system that was
most efficient

  by the time fenton drew close to the
hotel veranda the schooner which had
been sighted earlier in the morning was
mooring in the bay her dingey was al-
ready at the little boat landing near the
godowns proving that her skipper was
ashore fenton noted idly that the name
on her bowplates was untong he knew it
to be the malay word for good fortune

  by george he told himself toady
harry did know her after all now hell
have something to crow about

  the steamer palembang was alongside
her wharf cargo coming out of one hatch
to the dock and going in from the dock to
another she was in a hurry to get away
and swarming with native workers and
sailors bags of coal were going through
her side-ports for she bunkered at the
island the bunkers being owned by the
same dutch company which owned steamer
hotel godowns and some of the plantations

  on the veranda on the side from which
fenton was approaching the kota baiun
he could see white-clad men at the tables
inside the veranda rail at breakfast these
he knew would be the passengers from the
palembang

  what pleased him most was the pile of
luggage in front of the hotel surrounded by
a swarm of javanese and kfing servants all
arguing about who should have the handling
of the various pieces to the rooms engaged

  the head porter was reading off room-
numbers from slips of paper sent out from
the office after rooms were assigned to
the guests this plenitude of baggage told
fenton that the travelers were really leav-
ing the palembang and would not sail away
with her in a couple of hours

  rich pickings there he told himself
and moved toward the coral path leading
to the carefully barbered garden which sur-

  rounded the hotel he fingered awhile to
admire the flowers it was a pretty spot in
which the hotel was set the tropical
shrubs were cared for with the usual dutch
exactitude

  paw-paw trees grew close to the verandas
shrouding them from the sun along the
eaves here and there a tall palm lifted
its mop-head a hundred feet or more into
the blue sky to throw a round blob of
shadow on the lawns

   the low railings of the veranda were over-
grown with blooming vines which at the
pillars ran up to the second story and then
spread out in a luxurious riot of blossoms
on the red-tiled roof

  a bamboo framework cut the roof up into
checker-board squares and this framework
held the tiles in place during a strong blow
in the time of the changing monsoons

  the veranda was double in that it pro-
vided a balcony for the upper story all the
rooms opened out on this upper veranda
and most of the guests spent their time on
it wearing only pajamas and loafing in re-
clining chairs these chairs were used to
sleep in on hot nights

  and as there was nothing in the nature
of windows in the rooms-each window
being but a great opening cut in the wall
with a kajang or sun-awning that protected
it from the blazing fight-it was easy for a
thief to move from room to room and raid
them while the guests slept outside in the
verandas

  it was especially easy to raid the rooms
when the guests happened to be traders or
planters who drank plenty of gin and bitters
and in consequence slept heavily

  the tinkle of glassware and dishes the
laughter of the guests the trotting to and
fro of malay javanese and chinese ser-
vants the gabble of the porters and the
chirping of birds in the garden or in the tree-
tops made merry morning music when
the palembang with her shrilling blocks and
clanking battens got out to sea again there
would be nothing but peace and quiet about
the kota baiun

  as he passed languidly along under the
rail of the breakfast veranda fenton did not
deign to look up at the men lolling about the
tables he appeared to have no interest in
strangers but moved along intent on his
own thoughts as if making for the hotel
with a definite and pressing business

at the front stoop he nodded pleasantly
king of the beachcombers



to the head porter in order to establish with
any of the strangers the fact that he was
known by the hotel servants then he
mounted the stoop-prepared to begin his
little game for secret loot

v

as it happened the one english
clerk of the hotel was on duty-
a little man known as bertie who
was an assistant as most of the
passengers from the palembang happened
to be british he had taken the desk to
assign the rooms

  ill have to stop over a few days said
fenton id like the center room on the
front veranda topside-the room i always
have bertie and if any gentleman calls
to see me be sure to send him up without
delay im expecting two or three gentle-
men from the plantations

  fentons voice was sufficiently loud to
carry to the restaurant veranda he
scrawled a name on the register pocketed
bis key and went round the corner to the
stairway as if going up to his room with
him he took a supply of the hotel writing
paper

  but once out of sight of bertie fenton
made for the bar

  at this hour in the morning he knew it
would be closed and the kajangs down
but the door leading to it had a latch which
could be opened by slipping a hand through
a hole made for that purpose fenton let
himself through quietly and closed the door
after him

  it was a room with polished hardwood
floors and a few native mats of exquisite
workmanship marble-topped tables with
wire legs were ranged in a double row down
the center of the room at one end was a
short bar backed by bottles on shelves and
a large mirror

  ah sam the chinese barman was polish-
ing brass his towchang was plaited on the
top of his skull and the red silken end neatly
tucked in under the concentric circles of the
flemished mat of hair he wore a blue frock
and trousers wrapped about his ankles

  ah sam was a particular friend of fen-
tons the chinese was in a position to
perform favors of considerable importance
in fentons secret operations-and fenton
paid well for these special services

too soon come this side cautioned ah

sam but as he spoke he grinned affably

  thats all right said fenton in a quiet
tone i want to be alone-business you
catch me a picon drink and fetch talk-

stick

  he sat down in a chair at a table as far
away from the door as possible where there
was some light coming through the partly
opened kajang on that side of the hotel
the veranda outside was deserted the res-
taurant being at the far end of the front
veranda

  ah sam brought the pencil before he
mixed the drink he let his towchang down
in order to be respectful got plenty new
ones come this time he observed

  fenton nodded and winked

  oh yes some strangers he said as he
laid out his paper now then you wash
your hands before you fix my drink-they
stink of that awful brass polish dont you
flavor my swizzle with it

  ah sam pattered away and fenton began
setting down columns of figures and adding
them up any person entering the bar-
and only an employee would be likely to
enter for the next hour or so-would assume
that fenton was dealing in large sums of
money fenton always carried about with
him notes which had to do with substan-
tial financial operations pertaining to new
planatation machinery these slips he
managed to display when he found it con-
venient to impress new friends while chat-
ting over a drink or a meal

  ah sam returned with the picon and set
it down fenton paid no attention for he
did not want to carry on a conversation and
reveal his presence to the outer office of the
hotel

  it was not long before he finished his pre-
tended work and sat back to sip his picon
and smoke a cigaret presently he heard
two men moving along on the veranda just
outside the partly opened kajang he
glanced out and saw two pairs of white shoes
as they advanced to a position near his
kajang

  there is nobody in this place captain
so we can talk without being disturb-the
bar not yet open

  fenton recognized the voice as belonging
to mr hoi an auditor for the hotel com-
pany who came to port retzenborg about
once a month to go over financial affairs and
make an inspection

  i just want a word in private replied


adventure

a voice strange to fenton just as well
that nobody is around-or sees us talking
together

  they seated themselves in grass chairs
the lower part of the kajang was opened
outward a few inches so fenton had no view
of them all he could see was the bottoms
of the rear legs of the chairs

  i am not aware of this business said
mr hoi presently he had a precise en-
glish phrase-book way of speaking

  well of course you know the untong
is my schooner

  oh yes-i know this but to me that
mean little before captain i have not
hear of your schooner

  no shes new down this way but per-
haps mr hoi it will mean something to
you if i tell you my name-stranlow-
captain edward stranlow

  of course i have see your name in the
hotel register yes you will stay with us
a few days i know so much-no more of
you captain

  i didnt expect you would know more
than that said stranlow but as a mat-
ter of fact i am in the employ of your com-
pany-though that information is strictly
private

  oh is this true you are a company
man certainly i shall do for you what i
can captain

  dont do too much-and dont give it
away that i am anything special to you-
keep it a secret that i am in the companys
employ but you must be aware that some-
thing came for me in the palembang

  no i have no advice for this said
mr hoi

  then the mail-bags have not been
opened yet

  not yet i think captain

  then they will be soon-and youll find
a large package for me i might as well
caution you now that it consists of a ship-
ment of cash for me it is partly in gold
coin but the bulk in notes for that is what
i need in paying off white hands and in
buying supplies

  oh you have money that is it

  yes i thought it would be better for you
to know about it as soon as possible be-
cause the packages will not show on the
outside that they contain cash it is a
secret shipment and it is just as well that
you look after it for if a package should be
misplaced or broken or opened by mistake

by some of your native help it might be
stolen anyway the news might get out
that ive got considerable money in my
schooner and that would make talk peo-
ple would want to know what i was up to
you understand of course

  oh perfect i understand i am glad
you tell me this there will be no delay
captain to this i will attend

 thanks i have already had some
trouble with three white men in my crew

i am paying them off here that leaves
me with natives-and i will need some
white men where i am going so i shall
have to wait here until some vessel comes in
that can spare me some white sailors i
cant depend on my natives to back me up
if i should meet with trouble where i am
going ill have to do some exploring in wild
islands and wild natives may be suspi-
cious-as they wont understand what im
looking for or what im after

  if i might ask-what is this you look
for

  oil but i dont want it known the
company keeps a close mouth on what im
doing thats why i have to carry so much
cash-ill have to buy up land from native
chiefs and ive got to make it look as if im
after plantation lands of course oil and
mineral rights will be included in the con-
tracts but oil means nothing to the native
chiefs ive got to be able to bottle up what
i find and that means ive got to be
generous in presents to the headmen of the
villages so theyll let me move about freely
ive got plenty of gin below decks and a
good cargo of trade goods to be used for
presents

  yes i understand now said mr hoi
i will attend

  the captain lifted himself out of the
creaky grass chair then we might as well
let things go for now he said and its 
just as well that were not seen talking to-
gether too much we cant be too sure who
these passengers out of the palembang are
or what their business may be what they
dont know wont keep em awake nights

  that is correct observed mr hoi as
he got up

  just slip me the money packages and
ill get em aboard the untong were not
to be too chummy ill go back aboard now
but ill manage to have another private talk
with you when this crowd of passengers
get out
king of the beachcombers



  captain stranlow and mr hoi disap-
peared one going to the front veranda and
the other moving off to the rear as mr
hois voice was presently heard from the
back veranda fenton knew that it was the
skipper of the untong who had left for the
front

  slipping to a front kajang fenton opened
it outward gently an inch or two he saw
captain stranlow making off down the coral
walk for the beach

  heres something that looks worth
while he told himself it appears that
the big mop-up ive waited for has walked
in on its hind feet and begged me to take it
along now ive got to be able to handle
this thing right-and its going to take all
the wits ive got to put it over

vi

fenton made his appearance of
the breakfast veranda where mr
hoi was chatting with the palem-
bang passengers at their tables

  will the bar be open soon mr hoi
asked fenton his loose papers in his hand
and a pencil over his ear

  oh any time mr fenton it will be
open now do you desire so early a drink
you can have it here

  yes i know said fenton i wasnt
wanting a drink thanks i thought i could
go to the bar and be quiet with these cost
estimates for machinery but i can go
up to my room-or its pleasant enough
here maybe- havent seen you for some
time around the place-weve missed you

   in this crafty little speech fenton estab-
lished some of the things he desired first
to mr hoi that no one was in the bar while
the conversation went on in private with
captain stranlow second he had shown
the passengers of the palembang that he
was a man of business who apparently spent
most of his time at the hotel and had a
room there third that he knew mr hoi
quite well and had missed him during his
absence from the kota baiun

  as a matter of fact mr hoi knew little
about fenton except that he seemed a
permanent guest in that he was always
there when mr hoi was making his regular
visits

  the passengers glanced up at fenton
mildly curious they sat in pairs at the
little tables along the veranda rail dawdling

over their coffee and cigarets and enjoying
the sunlight and garden scents after having
been several days in the cramped quarters
of the stuffy little steamer on a blazing sea

   they all looked prosperous and were
plainly men of the tropics who had interests
in plantations or trading-with one excep-
tion he was a man who sat alone at a
table and being the ninth of the crowd had
no one to pair off with for breakfast

   he was young and a man of ruddy com-
plexion smoking a long thin sumatra
cheroot he stared into the smoke rising
before his eyes reflectively taking no in-
terest in the others one white-shod foot
was sprawled out on a near-by chair as if
he suffered from the gout

   he wore a big straw hat pushed back on
his head a loose white jacket and white
trousers of heavy duck which stamped the
garments as having been tailored either in
 shanghai or the straits settlements it was
not the white suiting of the far-off islands

   his blue eyes were keen he turned sud-
 denly and took in fenton with an appraising
 but careless stare interest but not an in-
 terest that could be in any way offensive
 he lifted his foot down from the chair and
 nodded to fenton

   this seat-perhaps you would like it
sorry sir but i do not want to take up two
chairs i am leaving and--

   no no thanks said fenton i dont
 want to intrude dont run away-and ill
 sit here if you dont mind he was always
 quick to seize an opportunity to strike up
 an acquaintance without seeming to be
 eager to know strangers

   the young man sat down again

   then ill linger a bit longer assented
 the young man

   im really too lazy this morning to go
 on with these confounded figures said
 fenton laying out his slips of paper before
 him i think ill have coffee if you dont
 mind he suddenly gathered up the papers
 and stuffed them into his side pocket

   oh certainly have your coffee said
the other and lifted a hand in signal to a
malay waiter charming little port
this-so restful

   then youve never been here before
asked fenton

   first trip-didnt expect to stop over
 but wanted a rest from the palembang

   find business brisk these days probed
 fenton


adventure

  business oh i dont belong with these
other gentlemen im just touring around
and taking a rest

  how are things in spore asked fen-
ton who always contrived to draw informa-
tion from strangers

  the stranger looked a little surprized
how did you know i was from spore
he parried

  i beg your pardon said fenton
didnt intend to ask a personal question
but i assumed you were from singapore-
your clothes are better if youll permit me
to say so than the ordinary trader about the
islands

  the compliment drew a grin

  youre a keen man sir i thought may-
be youd seen me in spore are you from
there yourself

  i-i make my headquarters there but
im there very rarely have to spend most
of my time in islands with plantations

  as if encouraged to further confidence by
fentons affability the stranger went on-
yes im from spore my names out-
ridge-english of course

  fentons mine hope i can be of some
service to you if youre going to stop over
this boat

  i am stopping over yes he lowered
his voice and shot a careful glance to the
other tables i dont take on well with
the dutchies and im tired of listening to
these commercial men on the steamer they
talk of nothing but trade-and money-
and freights nice enough in their way of
course but rather boring y know

  the other passengers were chattering
away merrily again with their own affairs
apparently totally unaware that they were
disliked by outridge

  fenton smiled appreciatively

  i understand im in trade myself-
have to work to make my living-but i hope
i dont keep up a constant clatter about
shop like to rest and chat with a congenial
chap now and then and forget the con-
founded business and the counting-house
im here estimating for plantation ma-
chinery but i wont be here much longer
find it a bit stupid as you will if you stay
long

  oh im out by the next boat but it is
pleasant to know ive found somebody in
the place wholl be congenial

  fenton ducked his head in a little bow
they were getting on famously laying his

sun-helmet aside fenton gave the malay
boy with the coffee a substantial tip

   pretty little schooner that remarked
fenton with a jerk of his head toward the
bay presume shes a trader-though her
lines are too smart for the ordinary trader
thats generally seen in here

   quite so said outridge without taking
the trouble to look at the untong but i
presume there are a few interesting things
to see on this island-plantations inland
for instance ive heard there are some
pretty spots taken care of like private
gardens and all that sort of thing with
labor so cheap

   he nodded at the great masses of bloom-
ing shrubs in the hotel gardens below

  oh yes some charming places said
fenton ill take you about the island
if you like when youve rested from the
steamer

   thanks awfully ive nothing to do but
kill time and see as much as i can

   then when you feel inclined for a little
sight-seeing just let me know and well
take a jaunt into the hills

   the invitation was easily offered for the
simple reason that fenton had little inten-
tion of ever carrying out his promise he
was after bigger game than a mere tourist
who rarely carried good sums of money

  in a couple of days when-

mr outridge sorry but
may we see you in the office for
a minute a matter of your
room-were afraid youll not be
satisfied it was bertie the english
clerk-and mr hoi was lurking in the back-
ground

   oh certainly called outridge and rose
with a word of apology to fenton and
outridge disappeared in the direction of
the lobby

  as outridge left it struck fenton that
the men at the tables had suddenly become
quiet he swung round in his chair just
in time to see smiles and winks going among
the travelers and as they saw fenton
looking at them in surprize they gave him
peculiarly knowing looks he continued
to stare at them puzzled by their cryptic
smiles

  thatll put a bit of a spoke in mr
outridges wheel remarked a gray-haired
man of jovial face he was a big man and
his whole appearance suggested wealth and
king of the beachcombers



importance and as he spoke he held fen-
tons eye with his own smiling quizzically

  if i might venture to inquire began
fenton id ask if there is anything-
wrong-or mysterious about mr out-
ridge

  certainly venture all you like my dear
sir said the big fellow im bentley-
trading in island products of spore-and
if i had the pleasure of your acquain-
tance-

  he spoke with a shade of pride about him-
self as if his name usually brought deference
when it was uttered

  fenton is my name sir

  mr bentley having gone through the
formality of knowing who the strange per-
son was wiped his glasses and cleared his
throat importantly

  i rarely discuss strangers with-er-
strangers if youll pardon me but we saw
this chap making up to you i feel it is my
duty to say a word-to put you on your
guard as i might say-about this chap-
whats he call himself outridge

  he twisted a thumb that pointed in the
direction of the hotel lobby

  you mean theres something i ought to
know asked fenton

  the others laughed a little quietly and
sedately as if careful that fenton should
not think they were laughing at him

  its not necessary that you know of
course but id say it is highly desirable
that you do know went on bentley in
that peculiar style of the orator who is pre-
paring an audience for something of a vital
nature in his subsequent remarks

  then sir i should appreciate the in-
formation-and hold it confidential en-
couraged fenton

   in the first place began bentley look-
ing critically at his glasses to make sure he
had cleaned them perfectly mr out-
ridges real name is not outridge hes
known to the police of spore by another
name-several of them in fact what they
are does not matter here-i am not in the
confidence of the police

  im glad to be aware of what you say-
of the history of the gentleman

  bentley smiled knowingly and went on
in a subdued voice but in his speech-making
manner

  that chap-who pretended to be a
tourist in what he said to you-and youll
pardon me for having listened-weve seen

quite a bit of him in the last few days aboard
the palembang he has plenty of money
and all that but hes a card-sharper and
you may not want to add to his prosperity
weve said a confidential word to the man-
ager here so as to warn him against any of
this chaps tricks hereabouts-and a word to
the wise is sufficient he nodded his head
as a sign that he had finished

  thank you said fenton hed taken
me in right enough about being a tourist
but ill mind that he tried no tricks on me
with his cards

  another man in the party shook a warn-
ing head at fenton it isnt cards only
that youve got to be careful about-but
watch your watch the others laughed
at this

  i think i understand said fenton
im obliged to you gentlemen for the
warning

  he got up and sauntered in toward the
bar curious now to see what might be going
on with outridge at the hotel desk

  what fenton saw was most extraordi-
nary outridge his shirt pulled up in front
and the belt of his trousers hanging loosely
from his hips was holding up a large buck-
skin moneybelt which he had apparently
just taken off

  i dont see why you should be all upset
about my ability to pay for my food and
shelter here he was saying to mr hoi in
angry earnestness i never expected to be
embarrassed like this-and its a confounded
outrage but heres my ready cash-some
two thousand dollars in notes count it
yourself if you like you dont have to take
my word for the amount and if you feel
i cant pay for what i get i can go back

aboard the palembang and-

  dont trouble any more soothed mr

hoi i did not mean to-

  you jolly well meant to make things
unpleasant for me went on outridge
its an outrage i say i know that lot
of rotters off the palembang have said
something to you about me im not at
all worried about that lot of rotten com-
mercials ill tell you come to cash i
can buy and sell the half of them ill tell
you that mr hoi

  please put your money away sir said
the harrassed mr hoi his face red i

assure you-

  ill get out of this confounded place of
yours by the first boat-yes perhaps by


adventure

that schooner in the bay raged outridge
getting angrier-or pretending to be more
angry in proportion to hois apologies-as
he saw that his counter attack was winning
over the manager now he was strapping
his fat belt about him and tucking it under
the belt of his trousers youll find mr
hoi that its not cricket to jump to con-
clusions about a guest who might stop here
a month or more and listen to the lies of
a lot of traders who pop in and pop out
with-

  fenton slipped away to the bar and did
not hear the last of outridges tirade

  hes so mad mused fenton to him-
self that he probably wont put his money-
belt in the hotel safe tonight-and two
thousand dollars is not to be sneered at
even if i have bigger game in sight

ah sam was still busy with his
rag and polish wearing out the
brass fittings of the bar he
looked up at fenton and got
behind the bar to serve him

  you know this feller--outridge-talking
now office side asked fenton pointing at
the wall which was opposite the location of
the hotel desk through the doorway the
voice of outridge still raised in indignation
thundered at mr hoi

  ah sam listened have got-can do
he pronounced with a nod meaning that
he would recognize the man of that voice

  fenton leaned across the bar and whis-
pered you give him drinks-maybe this
night you give him same stuff all time
we use for sleep-make him sleep long
time

  ah sam gazed stolidly at fenton his
wisdom was bland and unobtrusive can
do this he assented i make this feller
slep-long time hard

  fenton asked for another picon and when
he had finished it left the bar for the front
veranda outridge was still in argument
with mr hoi waxing more excited as he
reviewed what had happened

  and the best of this thing is fenton
told himself as he sat in a grass chair and
looked out over the bay that outridges
baggage has gone to the upper floor ill
roll him and then not sleep in my room at
all but stick in the bar late and sleep down
here in a chair also i think ill be robbed
myself tonight just as a little protection
against suspicion of having had anything

to do with outridges precious belt i cant
take any chances as toady would say con-
sidering this untong business in hand ive
got to be able to sail away in that schooner
if i can manage it without the slighest
blemish on my character

  he stood up and strolled down the coral
walk toward the palembang hoping that he
might run into the skipper of the untong
and strike up an acquaintance with that
highly interesting person

vii

port retzenborg lay un-
der a white moonlight the mop-
heads of the palms fretted softly
by the land breeze from off the
hills that lay behind

  shadow and light blackness and sheening
silver-neither was diluted in the slightest
degree under that tropical moon the
fronds of the palms as they stuck out in
wisps under the pressure of the upper breeze
looked like black seaweeds in a submarine
garden moved by an undersea current

  it was not difficult to watch the sema-
phore-like motions of the palm leaves against
the bright sky and to imagine oneself a
diver on the floor of a sea looking up
through marine foliage that waved in the
water and stood out in clear relief against
the sunlight up above the surface of the
water for the moonlight seemed to lave
the land like some gently flowing liquid

  it was well after nine oclock in the
black pit of the kota baiuns deep veranda
a few cigars burned intermittently like com-
ets flaming into sight and dying out in the
tremendous distances of the unknown uni-
verse-to return in a few seconds on their
orbits and blaze into visibility again an
eerie world was port retzenborg under the
magic of the moon

  from the bar dimly lighted so as not to
draw the insects of the night most of the
travelers could be heard talking in droning
voices over clinking glasses about the prices
of hemp and the rising market on copra

  on the side of the moon three men sat
with their feet on the veranda rail but kept
their faces in shadow of vine-grown pillars
they knew that a tropical moonlight has
its charms but they believed also in the
power of the moon to distort a face exposed
overlong to its beams

at the dark end of the front veranda two
king of the beachcombers



men sat in blackness stretched out in re-
clining chairs and chatting lightly after the
manner of persons newly met and likely to
part in the next few days never to meet
again it is a condition of affairs which
leads many men into confidences which
they would not confer upon their closest
friends-and so under certain circumstances
may be fraught with danger

  their cigars were going comfortably
they gazed out over the dark gardens and
the moon-swept jungle tops beyond and
from down the beach beyond that rising
jungle there came the distance-softened
strains of a mandolin a soft and musical
voice sang of the time when it would be
possible to go back home it appeared from
some of the vagrant words which were intel-
ligible even at that distance that there was
waiting for the singer a baby

   here and there fireflies looped glintingly
through the gloom lights twinkled out
of the velvety darkness of the jungle where
coconut-oil lamps of natives were moved
across the openings that served as windows

  a dog bayed the moon down near the
warehouse it seemed strangely lonely and
deserted now that the palembang had tooted
itself out through the reef a few hours agone
only a toy vessel carved out of jet rode on
the shining waters of the bay-the schooner
untong

   if youre going to sleep in the hotel to-
night captain you should be careful of your
valuables said fenton in a low and confi-
dential tone

  why careful asked captain stranlow

  having met fenton during the afternoon
in the bar and finding him an agreeable
chap stranlow preferred to sit out on the
veranda rather than mix with the strangers
in the hotel bar and fenton had proved
to be an interesting talker

   well there have been thefts here in the
past said fenton naturally the man-
agement keeps quiet about such things and
the hotel of course is not responsible be-
cause every room has a card posted up ad-
vising guests to leave their valuables in the
hotel safe id be careful sir

   oh thefts can happen anywhere i pre-
sume said stranlow but ive little to
loose i keep my money in a little safe
aboard the untong-and a mighty little safe
i need too he laughed lightly at his
joke

   i couldnt lose very much myself ad-

mitted fenton but i thought it as well
to inform you of how things go here-its
something i wouldnt speak of to every-
body

  oh im willing to be put on my guard
said stranlow thanks for saying a word
about it

  fentons voice dropped lower ive a
particular reason for mentioning the mat-
ter tonight

  particular reason why hows that
this party off the palembang-theres a
chap among em thatll bear watching im
told

  which one is it

  the card-sharper

  which is the card-sharper

  fellow who calls himself outridge-the
well-dressed young man who smokes the
long sumatra cheroots

  oh yes thats the chap sir

  has the room next to yours-between
our rooms you know

  oh now i understand why the manager
told me to secure my kajang carefully when
i went to bed said it would rattle if there
was a breeze and probably keep me awake
it wasnt the breeze that he was think-
ing of said fenton with a chuckle

  he wont get very rich off what im
packing said stranlow and as for his
smoothness with cards-i dont play for
money so i feel safe

  i was told to watch my watch went on
fenton of course so far as outridge is
concerned i know nothing but hearsay but
ive been warned that hes light-fingered in
more ways than one still there have been
thefts here long before mr outridge came
on the scene

  now who do you suppose is up the
beach playing that music said stranlow
its mighty sweet music whoever it is
some white sailors who have been work-
ing on plantations during the stripping
season

  white sailors why i didnt know
there was a white seaman on the island
oh yes said fenton theyve had
jobs as gang-bosses and so on no longer
needed now and have been paid off so
while theyre waiting for some vessel thatll
need seamen who are white they loaf up
in the native town and amuse themselves
thats odd remarked stranlow i
cant understand why mr hoi never
mentioned the fact that there are white


adventure

sailors here thats something i should
know about

  mr hoi wouldnt know much about
em said fenton theyre not known
in the port here as sailors-simply planta-
tion donkey engineers or foremen natur-
ally they dont spend their time at the bar
f the kota baiun but ive run across em
now and then in my jobs one-the fel-
low playing the mandolin-is an american
black he was a ships cook i understand
and got stranded here but worked around
on the various plantations

  any other seamen working on the inland
plantations

  not that i know of captain why
well im looking for some white men for
my crew ive got natives but ive got to
have a white mate and so on

  perhaps these men up the beach would
do suggested fenton

  no i dont believe i want to ship a
bunch of shiftless beachcombers

fenton laughed id hate to
hear those chaps singing up the
beach called beachcombers to
their faces captain thered be
a row i know they may be regarded as
beachcombers by the managers of this hotel
but why should a seaman whos worked out
the season on a plantation come to the kota
baiun to live where can they go when
the busy season ashore is over and theyre
waiting for a ship there are no lodging-
houses for seamen in port retzenborg you
know

  yes im aware of that said stranlow
carelessly

  i happen to know went on fenton
that these men have plenty of cash as
their kind go theyre living in a native
shack for which they pay rent and they buy
their food in the native markets and ask no
odds of anybody if thats beachcombing
then im a beachcomber ive finished up
my job of estimating for the plantations
and im staying here until the spore
steamer shows up and paying my bills
these chaps up the beach are doing the
same thing only on another scale thats all
of course if they came to the hotel and
spent their money at the bar they might be
popular-until their moneys gone but
as i size em up theyre pretty decent as
such men go

  certainly that puts a different light on

the thing said stranlow if theyve been
working-and want a ship-and are paying
their way we cant dismiss em as vaga-
bonds

  of course theyre nothing to me said
fenton only if you happen to want sea-
men you ought to know the facts in the
case

  i certainly want the facts as i under-
stand it youve met them in the course of
your work-and have talked with them
yes i know a couple of em fairly well
they regard me if i may be permitted to
say it as an utter swell but one bossed a
hemp-press with a gang of coolies and an-
other is a mechanic of sorts who kept ma-
chinery fixed up in some of the places where
ive been talking about new equipment
cant for the life of me remember their
names at the minute-if i knew the names
at all toady is one i know-just a nick-
name-and one is called jones i think but
that last name may be a native way of
pronouncing his real name

  and you say theyre looking for a ship
so i understand im sure of only one
thing-this chap called jones-i think he
was mate of a trader and got sick here ive
heard toady say he was a bosun himself
but you know such men will brag about the
positions theyve held

  he laughed as if in remembrance of un-
believable yarns he had heard from the men
up the beach

  why not tell em to come aboard the
untong and have a talk with me said
stranlow that is if youre likely to run
across em dont go to any trouble about it
no trouble at all captain ill be up
the beach tomorrow but theyll want to
know where youre bound for-and what
wages

  stranlow puffed his cigar a few minutes in
silence

  the regular wages of course what i
want is a white mate-even if he hasnt got
a ticket i could use a bosun a carpenter
and a sailmaker and i think you spoke of
the black as a cook

  im under the impression he was a ships
cook

  im not sure i want a black man for
cook the islands im making for are
rather a wild lot-and i find natives are in-
clined to think a black man in the crew
who isnt a regular native-has been stolen
and is in slavery
king of the beachcombers



  you know best captain

  but dont say anything about the rat-
ings if i ship any of these men ill ship
em as abs with quarters separate from
the natives and good grub of course
when ive got a line on such men as i take
i can promote as i see fit

  and wherell i say youre bound for
pressed fenton

  stranlow puffed again at his cigar be-
fore replying then he turned his head to
make sure no one was about and listening
and brought his voice down to a whisper

  im going to the sedriana group want
to go down there and comb a few reefs and
lagoons for pearl shell

  oh i didnt know you were a pearler
no im not exactly what youd call a
a pearler im out on a scouting trip for a
pearling fleet i look over the ground for
promising shell and then make my reports
to the company that employs me but i
hope youll keep that quiet-im talking to
you confidentially

  of course ive nobody to talk with
about it even if i took the liberty of dis-
cussing your affairs but how long do you
expect to be gone its just my own ques-
tion and not at all for these men you want
to ship so dont answer if you feel its none
of my business

  thats all right said stranlow im
not making any particular secret of my
business with you i may be gone three
months or longer depends on how much
time ill want to put in on the various la-
goons i look over sometimes i stick in a
spot a week sometimes i get out at once if
the sign of shell is not what it might be
thats the kind of a trip id like to take
some day captain just have a good loaf
and rest

  im afraid youd find it dull

  no i dont think so i like the sea if i
can have it quiet passenger steamers i
dislike-but a schooner and a congenial
skipper-i always enjoy it and ive made
such trips

  then why dont you come along with me
this trip said stranlow a trifle indiffer-
ently

  i hadnt thought of it until this minute
and im due back in spore by rights
its up to you said stranlow come
if you like-as my guest im all alone you
know-nobody much to talk with do you
play crib

  fairly well thanks he said nothing
more for a few minutes and appeared to be
thinking the project over

  i suppose i could send my report to
spore by mail he went on presently i
dont actually have to go myself matter
of fact my report is nearly all made out-
what machinery is wanted and so on and
how many men to send for setting it up
my job here is at an end now and i dont
need the money thats coming to me from
my employers i could let that ride until i
get back to spore after this trip with you
not but what id expect to pay my share of
the stores

  dont worry about that said stran-
low just come along if you feel like it-
youre as welcome as the flowers in may
its something ill have to think over
captain it appeals to me i need a little
romp after quite a siege of hard grind but
ive got to figure out whether i can afford to
take so much time off as a matter of fact
i can write the spore office that when im
out with you i can visit some plantations of
the sedriana group and combine business
with pleasure that is if you feel i could
visit an odd island or two for an hour if
things fell right

  i couldnt go very far off my shell fields
just to accommodate you but i could
drop in on an island that we happened to be
passing-especially if there was any chance
of shell and most of the islands need
looking over

  i wouldnt expect you to go out of your
way no said fenton grandly youd
have to be the judge as to where i landed
and my visits would be in line with your
plans-or i wouldnt make any calls

  im suited with that if you are said
stranlow think ill turn in now he
stood up and stretched luxuriously and

if you run into those men in-

  ill be glad to attend to it captain
in the meantime dont be fobbed off if
anybody tells you theyre beachcombers
naturally men who are not working are not
popular in these dutch islands the dutch
hate loafing even between jobs

  what i want to do is sail said stran-
low im not likely to get any help from
the hotel about picking up sailors if i
size mr hoi up right hes shrewd enough
to enjoy having me hang about here a month
or two waiting for a crew-and paying
kota baiun rates and spending my money


adventure

at his bar ill judge the men myself de-
pend on that

  then good night sir and thank you
for your kind invitation captain

  they shook hands in the darkness and
the skipper wandered away to the stairs
which led to the upper floor

  on the upper landing stranlow passed
mr hoi i think ill be able to get all the
crew i want he whispered to the hotel
man and this chap fenton-he thinks
hes going on a vacation trip with me to the
sedrianas

  you mean-he go with you whispered
mr hoi

  stranlow waved a hand in dismissal of
the subject ive got to give him the soft
stuff and make it appear that im not at all
concerned about who knows my business
as long as he thinks im bound for the
sedrianas no harms done so ive blinded
his eyes on where im really going dont
let me down on it-the sedrianas you
know im a pearling scout-savvy

  mr hoi nodded

  you fool him all right my he will
be mad when he find where you do go he
will yell

  who the dickens is that snoring asked
stranlow as he became aware of the regular
trumpeting of some sleeper in a room
nearby

  that is mr outridge he drinks too
much and goes to sleep early my such a
rumpus i hope he will not disturb you
captain

  stranlow grinned into the candle which
mr hoi had just lighted

  no hell put me to sleep-it sounds like
the surf on a reef after a hurricane

  mr hoi gurgled with laughter deep in his
throat and went down the stairs softly

viii

immediately after captain
stranlow left the veranda fen-
ton went to his room men still
lingered in the bar chatting
quietly or playing chess after he reached
his room fenton could hear their voices
dimly

  outridge was snoring heavily in the
room beyond fenton could hear stranlow
preparing for bed the grass chair creaked
as he sat down to take off his shoes while
the skipper was still moving about fenton

decided he had best carry out his plans with-
out delay it would be dangerous to prowl
after stranlow was quiet in bed or asleep

  before long the bar would be quiet and
fenton would not have the cover of the
noises of conversation and movement be-
low also men would be coming up and
preparing for bed or moving about on the
upper veranda

  fenton folded two large handkerchiefs in
peculiar shapes when he had finished with
them they looked like napkins formed into
fanciful shapes so they would stand alone
like pyramids at the base of each pyra-
mid was a corner knotted into a loop these
cloth pads he slipped over the toes of his
shoes as if they were light rubbers

  they protected the soles and heels from
making a noise on polished wood floors
where there was no matting thus he
could move silently without taking off his
shoes he avoided the chance of being
caught in stockinged feet and in case of
danger the pads could be kicked off and he
could provide an excuse for being in the
wrong room

  outridge continued to snore with regu-
larity

  ah sam fixed him properly-and hes
asleep for at least twelve hours fenton
assured himself

  he moved to the open kajang which led
to the upper veranda the place seemed
deserted the moonlight shot slantwise to
the outer edge of the veranda rail there
was a strip of darkness along the wall he
had but some six feet to go to be able to
enter the room occupied by outridge
fifteen feet beyond was the kajang of cap-
tain stranlows room and stranlow was
still fussing about so that fenton was al-
ways aware of where the skipper happened
to be

  he slipped out to the veranda he
stooped down to bring the lower part of the
veranda between him and the outer moon-
light thus he made sure that no person
was concealed in that strip of darkness along
the wall he crossed the veranda to the
vine-clad rail to listen a minute and to
make sure that his movements would not
attract the attention of stranlow

  with careful fingers fenton plucked a
half dozen leaves from a vine and slipped
them into his side pocket he had no
weapons for he always avoided using them
in his work knowing that the dutch were
king of the beachcombers



strict about revolvers the leaves in his
pocket were safer for him-and he had al-
ready perfected his plan so that they could
be used to advantage the one thing
fenton prided himself on was his wits-he
always had the foresight to plan for what
would happen after he was successful in
getting the desired loot he maintained
that the events after a raid were of more im-
portance than what was done in prepara-
tion for the raid

  he slipped back to the wall and keeping
close to it to avoid creaks glided noiselessly
to outridges kajang

  all clear he breathed

  he stepped over the high sill of the kajang
which was thrust outward from the bottom
about three feet he got in sidewise and
found himself in total darkness the posi-
tion of the kajang now marked by two
triangular strips that revealed the outer
moonlight

  outridge snored on captain stranlow
was humming a low tune to himself as he
moved about the dresser fenton heard
him drop some loose change and his watch
on the dresser as he emptied his pockets

  moving into the darkness of the room
guided by the snores fenton gained the side
of outridges bed with deft hands the
thief located the belt which outridge wore
about his middle-under the single sheet
that covered him

  carefully the three tiny buckles were
loosed then fenton pressed the ends of
his fingers gently against outridges back
over the kidneys the pressure was grad-
ually increased and then kept uniform

  for several minutes fenton waited pa-
tiently then outridge between snores
sighed heavily he turned over to escape
that pressure on his back as he turned
fenton drew the belt from under him

  outridge resumed his snoring with new
energy in the comfort of his new position
that annoying pressure was gone and
the sleeper settled down again into deep
slumber

  fenton lifted the snaps on each pouch
of the belt and made sure the packets of
notes were still there then he pocketed
the belt the trick was done but there
was still work to do

  fenton moved back to the kajang and
peered out to the veranda to his surprize
captain stranlows figure was outlined
against the moonlit sky beyond the

skipper was smoking a cigar and leaning
against a veranda stanchion gazing out
over the bay at his schooner

  all right enjoy the scenery thought
fenton i change my game to suit the
situation stranlow is likely to slip over to
my kajang to see if im in bed so i cant
chance things to wait here until he gets
back to his own room and goes to sleep
and he may stick there an hour

  he moved straight back and passed the
bed once more the door to the outer hall
was not locked for there was little use ot
locking doors at the kota baiun while
kajangs on the veranda were open

  fenton got into the hall and returned to
his own room without making a sound
he slipped the handkerchiefs off his shoes
untied the fabrics and pocketed them he
slipped off his shoes and got into bed with
infinite care so the frame or the cane bottom
would not creak

  then he sat up and flopped about noisily
he reached down to the floor and gathered
up his shoes with a clatter

  confound you and your snoring he
muttered angrily he put on his shoes and
tramped about on the floor where there was
no matting

  captain stranlow came along the veranda
and stopped before fentons kajang just as
fenton was applying a match to his little
bedside lamp

  so he woke you up eh rather a nui-
sance isnt he laughed stranlow

  hello that you skipper yes i
give up ive been asleep tvice now im
going below for a drink join me

  no thanks said stranlow ill turn
in and have a try for some sleep myself he
may not disturb me

  from the little fenton could see of him
stranlow was in his pajamas

  ill take a walk through the palm grove
said fenton and see if i cant get sleepy
enough to have some shut-eye in spite of
that racket next door by the time he has
shifted gears on that snore we may sleep
listen to it it makes the calendar hanging
on my wall jump

  well so long said stranlow i wish
you luck and he laughed and moved back
toward his own room

  fenton slipped the packets of money out
of his pockets and examined them at the
lamp standing between the light and the
kajang
adventure

  a little over two thousand dollars he
breathed he tucked the notes away in
various pockets and went into the hall

there was a narrow passage
that led to the back of the build-
ing it opened on a rear ve-
randa where stairs went down to
the kitchen this was the service stairs
through which the servants brought food or
drinks to the rooms of the upper floor off
on either side of the stairs was a tiled roof
newly added to the building and so not yet
overgrown with the creeping vines which
ran up the pillars and the sides of the hotel

  out on these tiles fenton threw the
moneybelt he saw it laying askew like a
snake newly killed he took from his side
pocket the leaves he had torn from the front
verandas vines the leaves would be
found with the belt and the means by which
the thief had gained outridges room would
be explained to any investigator-a native
had climbed the vines of the rear veranda
made his way over the tiled roof and robbed
the sleeper and in making his escape
the thief had dropped the empty belt so
suspicion would be diverted from the other
guests on the upper floor

  fenton turned back and descended the
regular stairs which led down to the lobby
he made no attempt to be quiet but let his
feet clatter on the wood he grumbled
about not being able to sleep

  he pressed in to the bar still muttering
angrily ah sam he snapped give me
a picon

  he turned to the four men who remained
in the bar mr bentley was one of them

  sorry to be so upset about it but i
warn you gentlemen that if youre thinking
of sleeping in any upper rooms youre in for
disappointment that man outridge jars
the furniture with his snoring im forced
to go and walk about a bit - and then
ill get my sleep in a chair on the lower
veranda

  ive been up and tried to sleep myself
said bentley in sympathy but it was no
go-i thought id better come back here
and hang on  the chess game was re-
sumed

  fenton drank his bitters and slipped a
couple of gold pieces to ah sam keep
the change-you mixed that drink just
right he winked at the chinese who
pocketed the gold coins and from his own

pocket put a silver coin in the till in pay-
ment for fentons picon ah sam under-
stood that he had been successful in doc-
toring outridges drinks - and that the
transaction was successfully completed

  lighting a cigaret fenton went to the
front veranda in a few minutes he saun-
tered idly down the coral walk in the direc-
tion of the godowns

  for a quarter of an hour he idled about in
the palm grove walking back and forth and
keeping in sight of the hotel he appeared
to be seeking exercise and not to be con-
cerned with where he went

  finally he struck off for the beach when
he got into the open moonlight he walked
briskly over the hard shingle then when he
had gone twenty rods turned and came
back

  he kept increasing the distance he gained
down the beach away from the hotel this
was toward the place where his companions
had their shack

  there was a point of brush that ran down
from the jungle to the beach he sat down
at the end of this point of foliage rested and
lit a cigaret

  ive made a fairly good nights work of
it phil he remarked to the dense bushes
behind him cold cash-and a little bet-
ter than two thousand dollars-all in mixed
notes and of fairly good denomination
that is a clean-up came the voice of
phil jones

  first-chop good luck it walked into
the hotel and yelled at me to pick it up
but alongside of something else ive run
into its mighty poor picking

  how do you mean dude

  theres something big for us in the wind
if that gang can keep their shirts on
whats turned up an american mil-
lionaire without his keeper-and his pockets
lined with cash

  better than that-phil heres where we
jump this island

  good ill move along any time you say
the gangs getting too hard to handle
what are you going to do buy a yacht
and take em on a tour

  you know that schooner that came in
this morning

  is that the big game youre talking
about she didnt look very rich to me
thought she was a trader

  she has her hold full of trade goods
yes but shes here on some under-cover
king of the beachcombers



game and she has fifty thousand dollars
in cash in her safe

  for the love of mike marveled phil

  if shes cleaned up whos to make a
roar about her if she doesnt turn up in
some port whos to make trouble as ive
said her skipper-stranlows his name-is
here on some smooth game

  got any idea what it is

  no what i heard him tell hoi pri-
vately may be right-hes an oil scout on the
quiet but he told me hes going to the
sedrianas to hunt pearl-shell beds
maybe what he told hoi is right
maybe but it doesnt matter-i know
hes got a bunch of coin that came in for him
in the palembang stranlow doesnt dream
i know-picked it up on the quiet but if
we could get that schooner and sell the trade
goods in some wild islands and get away
with the cash-itd be the mop-up were
been waiting for

  then well need the gang

  sure he wants some white men in his
crew ive told stranlow that youre men
whove been working on plantations and
spoke of you as a mate he didnt cotton
at first but i swung him round

  but how can you ship going to stow
away

  going along as guest if he doesnt take
on any of you ill have to stow you away
and well swing the thing by ourselves no
other whites aboard you see but if we
can only get toady and probably port light
the four of us will be enough to settle the
native crew and handle the schooner here
take this cash slip it back to me when i
see you tomorrow and dont tell the gang
how much we got ill divide up a couple
of hundred dollars with em and say that
was what i made tonight

  he dropped the packets of money by his
side and phils hand reached out and
picked them up

  and take my watch fenton went on
ill make the first roar about thieves in the
morning myself and beat my chap to it be-
fore he finds his moneybelt gone so i
cant take the chance of having any of his
money on me-you might slip me one note
back-a small one ill use it to draw a
herring over my tracks

  phil jones handed back one note here
its only a british pound note he explained
after he had squinted at in the moonlight
youd better drift into the port early in

the morning before i get out to see you
went on fenton show up in your best
sailor duds thatll make it appear to
stranlow that youre after a ship regardless
of what ive said-itll throw him off the
track of a thought that im planting a crew
on him get out to the untong in a boat
stranlow probably wont be aboard but if
you watch at the godowns after youve been
to the schooner you may catch him on his
way to his schooner

  brace him for a berth as mate and if you
hook put in a word for the others tell
him toady is a bosun and port light a
carpenter if possible get em all shipped
without my having to talk to stranlow
about it again ill wander up the beach
because ill want to have a talk with the
gang dont tell em anything about the
plans or whats in the untong ill spring
that on em myself-and give orders then
i can come back to the hotel and tell stran-
low i couldnt find any of you you be
back at the shack by nine oclock so you
can be there and listen to what i tell the
gang weve got to play canny all along
the line ill mosey back to the hotel now
and not be away too long

  ill show up early in the morning for the
untong and go through with things said
phil good luck

  luck yourself phil

  fenton rose and strolled up the beach
toward the kota baiun

ix

i tell you i left my money-
belt in the safe

  it was the angry voice of
outridge just after dawn it
reached the ears of fenton asleep in a re-
clining chair on the front veranda the
birds were chirping in the hotel gardens
from the upper floor came the angry growls
of men waked from sleep by the uproar in
the hotel office fenton sat up to ms ten

  sure i did i know what im talking
about dont try to bluff me out of it-
youve got my money more than two
thousand dollars in a buckskin belt i
want it

  servants cleaning the side verandas be-
gan to gather to hear the row the low
tones of the clerk pleading for quiet drifted
out to fentons ears

  i have no record of your having
io

adventure

deposited any money in the safe sir but
please dont make so much noise its early
sir and the safe can not be opened yet and
last night you had been drinking a little
there may be a mistake on your part
sir

  i was drinking more than a little last
night admitted outridge  s matter of
fact i was tight never got tight so quick
in all my life had two or three drinks-
and they made me sleepy drunk had a
hard job to get to bed funniest thing i
ever saw ordinary i can drink all night
and not be under the influence but that
stuff your bar-boy hands out-not only
made me drunk-made me ill ive been
ill for the last two hours-and im still
groggy but thats neither here nor there-
i come down here for my money-belt and
you swear i didnt hand it over for safe-
keeping ill jolly well see about that i
know i left it with the clerk-the dutch-
man not you ive a distinct recollection
of standing here with my belt in my hand
and turned it over and-

  then if you left your money you should
have a receipt sir anyhow youll have to
wait and take it up with the clerk who re-
ceived it-and wait until he comes on duty
and the safe is opened

  oh hang the receipt i dont believe i
took any cant remember any i trusted
this hotel and i want my property

  the wrangle went on outridge refused to
be satisfied with anything but an admission
that his money-belt was in the safe

  fenton grinned

  heres luck that outridge chap is a
trifle muddled from the stuff ah sam doped
him with and finding his belt missing
hasnt the slightest idea yet that hes been
shaken down for it this gives me time to
fix up a game thatll cinch the fact that a
native got away with the cash

  he threw off the light covering and in his
pajamas went round to the restaurant ve-
randa where the breakfast tables were being
covered with linen the servants were
busy wiping the matting fenton grumbled
about having been waked dropped into a
chair and pretended to fall asleep

  the servants resumed their work as the
trouble in the office waned fenton dropped
the pound note which he had taken back
from phil jones and presently wandered
back to the chair he had deserted on the
front veranda as he settled himself he

could see the note he had dropped under the
other chair

  in a few minutes a malay boy wearing
only a loin cloth appeared with a bucket
and a mop he began cleaning near the
note he picked it up looked about to
make sure the other servants had not seen
him tucked the note into his chowat and
went on with his work

  fenton left at once for his room on the
upper floor as he approached the stair-
way he saw outridge still in argument with
bertie

  as fenton dressed himself he heard cap-
tain stranlow moving about in his room

  i say my watch is stolen cried fen-
ton left it in my trousers last night
when i went below to sleep and its
gone

  hello whats that called stranlow
through the wall

  fenton broke out in angry complaints
i say my watch is lifted and outridge
is having a row with the clerk about a
moneybelt outridge swears he put it in
the safe

  the entire hotel knows that much said
stranlow ive been trying to sleep
through the racket hes made but while
im sorry for you-i think its amusing-it
was you who warned me to put my prop-
erty in the safe and now youre nipped

  and youd better look through your
things said fenton as he hastily tied his
shoes he departed for the lower floor and
broke in on the harrassed clerk outridge
stood aside giving a nod of recognition

  look here began fenton crossly to
bertie ive been robbed left my
clothes in my room last night and slept on
the front veranda outside here and my
watch-worth a hundred dollars-is gone

  im sorry but well have to disclaim re-
sponsibility said bertie guests are cau-
tioned to leave their property in the safe
and-

  oh yes your safe exclaimed out-
ridge all i hear is your confounded safe
well i left mine in your bally safe and now
you say youve no record mr fenton
youve lost your watch by not putting it in
the safe but i wonder if ill get my two
thousand after ive put it in the safe

  youve nothing to worry about out-
ridge im not questioning the honesty of
the clerks but it is a confounded nuisance
to be left at the mercy of a lot of native
king of the beachcombers



servants roaming about in the halls at all
hours of the night and sneaking into
rooms

  what servants were in your room
sir well do all we can to recover your
watch if youve any suspicions-any idea
of the servant who might have taken the

watch-

  how should i know who got it bertie
i ordered nothing during the night but i
did see a boy in the hallway when i left my
room a little after midnight a malay he
was id say got a good sight of him as he
passed a lamp id know him i think
when he saw me he scuttled for the back
veranda naturally i thought he was
from the kitchen or the bar but ill bet he
hid in the servants stairway and when i
came below he went into my room and
lifted my watch out of my trousers i slept
down here in my pajamas

  well see about it sir said bertie
well have all the servants up at once so
please keep quiet sir so they wont all
know your loss has  been discovered
theres been too much row made as it is
here comes mr hoi-hell take charge
of your cases gentlemen

  the blond young dutch clerk arrived
with mr hoi both looking annoyed and
showing signs of having dressed hastily
they listened to outridge with grave faces

  he shook his head doubtfully as he
looked over the two or three duplicate
receipts for valuables deposited in the
safe

  i doubt that you turned over your
money-belt sir i have no recollection of
anything in connection with your belt or
your money except that you showed the
belt to mr hoi yesterday when you de-
sired to convince him that you had funds
to pay for any expenses you might incur
you did not leave the belt or the money for
safety with me

  mr hoi went to the safe and rolled the
combination he took out a tin box con-
taining envelopes and packets

  there is nothing here of yours sir
said mr hoi you can see for yourself
we cannot be held responsible

  outridge in blank amazement and rage
began to storm he insisted that he had
turned in his money by this time other
guests began to arrive from their rooms
grumbling as they came down the stairway
and staring disgustedly at outridge

   captain stanlow appeared wearing his
 sun-helmet he lingered looking on as if
 waiting for an opportunity to attend to
 some business with the hotel on his own
 account the servants began to gather
 in the lobby

   i shall hold this hotel responsible for
 my loss of two thousand dollars cried
 outridge

   a native servant came running down the
 stairs he held in his hand a long strip of
 light-colored material-the empty buck-
 skin belt that belonged to outridge

   in high excitement the servant held up
 the belt to mr hoi and explained in malay
 that he had found the empty belt out on
 the tiling of the roof of the rear veranda

   thats my belt cried outridge there
 you are i told you the hotel had it and
 whats this boy doing with it-and empty
 you cant disclaim responsibility now
 and-

  but no heed was given to outridge
 smr hoi and the two clerks bolted up the
 stairway demanding of the boy to be
 shown the exact spot where the belt had
 been found

   the other guests went out to the restau-
 rant veranda but outridge fenton and
 captain stranlow remained in the lobby

   this is certainly a bally madhouse this
 morning said stranlow id like to
 have a cup of coffee before i go out aboard
 my schooner but theres no chance i
 think ill drift along

        outridge dashed away to the
 upper floor explaining that he
 jjyjvja should hear and see what went
 on if im not present he
 said theyll cook up something against
 me by having a servant admit theft from
 my room when as a matter of fact i left
 the belt with the clerk

   you ought to be there said stranlow
 with a wink to fenton

   fenton laughed and shrugged shoulders

   what do you make of it asked the
 skipper

   its all a blind i don believe this
 card-sharper lost his money at all

   stranlow was surprised

  a blind how do you mean what
good would it do him to make all this fuss if
he didnt lose his money and theres
his empty belt-picked up out on the
tiles of the roof


adventure

  its this way as i see it said fenton
in quiet tones disregarding the voices from
the upper hallway outridge tried to get
the hotel to believe he had a couple of
thousand dollars to meet his expenses the
bluff worked-they didnt examine what
was in his belt now he threw the belt
out on the roof swears he left his money
in the safe and is trying to bilk the hotel
into paying him back his money to avoid
trouble

  pretty smooth business that de-
clared stranlow id never thought of it
in that way you ought to say a word to
mr hoi on that theory

  theres more to it than that went on
fenton i think hes the blighter who
got my watch hes playing at being
robbed to divert suspicion from himself
his snoring-that was all rot to fool the
lot of us

  my word said stranlow looking ad-
miringly at fenton you are a keen un
its the cleverest bit of work ive ever
heard of i wouldnt have seen through the
dodge in a yeaf of sundays

  i may be wrong of course i thought
at first a malay boy i saw in the hall last
night was the chap who got my watch-
and look here there he is now-the chap
with the bucket and mop he pointed
to the boy who had picked up the pound
note

  he looks scared-knows youre talking
about him said stranlow and hes
edging away he does look guilty and
wants to get out so-

  fenton darted across the lobby after the
malay boy who dropped his bucket and
mop and attempted to flee as fenton
started for him but fenton caught him
and dragged him across the lobby to
stranlow

  the cries of the startled boy brought the
outer guests running from the restaurant
veranda they looked on in surprize as
fenton held the native in his arms facing
away and probed into the folds of the
chowat

  out came a concave brass box which
fitted over the malays hip it held
sireh-for betel-chewing then came a
few coppers and a piece of bone carved so
that it served as a charm-and the one-
pound note

  now we have it cried fenton
whats this boy doing with a pound note

he isnt paid off in english notes ill bet
he probably doesnt know what its worth
to the boy fenton said where you
catch this

  the boy terrorized with the realization
that there had been thefts in the hotel and
that he was trapped with money which did
not belong to him whined and spluttered in
malay and bits of dutch that he had not
taken the money but had found it on the
restaurant veranda

  likely story said fenton to stranlow
turning round to the other guests fenton
said ill wager that this is part of the

money from outridges belt with-

  mr hoi came dashing down the stairs
some of the servants had run to him with
word that the thief was caught the whole
crowd from above came trooping down
mr hoi demanded to know what had
happened

  ah you have find the tief cried
mr hoi when he heard fentons explana-
tion and saw the crisp fresh note and
you say this is very boy you see above
floor last night eh i have hear of it he
no business upper floor this boy

  look at this note mr outridge said
fenton did you have any such notes in
your belt

  outridge took the note from fentons
fingers

  cerainly thats some of my money
i had quite a few of these-real new ones
youll see from the bank in singapore
and its folded just as mine was-twice
across so as to fit into the pockets of my
belt look here this proves it

   he took the belt and fitted the folded note
into the little pocket from which it had
been taken

  the malay pleaded with mr hoi assert-
ing that he had found the money and was
not a thief

  ah so you lie to me eh we find you
went up to the back roof-we find leafs on
the roof and last night mr fenton is
see you-in the upper hall he turned to
the number one boy of the servants a big
chinese take this boy out and give him
twenty bamboo i show my servants they
cannot lie to me-and steal

  the wailing boy was dragged away
all the servants were summoned to be
questioned in an attempt to discover where
the missing money might be hidden
screams came from the yard behind the
king of the beachcombers

hotel as the bamboo rods were laid on
the malay boys back

  well ill get out of this said stranlow
ive business for a few minutes aboard
my schooner he took from the clerk
three large packages that had come by mail
nodded to mr hoi and signed a receipt for
them see you later he said to fenton
and departed

  the packages under the skippers arms
fenton knew must be the money-or part
of it-which had arrived for stranlow in
the palembang the fifty thousand dollars
was being moved aboard the untong

  and as stranlow walked down the coral
path for the beach fenton observed a figure
in clean dungarees and wearing a pilot cap
lurking about the warehouses at the dock
it was phil jones waiting to approach
stranlow and seek a berth as mate in the
schooner

fenton arrived about nine
oclock behind the point of rocks
where his beachcombers had their
lair he came straight up the
beach without any attempt to conceal
where he was going from those at the hotel
explaining before he left that he was taking
a walk to avoid the confusion attending the
row about outridges loss the investiga-
tion was still in full swing when he left
and while the money had not been recov-
ered there was no doubt about who had
committed the thefts the malay boy was
chained to a tree

  so fenton in his hotel clothes wearing
his sun-helmet and carrying his cane was
a figure of elegance and affluence now in
comparison with his appearance the morn-
ing before when he left his companions

  and the beachcombers had changed their
appearances they were shaven and clean
and instead of their rags now were all
dressed in clean working clothes-faded
dungarees straw hats or canvas caps
they wore shoes or boots their sea-
bags were on the sand and they squatted
on them ready to listen to what their leader
had to say they looked like honest and
respectable seamen-all but thursday
smith his clothes were a trifle better than
the others and his trimmed beard might
have caused him to be mistaken for a ships
doctor

  fenton had already had a private con-
ference with phil jones-just a minute in

passing during which fenton had received
back some two hundred dollars of the cash
looted from outridge

  well began fenton to his assembled
men i understand that phil has shipped

as mate in the untong-

  i told you as ow i knew that blighter
of a schooner broke in toady harry his
sunburned face showing spots of light skin
on his cheeks now that he had lost his
beard

  -has shipped as mate went onfenton
and it looks as if theres a good chance you
can all ship in her if you play your hands
right with the skipper

  yes its all to be decided when stranlow
has had a chance to look em over said
phil so ive got em ready to move into
the port

  now warned fenton as he sat down
carefully on a rock i want to say a word
about care in port retzenborg in the
first place you know that the minute you go
past the point here youve left british soil
and are in dutch territory the boundary
line cuts this island hereabouts-you know
that-and the dutch cant touch you here
but in the port-if you drink or make any
trouble you may be grabbed you know
the dutch would like nothing better than
to pick up the lot of you on any charge
so mind your eye before the untong sails
we knows all that dude said toady
wot we wants to know is wots the lay
im coming to that in a minute when
i leave youd all better wander down to
the jetty ill go back to the hotel through
the hills and tell stranlow i couldnt find
you in the meantime youll probably
be shipped-and itll look better that way
this trick cant look too rigged up or the
skipperll have none of us

  its all very well for us to be shipped in
that schooner said toady harry but
wot i wants to know is where is she bound
for

  hold your tongue and give the dude a
chance said phil sharply

  ho youre the myte of the untong
now and were only swine of sailors
thats it is it my earty

  toady was jeering now but there was
good-nature in his jeer and phil had too
much sense to take offense

  let the dude talk and shut up said
thursday there were murmurs of assent
and the others hitched closer on their bags


adventure

to listen elephant joe had his mandolin
over his shoulder and his eyes were glisten-
ing with anticipation

  this is where we mop up began fen-
ton weve been here long enough its
time we moved on if you play the game
with me and take your orders and carry
em out well be in sydney in three months
-with plenty of cash

my aunt sydneyi cried toady harry
joyfully thats wot sounds like it to me
there were gasps of astonishment and
pleasure from all the others-except ele-
phant joe he shook his head a trifle sadly

  we should have a couple of thousand
dollars in cash-maybe more said fenton
it remains to be seen we may make
even ten thousand a man in the final split-
up

  id ship in a blinkin bawth-tub for the
likes o that

  are you talking seriously fenton
asked thursday

  i never was more serious i want this
talk of swine of sailors stopped weve
all got to play our proper parts in this game
no rows mind if phil as mate of the
untong gives you rough talk and treat-
ment take em-hes got a reason he
cant let this skipper think its a gang of pets
thats being shipped and you look to
that phil-dont be too ready to make the
skipper think these chaps will stand by
you rather than by the skipper dont
talk em up too much but show you can
boss the job if theres the least suspicion
that im too thick with the lot of you were
likely to miss the chance of our lives
cawnt a chap awsk a question without

avin is - ead knocked off-ere

amongst ourselves asked toady harry

  thats all right-here look out for
what happens in that schooner youll
take orders-and no growling

  i always as-and i will now youre
my skipper dude-and phil ere ill
tyke my horders from im didnt i
always do my bit

  you have but youve fretted a little
lately and we cant chance this job with
one man on the least of a raw edge i
want you in on this toady-youre too
handy with a knife to leave out of it

   oh theres a knifin job eh

  never you mind talking of it now

  orl right im in for this commish
and if im oldin things up with my gab

dont mind me-go aead- ive no mind

to stop the meetin

  then its this way the untong is
loaded hatches-full with rich trade goods
i got the tip in private he told one man
he was going scouting for oil and told me
he was bound for the sedriana group for
shell but whats he doing with holds full
of trade goods he has natives aboard as
crew he could use them for oil or shell
work but he wants a white crew and hes
beached some of his white men i dont
dare go look them up in the chink gin-
shops and ask em questions mind if
you run into any of them dont ask ques-
tions we cant have stranlow fobbed off
us by showing too much curiosity and
keep out of the gin-shops at the port

  wot does e want white seamen for
asked toady his face twisted in a reflective
study

  for fighting purposes thats what
said fenton hes on an under-cover
business-but that doesnt concern us
what we want to do is get off the land in
that schooner

  ho i see we grabs the schooner sells
off the tryde goods to natives in the southern
islands and its out for sydney with the
blinkin cash weve made-and scuttle the
untong when weve done with er

  thats it assented fenton

  shell ave some cash too for tryde
commented toady thats not to be
spit at

  i doubt shell have much money aboard
said fenton his eye wandered to phil
jones

  traders dont carry much cash you
ought to know that toady said phil

   theres little to expect in her but trade
goods said fenton but theyll make
us rich

  ahm agoin home some old day oh
baby hummed elephant joe shaking
hands with himself gleefully

  me for london in good time-and a
first clawss ticket declared toady

  but how are you going to come along
with us asked thursday

          im going as the guest of the
skipper that means i wont
mix with any of you-but be a
little cold and distant though
ive met you off and on at plantations
youre below me in class-and dont forget
king of the beachcombers



it youll get your orders from me through
phil because hell be aft where i can get a
word to him privately now and then and
elephant joe may be able to get the cooks
berth though captain stranlow is against
taking blacks who are not native so i
want you to understand that when phil
tells you to do a thing the order comes
from me-and must be obeyed the man
who lays back no matter what the order is
gets his share cut as ill decide when the
pay-off comes

  if i see the slightest break in program-
therell be somebody to pay for it you
can work things out your own way but
phil and myself could pull this game off by
ourselves if we had to ive always played
fair with you and ill play fair unless you
dish this business youve lived fat and
easy under me and ive done the work and
taken the risks giving you your share so
youd stand by until something like this
came along and i could use you all together
in a gang-job now the untong is waiting
to be taken you can drop the game and
stay here on the beach-any of you or all of
you-or ship in the untong and get in on
the pay-off whos for staying behind
ah stays right with the bandwagon
said elephant joe

  count me on it and no questions asked
said port light

  ill stick - or high-tide said

thursday

  wots the use of talkin like wed op
out on you demanded toady harry in
hurt tones you think ill stay off a
crimson fortchin

  will you take orders-and no growling
demanded fenton

  ill bite the - blacks if youll

awsks me said toady were all in on
this as the dude and phil wants eh
mateys

  they all gave willing assent assuring
him in chorus that fentons word would be
the law and phil jones the chief prophet

  all right then said fenton briskly
and now about your sea-bags have you
got in them all the silver and jewelry thats
been hidden away

  not a thing left behind said port
light we didnt have time to melt down
the silver egg-cups and a few other trifles
where are the silver pieces

  we split em up between us said port
light walking into fentons trap

  i thought so said fenton with a grim
smile and now im going to give you a
chance to obey orders from the jump all
the silver has to be left behind-even what
has been melted before not a piece of
that stuff goes aboard the untong in a sea-
tjag-or in any other way

  youre right declared thursday ive
been telling em the same thing before you
showed up but they wouldnt listen
dismay came into the faces of the other
three phil jones looked away out over
the sea as if he was not concerned in what
they thought of fentons amazing and dis-
appointing order

  there was silence for a few minutes and
then toady harry in weepful tones spoke

  do you mean all the blinkin swag thats
silver thats nice to ear i must say
when weve been told all along were to
ave it wots to be done with it if i
might make so bold as to awsk

  bury it here said fenton coldly
itll keep-and we can come back for it

if we ever need--

  thats a jolly nice tune to ply declared
toady in total disgust  ere you been
payin os orf with silver and the like out of
your pickins at the otel and we thinks we
got a fair pile o swag now you say were
to bury it like a blinkin pup with a bone
on this crimson beach and syle awy to
try and myke our bloomin fortchins on
another job of work wot if we dont get
the schooner wot then do we go on a
beach again and vag it

  there were guarded murmurs of approval
of toadys stand

  you fatheads fenton broke out
knowing he could best handle the three by
abusing them have you no brains in
your heads are you a lot of simpletons
cant you see beyond your noses or
have phil and myself-and thursday-to
do all your thinking for you and fight with
you in the bargain to put a fortune in your
hands

  wots the blinkin arm to tyke along
the silver asked toady

  whats the harm scorned fenton
no harm at all you fool itll be a fine
thing for some of the native crew to fish in
your sea-bags steal silver egg-cups or other
silver with the name of the kota baiun on
it and sell it ashore before we sail from
port retzenborg in a quarter of an hour
after hes bought it the chinkll be telling
adventure

the hotel where he got it and after a reward
for returning it-and informing then
with the untong still in port the lot of
youll be dragged ashore and your sea-bags
opened the evidencell put you in a
dutch jail for the rest of your lives thats
all the harm toady you woodenhead

  the grumble of the others was now direct-
ed at toady for they saw he had been
beaten down

  but wot abawt the jewellyry weve got
cawnt we tyke that along

  one watch apiece and keep that out
of sight said fenton and the diamonds
-if theyre out of the rings-yes but no
silver mind--melted or unmelted

  thats rotten luck said toady

  say you havent got fifty dollars
worth of silver a man are you going to
let that junk wreck our chances dont
be fools bury the lot ill not take any
of mine and if i can leave mine behind
you can yours and more ill pay you
fifty a man for the silver in cash i got
about two hundred dollars out of a room
last night and ill take no share of it to
prove im right a hundred of it is mine
by rights but ill give you the lot to split
up-and another hundred of my own to
split for the silver hows that

  i sees it your way said toady beg-
gin your pardon for stickin my up in but
wot we wanted to know was wot you wanted
from us and thats correct eh mytes

  he turned to the others his face glowing
with sudden virtue now that fie could be
the leader in assenting to fentons orders

  the trio agreed all being relieved that
the matter was smoothed over

  wots the silver and the jewellry all
good for anyow i awsks went on toady

  he had his little trick for maintaining his
secondary leadership and now he per-
tended to take credit to himself when he
knew he had no choice in the decisibn

  glad you understand it from the right
angle toady said fenton ready to shift
from blame to praise for he needed toady
more than any of the others

  you generally have good sense when a
thing is explained to you ill say that
tyke no chawnces thats my motter
said toady and keep things movin i
says give the word and ill pull my
weight on any bloomin rope

  now then ill have to get back to the
hotel said fenton he took the roll of

money from his pocket it was part of
the outridge loot

  heres all i got last night and you
can split it yourself-and heres another
hundred of my own ive always played
fair with you chaps and ill continue to do
so if youll play my game

  he tossed the bills to them and with a
wave of the hand jumped up on the rock
barrier and left for the kota baiun

xi

        creaming the seas from be-
fore her bows close-hauled under
jjgpgbfr- a northerly breeze the schooner
untong drove to the southward
over a moon-bright sea she fore-reached
with the grace of a wheeling gull her sails
white in the nights brilliance and her
trucks flirting with the low-lying stars that
twinkled playfully among her topmasts

  in her bows under the shadow of her
foresail there was a cluster of black shapes
one figure sitting astride an overturned
bucket loomed up against the seas ahead
like the statue of some gigantic character
of mythology but the figure swayed
with an easy motion to the heel of the
schooner and as it swayed the monstrous
head lifted to the stars as if in wonderment
over the beauty of the night

  the ratlines sang in a low soft mono-
tone and with regular rhythm as they
slacked and grew taut again with each
caress of the swells against the schooners
stem

  there was another gentle sound that
beat against the planking-the soft fall of a
bare foot that sought to catch the pulsa-
tions of the rigging presently foot and
rigging fell into time and there was a melo-
dious twang that seemed to break from the
very skies themselves-a lilting minor that
might have come from a harp in heaven

  it came again--and again-sweet and in
time with the schooners roll the up-
thrust head lifted higher and a soft crooning
that challenged the croon of the seas
swelled upon the moonlight

   ahm goin home some old day o-o-o-o-h
ba-a-a-aby

  tum-tum-tum-tuml ahm a-goin ho-o-o-o-me

  elephant joe sang that formless song with
his soul he used words without rhyme or
reason and setting them to a music of his
king of the beachcombers



own which had probably come down to
him from his jungle forefathers he made a
song of infinite longing with a melody as
natural as the strumming of wind through
an african forest

  strike me pink but you ought to be in
the alls at ome you black declared toady
harry when the negro let his song die
away in the softest of string-picking

  best i ever heard bar none declared
port light nice pickle wed ha been
in if the skipper handnt taken you as cook
joe

  port light lay on his back staring up-
ward

  you know wot said toady impor-
tantly skipper didnt want the black be-
cause e said the nytives of the sedrianas
would be suspicious of a black in white
mens togs suspicious ho ever ear
the like o that

  poor old thursday said port light
he was a good chum-but he gits cold
feet at the last minute and decided not to
come along with us i done my best with
him but i couldnt git him to come near the
untong

  good job he didnt said toady i
never ad no trust for that chap-too much
of a toff for the likes of us

  thursday was a good sort insisted
port light loyally but he was afraid
of somethin

  you know wot

no he was a close-lip never a word
would he drop to give me a thought on it
i knows said toady with certainty
there was somethin wrong with thurs-
day-somethin he feared like

  sydney thats wot he was a-feared of
sydney and the blinkin police

  cripes youve struck it said port
light minute he knows were for syd-
ney i could see a look in his eyes-a power-
ful fearin look and he didnt talk so
much to me from then on only once this
mornin he has a chance down near the
water when we was alone tort light
he says to me i got a feelin in my bones i
dont want to go in this untong stop
ashore with me and well go it alone i
thinks it over but decides to stick-and
as were cornin down the beach to the port
to see the skipper and ship he bolts into the
jungle and thats the last we sees of him
you know wot

  no toady

   es a slick un is thursday figures it
out that if he skips us ell ave all the silver
and jewelry we buried-and a fairish lot
it is too better e says to hisself to ave
this swag and be safe then look in the eye
o a sydney bobby-and be tooken up for
murder or the likes o that

  perhaps youre right agreed port
light thoughtfully but wewas in luck
if we was to lose thursday to bring joe
here along-and his mandolin

  me ah tells him ahd throw away mah
pants when we gits to where them natives
is at-and look so wild id scare them can-
niballers chuckled elephant joe ah
cooks in this schooner says i to the skipper
if all i wears is a chicken bone in mah
nose

  not particular easy for you to ship
yourself toady said port light know
what the skipper said about you

  wot asked toady in a tone of indif-
ference

said you looked like a cockney trouble-
maker-and would be always on the growl
ill show im a bit of trouble-makin-on
the point of my knife whispered toady
viciously

  it was phil that fixed things up for you
went on port light in the barest of whispers
phil said as how you was the only man as
was fit to ship as bosun-and he needed
you

  and so i am declared toady thats
the honest of it

  sure its the honest agreed port
light that aint what im talkin of-
i says it was hard enough for the lot of us
to get shipped particular beggar the skip-
per but i know what he was afraid of
wot

  he was afraid that elephant joe and
you might be hard to handle when you found
the schooner wasnt bound for sydney at
all but was for the sedrianas-and this
cruise is a bluff he didnt want anybody
who might be dangerous

  you was good enough for im eh porty
youre the fair-aired boy e fancied for a
sailor eh well ill show the likes o im
afore the nights done-ive ad a borry of
joes sharpenin-stone from the galley and
ive give my knife a fair whettin

  thatll be a powerful lesson to him when
you gives him a stab laughed elephant
joe

  hush it down warned toady dont
adventure

you know the nytive sailors is idlin in the
dark o the waist aft there

  then its tonight we strike asked port
light

  the night said toady cautiously
dudell be sittin out on the quarterdeck
with skipper for a bit of a chat after they
sup philll ave the deck when he calls
me aft thats the signal for the gyme to
begin

  what next asked port light this
is the first chance weve all had to know
since phil gave you the word we better
know now whats to be done

  when phil calls forard for me you all
lay aft and stop a bit at the scuttle-butt as
if you was for a drink of water afore turnin
in for watch below philll tyke me far
enough aft for a word so i can watch my
chawnce-and i slips my knife therell
be a call-you rush aft along the windward
runway that puts us all together soon as
skippers done for and we can fight if the
nytive crew acts up

  easy enough it sounds said port
light

  wots the matter we cant do for one
white man in this packet-and the lot of
these nytives too come to that

  but why so sudden-like asked port
light as if he shrank from murder so
abruptly why not give us all a chance to
think it over-and know the schooner bet-
ter and the lay of things

  the nights as good as any to finish off
this job o work said toady keep
things movin thats my motter do you
mind that when weve done for the skipper
we all live aft i enjoys a good bit o
tucker-why live on crew grub when we
can eat in the cabin

  right enough agreed port light
come on elephant-give us another rally
with a song it makes things sound peace-
ful-like and the skipper hearin us singin
wont think theres no danger in the wind
ay a bit o music said toady wont
do skipper no arm to ave a bit o music
afore e gits my knife its the last o singin
ell ear this side o jordan

  i wonder how old thursday is makin
things all alone in the old shack mur-
mured port light

  never you mind thursday said toady
im fair sick o earin of that toff e
never belonged with the likes of us-es a
blinkin ships orfficer wots lost is ticket

thats wot i knowed the beggard slip is
cables on us come first chawnce

  poor old thursday sighed port light
he was a good enough chum for me

  you wishes youd stopped back with
im i knows said toady you wait-
come mornin youll be aft-and a blinkin
owner of this packet and the tryde goods
below atches

joe struck his fingers across the
strings again and sang the delight
that was in his soul anticipating the
wealth that was soon to be his

  toady keeping an eye aft could see at
times captain stranlow pacing the weather
side of the quarterdeck and fenton walking
with him phil jones stood near the native
helmsman leaning on the cabin roof and
staring ahead into the night

  in the shadow of the sails these figures
were dim and indistinct but when the moon-
light fell upon them they stood out in sharp
relief against the glistening seas astern
fenton phil and toady were waiting for
what they considered the proper moment

  most of the native crew were loafing in
the waist for while the wind was fair and
the barest watch was needed the natives
preferred to remain on deck to hear the
music of elephant joe and port light
was in the bows on lookout so the routine
of the schooner was in order

  four bells struck-ten oclock

  bosun

  it was phil jones now at the break of the
deck and peering forward

  ay sir answered toady he got to
his feet and fumbled at his belt to pull his
sheath-knife forward on his hip ready at
hand to his companions he gave his final
order before moving aft for his nights work

  to the scuttlebutt right after me and
mind you have your knives ready keep
together-and rush aft when you hear a
call thats to let you know my blades
found its ome-therell be no slip from me
mind but you may ave to bear a and
with the nytives when ive done for skipper
not avin a gun mind youre andy with
your knives and tyke no chawnces

  stooping to clear the stay toady hurried
aft and elephant joe once more struck
the strings of his mandolin and sang lustily
a bar or two

  then the big black and port light moved
aft joking as they went to the scuttlebutt
king of the beachcombers



which was lashed to the forward bulkhead
of the cabin

  bosun break out the paint-gear in the
morning ive a job you might attend to
and its as good a time as any to show you
whats to be done this paulm on the cabin
roof is gittin to leak and needs mendin
and fresh paint

  i was noticin of it myself sir said
toady he mounted the three steps of the
quarterdeck following phil jones

  phil moved aft slowly running his fingers
along the edges of the whipped-down canvas
side of the cabin roof

  theres a spot aft here thats special
bad continued phil ill show you where
it is and you can turn to on it some
morning

  he drew toady still farther aft captain
stranlow was walking with fenton and they
were talking there was nothing suspicious
about the boatswain and the mate discus-
sing the work for the next day

  toady edged ahead of phil and reached
the after corner of the cabin roof-on the
weather side where stranlow always turned
to go aft again

  phil and toady went on discussing in
low tones the defect in the tarpaulin

  the moment came when captain stran-
low was within three feet of toady the
boatswain having his back to the skipper

  the captain made his turn aft phil
jones threw up a hand in signal to toady
that things were right

  toady swung round knife out and lunged
forward with his blade-hand in a straight
stabbing stroke for the kidneys

  captain stranlow whirled he did not
lift a hand-but a yellow jet of flame rose
slantingly from his hip there was a dull
report tiny red sparks flew from the yellow
flame-bits of fabric sheared away by the
bullet as it leaped through the side pocket
of stranlows jacket

  the up-angled slug of lead struck toady
in the chest his feet left the deck in a
convulsive little jump for the big auto-
matic pistol carried a blunt ball and as
toady was not more than two feet from the
muzzle the heavy charge of powder got in
its full effect with velocity and lifted the
boatswain off the planking the impact
hurled him backward and he fell in a limp
heap in the narrow runway between rail
and cabin bulkhead his knife clattered
away musically

 sydney he gasped no sydney
for-

  port light and elephant joe came rush-
ing aft

  captain stranlow now with a big auto-
matic in each hand waved a weapon menac-
ingly in the direction of phil jones and the
two sailors

  stay forard you two bawled stranlow

  whatd you shoot him for demanded
phil jones

  forard yourself mister cried stran-
low keep em off my deck i dont want
any piracy aboard me

  phil seeing the skippers gun on him
backed away waiting for fenton to do
something and fenton was watching his
chance to grasp one of those wavering
pistols which swung about in a wide arc
crazily-dangerous to fenton

  phil knew something had gone wrong
there was no time to think-it was a mo-
ment in which more was happening than
either phil or fenton had looked for

  forard forard yelled phil to the
two who rushed upon him from the break
of the deck

  he threw up his hands and waved them
back they understood that he meant what
he said the gasping figure of toady under-
foot stunned them and the sound of the
shot from stranlows pistol gave them proof
enough-if the boatswains body did not-
that they had lost the first skirmish for
possession of the schooner for neither
phil nor fenton had a firearm

  they hung in stays a minute too amazed
to obey phils order promptly and gazing
aft they saw what phil saw as he turned aft
to distract the attention of the skipper so
that fenton could do the work that was
needed-an attack on stranlow from be-
hind

  mister get them men aft warned
stranlow once more his back now was
partly to fenton and phil jones drew his
breath quickly seeing that the chance was
open-and fenton might miss it

  a figure darted from the wheel-the
native helmsman just as fenton lurched
forward to grasp a pistol from stranlows
hand the native struck there was a dull
sound to the blow-a smack it caught
fenton alongside the head low near the
neck the dude dropped like a pole-axed
steer

  the helmsman stepped back to his wheel


adventure

and gave the schooner a spoke or two and
steadied her on her course

  mister-you git forward drive them
men to the waist and he sent a shot over
phils head

  blast you get forard roared phil now
he fled from before stranlow knowing that
for the time being they had lost the only
hope was that fenton knocked senseless
might have a chance to begin the attack
anew later it appeared that the helmsman
had lost his head and volunteering to aid
his skipper had struck down the guest of
the schooner by mistake it was plain
enough to phil that the skipper could not be
aware that his new mate was hand in glove
with the new crew else why had stranlow
fired that second shot into the air

  if he was on hed have pinked me along
with toady reasoned phil as he swung his
arms and thumped port light and elephant
joe forward pretending to rain blows on
them get forard you swine how many
times you need the tellin who called you
aft forard i say

  we aint done nothin wailed elephant
joe

  you wait till youre called for and-

  as the three of them stumbled down the
steps from the quarterdeck they found
themselves assailed in an unexpected am-
bush the whole native crew was out on
deck and had huddled behind the bulkhead
of the main-cabin from that vantage spot
they hurled themselves upon the three and
with iron belaying pins battered the three
men to their knees

  not one of the trio had a chance to use
their knives a dozen of the despised native
sailors were upon them like a hurricane out
of a clear sky the three were borne down
to the deck from all quarters beaten and
clawed with vicious energy and blinding
smothering effect

  elephant joe called for help evidently
thinking that he alone was beset you
phil you phil man came the muffled
tones of the big black from the mass of
flying pins and waving arms and trampling
feet

  phil jones fought as best he could blinded
by blood from his eyes and barely conscious
as he swayed upward to his knees only to
go down again vaguely he knew that joe
had made a mistake in calling him by name
captain stranlow might hear his black cook
pleading for help-by the mates first name

in those cries for help from the big black
the skipper might grasp the key to the
situation and realize that all his crew were
leagued against him that would be
piracy-and black ruin that was the final
thought of phil jones as he sank unconscious
under the pack of bare brown feet and the
blows that flattened him to the planking

xii

when fenton became aware of
the fact that he was once more
in the land of the living he could
hear vague and dreamy voices
they seemed far in the distance and there
was a roaring noise that blurred the words
and left them without meaning and his
head ached with a violence that was beyond
bearing

  the voices grew fainter-and the dude
fell back again into a merciful uncon-
sciousness

  again he wavered on the borderline of
that vague world where voices could be
heard he managed to get his eyes open
above him was a whirling planet that swam
in a sky of yellow brilliance it must be the
moonlight he thought but the moon
should not be a black blob swinging un-
certainly back and forth across the sky

  he decided that what he took for the
moon must be the swinging lamp in the
main-cabin of the untong he could not
be on deck he had been brought below
and something had gone wrong-dis-
astrously wrong just what it was he had
no way of knowing his head was a frenzy
of pain

  he was on his back-on a transom-seat
that ran athwartships on one side of the
companionway leading to the quarterdeck
his face turned away from the bulkhead
for he wanted to see who was talking it
sounded like stranlows voice quiet and
matter-of-fact in spite of some terrific
things that had happened

  he closed his eyes against the pain that
the light of the lamp only made worse
but fenton wanted to see-and he took the
extra pain in order to look

  there was stranlow sitting at the cabin
table there was a mess of stuff spread out
on the cloth and stranlow was speaking
in low tones to somebody he spoke
soothingly and then fenton became aware
of a low sobbing sound
king of the beachcombers



  making an effort to remember he sud-
denly realized that the sobbing sounded
strangely like the singing of elephant joe
but the big black would not be in the main-
cabin that was too puzzling for fenton
to reason out for the moment he closed
his eyes again to think

  elephant joe got hurt-in the fight
thats it and stranlow has brought him
into the main-cabin to look after the blacks
hurt that means stranlow cant under-
stand that were working together against
him-and toady-but whats become of
toady did i see him shot and what
happened to me

  he groaned and lapsed into unconscious-
ness he did not know how long he was
lost to the little world of the main-cabin
with its swinging lamp but when he re-
covered again he heard stranlow giving
quiet orders to the native serang-and talk-
ing the native lingo

  elephant joe was sobbing noisily stran-
lows voice soothed him

  now tell me where you got this money
i took from your pockets urged stranlow

  ah gits that money fo a job i has in a
plantation replied the big black from
where he lay on a side transom near the
table

  and they paid you off in british notes
dutch paper and american money eh
pressed stranlow

  thats right boss said elephant he
checked his sobbing now eager to set him-
self right with the skipper

  and the money the mate has-and this
other man you call port light did they
get paid in the same money

  same way boss

 and mr fenton there did he get
paid off in the same way

  how i knows how mr fenton gits his
money suh i aint no banker man for
that swell

  mr fenton had a lot more money than
you did see that pile there it came from
mr fentons pockets and a great deal of
it is folded in the same way that your money
has been folded how do you account for
that

  i dont know nothin about his money
said elephant

 didnt you get this money from mr
fenton

 no suh how come mr fenton be
payin me

  thats something for you to answer not
me i asked you if you didnt get it from
mr fenton

  not me no suh

  how do you account for the fact that
the money you have and the money the
mate had and the money port light had-
is all folded the same way

  i dont know nothin about this capn
suh

  well i do said stranlow about
eighteen hundred dollars that i took off mr
fenton is marked-and a total of about two
hundred taken from you the dead cockney
port light and the mate-is all marked the
same way

  maked how come malced capn
boss ah dont know what you is talk
about at all no suh

  this is what im talking about mr
fenton got a little more than two thousand
dollars somewhere and he gave you and

the others about two hundred of it so-

  gits what capn demanded the
amazed elephant joe

  i said mr fenton got two thousand

dollars some-

  mah land cried elephant joe he

gits so much and he holds out on us-

  go on urged stranlow you were
saying something

  ah got no mo to say capn ah dont
know what you talks about

  oh yes you do said stranlow you
talked with mr bentley awhile back and
you had a fairly good idea of what you were
talking about now dont try to fool me

any more and-

  bentley that nigger never talked with
bentley broke in fenton weakly he
realized that elephant joe was giving away
facts which were dangerous

  oh mr fenton has joined our little
party came a voice from the shadows in
the corner of the cabin

  it was the voice of bentley

  fenton groaned he knew there must be
something wrong with his head if he
thought bentley who had warned him
against outridge back in the kota baiun
could be aboard the untong

  maybe a drop of something stimulating
would loosen his tongue went on bentleys
voice

  fenton moved his head to look into the
shadows as the swinging lamp threw a
splash of yellowish light into the corner


adventure

it revealed the figure of the big planter
sitting on a transom and smoking a cigar

  fenton gathered himself to get on his feet
he tried to throw up a hand and steady him-
self on the bulkhead behind him but the
hand refused to go where fenton wanted
to put it-and he found that his wrists were
bound with strong cord

  he gave a muffled cry of sudden fear-
and terror he knew some trap had been
sprung though just how it had been set he
could not fathom at the moment he fell
back again on the cushions of the transom
aghast at what had happened he was
sickened anew by the thought that he was
helpless

we dont need any informa-
tion from mr fenton said cap-
tain stranlow quietly let him
 come to if he likes-but this
money of outridges from his belt and
the pockets of his men sews up the lot
of em

  besides theres a charge of piracy in a
british vessel thatll hold em as for the
money its plain that fenton only gave the
others a small part of what he got from
outridge and kept some eighteen hundred

himself so-

  ah tole em you never split that money
fair burst out elephant joe shaking his
fist at fenton you calls yoself a dude
you says as how you plays fair with us boys
that heped you fool the dutchers and
what does i git fo what i done ah goes
and gits mahself all hampered up wid these
ere yaller niggers what strangles mah neck
wid fish-net ropes so ah caint fight em
none me ah thinks ahll go and git
mahself rich from listenin at yo smat
talkin about how you fools them dutchers
stealin offn em at that ho-tel and what
does ah git ah gits mahself in jail yo
is a smat white man mr dude yo aint
so smat as a baby mud-turtle

  mr fenton has been injured dont be
hard on him said stranlow

  w-jured does i care me ahm
ruined no suh mr fenton ah don
worry none about you look at what
toady gits he gits his liver blowed off
wid a gun all from listenin at you talk
smat ah wished you was stabbed in so
many places the stabs would run together
in one big stab and yod be nothin but a
hole in the air aroun yo

  you seem to have a grudge against mr
fenton remarked stranlow

  ah got the grudgiest grudge what any-
body could have capn what i gits for
listenin at that man look at me now
is the only time ah got to talk-when i gits
in front of that dutcher judge he wont
know what is mah remarks me ah thinks
ahs goin home what ill do is be in a
dutcher jail as long ah fergits me where i
comes from-and ahll have to do the
cheffin for that smat man what gits me in
it and if ah don pizen him ah--

  oh shut up broke in a weary voice
it was phil jones where he lay on the deck
under fentons transom-seat-like a trussed
goose nobody wants to hear you talk
ah gits mah say retorted elephant
joe ah is just a fool black man but ah
got sense enough to know when we is done
if you not ah been listenin at what these
genlemen says and ah knows how down
ah is tuck in mah toes and let me sleep-
ah is a sick coon and mah comfort is
fractured

  if you dont mind captain stranlow
just what has happened ive been listening
to that crazy black talk and it means noth-
ing to me said fenton

  you is about ready to git the meanin
said elephant joe and what is mo dude
man it makes you awful sick dont you
be too hongry for meanins-you gits
a-plenty

  theres little to explain said stranlow
you men were up the beach just over the
line of dutch territory mr hoi of the
hotel couldnt do much and didnt want to
get in any argument with the british that
morning you were in the bar-mr hoi and
myself were aware that you were there-
we talked about the fifty thousand that had
arrived for me in the palembang it was
only a bait-there was no fifty thousand
whats that got to do with me asked
fenton

  nothing much but we rather think it
had a lot to do for us

  that may be your opinion but your
opinions dont interest me ive heard a
lot of talk about my money and the money
youve taken from these sailors i dont see
the connection at all youve taken my
money out of my pockets i understand-
id appreciate it if youd put it back

  it isnt your money said stranlow
  thats something youll have to prove
king of the beachcombers



or ill put you in the courts captain
i think i can prove it but im no hurry
about that little detail said stranlow

  all right said fenton im in your
hands it seems but i dont quite under-
stand what mr bentleys doing here just
what does it all mean

  simple enough this vessel was a black-
birder and was captured by the british
we use it for little cruises out of spore
these days

   we who is we if i might take the
liberty of asking

  myself mr bentley and mr out-
ridge

  outridge oh so youre in with out-
ridge eh how does that happen

  mr outridge is the man you robbed in
the kota baiun

   robbed him what are you driving
at you know a malay boy robbed him
im not so sure of that the money you
took from mr outridges belt was-marked
and the money taken from you and your
men is the same identical money

  fenton gave a gasp of startled amaze-
ment for the first time he began to grasp
something of just what had happened to
him

  how do you know this is mr outridges
money

  because mr outridge says so himself -
oh outridge will you step in from the
galley a minute i want you to meet a
friend of yours-a mr fenton sometimes
known as the king of the beachcombers 
outridge appeared in the galley passage
and smiled in at fenton

  hello there thought i was full of ah
sams dope eh when you lifted my belt
well i wasnt and as my money was
marked and you and your men had it in
your clothes i rather think i can prove its
my money well wait until we get to
spore however to give you all the facts
but-but bentley-said you were a
card-sharper gasped fenton he warned
me against you when-

  mr bentley didnt warn you enough
im afraid said outridge i hate to
criticise my chief but i was far more dan-
gerous than you supposed

  chief

  yes my bentley is an inspector of
the singapore police mr stranlow-beg
your pardon skipper-captain stranlow is
also connected with the police and im an
humble employee of the same department
ah craves to ask one question suh
said elephant joe

  ask it said stranlow

  fo what does i have to go to jail iffen
this dude fenton done the stealin ah
cant hold his hands while hes away fom
me nights

  oh we havent any theft charge against
you said stranlow except maybe hav-
ing stolen money in your possession the
charge against all of you will be piracy-or
attempted piracy-on a british vessel that
makes it simpler to hold you-and thats
why we waited until you did something
aboard here the crew you see are all
native police-and well trained to handle
any case that arises naturally you had
little chance to actually commit piracy in
the untong-but you tried hard enough so i
think the charge will stand

  there was silence for a few minutes

  ah craves to ask one mo question suh
  ask it

  this here jail what were goin to-is
that jail you done got picked out fo us all
a english jail

  british of course said stranlow with
a smile

  its not so powerful bad as it might be
went on the big black ah can be happy if
folks knows what ah says-and they can
listen at mah singin ah shore been in bad
company but the last thing ah looks to
git jugged fo is piracy-stuff no suh ah
never intended mahself fo to be  pirate
no suh now ah gits me some sleep

  and elephant joe turned over and fell
into slumber
the camp-fire

a free-to-all
 meeting place for
stgeaders writers and
adventurers

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesamej between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

   if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

camp-fire does go out and
hunt them up when they seem to
have got lost in the world in gen-
eral one of you inquired about
didier masson whom he had heard was
dead here are three comrades replying
and one of them expects to produce didier
masson alive and well while another is
pretty sure tommy dean is alive in cali-
fornia	miranda cuba

  about december  masson arrived in los
mochis sinaloa his plane arrived by military train
at san bias sin was switched over on the k c m
  and sent to topolobampo

  at that time the gunboat tampico was flying the
constitutionalista flag-how the tampico crew
revolted in guyamas harbor and brought the boat
to topo is another story

  shortly after the arrival of the tampico in topo
two of her guns were installed on the mountains
commanding the entrance to the port

  several days later the guerrero and morelos fly-
ing the federal flag showed up and dropped an-
chor just off the bar near the entrance of the harbor

  on the large level stretches just behind a low
range of mountains masson had his plane a better
landing or take-off field no one could desire the
first flight was somewhat a surprize to the guerrero

and morelos and not a shot was fired as masson
came over the mountains and headed out toward the
gunboats

  three bombs were dropped one failing to explode
one missing widely its mark the other splashing
water on the morelos a little later on in the day the
tampico steamed out to the entrance of the harbor
and a lively exchange of shots occurred but with no
damage to either side

  thereafter for a period of several days early in the
morning up would go masson but after the first day
he was met with a lively fire from the time his plane
showed over the mountains however it was never
for more than a few minutes because as he gained
altitude the guns could not be brought to bear on the
plane due to not having elevation sufficient and in
those days anti-aircraft guns were unknown usu-
ally from  to  shots were fired

  the second days practise at bombing resulted in
three clean misses but on the third day the bombs
landed uncomfortably close and at the same time a
few shots from the -inch guns on the mountains
caused the guerrero and morelos to up anchor and
away from topo masson went to hermosillo
and later to nogales after that we lost track of
him until word reached us that he had been shot
down in france

  a relative of mine residing at puerto barrios in
guatemala sent me a copy of adventure for the
month of february  i notice inquiries being
made for one didier masson a frenchman the
episode mentioned by the writer together with
many others relating to his war service on the west-
ern front in france i have heard from masson him-
self he was what is known as a french ace and
had the croix de guerre and i think the legion of
honor medals besides other decorations the
writer states he has heard he is dead and was killed
in france i can assure the inquirer that he is not
i last saw him at orange walk in the northern part
of this colony in  and at the present time to
the best of my knowledge he is engaged commercial-
ly in the el cayo district i e the western district

  i am at the first opportunity sending this par-
ticular copy of your magazine for his information

  this is in answer to a b cs inquiry about did-
ier masson and tommy dean i knew them both
from the time gen pesqueira then acting governor
of sonora brought them to mexico together with
the curtis biplane which had to be smuggled across
the line

the bombs mentioned were the invention of
dean who lost the part of one finger in his ex-
perimenting tommy dean was a cracker-jack
aeroplane mechanic and had never done any flying
previous to general obregons besieging guaymas
that plane was very different from those used today
it had two seats rigged in front of the wings with
nothing in front to break the wind and in fact noth-
ing underneath them but a sort of basket seat and
a narrow foot-rest the operator sure had an un-
obstructed view by leaning over a little one could
see under the plane one day masson asked dean
to get in the other seat lean over and watch to see if
the bombs struck anything while he taxied down the
field before dean realized what had happened he
was up in the air after that he flew regularly with
masson

u aving no protection from the wind and it be-
ing before the days of special clothing they
bundled themselves up in whatever clothing they
had on the day mentioned when they had to make
their forced landing at empalme and with gen
ojeda coming out of guaymas with a train full of
soldiers to take them prisoners dean stopped at the
plane long enough to break and tear away his gas-
controls trying to leave the machine in such shape
that gen ojeda could not use it then they both
beat it for their camp some  or  kilometers away
shedding their extra clothing as they went both of
them expected gen ojeda would shoot them if they
were caught so discarded their clothing regardless
dean had spent some four or five hundred dollars for
repair parts etc and the vouchers for this money
were in his coat that he threw away to get in good
running shape he told me afterward that he had
a dickens of a time collecting this money as acting
governor randall at first refused to reimburse
him because he could not produce the vouchers

well they kept going until they ran into col tru-
jillo with a troop of cavalry who came to their rescue

by the way col trujillo lost one man in this rescue
the mexican who told me about it said the poor fel-
low stuck his head out just in time to have it carried
away by a cannon-ball

  after they met col trujillo they went back over
the way they had just come they discovered ser-
eral barbed wire fences they had passed but neither
could remember if they had gone through or over
them the surprizing fact to them both was that nei-
ther had tom his clothes

a fter gen ojeda was forced to evacuate guay-
mas they continued with gen obregon on his
march via mazatlan that finally wound up in mexico
city masson became fed up with his job and re-
signed coming back to hermosillo where he em-
barked in the commision business when the war
broke out in europe he went to france serving first
in the infantry later he was transferred to the air
service and i am told was one of the organizers of the
lafayette squadron subsequently he was ordered
to the united states i believe as an instructor at one
of our aviation camps they tell me he was killed
through some accident while flying at one of our
camps masson learned to fly in france where he
was known as the rubber-man on account of the
various spills he had while learning to fly

  tommy dean stayed with the mexican army for
some time he was in charge of their planes at
mexico city under a col salmas who was also a
flyer and a nephew of gen carranza later he
quit came to the states and got married he went
to san francisco took his examination and got his
license as an air pilot when the united states went
into the war he was foreman of an aeroplane factory
in either rhode island or new jersey i do not re-
member which state it was but i have the impression
that he worked in both states i know he built
planes for our government all during the war i
have not heard from him for several years but be-
lieve him to be still alive he had a brother in cali-
fornia and i think his father also fives there he in-
troduced me to him in nogales and he was then on
his way to california

  dean was a british subject and was born i think
in new zealand he is probably an american citi-
zen by this time-f e stevens

adventure

revolutions filibusterer with villa and friend of
pershing will be buried today

 los angeles march -us-there died
here yesterday a most famous border character of
recent years-sam dreben the fighting jew

  a heart overstrained by adventures such as few
men meet gave way and dreben died suddenly as
he would have chosen leaving a name for quiet
courage unexcelled in the annals of the southwest

  although the fighting jew was but  he had
packed into those years enough of danger and ro-
mance to cover a score of lifetimes intimate of
pancho villa companion of lee christmas and
tracey richardson and chief of scouts for pershing in
texas drebens name on both sides of the line was
one with which to conjure he carried uncle sams
musket in the boxer rebellion the spanish-american
war and the philippine insurrection earning the rep-
utation of a remarkable soldier

  and in the world war he ran true to form as top
sergeant in the th texas division he received the
accolade from general pershing of being one of the
bravest men in the american army

  it was for capturing a machine gun nest and kill-
ing  germans singlehanded that he received the
distinguished service cross the croix de guerre
and the military medal

  dreben made a considerable fortune at one time
in mexican mining properties his intimate ac-
quaintance with the country acquired while he
served on a machine gun for villa and acted as his
sub-purchasing agent afforded him an opportunity
to capitalize his knowledge when the border became
semi-pacified he was said to be the only american
ever really trusted by the picturesque mexican
chieftain

  but money meant little to him and his modest
competence was dissipated during several years of
semi-retirement at el paso he was an insurance
salesman in los angeles at the time of his death

  drebens last exploit was his attemped capture of
little phil alguin notorious los angeles desperado
who was in hiding in juarez in company with
louis oaks then chief of police of los angeles he
headed an expedition to kidnap alguin wanted for
murder and bring him to the american side alguin
was captured but a riot ensued before they could
hurry him across the line and the american party
had difficulty in escaping with their lives

wouldnt you know that hed be

 only a top sergeant in our hurriedly

built a e f quite possibly they started
this experienced soldier as a private and
quite possibly those who started him had
never even heard a shot fired in anger
his friend tracey richardson heaven
knows had a hard enough time getting
even elementary recognition of his military
experience even after hed added commis-
sioned service with the canadians in the
world war to his already strong record
with a commission as colonel or lieuten-
ant-colonel waiting for him in canada if
he couldnt make his own country let him
serve her as he was qualified to serve he

made a fight for it and at last forced
them to give him an examination the result
of which compelled them to give him what
was his due

  and two other comrades commissioned
officers in the british flying corps both with
service at the front and one with three or
four german planes to his official credit-
when we went into the war they came back
to serve their own country and were they
allowed to neither one could get a job as
pilot or observer despite their credentials
turned down by men whod never even seen
war and who couldnt do even elementary
flying jealousy i suppose or red tape
carried to the point of utter madness-at a
time when this country had practically no
aviators with anything like the experience
needed at the front one pompous fool on
long island finally allowed one of these two
camp-fire comrades to go up with him and
be tested out but the tester didnt know
enough flying to do even his own part-our
comrade had to take the stick and bring
the buss to the ground so they offered
him a ground job and he went elsewhere
his then invaluable experience lost to his
country

  at bottom its the same kind of pettiness
red tape bureaucracy jealousy politics and
utter lack of patriotism and horse-sense that
showed so often in the proceedings that re-
sulted in the removal of general mitchell
from his place in our air force

 from leonard h nason some
	acts concerning the history back

haggirj of his serial beginning in this issue

          qjd soldiers if they have not al-
ready run across it will be interested in the
seven-year record of ligoniers regiment
of horse

  in this story mr nason takes up what is
for him an entirely new line ive already
warned you that his field is not limited to
the war and the sea

  the journal of hugh bancroft a trooper in
ligoniers regiment of horse begins somewhat
abruptly at the battle of dettingen june 
this battle strangely enough took place between
two nations the french and the english who were
not at war with each other

hphe emperor charles vi of austria died in 
leaving but one child a daughter maria
theresa the elector of bavaria a cousin claimed
the throne of austria and was supported by fred-
erick ii of prussia the french were allies of the
prussians and in this capacity encountered british
troops who were supporting the claims of maria

  

against all comers the battle of dettingen was
the only one of the campaign of  and war was
not declared between france and england until
the following march

  ligoniers regiment had an exceptional history
in seven years of war they never lost a man or
horse to the enemy never had officer or man tried
by general courtmartial had thirty-five troopers
commissioned from the ranks and lost only seven
men by disease it can be seen from this record
that ligoniers troopers were exceptional men and
it is therefore not remarkable that a man of hugh
bancrofts education and antecedents should be
serving as a common soldier in the ranks of such a
regiment-steamer leonard h nason

to those who do not know our

   magazine or the type of people
who gather at our camp-fire it
would probably be a great sur-
prize that an argument concerning the
character of julius caesar started by talbot
mundy at one meeting pretty well occupied
another full meeting comes up again in
force at this one and may very well continue
at future ones

  the following editorial from the brocton
mass times restating part of mr
mundys theories is a good opener for the
present session

  talbot mundy who has some reputation as a
writer of historical fiction has a story dealing with
julius caesar in a recent number of adventure in
which he gives a different impression of the great
roman than that usually current and says regard-
ing it

  in the first place i dont believe he wrote his
commentaries many commentators agree with
him on that point his secretary did most of it
is in the third person but here and there the first
person creeps in showing where caesar edited the
copy which was afterward no doubt transcribed
by a slave who did not dare to do any re-editing

  the statement is frequently made that caesar
must be accurate because all other roman histo-
rians agree with him but they all copied from
him so that argument doesnt stand no man who
does his own press-agenting is entitled to be ac-
cepted on his own bare word and as caesar was quite
an extraordinary criminal along every line but one
he does not seem to have been a drunkard he is
even less entitled to be believed than are most press
agents he was an epileptic whose fits increased in
violence as he grew older and he was addicted to
every form of vice except drunkenness then
known he habitually used the plunder of con-
quered cities for the purpose of bribing the roman
senate he cut off the right hands of  gauls on
one occasion as a mere act of retaliation he broke
his word as often and as treacherously as he saw
fit and he was so vain that he ordered himself
deified and caused his image to be set in roman
temples with a special set of priests to burn incense
before it
i

adventure

  most of what he writes of caesar is true the
greater part of it may be found in suetonius but
plutarch has been followed rather than suetonius
and as it has been said that the english people take
their history from shakespeare and their religion
from milton so shakespeares magnification of the
romans character has impressed the popular
imagination

  yet despite his many faults caesar was the
greatest roman of them all and should be judged
by what he accomplished rather than by any merit
or demerit in his personal character

one from l s hughes as to my
aiding etc i refer him to a more
careful reading of my original statements

moundsville west virginia

   i write because i feel that you are unconsciously
aiding in a piece of mischievous iconoclasm i refer
to the troi stories

   recently i had to prepare a paper on the myths of
history and while i deplored racial and national
myths i defended personal legends of excellence
because they furnished inspiration

   i feel that there is no question that our belief in
the magnanimity and greatness of any one is bene-
ficial and that our modern tendency to sneer to be-
little and to deny the good in famous men militates
against nobility

   do you find nothing helpful in the tale apparently
authentic that caesar ordered all enemy correspon-
dence in the camp at pharsalia burned unread on the
ground that he did not wish to know his enemies
it is probable that this cost him his life

  consider also that after he had shattered the
senatorial power there was no proscription con-
trast this with sulla and others who proceeded him
if my memory serves sulla proscribed some
hundreds of senators and sixteen hundred equites in
one document

  even anthon who bitterly assailed caesar see
anthons classical dictionary did so only on
the ground that he overthrew the liberties of rome
and was ambitious as to the former charge i think
we can agree that he was mistaken as the liberties
had been gone for a century

qome of the authors remarks are truly extraor-
dinary such as the one denying caesars
authorship of the commentaries on the argu-
ment that they are both the third and the first per-
son to any one who has read much latin this
approaches the ridiculous for the two persons were
used much as they are today in french we know
that aulus hirtius wrote the latter books it is gen-
erally believed from caesars notes

   one thing is very certain the books were written
by a great soldier hirtius was one for they form
even today a practical manual of the art of war do
secretaries have the insight into strategy and tac-
tics of a master of war

  lechery is a favorite charge against any great
man it has been made against many among
them washington and napoleon it was made
even against jeanne darc consider that

  the charge is greatly weakened by being extended
by the author to the roman troops in general here
we have a definite and exact commentator who was a
jew and a high-priest of the jews josephus gives

in great detail the actions of the romans in camp
on the march in battle and siege and lastly in the
storm of a city he does not mention that a single
woman was molested is not this worth notice

  i do not pretend that the romans or caesar were
purists by any manner of means but gross animalism
is not compatible with good soldiership and they
were the best of soldiers

hphe commentaries to any student of the art
of war are a strangely modest book where
disaster occurred it is clearly recorded and the
reasons are given for instance caesar says dis-
tinctly that when in the territory of the belgae he
held his forces in camp awaiting a favorable oppor-
tunity because the test skirmishes resulted un-
favorably

  a curious error is found in regard to the word
barbarian this carried no stigma whatsoever
and meant only those who spoke another tongue
than latin the word is from the greek barbaroi
an imitative invention indicating meaningless
sounds and by the way caesar rarely uses it in
regard to the gauls he spoke celtic and so under-
stood most of the tribes he does use it in con-
nection with the tribes of brittany

qnf more point i shall try to make before i ask
for a bit of information and close the scene
of the fight at the landing is entirely beyond pos-
sibility caesars vivid description has only been
touched by one writer the younger arnold who
has redone it excellently the romans lost few men
and the aquilarius of the tenth legion whom mr
mundy makes a swaggering grinning brute but
who has fired tens of thousands with the memory of
his noble cry was not killed few men were lost
because the legionarys armor was not heavy all
equipment and pack amounting to seventy pounds
and because the pila hurled from the ships could
clear the landing for a sufficient distance

   i shall be greatly obliged if you will give me the
citation of caesars alleged cutting off of sword-
hands giving book chapter and the edition in which
it occurs it is not in my de bello gallico and
anthon who was a great classicist does not men-
tion it in his indictment of caesar

   i would suggest that if you want a fair picture of
the romans you read josephus he had no cause
to love them

  i have touched only a very few points of the
many which might be criticized in the story and in
the authors letter because i wish to prevent harm
not to find fault-l s hughes

  ps-admiral mahan who was competent highly
admires the roman navy see the influence of
sea power on history-l s h

now this one from hugh pendexter i
hate to publish it because its going to
make him so many bitter enemies i can just
see the abusive letters pouring in upon him
the insolence of the man the ignorance
a dangerous character and doubtless a
bolshevik an atheist and a downright
criminal at heart how about a lynching
party or at least some tar and feathers
iroquois indeed ridiculous why he
the camp-fire



hasnt any respect for anything sounds
as if hed been off somewhere in a corner
thinking a very dangerous habit ex-
terminate him hes a menace to all our
oldest and most cherished ideas that we
got from-oh well it doesnt matter where
we got em from or how theyre ours
and its impudent and criminal for him to
have any opinions that dont agree with
them

 again i add my n b to the hastily
minded to wit i do not endorse or attack
mr pendexters opinions but merely listen
to them with decency and respect for an-
other mans opinion hoping that they may
broaden my point of view and stimulate
me into doing some thinking of my own
the same course and attitude are respect-
fully but not too hopefully recommended
to you of the hasty minds

norway maine

  caesars reputation is based primarily on his
own reports somewhat similar to a newspaper
account of a fight i had had say with a deaf-mute
who couldnt express himself even in the sign-
language in such an event my opponent would
stand a fat chance so far as reputation goes ive
been warned that if i say caesar never originated
a military maneuver id have to back up the asser-
tion or have a dozen on my neck as it would
be difficult to make a man prove such a negative
statement ill put it this way what military ma-
neuver did he originate

as schoolboys we learned that the spartans
originated the phalanx also that rameses
the great seventeen centimes before christ was
the first man recorded by authentic history to col-
lect discipline and maneuver large bodies of men as
an army egypt consequently was first to lead
in the art of making war the army depended upon
its archers afoot in chariots and in a lesser degree
cavalry the regiments were early divided into
battalions and companies a phalanx of twelve
men deep was used they were directed by
trumpet and drum professor john lord states
that in defensive and offensive warfare in disci-
pline and construction of military engines their
work was scarcely improved upon by greeks or
romans or even by europeans in the middle ages
the spartan phalanx was eight men deep philip
of macedon made it sixteen men deep and it was he
who introduced the large oval buckler and a heavier
spear the spears were twenty-four feet long
projecting eighteen feet beyond the front it was
philip who adopted the policy of standing armies
to replace militia he borrowed from epaminon-
das of thebes the idea of forming columns upon a
front less than the depth and applied it to the cav-
alry napoleon used the same tactics in his italian
campaign against the austrians

nphe roman soldier at his best was developed by
centuries of effort until the year  bc
only those strongly attached to the republic could
serve in the army the ten legions caesar used in

subduing gaul were not of italian origin what
new science or trick or tactics did he bring to
the battlefield he fought a primitive people
and was helped along to success because they were
divided into three parts

  anthony wayne equally strong in men and
similarly armed would have gone through caesars
legions like the center college eleven through a
squad of one-legged mendicants wayne was a
super-drill master and never did a brigadier plan an
assault more carefully or take greater risks lee
and his generals would have run circles around
caesars army stonewall jackson and his two-
footed cavalry would have him whipped on front
and flanks before caesar knew what was happening
to him grant would have broken his neck
froude and others have whitewashed and calcimined
caesar and tooted his horn so loudly and other his-
torians have followed suit in a lesser degree so persis-
tently that the name of caesar for centuries has
been a fetich much of it is bunk pure and
simple

  in caesars time the armies were filling up with
mercenaries and no army can be great per se that
will sell itself to the highest bidder imagine such
fighting material stacking up against the spirit of
america as shown at bunker hill and more notably
at valley forge

hphe iroquois conquered as much if not more
country than did rome the highest estimate
of the iroquois forces is  men seldom if ever
did so many of the five nations take the field
from maine to the black hills in south dakota
as far south as the tennessee river they imposed
their will and the most wonderful part of it is
that they had peace inside the league whether
a people were exterminated or absorbed there was
peace they won no victories by bribing traitors
they lost no peace by traitors their federal
confederacy is the model after which our republic
wittingly or otherwise was formed when the war-
riors took a red path there was no intrigue and
double-crossing back home i maintain that the
iroquois plane of culture and civilization was
far superior to that of the roman empire which
bred imbecile rulers and apparently liked them that
way there was an idea back of the iroquois
league which is not found in the topsy-turvy cen-
turies of treachery and political graft and intrigue
which characterized the empire

as an example of the wrong way to do it rome is
entitled to a place in our school histories but lets
have done with parroting of eulogies and encomi-
ums lets teach the youngsters that no nation
without national ideals for wholesale betterment
can live lets not perpetuate the tradition that
one must lead off with caesar in naming the greatest
of military heroes lets anticipate the time when
children will be taught to name washington lee
grant and their famous brigadiers when caesar
won at thapsus africa and lost only fifty men
while slaying ten thousand he won no great military
victory he just happened upon a soft thing
a set-up at petra in  bc pompeius had caesar
spiled for all time but paused to celebrate and let
him get away

  and why not tell the youngsters when they read
about the appian way that the inca under greater
difficulties built as good probably better roads
io

adventure

also that the iroquois were greater military leaders
far superior as rulers and along with other red
nations produced as great orators as organizers
either pontiac or tecumseh had it over caesar el
als like ringling brothers ten had qesars
cohorts brought a fight to the home of the iroquois
the cohorts would have died in their harness
with all best wishes and for the truth in so far as
we can get it about the original vice kid-
hugh pen

ne from h g patterson who while
he does not agree with mr mundy on
various scores is not in the habit of swal-
lowing accepted history whole and without
doing some thinking and investigating of
his own

russellville tennessee

  the editor and talbot mundy deliver a rather
free discourse on the unreliability of accepted
history with a big h i imagine pendexter and
lamb would agree with you since i was con-
vinced long before i suppose we can call in unani-
mous	

  there is one thing however that we must not
overlook in the matter if we go to our children
with all our doubts various views and contradic-
tions they would probably not get started on any
history so i believe we have to work that study just
like we would orthodox religion get them oriented
properly rouse their interest then they can look up
the loose threads themselves

t do not know where mundy gets his material

  about julius caesar caesar has never been a
special study of mine not from lack of interest but
because my line of research jumps beyond that time
and we can not take in too much territory how-
ever there are some things about caesar which came
into my studies as a by-product

  	i do not believe he slew three million men in
battle or anything like it that was about the ex-
tent of the entire gallo-belgic population

  	for some reason and possibly correct he is
rated a military man of the first class but i can not
find any record of his ever being in a mans-size
pitched battle military history is part of my line
pharsalia was big only in results with pompey dead
on his feet and his soldiers fighting as a swarm and
not in large units so far as any one knows for
certain the gauls seemed to fight only as mobs

  	i dont think csesar ever regarded himself in
the light we shine on him although he considered
himself first in rome later propaganda gave him
the hoist how come

  he was the starting point of the emperorsof old
rome hence the greater julius caesar was that
much greater was their reflected glory later came
constantine and the popes christian but deriving
their worldly authority by inheritance from julius
caesar then came the holy roman empire
charlemagne otto frederic barbarossa charles
fifth innumerable popes religion and government
were synonymous all claiming inherited authority
from julius caesar just think of fifteen hundred
years of propaganda from emperor and pope they
might fight each others authority but never in-
herited authority of julius caesar

   	in regard to caesars treatment of captives and

women especially it was only the custom of the
times neither better nor worse than the others

pros of samothrace and a secret knowledge
in general i was in hopes when i faced the
east that there might be an inner knowledge
among some people but i did not find it although
what i found might be of use with information from
a separate source

  the yogi philosophy is an interesting study along

babylon long island

  as for caesar my minds wide open i consider
mundy overdoes what a lawyer would call a good
case caesar was cruel selfish and epileptic he was
lustful he may have been a degenerate in this
connection remember the roman biographers were
often partisan likewise the world had different
moral standards then-jesus christ drank and en-
joyed alcohol but he was a great man mundy
sneers at his luck well one lesson ive learned in
my life is that no man succeeds continually by luck
once in a while yes but not always caesar was
a consummate soldier if nothing else and he seems
to have envisaged the world state which rome ulti-
mately became

and this brings me to the most unsound of
mundys animadversions in his camp-fire
note his wholesale denunciation of rome it
sounds like the round condemnations of everything
german we used to get several years ago i call it
ridiculous by its lack of restraint rome wrought
evil yes it also wrought good despite the
peculiar failings of romans as individuals and as a
people the world actually progressed under the
empire and the best evidence of that is the utter
failure of civil forces which followed the empires
collapse

  mind you im not going to make mundys mis-
take and give rome a clean slate but let me sug-
gest that any fair-minded man do this read up on
the history of any of the empires preceding rome or
contemporaneous with rome then say whether
the world would have done better given all the cir-
cumstances of the times the state of human society
the extent of human knowledge under any other
known power carthage no the hellenistic
empires in asia minor and egypt no the
persian or other asiatic monarchies no the
greeks i dont think so in recent years we have
learned more about the utter depravity of the greek
decadence a decadence much more sinister than
that of rome certainly in caesars time

hphe charge of materialism falls of its own weight

     unfortunately the great majority of people in
this world can only be swayed by materialism
we have to work with the tools available so did
the camp-fire



the romans whats more they didnt turn the
world into materialistic channels it was there
already and another thing theres a lot of bunk
about mysteries of course its perfectly fair for
mundy to exploit em for story-purposes but hes
simply using his imagination when he hooks up
druids with samothrace etc the mystery which
really became worldwide was the mithraic and that
was a religion as well as a mystery with a special
appeal to men none of those old mysteries with
a wide appeal reckoned on women to any extent-
which is an indication of their essential limitation
i underscore wide to save myself from being
jumped on because of the lewd greek mysticism
which never reached western europe

tpo sum up if there is any great plan in this
universe of ours it is manifest that rome had
a definite part in it for rome laid the groundwork
of the world we know and personally however
dissatisfied i am with this world i refuse to believe
it should be scrapped for its shortcomings the
chart of human endeavors shows a steady upcurve
from the first glint of reason amongst the stone
age folk occasionally it dips down for a generation
or an eon but it always climbs up again and its
progress upward was as steady under romes do-
minion as in any other prolonged period men had
much to wish for as we have but they were as a
whole better off than they had been if there were
few great thinkers education was more widely dis-
persed than it had ever been so widely dispersed
that it was able to survive the dark ages and the
jealous ignorance of the early christian priests
no i wouldnt say rome thwarted human progress
or aborted mans happiness-arthur d howden
smith

mr smiths letter was one of the first
sent on to mr mundy so that the
latter might have his chance to answer in
rebuttal and elicited a direct reply mr
mundy will be given opportunity later to
make general blanket reply in defense of
his theories meanwhile his reply to mr
smith is given here after reading it you
will at least credit him with having done a
great deal of research before forming
opinions of his own i wonder whether
all who attack his views have done as
much

point loma california

    the difficulty of answering mr smith lies chiefly
in the fact that he offers me so many openings
however to begin with caesars luck i am accused
of sneering at it caesar boasted of it so incessantly
that one cant rightly ignore it all the world in
caesars day regarded him as lucky and undoubt-
edly he was whoever opposed him had to take
that luck of his into consideration and for tros to
have disregarded it or not to have discussed it
when advising those who had to resist caesars inva-
sion would have been simply foolish i believe
that nowhere either in these tros stories or in
camp-fire have i even hinted that caesar was not
a man of marvelous ability although he made some

incredibly crass mistakes of judgment as for in-
stance with his fleet

tid caesar envisage a world state i doubt it

   his own excuse that he gave for invading
britain was that he wanted pearls to make a breast-
plate for the venus genetrix in rome one ac-
count describes him when in spain as weeping be-
cause although in early middle life he had not yet
begun to emulate alexander who conquered the
world in his youth he was murdered mainly to
prevent his project of invading asia for which he
was preparing unheard of armaments with the aid
of cleopatras money cleopatra was in rome at
the time of his death she was occupying his trans-
tiberene villa and although caesar was living with
his own roman wife at the time he already had a
son by cleopatra and there is at least good ground
for believing he intended to make cleopatra em-
press of the world-ie that she should share his
throne

thpilepsy does not make high character ask
any doctor immorality of the type that
caesar practised wholly undermines sanity any
one who doubts this should consult the medical
officers of a few lunatic asylums it is quite true
that roman historians were addicted to reporting
malicious scandal and that a very great deal of
what they wrote either for or against any well
known individual will not bear scrutiny but even
baring-gould caesars stoutest advocate has to
admit that caesar was sexually vicious even after
making all possible discounts for gossip and the
accepted standards of his generation

tt was octavian augustus who visualized the

    roman empire really founded it and made its
survival for several centuries possible julius
caesar was an intellectual giant a prodigious cynic
a genius if you like the term who saw the possi-
bility of making himself master of the world and
who knew that nine-tenths at least of the men
opposed to him were fools he was an expert in
psychology and perfectly understood the trick of
magnanimity never being cruel for the sake of
cruelty itself but preferring to be spectacularly gen-
erous to use his own phrase he punished ill-will
not the deed but on the other hand he was not
particularly fond of referring to the sixty thousand
gauls a year whom he sold into slavery in order to
accumulate money for his campaigns and defray
his personal debts he was the most extravagant
wastrel of other peoples money of whom we have
any record

    caesar was beyond all doubt a genius he recog-
nized himself as such and had such a perfect con-
tempt for men of lesser intellectuality that for in-
stance when one of his generals deserted to pom-
peys side at the beginning of the civil war he sent
the mans baggage after him he despised pompey
-understood his weakness of character perfectly-
gave him all the time he wanted in which to under-
mine his own position-and then smashed him

hthe commonest mistake made in connection with
roman history is to suppose that caesar found-
ed the roman empire he did nothing of the kind
prior to his day and until his death rome was an
abominable welter of vulgarity corruption murder
rioting malaria chicanery and vice there was not
adventure

one admirable feature in its government which
amounted to nothing else than mob law the con-
dition lent itself to cassarism the word exactly de-
scribes what caesar had in mind and what he did
he had the genius to recognize his opportunity and
the strength of personality to put his will into reflect
but would a genuine hero have built to himself a
temple in rome-deified himself-have appointed
priests to sacrifice to him-have coined the famous
veni vidi vici phrase after a victory that was in-
significant compared to many he had won would
he have executed vercingetorix would he have
out-corrupted as caesar admittedly did even the
election-riggers of his generation such a man was
not in the same class with washington or lincoln
nor even with napoleon bonaparte

vtr smiths assertion that the charge of
materialism against rome falls of its own
weight simply takes my breath away has he ac-
cepted the cut-and-dried judgment of the text-books
that were inflicted on us when he and i were boys at
school prior to octavian the emperor augustus
romes politics religion aims and methods were so
utterly swinish that the closest search discovers no
trace of anything except materialism that is a tall
statement i admit but let some one produce evi-
dence to the contrary remember the pigs can be
brave i say nothing against the bravery of a cer-
tain class of roman soldiers

  certainly rome did not invent materialism but
by caesars time she had raised it to a policy which
caesar carried to the wth degree octavian au-
gustus foresaw founded disciplined and schooled
the roman empire and in doing so he and tiberius
after him incorporated into it what finally killed
rome herself nerva trajan hadrian and the
antonines strove almost as mightily sis he did to
purge the materialism that they recognized and
loathed but it was augustus treatment of the
provinces that made decent living possible outside
of rome with the result that the great majority of
statesmen artists poets legislators after his day
were foreign bom romes civilization was in the
provinces which throve in spite of her and finally
destroyed the roman system

arthage may have been no better than
rome but we have to trust to roman histo-
rians for accounts of carthage do we accept say
mr creels account of germany-or the bolshevic
governments official valuation of the ethics and
condition of the united states greece produced
pythagoras plato socrates eschylus and others
but she failed them and she fell when she ignored
her teachers the higher they rise the harder they
fall and greece has not recovered yet of persia
as a contemporary of rome we have not much
record except such as was written by her enemies
however she was sufficiently wile to defeat rome
repeatedly and thoroughly and from the treatment
that crassus received we may judge that even the
larthians despised romes lust for money

  of india rather more is known there was a
constant flow of pilgrims into india to study at the
feet of indias philosophers out of india came
buddhism which carried peace the arts kindliness
and spiritual thinking it survived a great deal
longer than did romes iron rule chinas civiliza-
tion so much higher than romes that no compari-
son is possible endured for two thousand years

based on the teachings of lao tse confucius and
buddha the first and the last taught spiritual
thinking positively the second implicitly and the
three became blended into one philosophy whose re-
sults exceeded anything that later history can show

tto say as mr smith does that the great ma-
jority of the people in this world can only be
swayed by materialism is stark nonsense lao
tse confucius and buddha swayed four hundred
millions of chinese the gautama buddhas teach -
ing spread from end to end of asia and changed it
out of recognition it survives today as a living force
in the world it was the basis of the original chris-
tian teachings jesus christ whom mr smith
compares with caesar was surely hardly a material-
ist yet not without a certain influence

  if anything is dear to one who really studies
history instead of parroting the jargon of the politi-
cians text-books it is that civilization declines into
savagery exactly in proportion to the inroads of
materialism and that savagery yields to civilization
only in response to spiritual impulse the deca-
dence of art the beginnings and the progression of
anarchy the degradation of morals the increase of
cruelty can in every instance be traced to the ac-
ceptance of material standards-generally notice-
able first in the increasing craving after wealth
no savagery can be found anywhere in the world
remnants of the stone-age not excluded that does
not show unquestionable traces of an antecedent
civilization the course of history runs in cycles
descending as spirituality lessens and materiality
increases then in course of time ascending out of
materiality into another golden age

m r smith is totally at sea about the myster-
ies by the time of pythagoras who was
taught in india the mysteries had ceased to exer-
cise much outward influence on the world they had
become popular with the result that their interpre-
tation had been vulgarized and very few remained
whose character enabled them to penetrate to the
higher degrees and the inner teachings the school
of pythagoras was an effort to stem the advancing
tide of materialism that culminated in the debauch
of rome just as neo-pythagoreanism neo-plato-
nism stoicism and even epicureanism were efforts
of the same sort made in rome herself but they
were efforts none the less from outside rome not
due to her own genius but aimed against her
materialism

  mr smith refers to mithraism which by the
way ran a very close race with christianity as
having been a religion as well as a mystery does
he suppose the other vastly higher mysteries were
not religious they were wholly so it was when
their followers attempted to materialize them
mainly along the line of adopting them as state
religions that they fell on evil days and almost but
not quite vanished from the earth that they did
not reckon on women to any extent to quote
mr smith again is totally untrue-as untrue as
that freemasonry does not reckon on women
although it does not admit women to membership
and for perfectly valid reasons that have nothing to
do with womens fitness or unfitness for spirituality
mithraism with its blood-rites was by far the most
materialistic of all the mysteries hence its popu-
larity and hence its disappearance in competition
with christianity which did not permit blood-rites
the camp-fire

in theory though its record due to materialistic in-
terpretation of the teachings has been the bloodiest
of all not one excluded

tt would be interesting to know just where mr

  smith obtained his information about the druids
and why he thinks i relied only on my imagination
when i linked them up with samothrace even in
the days of pythagoras the outward influence of
samothrace had begun to wane but things are not
invariably what they seem if mr smith or any
one has proof that the secret hierarchy of samo-
thrace had no connection with the druids in caesars
or at any other time it would give me a peculiar
satisfaction to be supplied with it meanwhile i
would like to point out the probability to put it
mildly that the most highly educated scientific ex-
perts in the known world would at least know as
much about one another as today for instance a
thirty-third degree freemason would know about
the grand orient

   caesar representing materialism did his utmost to
smash druidism by slaying its adherents and black-
ening the reputations of its hierarchy just as it has
always been the way of the advocates of iron
tyranny to smash or to discredit spiritual move-
ments but in spite of caesars unsupported ac-
count of the druids they had an extraordinary repu-
tation even in rome see diodorus siculus they
the druids speak the language of the gods he
speaks of them also as exhorting combatants to
peace and taming them like wild beasts by en-
chantment diogenes laertius says they taught
men to worship the gods to do no evil and to ex-
ercise courage also they taught many things
regarding the stars and their motions the extent of
the universe and the earth and the nature of
things and the power and the might of the im-
mortal gods says even caesar their detractor
strabo speaks of their teaching in moral science
says lucan and ye ye druids to you only is
given knowledge or ignorance whichever it be of
the gods and the powers of heaven    from you
we learn that the bourne of mans ghost is not the
senseless grave not the pale realm of the monarch
below diodorus testifies that among them the
druids the doctrine of pythagoras prevailed
compare this with mr smiths contention that
the druids knew nothing about samothrace

  but again says valerius maximus they the
druids would fain make us believe that the souls
of men are immortal i would be tempted to call
these breeches-wearers fools if their doctrine were
not the same as that of the mantle-clad pythagoras
other writers who refer to them in much the same
terms are timagenes strabo and mela iamblichus
makes the assertion that the druids did not learn
from pythagoras but pythagoras from them

domes greatest men all seem to have recog-
nized her materialism and to have fought
against it augustus himself an initiate of the
mysteries and others after him succeeded in making
a high state of civilization possible in many of the
provinces and waves of that civilization invaded
rome from time to time as christianity too did
in its turn but the tendency that caesar repre-
sented had taken too firm hold and rome cor-
rupted everything that touched her like the can-
cer that befouls all blood that comes in con-
tact with it

    personally think the world is on the up-
 grade though i know that many men of integrity
and education disagree from that optimistic opin-
ion there seems to be a kindliness abroad a
breaking up of standards that are proven false and a
craving for frankness there is no doubt in my
mind that the united states may if it cares to blaze
a new trail in the history of mankind i think that
is its destiny which it would hardly be possible to
prevent but it is perfectly clear that material-
ism will make a hard fight and that if we adopt mr
smiths theory that the great majority of people
in the world can only be swayed by materialism
we shall find ourselves in our efforts to progress in
the predicament of the ambitious gentleman who
tried to lift himself upstairs by the seat of his pants
if we let rome set our standards of attainment and
of morality and method we shall do as rome did
fall as rome fell and perhaps like rome be taught
from text-books to the helpless youth a dozen cen-
turies from now with a result that staggers ones
imagination to predict unless by grace of some new
inspiration they should merely point to us as an
amazing bad example and pass on-to study china
in her golden age yours faithfully and friendly-
talbot mundy

  well weve had a look at caesar from
quite a number of points of view there
seems plenty of ground for honest differ-
ence of opinion but not much ground for
snap judgment caesar will not be with us
at our next camp-fire but at some later
one arthur g brodeur of the university of
california and of our writers brigade has
some things to say about the great roman
and mr mundy must be given his chance to
answer the arguments of those who have
taken the field against him in this matter
he has already replied to arthur d howden

a trip in south africa

good climate good hunting and lots
of scenery

  request-my husband and i are very fond of
taking camping trips in out-of-the-way places and
seeing country that tourists do not go into we
have been over most of our own country in the west
and also in canada newfoundland and labrador

  is it feasible to take such a trip in africa and yet
not run any great danger from fever and the tsetse
fly also not be frightfully hot

  i have read keables mother of all living and
in that he describes a camping triprinto the moun-
tains of southeast africa that sounds delightful
i have also read the trip from cairo to capetown
in the last national geographic it sounds tre-
mendously interesting but not so enjoyable

  is it possible to get good hunting and not go into
the fever districts what is the best time of year
to go could you give me any ideas for an interest-
ing and pleasant trip in africa

  we want a trip for pleasure and do not want to
be eaten alive by mosquitoes or simply melted with
heat and yet we do not want to get away from
civilization and we love really roughing it and are
not tenderfeet i have been in a great many places
no other woman has ever been so the trip doesnt
have to be very easy

  i will be grateful if you can give me this informa-
tion or tell me where i can get it-mrs ethel
cutler freeman morristown n j

  reply by captain franklin-i am very glad to
receive your letter of a few days ago as it is just the
kind that we of the ask adventure class like to
receive

  in the beginning i will say that your letter will
not be published in adventure without your consent
at the same time we like to see inquiries of the nature
of yours published as they prove to our readers
that we can do what we claim and that is to supply
authentic information pertaining to travel on any
part of the globe

  it is gratifying to me that after all your travels
you contemplate visiting south africa and i note
with pleasure that you have been in labrador where
i feel certain you have met my friend dr grenfell

  i will now endeavor to answer your letter very
fully south africa is the most fascinating and
alluring country in every way especially for people
like yourselves who have left the beaten paths and
made for the wide open spaces like panama the
danger of the tsetse fly malaria dysentery have been
almost completely eradicated and the climate of
south africa is such that you have no qualm of
encountering any such conditions as existed a dec-
ade ago

  i would like therefore to suggest to you an
itinerary starting say from america in march
which would give you the months of april may
june july august september and october with-
out encountering the really hot period which at its
worst doesnt amount to a lot in south africa be-
cause the heat is always a dry heat and except in
such places as portuguese east or natal does not
hurt you-would recommend that you first go to
cape town there are many hotels at which you
can stop and it is generally a matter of selecting a
hotel that ones friends on the boat are staying at

before deciding i would then plan to visit groote
schoor etc and a most interesting time can be
spent for a few days among the old vineyards of
cape town and vicinity i would then visit kim-
berly and see the diamond mines from there on
to johannesburg to see the gold mines pretoria
the capital of south africa for perhaps a day to see
the gold lace by that time you would probably
feel that you would like to spend a few days hunting

  adventure has a very strict rule that we shall not
recommend any guide philosopher or friend hotel
bar or such-like but synthetically i might men-
tion to you the name of mr t e brent mount
silinda mount setter district southern rhodesia
mr brent-can show you the finest hunting in south
africa at less expense than any man of whom i
know he is not a professional guide but is willing
to take care of a few people who may from time to
time be sent him you can go through territory
practically untouched by the ordinary hunter and
can get a bag of elephant lion buffalo hippo and
most of the lesser antelope

  after your game-hunting experience you would be
very close to beira in portuguese east africa and
from there i would suggest that you take the boat
to durban natal should you so desire i can route
you through zululand which would be intensely
interesting thence into basutoland where one of my
brothers resides who could show you the interior
life and customs of these very remarkable people

  i could also give you many other itineraries some
far more expensive than the foregoing but for a real
pleasure trip at a minimum expense i doubt if this
can be beaten

 ment editors and the exact field cov-
 ered by each section are given in

mexican oil-fields

tampico where jobs are few prices
high and the climate poor

  request-please give me all possible information
on the part of mexico which you cover mainly in
and around tampico and mazatlan

  what oil companies and other american busi-
nesses are in the city of tampico living conditions
climate business and general conditions for ameri-
cans what chance is there in tampico or mazat-
lan for a young man who is an all around automobile
mechanic and driver one who speaks spanish

  do oil and other industries there use many cars and
trucks what are the names and addresses of
mining companies in your field please do not use
my name if this is printed i enclose stamp and
envelope addressed for reply thank you-
- glen wood springs colo

  reply by mr mahaffey-there are no oppor-
tunities for you in or around mazatlan and you
would be doing a very foolish thing in going there
i was there for over a year and am thoroughly con-
vinced of the fact
adventure

  there are two parts of tampico one is a regular
mexican town and the american part of tampicois
a regular american city in the midst of mexico
tampico is or was the most expensive place to live
in that one could find in many long moons and any
one who goes there should take enough money to
support him a month or so and a return ticket home

  time was in the good old days when most any-
body could get a good job around the oil fields but
those days are gone now of course there is a
limited amount of drilling but chances are far from
being as good as they were nowadays with the
new immigration law in the u s mexico is full of
foreigners who want to come to the u s and plenty
of them are working for less than an american
would consider just to get by

  it would take me a whole day to tell you all about
tampico i hardly know where to start

  the many oil companies have trucks for hauling
and you might make it the laws of mexico require
that you have  in gold on your person if you
enter mexico looking for work and you will need a
passport secured through the nearest federal
court or state naturalization court takes about
three weeks to get and costs ten dollars you will
need the visfi of the nearest mexican consul another
ten bucks and eight dollars head tax when you
cross the line twenty-eight dollars all told plus
your fare and the  in gold

  climate around tampico is none too good i
know many who lost their health there and were
chuck full of malaria germs wages are a little
better than in the u s but living expenses are
higher in my opinion you are better off in the
states it has been a long time since i was around
tampico and conditions have changed for the worst
since then

  you might go to beaumont or port arthur
texasm and strike the magnolia or texas companies
for a job in tampico it will do no good to give you
address as you should be on the ground to have a
chinamans chance for a job nowdays there are a
great many young fellows drifting around in mexico
and most of them are on the bum mexico is one of
the finest places i know of to stay away from at
present if you still have the idea about going
write me and i will try to put you wise

  request- am to state my case briefly an office
man and have been for many years and naturally
my work is rather confining and the hours that i
work do not give me much of an opportunity to get
the necessary out-door exercise to keep my physical
condition fit there is nothing constitutionally or
organically wrong in my case with the exception
that i am very much under-developed in the muscles
of the chest arms and shoulders i have forgotten
to state before that i am twenty-eight years of age

  i am interested particularly to know if you can
recommend any exercise or series of exercises by
which i can develop these under-developed muscles

  i do not know whether you give individual advice
in these cases but if you dont please pardon me for
taking so much of your valuable time i enclose
stamped envelop with return postage for a reply

  thank you for any information you may care to
give me-f s williams new orleans la

  re plyby dr fordyce-i know you can improve
your health and secure real development of the chest
and muscles byjwalking two miles a day in the open
air start easy with a half mile if necessary and
gradually daily increase

  it will take only an hours time when you get
under way and can be done after the evening meal if
necessary

  coupled with this i would at bedtime carry out
religiously some system of exercise such as walter
camps daily dozen full directions for these
are in booklet form together with some excellent
health-building advice and may be secured for c
in stamps from the reynolds pub co  west
th st new york city

  i would be pleased to know of your results after
trial

living in chinese treaty ports

  how white men get along

  request-for various reasons i am going to
reverse horace greeleys famous saying into go
east young man go east i have picked out
china could you answer the following questions

  	do oil companies or any other industrial con-
cerns pick out and train their men in this country
sending them to china or do they get them right
on the ground

  	if employees are selected in this country to
what companies and at what address should i apply
which would be preferable-oil mining or com-
mercial houses at this point let me explain that
i would best be fitted for the sales or office work

  	what are the chances for advancement in that
field is competition as keen as in this country

  	if there is a contract what are the terms

  	are married or single men given preference

  	briefly what is the social status of white men
and the standards of living

  	do you know how the salaries run are men
paid in gold if not how far would the rate of
exchange affect salary

  	what would be best to take along in the line
of equipment such as clothing and other personal
belongings which could be purchased more cheap-
ly and easily here-s c eastwood phila-
delphia pa

  reply by mr halton-  the standard oil
co sends men out to china write them at 
broadway new york stating fully your qualifica-
tions you might also write to the pacific mail
ss co  california st san francisco calif
and to the admiral line l c smith building
seattle wash stating fully your qualifications for
an office job

  	the chances for advancement are good if one
sticks on the job and the competition will be from
your fellow employees

  	you would be required to sign a contract for
two or three years and of course the pay will
depend on the position you hold

  	do not know that any preference is shown as
between single and married men at the starting
salary single men can get along better

  	the standard of living is on a plane with that
of the white man in this country as also is the social
life that is of course in the treaty ports there
are very few places in the interior where a white
man would not have to rough it considerably

  	clerks are paid around  gold per month
or with exchange around fifty per cent about 
mex per month the question of exchange is
serious as it fluctuates from day to day in accordance
with the price of silver the lower it goes the more
mexican dollars or local currency you get and the
higher the fewer some of the firms pay in local
currency so that the fluctuations do not affect much
unless you are buying gold it is the general rule
that when exchange is low the merchants who buy
in europe or america have to pay in sterling or
gold and as they have to pay more mexican dollars
it naturally raises the price of commodities in local
currency to the local purchaser and usually when the
exchange raises the merchants are not quick to
reduce prices

  	shoes are the principal item of clothing to take
along nearly everything else can be purchased
cheaper and better out there

 prospecting by airplane

heres a new field for the up-to-the-
minute gold-hunter

  request-are there any opportunities in the
mining game where airplanes could be used are
there known ore bodies unworked because supplies
can not be brought in or ore taken out

  we are expert airplane men-eight of us we
have seven ships including four that will carry four
to six passengers each our ceiling is around

	feet our normal field is  yards although
we can make up-hill landings down-hill take-offs
or work on a ridge say twenty feet wide a loose
sand will not stop us-sand say that would almost
stop a car our normal cruising range is two hun-
dred and fifty miles although larger tanks could be
put in we can work on snow or ice-pick fields
from the air drop a man with a parachute to clear
away light trees if necessary we have parachutes
and cameras-but not much cash

  we figure our cost about fifty cents per mile
including salaries depreciation etc

  are there any known inaccessible but commercial-
ly profitable ore bodies we could tackle the loca-
tion description of ore description of near-by land-
ing fields altitude description of country is desired

  it might be possible in a very rough country to
pick up small loads ten pounds without landing
and on some favorable days with a forty mile wind
it might be possible to pick up a passenger from a
ridge on the fly or it may be that there is some
country it would be worth while exploring which is
at present judged inaccessible

  i have had a couple of years college geology out-
side of that we know nothing about mining how
about looking for some of the famous lost mines

  is there something along these lines it would pay
us to tackle with one airship or more or is it all a
fairy dream any information will be appreci-
ated-merrill k riddick lancaster pa

  reply by mr v shaw-you present an interest-
ing subject and one that is worth considerable
thought and discussion i believe ive given it
some of the thought already there are many
localities so isolated that the costs of transportation
preclude any development of ore bodies except very
rich gold which would be bonanzas if near a rail-
road if planes could transport machinery and

carry out copper matter or concentrates in sufficient
amounts the matter might bear consideration

  as to prospecting and discoveries that are new
because of difficulty in traveling afoot there are
many spots among the high sierras and back inland
in such countries as this for example you cant
get up most of these rivers after april or at least
early may because they are too swift also the
terrane is so heavily timbered and undergrowth so
dense that ordinary travel is impeded to the extent
that little or no prospecting has been done here off
the main water courses or back from tide water
beaches and lakes

  if you have a hydroplane in which landings can
be made anywhere on water you could work with
your chart and make landings on lakes inlets bays
etc that perhaps are inaccessible now at least re-
garding the inland lakes also you could explore
cliffs and hills above timberline that can not and
have not yet been reached

  this however would be only for plainly visible
white quartz veins dykes of quartzite or light
granites and pegmatite or marked contacts and
changes of formation this last is important in
this region the valuable minerals are all located at
or close to these contacts and prospecting is re-
stricted by experts to these areas entirely

  if you had as an observer a qualified geologist
or engineer he could with a glass plainly mark such
at quite a distance and by flying within fifty feet
he could verify his suspicions this country is so
intersected by lakes bays and inlets etc that you
could almost always figure on landing fairly close
on water then camp and make your way afoot to
the place

  there are here and there all over these hills open
muskeg covered with spongy moss into which your
feet will sink just above the sole whether you
could effect a landing is an open question or whether
youd find one of these where youd need it

  the topography is much broken steep hills
average around  feet all timbered from tide
water the timberline here is i believe around

	feet altitude you could make landings on
beaches here and there that have fine quartz sands
and would be well within your field of  yards
but the average beach is pretty well strewn with
rocks from as large as your head and down and
with boulders here and there that are much bigger

colorado above timberline would be pickings
for your plane but your landings problematical
unless you had a hydroplane and then not certain
of finding water where you wished to descend the
desert regions would in general be ok for you can
always find long open sand stretches of level charac-
ter you could fortify yourself with charts giving
all the water holes for your camps and the lack or
sparsity of timber would make your work more
simple

  i should say offhand that desert prospecting by
airplane would be rather worth trying and because
mighty unique would probably give you a whole
bunch of press notices you know the border
patrols on the mexican line are not having so much
trouble even when making forced landings or so i
am informed here in alaska dropping a man to
clear out timber would be putting him in a hole-
he might drop right on top of a grizzly whose break-
fast had been poor or set wrong and if the way was
clear hed have trees to clear measuring feet through
i

adventure

and hundreds high and an all summers job alone
simply cutting and not moving the stuff wind
here is fairly steady for days in one direction but
so many hills youd have a lot of upcasts holes cross
currents etc to contend with we have a hydro-
plane here in town in a hangar but it has not flown
this year though it has been flying previously with
what success i cant say curious passengers taken
up mostly i hear population here only  so
nothing in that for you chaps

pxploring is where you could shine-if your
flame wasnt extinguished too soon the huge
areas around the mackenzie river for instance
would give you a fine field as there is oil there 
or the interior of labrador or newfoundland inland
in baja california or tiburon id the inaccessible
peaks of western mexico the san bias country etc
and you can use your atlas and imagination for a
hundred more i know of buttes in colorado that
no man ever set foot on because their slopes are too
steep from any sort of climbing the inacessible
ore bodies however would be impractical unless you
could assure getting in machinery and taking out
the product in freight planes the mere finding of
ore would profit nothing of course

  the headwaters of the peace river b c from
the junction of the findlay and parsnip up to the
northerly and westerly are known to be gold-bearing
but have been run over some you could land there
most anywhere and your distance from gas would
be perhaps  miles airline the region to the
north of the yukon also might present possibilities
for it is tough going afoot or by dogteam or canoe
and the chances are fair for gold deposits your
distance from gas there would be greater use a scale
on the map to fairbanks dawson or nome for-
get those famous lost mines-nothing in it for
any one unless it is some of the old ones formerly
worked by the spanish in old mexico

  i like to fool with your idea its mightly interest-
ing hence this long screed but in a sense youd be
pioneering and its something for you to try out
you cant be sure till you do for cash you might
select some feasible scheme work out the details
then put the proposition up to some wealthy sports-
man with guts who might take a chance for the
novelty of it if you have more ideas along this line
let me hear from you again and the best to you
always in any case

  your premier and final assault on this country
thus far has my sympathy these are smooth
waters from the deck of the northwestern queen or
admiral watson but the tide rips are hungry the
winds uncertain and ravenous at times and the
rocks are always there for even the larger boats
youve got to be pretty expert as a sailor and know
this coast blamed well then have plenty lady luck
at command to get by year after year old-time
salmon trollers in thirty foot gas boats go out and
once in a while never come back and sourdough
prospectors as well not all of them being killed by
siwashes or she-bears with cubs as has been
the case hereabout within comparatively short
while

  im knocking wood all the time and when i am
trout fishing for a change of diet i always have my
 winchester strapped to my back with a slipknot
i can loosen in short order if the weather looks
uncertain i have lots of real urgent business in
campl ive seen the wind cut the tops off the waves

even in sheltered inlets and hurl it fifty feet in the
air in a blinding mist and these waves can get their
backs up in a few minutes time too luck and

south atlantic islands

barren bleak and desolate

  request-i am writing you for information to
check up a report i have received from a man who
wants to interest me in a trip to these places

  it is in regards to gough island about  s lat
in the south atlantic

  about how large is this island is it low and
sandy or high and rocky who does it belong to
what kind of people live there how about the
climate and forest etc is it possible that as this
man says there is a smaller island some six hundred
miles east and a little north of there that has no
name on the charts

  also please give me some information on these
following crozet islands prince edward marion
kerguelen

  also the population as near as you know it and
about fishing hunting and climate of each

  thanks for the attention you give this-joe m
knutson toledo o

  reply by capt dingle-you have selected about
the most worthless bits of rock it is possible to find
that is from the point of view of a possible settler
i am sorry that i have no means at hand of giving
you very complete data on gough island my
reference books are in bermuda and my own experi-
ence was simply passing by gough when it seemed
to be a barren rocky waste and then it was unin-
habited you can get information about gough
island by writing to the hydrographic office u s
navy washington d c

  i can tell you abut the other islands you
name

  prince edward island belonging to great britain
a rocky uninhabited island sometimes visited by
sealers lava formation and snow capped always
nothing grows except coarse grass and a plant called
kerguelen cabbage penguins and seals are plenti-
ful

  marion island one of the so-termed prince ed-
ward group much the same as the other island
described above volcanic and barren there is
a sealers camp on the island but nobody lives
there

  the crozets are french and more desolate and
bleak than the rest i was on these islands for two
weeks once and if i had to choose between crozets
and-id hunt up my thin underwear and as-
bestos sandals without delay there is no popula-
tion the world will have to go crazier than it is
before there will be any however there is fresh
water and plenty of food of the seal and penguin
sort there is a cache of stores for ship-wrecked
castaways on hog island the climate weather
etc of the islands as of prince edward and marion
is cold and stormy with frequent fogs and icebergs
sail by gaily

  kerguelen land a big island almost seventy
miles each way in length and breadth is the only
place you name where human beings might thrive
in more or less comfort kerguelen is cold and
stormy but it is deeply indented by bays and there
is at least sustenance for sheep hogs and ponies
ask adventure

it was once a whale and sealing station but aban-
doned as such until recently the french govern-
ment made an arrangement with a norwegian whale
fishery and sea elephant hunters concern to work the
group

  this firm has a station in royal sound called
port jeanne darc also a frenchman named
rossicre has a lease on kerguelen and raises some
sheep and pigs at least bossiere was there a very
few years ago the place may be utterly deserted
again of course i speak of conditions in 

  i have no idea what you may think you could find
on these desolate hummocks of rock but i can as-
sure you there is nothing on any of them even
gough which would repay you for a trip without
quite big capital and a big outfit to hunt whale or
seal there is no wood on any of them and all
are bleak and forbidding gough is less desolate
perhaps but even that is only a fly speck on a chart
and has no attractions for human beings you can
get charts showing all these islands by asking when
you write to the hydrographic office mentioned
above for charts of the south atlantic and the
south indian ocean seventy-five cents each

 luck to you	

gun sights

phosphor bronze is the most dur-
able metal for this purpose

  request-being something of a gun crank my- x
self thought id drop in for a little chat also some
information

  in a recent issue of adventure you spoke about
your pet guns having gold brazed on the regular
sights what i wish to know is your method of
having the brazing applied

  do you cut away a small portion of the rear of the
front sight and have gold inserted as i have tried

to show in the accompanying illustration if not
would it be asking too much to have you make a
little sketch-h c gardner denver colo

  reply by mr wiggins-you have hit exactly
upon my method of having gold bead sights at-
tached to the revolver barrel i do as you describe
cut out the metal to form a support and have the
gunsmith braze in a bit of bright metal for which
he generally uses phosphor bronze a very durable
metal

  i never have a bead effect but a square blade the
undercutting of the bead seems to weaken the sight
and i have had many rifle sights of the gold bead
variety brought to me bent or even broken but
never one with a square blade and the rear of
the sight next the eye is on a slant from the eye
thus catching the light in any degree of illumination
or any angle of refraction

hiking in europe

cheap if you avoid the hotels de
luxe

  request-with a companion i am planning on
making a tour of germany this summer

  my partner is a chemist and somewhat of a
metallurgist and i am a printer and a newspaper
man and so would be interested in such as pertains
to our work electro-chemical plants newspapers
printing machinery and perhaps economical con-
ditions

  we intend to start from holland and head up
the rhine river country making a circle to the
south as conditions will permit as far as munich
after which we may proceed northeast to praha
dresden and danzig or to hamburg as we would
like to embark to scandinavia from either one of
these ports

  this tour is to be in the nature of a walking trip
and we would like to learn what you would consider
the best way to go about it what places you would
visit the amount of luggage necessary anything
which you would consider the best for us to do with
the least expense could you advise us as to the
fare from here to holland

  we are somewhat acquainted with the language
would it be possible for us to obtain employment
of any kind while there as we would like to make a
study of the various industries-e w swanson
cleveland calif

  reply by mr fleischer-to start from the be-
ginning i would say that the holland-american
line  state street new york city have a num-
ber of smaller steamers running to rotterdam on
which the one-class fare is in the neighborhood of
 however if you would like to work your way
over as workaway you would have to come to
new york and try the seamans institute on front
street they may be able to direct you to the
proper place where you could make inquiries

  in most of the german cities mentioned hereafter
and especially in the ruhr you will find quite a
number of plants which will come up to specifi-
cations i can not cite them here but i would sug
gest that you call on the american consul at koln-
if we still have one there i am not certain-and he
will gladly direct you

the following is my suggestion of an itinerary

  take train from rotterdam to wesel westphalia
germany from wesel you can follow the rhine
southward on excellent highways stop at duisburg
and make this city your headquarters for visiting
the various factories or plants in the ruhr which
will interest you then down the rhine via ducs-
seldorf koln bonn coblenz bingen to mainz in
all the places mentioned you will find smaller
hostelries which will afford you shelter and good
food for little money do not look for them in the
main streets however

  from mainz follow the river main eastward to
frankfort in that city you will find one of the
best if not the best german newspaper the
frankfurter zeitung from there through the
spessart forest to wuerzburg where you can taste
the best beer brewed then on to niirenberg if
you care to see munich go by rail from nuremberg
for foot travel in bavaria is at the present not to be
recommended
adventure

  from munich follow isar river northeast to
lanshut north to regensburg on the danube
see the valhall there then continue via falkenstein
wilting to fuerth fuerth is bavarian customs
center as is taus across the line in czecho-slovakia
from taus northeast via stankau to pilsen beauti-
ful highway through bohemian forest pilsen is an
industrial center you will find much of interest
there

  my advice is to take the railroad from pilsen as
far as beraun about fifty miles get off at that
place and follow the beraun river via karlstein
old castle to prague you havent seen europe
if you miss prague for it is the oldest center of
learning from prague take the dinky river
steamer on the moldau to melnik on the elbe river
then follow that stream northwest via leitmeritz
aussig bodenbach through the bohemian-saxon
switzerland as it is called into germany again
saxonia to dresden from there a walk to berlin
would be very uninteresting since the country is
flat there are good roads however if you want
to walk you can walk to either berlin hamburg
or danzig but it is some distance one way or the
other

  now as to outfit the usual american hikers
costume is advisable high laced walking-boots
knickers wool stockings and a pair of thick-soled
oxfords do not take any pack whatever but
when you get to germany buy yourself at little
cost a rucksack which is a triangular bag made of
strong cloth with shoulder straps which will hold
all you need a strong cane spiked can also be
cheaply purchased abroad if you feel the need of
an automatic you can buy one in germany and get
a permit at the same time i do not know how
much the permit will cost but it wont be
much

  you will do well to purchase a loaf of german
peasant bread cut it into halves and you and your
partner can carry a half in the pack together with
hard sausages for which westphalia is known these
rations will keep you during the day and you can
always get butter eggs etc as soon as you are out
of the industrial region at any one of the numerous
farms which dot germany you can even secure
lodging at very little cost

  as to employment i do not know germany has
also unemployment to contend with and i am afraid
that you would not find anything suitable except
perhaps that you might if you know german well
enough do translations for technical firms but
thats only a guess

  if you really mean to go and so have made up
your mind write me again when you are ready and
i will give you some letters of introduction to some
people who will help you over there

homesteading in colorado

    lots of land still available

  request-will you kindly send all of the neces-
sary information in regard to homesteading in colo-
rado

  what is the land best adapted to

  am especially interested in land west of the do-
lores river-a r cammack cincinnati o

  reply by mr middleton-there are something
like six million acres of land open to homestead en-

try in the state of colorado and about one third of
this lays in moffat and rio blanco counties in the
northwestern part of the state

  land in this territory is adapted to the raising of
small grains such as wheat oats barley rye etc
and alfalfa timothy and native hay vegetables
such as cabbage potatoes carrots beets onions
beans etc etc and in sheltered places the small
berries are raised even to strawberries also some
fruit these counties lay in the glenwood springs
land district and a letter addressed to walter spen-
cer state registrar glenwood springs colo will
bring results in the way of information as to land
now open to entry etc i should strongly advise
that you have a look at northwest colorado before
deciding upon settling elsewhere

  rio dolores river flows through the extreme
southwest part of the state land in this territory
lies in the durango land district i will not at-
tempt to advise you upon this part of the state as
it has been several years since i was there and there
have been changes down there i am sure there
are some  acres of land in this district open
to entry i advise that you address a letter to each
of the following addresses requesting that they mail
you literature on southwest colorado do not know
what the registrars name is at durango but a let-
ter just addressed to the state registrar at that ad-
dress will bring a reply

  i am enclosing a leaflet on homesteading that may
be of interest send for the leaflets mentioned they
will supply you with full information which i have
not the space for believe that the land office will be
able to fix you out this leaflet is intended for those
who have means and are desirous of bringing the
homestead to a self-sustaining basis as quickly as
possible many as you undoubtedly know start
on a very small scale and work on neighboring
ranches to provide themselves with funds for im-
provements

  here are the names of persons who will i am sure
be glad to furnish you with any information you
may request

  mr chas e hall secretary durango exchange
durango colo mr hall can furnish you with au-
thentic information as to all of the san juan basin
mr charles bear secretary dolores commercial
club dolores colo and mr f m shidler cham-
ber of commerce mancos colo then for litera-
ture on moffat county address a letter to mr w
p finley craig colo

  should you decide to have a look at northwest
colorado and i am quite sure you will not regret
having done so craig should be the best place for
you and may or june the best time to have the
look there is work to be had over there on ranches
or in the mines and ive an idea there will be an oil

excitment there next spring	

  hope that this will fix you out and if you think i
might be able to help any in the future come again

homesteading in portuguese east

    where you must have a working
capital of at least  to hope
for success

  request-i would like to have some information
regarding portuguese east africa and as you are
the only authority i know of i am coming to you
i intend to go down to africa and settle and i am
thinking about portuguese east

  how are living conditions down there is the
cost of living very high can land be had there for
a reasonable price how about homesteading is
the soil fertile how is the climate-is it healthy or
feverish

  what is the general topography of the country
near the coast is it high or lowland is it wooded
or open veld does it rain much or enough for crops
to grow what are the markets i am thinking
about the country near the port of beira-there
ought to be a good market there

  what are the immigration laws there will a
person have any difficulty in landing any certain
amount of money required what kind of money
is used and what is the rate of exchange would
 or  be enough to give me a start
i intend to go down there in april as i think that is
the best time now i hope you dont think i am
asking a lot of silly questions there may be some
important thing i have forgotten at that so please
give me all the information you can- c a
anderson los angeles cal

  reply by mr warring-i fearthat your capital
of  to  will not go very far in portuguese
east africa in establishing you in any form of agri-
culture

  however i will give you what information i can
the land laws have recently been changed and are
now as follows

  leases of lands for five year period the so-called
entrada are-

land adjoining railways  reis per hectare

five miles from a railway  reis per hectare

next to navigable rivers  reis per hectare

  along the sea-shore  reis per hectare

ten kilometers from rr  reis per hectare

  twenty kilometers and farther  reis per
hectare

  forty-five hundred reis are equal at the present
time to about  american money

  there are no free homesteads and all govern-
ment lands are leased as above as i understand it
the prices given above are not by the year but for
a five-year term

  settlers are going into the beira district more
freely of late especially germans and the prices of
both developed and undeveloped lands and farms
are likely to advance

  in general  may mention that the whole of east
africa tanganyika kenya uganda and portu-
guese east are making great progress more espe-
cially the first three

  coffee sisal flax sugar copra maize cotton
wheat oilseeds dairying and wool are the main
agricultural industries

  cost of living somewhat higher than in the u s
the savoy hotel at beira would charge you round
about  to  per day inclusive

  shipping and market facilities at beira are good
and are expanding

  immigration laws are sound you must have
 in your possession when landing

  i am enclosing printed matter dealing with the
remainder of your questions

  my personal opinion of the amount of capital you
should have to get a successful start in tropical
farming would be around  i have a friend
of mine in rhodesia which territory joins portu-
guese east africa who told me that  to -

	was the very least one should have

  you can not toil under the african sun as you
could in california in africa the black man does
that for you

  since you do not propose to go until april next i
will get in touch with some friends of mine in beira
and get the lay of the land for you if you change
your address let me know

floridas west coast

where to go and where to settle

  reqiiest-i would like to know something of the
coast below fort myers fla if it is livable and
settled to any extent

  i own ten acres at a place called river view about
nine miles up the river from fort myers i have
never developed this property though i have had it
for some years it faces on the riverfront and i
think under certain conditions is subject to over-
flow

  i rather think i would like to dispose of this
property and invest the money in some place where

	can build as near an ideal home as possible close
to water good grove soil good fishing

  i understand most of the development is at pres-
ent on the east coast would like your ideas as to
the most ideal location for such a home that could
be made with a moderate outlay of money

  i like the fort myers section but it has the dis-
advantage of being too far from any good beaches

  i wish to thank you in advance for your informa-
tion please do not publish my name- -

  reply by mr liebe-the coast below ft myers
is settled thinly there being few towns and those
very small down to marco which also is very small
marco is on a little island that is separated from the
mainland by less than a quarter of a mile of water
below marco there isnt very much of anything
but mangrove and mosquitoes a jumble of tiny is-
lands scrubby woods swamp etc

  i	dont know the particular place riverview you
mention but unless it is very low it should have ad-
vanced in value within the last year as for selling
it i cant help you there i rather think you
would either have to get hold of some reliable real
estate man or else come down and see to the selling
yourself

  it is a fact that most of the development down
here is on the east coast though all of florida is
growing if i were looking for an ideal spot for a
home i think i would pick on orlando eustis
or lakeland in central florida you would have
good water and comparative freedom from mos-
quitoes in any of the three towns named and on any
coast the water is bad and the mosquitoes ditto
water to drink here is mostly bought in bottles
central florida has as good hunting on an average
and better fishing unless you hire a cruiser and


adventure

go out to the gulf stream at from  to 
per day

  good coast towns in my opinion are sarasota
tampa and st petersburg on the west coast and
daytona melbourne and ft lauderdale on the
east coast

  as to the cost of building it would probably be a
little cheaper than in your present location since
houses need not be built so well owing to the mild
climate

  the east coast has of course the best beaches
notably those from palm beach north and espe-
cially those at daytona and new smyrna

  the thing for you to do unquestionably is to
come down here and dispose of your land and see
things for yourself and after more than six years
in florida i like the interior the center of the state
far better than any of the coast regions
