standard of the world is the feed-that vital part of
the fountain pen which is expected to work so that the
pen writes constantly and uniformly to the last drop

  in watermans ideal fountain pen it is made of solid
rubber flat and broad with capillary fissures and splits
sawed into it that secure a flow of ink that is automatic-
ally regulated by the act of writing

  this feed question is the rock upon which all other
makes have foundered whereas with the ideal this
proper feed principle has had the contrary effect

  the disadvantage -of slight overflow when almost
        empty still a common fault with
        any ordinary pen has been over-
        come by the spoon feed

           the semi-circular spoon-shaped
         cells or pockets cut into the side
         of the solid rubber receive and
         retain any overflow of ink until it
         is carried off by the ordinary
         action of the pen in writing

on a cuban tobacco farm

honest

how you
value f

americans

    the american cigar company claims your patronage en-
tirely on the merit that is in the cigars which it manufactures

it offers better cigar values than are obtained from any other
manufacturer on the continent

    the american cigar company produces a great many classes
of cigars of characteristics varied to suit every whim and variety
of public taste no one brand will suit all smokers nor is any one
man sure to be suited with any one brand for any considerable time

what you want is a guarantee that covers a lot of brands of
different characteristics so that you may make a selection in the
comfortable assurance that whatever cigar suits your taste it
will be the best value your money can buy and always uniform
in quality as long as you smoke it

          so the american cigar company has established a dis-
 tinctive mark of merit - a reliable standard of cigar
k	qualities-this  a  triangle a mark of merit fun-

   damentally this merit mark stands for honest cigar

value in whatever cigar you buy wherever you buy it

	the object of the american cigar company is

            to make good cigars and keep them good we
 expect the public to buy triangle a brands for 
 cigar	one reason only - and that is because they i

 values	represent the best values and the best

                   quality in the stores

    among the brands distinguished by the a triangle a
guarantee of honest cigar values are the following

   the new cremo victorias anna held george w
childs cabinets buck spanaflora tarita stickneys new
tariff cubanola the continental chancellor caswell club
the unico benefactor captain marryat roxboro general
braddock orlando also the palma decuba and isle of pines

    smoke anyone in critical comparison with the best cigar you
know at the same price and prove to your own satisfaction that
the a triangle a merit mark does really mean better cigars
for you if you look for it every time you buy

american cigar company

    every smoker every time he smokes invests an install-
ment on this immense total amount

     is this  spent with the proper degree of care
for the value received

    the  chance-may-offer - hope-im-lucky  manner of
buying cigars has in the past been due to the absence of any
reliable standard of cigar values until recently all but the
highest priced cigars had always been sold without any definite
assurance as to their quality or value and in nearly every case
the responsibility of the retail dealer for the cigars he sold
has been very undependable

    the smoker of medium priced cigars has been
at the mercy of thousands of brand names plenty of
them merely stock labels that left room for plain  a
robbery cigars worth  to  a  have  
sold for c each - generally to the manufacturers	jm 

profit the dealer has been deceived fully as m a
much as the public

five years ago the dealer could offer the
public no definite reliable assurance of the
quality of the cigars he sold - and the smokers
of medium priced cigars could not prevent these impositions

     today conditions are changed in the past few years cigar
quality has been immeasurably improved - and the new stand-
ard of quality - real tangible cigar value - is distinguished by
a simple mark - the a triangle a mark of merit

    the american cigar company follows a certain well-
defined policy to support a certain well-defined theory that
theory is that the surest foundation for a permanent business
success is square-dealing with both the trade and the public

     this policy has been consistently and conscientiously fol-
lowed as a fundamental principle and every effort made toward
improving cigar quality and lowering cigar cost to the public

august 

break and yet-norwest by west with the wind fair
for distant papeete and the deadly delgadas lying
about a quarter of a point off their present course
not ten miles away

  shes a hard case bosun he remarked to that
official as they sat down together she has me fair
scared with the course shes steering and yet you
may sling me over the side in a shotted hammock
for the sharkses ki-ki if she dont know a lot more
than the old man himself aint she a daisy too

look at her there olding the wheel as upright as a
cocoanut palm and as pretty and plump as a-
as a-

  porker concluded the bosun pouring an im-
perial pint of tea into his mug

  you aint got no poetry in you said the mate
disgustedly

  nor nothing else growled the bosun aint
you going to help that curry and give a man some-
thing to put in his own inside after stowing the
whale-boat full of beef and biscuits

  the whale-boat thats plenty bosun ive
got to live as well as you 

  ay biscuits beef and water compass and--

she give the order a while ago

  whats in the wind now

   i dont ask questions so im never told no lies

  i do though said the mate in a spasm of
authority deserting his dinner to spring up the com-
panion and join vaiti at the wheel

  the bosuns mahogany face broke up into a score
of curving wrinkles and his shoulders shook a little
as he watched the scene on deck quite mechani-
cally he transferred the rest of the curry to his plate
and while clearing the dish with the precision of a
machine kept an eye on the couple at the wheel

   he saw harris ask an eager question and repeat it
more eagerly he saw vaiti jerk a brief answer and
the mate speak again then he saw the girl swing
round on her heel lift one slender hand and bring it down
across harris cheek with an emphasis that left a crimson
mark upon the polished brown he saw the mate take a
step forward and look at the handsome helmswoman as
though he were very much minded to pay back the correc-
tion after the manner of men in general where a pretty
vixen is concerned the two figures stared at each other
eye to eye for a full minute vaitis brown eyes keen
as twin swords never wavered her lip was insolent and
unrelenting the mates half-angry half-mischievous
expression dissolved into an embarrassed grin then he
turned tail and hurried down the hatch

  shes a tigress in uman form he declared if the
old man-or any other-was to lay his little finger on me

- but there who cares what a scratchin cat does

id as soon marry a shark that i would 

    youve as much chance grunted the bosun

   talk of sharks said the mate gazing ruefully at the
table and the empty dish

  some two hours later a milky gleam on the port bow
attracted the mates attention as he stood on the poop
a kanaka sailor had just taken the wheel and vaiti was
below

    breakers on the port bow  sang out harris

  vaiti was up in a moment

  i trow water on my fathers head she said coolly
 but no good he too much sick he see snakes by and by
i think you and oki carry him into the cabin and come
back pretty quick i see this trough myself  

  see what demanded the mate on the last verge of

frenzy

  not know myself yet answered vaiti giving one of
her rare laughs she seemed in a very good humor for once

  when the mate came out a little later and the sailor
went back to the neglected wheel vaiti was standing by
the whale-boat wearing an air of perfect self-possession
and a complete suit of her fathers white ducks the sight
was no novelty to harris but it came upon him now as
usually with a new shock of admiration

  isnt she an outrighter he observed to the un-
sympathetic bosun

   she certainly is if outrighters french for an undacent
young woman   replied that officer sourly harris did not
hear him for the significance of the mornings mystery
had just burst on his mind he had not spent ten years in
the pacific for nothing-and the sight of tai a diver from
penrhyn standing beside vaiti with a water-glass in his
hand spelt pearl-shell to the eyes of the mate as
clearly as if the magic word had been printed in letters
three feet long

   vaiti flashed her white teeth at him

  tai me three boys we go into lagoon she said
suppose somethings happen you find course for apia
written out cabin table you take ship back put captain
in hospital

  youre a corker vaiti cried harris admiringly
whered you hear anything about the delgadas no
ship goes near them that can help it theyre a regular
ocean cemetery

with an emphasis that left a crimson mark upon the polished brown

  you member melicani officer from gunboat apia

  ay said harris he did remember the lad and the
rather inexplicable friendliness shown him by saxon and
vaiti during the stay in port of the hornet

  he show me photo delgadas hornet he been go all
round him mark him right for chart because he all
wrong melicani officer give my father bearings say
plenty talk and show photo he fool officer i think he
not know that place mean pearl-shell and we not tell
anything

  harris mounted the rigging and surveyed the reef from
the main crosstrees it was the best part of a mile away
a creaming circle of foam on the seas blue surface inclosing
a pallid spot of green vaiti who had followed him flung
one arm round the mast and leaning outward toward
the horizon surveyedthe reef intently within that ring
of foam-the grave of many a gallant ship that had sailed
the fair pacific as bravely as their own little schooner-
might lie many thousands of pounds the purchase of
the sybil now owned by a trading syndicate the regaining
of saxons lost position in decent society the realization
of half a hundred luxurious dreams dreamed on coral
beaches under the romance-breeding splendors of the
tropic moon-all this and more hung on the chances of
the next few hours

  there was silence for the space of a minute or two as the
man and woman swung between earth and heaven staring
across the sun-dazzled plain of sea then in one instant
the dream broke and the rainbow fragments of that bubble
of glory scattered themselves east and west for across
the bar of the level horizon slipped a small pointed pearl-
colored sail growing as they watched it flying past and
heading all too surely for the delgadas reef

  vaiti flung herself round a backstay and slid down to the
deck with a word on her lips that would have justified the
bosuns recent judgment could he have caught it harris
followed swearing fully and freely it was evident to
both that the newcomer had special business with the reef
as well as themselves and they wasted no time acting in
concord and without dispute after a fashion that was new
on board the sybil within half an hour they had reduced
the distance between the ship and the reef to a quarter of
a mile nearer than that even vaiti did not care to go for
the weather looked unsettled though the wind was off
the reef the whale-boat with a picked crew was
lowered and sent flying toward the break in the reef while
the mate burning to be in her but conscious that his duty
must keep him on the ship paced excitedly up and down
the deck glass in hand watching the advance of the
stranger ship from time to time she was a good two
hours sail away as yet and surely first possession was
worth something even out here in the lawless south seas

  before an hour was over however the wind had fresh-
ened considerably and the mate began to feel anxious for
the safety of the boat in case he should be obliged to run
for it from the neighborhood of the treacherous reef that
vaiti would return an instant sooner because of the
threatening weather he did not expect knowing the dare-
devil recklessness of her character too well it was certain

    however that he might lose the ship and inciden-
    tally himself by waiting too long and it was equally
    certain that saxon once recovered would put a
    bullet through his head if vaiti came to harm and
    all the time that threatening sail was growing larger
    and larger

       it was an unspeakable relief though no less of a
    surprise when he saw that the boat was actually
    heading toward the ship again the sail up and every
    oar hard at work he did not remember having seen
    tai go down in any of his hurried inspections through
    the glass and the time was certainly short what
    did it all mean

       the meaning became sufficiently clear as soon as
    the boat approached the ship but not through the
    medium of eye or ear a strong stench of rotting fish
    struck the mates nostrils almost before the boat was
    within hail and instantly enlightened him no one
    who has ever smelt the terrible smell of the pearl-
    oyster removed from its ocean bed and left to putrefy
    in a tropical sun can mistake the odor harris un-
    derstood at once that the strange ship had been
    there before and that vaiti was bringing back a
    sample of the last catch left out to rot during the
    vessels temporary absence

      the sybil was leaping dangerously when the boat
    came alongside but vaiti snatched at the lowered
    rope and swung herself up over the bulwarks before
    any of the native crew tai following her brought
    a sack of hideously smelling carrion and dumped it
    down on the deck the mates eyes glistened

       i find great lot lying on reef said vaiti with an
     apparent calmness that might have deceived any one
     who knew her less accurately than the mate i
     think be there two week clismas island he one
     week away good weather papalangi clismas island
     belong plenty diving-gear you see  

      rather said harris gloomily game up eh
i think you no man at all spat out vaiti
suddenly swinging into the cabin

  harris not especially put out gave a hand to hauling
in the boat remarking to the bosun who was picking over
the heap of decaying pearl-shell dont know as one
could say the same about her lump of solid devilment
that she is but this looks like the end of all our opes
as they say in the plays dont it

  in a minute or two vaiti appeared again wearing a
dignified muslin gown with three frills on its tail and
holding a chart in her hands she eyed the horizon
narrowly and ordered the ship to be put about a manoeu-
vre which headed the sybil straight for the oncoming sail
it was now evident that the stranger ship was a schooner
of some eighty or ninety tons rather larger than the sybil
and quite as fast no one on board had the smallest
doubt of her mission even had that rotting heap of shell
not been there to offer evidence pearl-shell lagoons-
with their shell worth from  to  per ton and their
pearls if any are found which is not always certain worth
a fortune on half a handful-are the gold-mines of the south
sea world the very birds of the sea seem at times to
carry the news of such a discovery and spread it far
and wide

  the sybil gathered way and sped fast toward the stranger
ship the sea was blackening and rising but there was
not very much wind as yet vaiti sat cross-legged on the
deck studying her chart in the waning light of the gusty
afternoon it was some minutes before she laid it down
and stood up to speak steadying herself with one hand
against the deck-house for the schooner was now rolling
heavily

  alliti she said suppose you got heart one small
fowl inside you i get captains winchester my levolver
you and bosuns levolver and we send that people davy
jones or go ourselves pretty quick but you not got
heart though you big man-and old man he all time sick
now you listen too much what i tell you we run alongside
ship you go on board you say captain sick no one take
sun we get off course nearly wreck on delgadas then
you ask captain give bearings reef and you look at him
chart too much careful see if this line mark-here

  she put the point of her small forefinger on the chart
she held and showed two or three newly-ruled lines in red
ink inclosing a large area east and south of samoa

  then you ask if captain come from new zealand and
you say me going auckland and our old man he hear
house belong him burn down in big fire in wellington and
he want to know that true now you say all over to me

  what for demanded the mate

  because i say pig flashed vaiti no-you got
head of pig heart of fowl you bosun you know i get
you trough this all right suppose you trusting me-you
come here

  harris shaking his great shoulders in an easy laugh
swung down on to the main deck and began ordering about
the crew he had an enormous admiration for vaiti even
when she boxed his ears but he thought her special
peculiarities of character rather a trying obstacle in the
way of his enjoying the easy life beloved of south sea mates

the saturday evening post	

  the acidulous bosun rose from his seat on deck holding
out an extremely unclean palm in the midst of which
glittered two fine pearls

  ive been through that little lot and got these which
do look like biz maam he observed as to people
havin fowls hearts or pigs heads im not prepared to
pass judgment but i dont own to neither myself and
if you say its a fight a fight it is or if youve got a better
plan in that uncommon level ead of yours im ready to
stand by

  you something like a man pronounced the com-
manding officer in the muslin skirt you listen i tell
him all again

  an hour later the bosun very wet and draggled climbed
over the bulwarks of the sybil and the schooner margaret
macintyre of sydney slipped behind into the falling dusk

  said he was thirteen weeks out from sydney maam
reported the ambassador four weeks out from apia
gettin copra round here and there and there wasnt no
news of a fire by the last mail as he remembered nice
new chart with no lines of that kind ruled on it anywhere
as to where he got the divin-gear that was in the cabin or
what kind of copra he reckoned to pick up on the delgadas
he didnt say not bein asked

  vaiti stood still to consider a beautifully poised black
silhouette against the yellow oblong of the lamp-lit
cabin door

  i think it all right he not been near wellington
she pronounced at last alliti how her head

  souwest by south answered the mate
from the wheel

  keep her so

  aye aye sir laughed the mate

	      - 

  every one in the south pacific knew that
the sybil was one of the fastest little
schooners ever turned out of frisco where
they know how to build a clipper but the
record of her passage from the delgadas to
wellington new zealand fairly astonished
the islands when it came to be told the
wind was fair almost all the way with two
or three lively nights when the little vessel
driven hard under the utmost possible pres-
sure of canvas piled up the knots like a
liner saxon continued delirious but was
fortunately quiet harris and gray the
bosun although unenlightened as to the
cause of the sybils sudden southward flight
fully understood that the possession of the
pearl lagoon hung in the balance and
worked like four men to supplement the
efforts of the scanty kanaka crew vaiti
interfered little with the working of the ship
but she kept a lookout that hardly left her
time for sleep or food although the sybil
like most pacific ships was allowed under
ordinary circumstances to chance it day
and night hour after hour she sat cross-
legged on deck watching the unbroken rim
of the black horizon-or paced up and
down the poop silent and grave in her lace
and muslin fripperies as a naval officer on
the bridge what she was looking for no one
knew but during that wild ten days of
foam and smother cracking sails and strain-
ing sheets her silent watchfulness infected
the men themselves and eyes were con-
stantly turned to scan the empty seething
plain over which they flew

  it was drawing on toward dusk of the
tenth day and the sky was beginning to
light fires of angry copper-purple high in
the storm-driven west when vaiti of a
sudden stopped dead in her endless walk
and looked with lips apart and eyes nar-
rowed deep beneath her brows over the
weather rail all this time they had not
sighted a single sail or a solitary funnel

they had been well off the track of new zealand
bound ships and the pacific waters are wide but
now they were drawing near to wellington and there
was nothing to be astonished at in the sight of another
sail creeping up over the horizon-except indeed the
fact that it was momentarily growing larger and gaining
on the sybil there were not many schooners afloat
from new guinea to the paumotus that could have done
as much

  the mate came up behind vaiti and handed her a glass
she looked through it lowered it raised it and looked
again with a steady gaze and suddenly flung it out of her
hand across the deck

  harris caught it deftly and asked with the constitutional
calm that alone saved his reason when vaiti took over
command

  whats to pay now

  she got auxiliary said vaiti with a note of agony in
her voice

  what if she has isnt any vessel free to carry an
auxiliary that can stand the stink of the oil and the
cussedness of the ingin   	

  i go see captain said vaiti flashing down the com-
panion

  saxon was better to-day and almost in full possession
of his senses vaiti went to the medicine-chest took out a
hypodermic syringe filled it with careful accuracy from
a tiny dark-blue bottle and lifted her fathers arm as he
lay limp and weak but mending fast in his bunk

  good girl take care of your old father he murmured
in maori as she slipped the needle-point painlessly under
the skin and the powerful drug began to race through every
vein of the inert body the effect was rapid and decisive
saxon sat up against his pillows in five minutes clear-
headed though weak and asked if the sybil had not sighted
the delgadas yet

  listen father said vaiti speaking fluently in the low
soft tongue that the two had used together all her life-the
maori language saxon had first learned from the pretty
brown girl he had stolen from her new zealand pah to
sail the blue pacific at his side in the days of long ago -
listen there is little time and we are in great need
we came to the reef and the shell was there truly but a
strange ship had been before us even as we lay there
she returned from christmas island with diving-gear i
sent gray on board to look at her chart and find out by a
trick if she had been to wellington and it seemed that she
had not the new line of annexation marked on the chart

where new zealand this year added to herself all that lay
within a certain space of the sea also she had not been south
of auckland so then knowing that we if we asked the
government might have the atoll granted us for twenty
years and take possession above the people of the other
ship i made sail for wellington and we are now but one
day away when this ship appears again chasing us
where the suspicion has waked in their hearts or when
is nothing they have discovered our desire

  give the sybil all sail daughter and she will leave
the other-what is this talk  asked saxon raising himself
on his elbow to look out of the glooming circle of the port

  but the ship has auxiliary my father and she will
have passed out of sight before the morning

  oh she has has she grunted the captain dropping
back into his native tongue what are you going to
do about it  

  he had noted a glimmer in vaitis eye that told him she
was not yet at the end of her resources the maori guile

and the english daring were united to some purpose in this
strange creature that he had given to the world

  i will tell she said standing up to her full height
but you must give the order my father for alliti drags
on the rein these days let the bale of trawl-net and the
manila rope be taken from the cargo and let us cross the
bows of this ship and drop them across her path the
keel will run clean but the screw will foul and they will
creep like a bird with a broken wing till daylight then
if the sea has grown less they will send down a diver and
clear the screw but we shall be almost into wellington
and the lagoon is ours

  you are worthy to be the daughter of a brave man
answered saxon in maori sinking back wearily on his
pillow go then and if we lose the ship we lose her
there is great wealth to gain and a man must die at one
time if not another i am tired i will sleep

  vaiti left him and hurried back on deck the purple
dusk was already beginning to gather and the green
starboard light of the margaret macintyre gleamed like a
glowworm a mile or so behind she was drawing very
near there was no time to lose

  alliti called vaiti my father he better he send
word to take trawl-net and manila out of hold make come
across that ship him path foul him screw suppose you
not afraid you bring us close drop net and manila
harris hide was thick but vaiti knew how to pierce it
when she chose and the man had courage enough in
streaks vaiti had hit the mark when she called him

              chicken-hearted in fighting but there was
      no manoeuvre of the ship too risky for him
      to undertake and carry through with perfect
      coolness

        all right my lady he nodded dont
      forget me and gray when it comes to sharin
      out the swag thats all

        the net and the rope were brought up
     and the latter knotted here and there to
     make a hideous tangle of it then the
     sybils lights were put out even the cabin
     lamp being extinguished the stars pricked
     themselves out in sudden sharpness on the
     great blue chart of heaven above and the
     waste of dark rolling water all around grew
     large and lonely

       you are not to suppose that norman
     saxons daughter did not see and feel these
     things-did not hear the voiceless talk of
     the great seas on starry evenings or feel
     her mortal body almost rapt away in the
     ecstasy of a black midnight and a shriek-
     ing storm just as you perhaps who think
     that no one ever shared such experiences
     with yourself may feel it is not only the
     blameless tourist with his daily diary and
     his books of travel teaching him how and
     when to enthuse who enjoys the splen-
     did pageant of the seas vaiti as the most
     indulgent chronicler must confess had more
     than a spice of her fathers villainy in her
     composition not to speak of whatever
     devilry her maori forebears might have be-
     queathed to her she was unscrupulous
     ruthless and crafty as a general rule she
     was engaged in a deed of the very shadiest
     description to-night-yet as she stood with
     her hands on the wheel and her eyes on the
     green starboard light of the oncoming ship
     steering the sybil to something extremely
     like certain destruction she knew that the
     southern cross was rising clear and beau-
     tiful above its gemlike pointers just ahead
     and that a little sliver of young moon
     crystal-silver against the dark was slipping
     up the sky to her left the thought just
     grazed her mind that this might be the
     last time the moon would ever rise over the
     pacific for her she smiled a little in the
     dusk and steered steadily ahead there
     were no streaks in the composition of vaitis spirit

  a short tack to starboard became necessary harris
put the ship about at a lift of vaitis hand it grew very
dark a cloud was over the moon and the stars were
dimmed by driving vapors the wind was increasing
the schooner lay over with its weight and the foam
gurgled along her clean-run sides still the margaret
macintyre came on stately and unsuspicious all sail set
and the beat of the little screw distinctly audible through
the night

  vaiti signaled again to put the ship about and as
soon as the great boom had creaked across the deck gave
over the wheel to harris

  run him just as he head now she said softly and
bring him too much close to ship he scrape the paint off
him i go do rest

  harris humming good-by dolly gray took the
wheel over if he had any doubts as to vaitis purpose

who

who

and

why

governor hy schedule

governors of new york are inclined to puff out their
chests and say their office is next in importance to
president it is a sizable office bigger than many
of the men who have held it by the same signal-smoke

  there are about eight million people in new york
half of them know the governors name there are
about seventy-six million people in the united states out-
side of new york although your real new yorker will not
admit it and those who know the name of new yorks
governor come under the scattering column it is the
same with every other governor of every other state he
is a great man in the state capital and in his home town
while he lasts but elsewhere he is something necessary
under our system of government occasionally a gov-
ernor does something that gives him a brief celebrity
but mostly they toil over dull routine through their terms
and after they have retired go home rub their foreheads
and wonder dully what it was all about

  that is what frank way land higgins the present
governor of new york will do when he gets back to
olean which will be about next january unless things
change some he will be due for a period of retrospection
and introspection that will culminate in the question for
which there is no answer whats the use  and that does
not mean he has not been a good-enough governor as
governors go but that he is accumulating the penalty
that goes with the job

  every community has a leading citizen in whom is
focused the respectability the dignity the uplift-as the
womens clubs put it-of the place some of these leading
citizens remain leading citizens until they die shedding
their radiance only on the home town others get
out into the broader glare of public affairs but only for
the reason that caused their rise to eminence among their
own people

  higgins was and is the leading citizen of olean he is
a wholesale grocer a most respectable business olean
was proud of him when he merely led in the uplift move-
ments at home olean was proud of him when he con-
cluded to go to the state senate and olean is hysterically
proud of him now when he has attained the governorship
olean is a thrifty little town in southwestern new york
not so named because it is the home of oleanders but
because it is a tank-station for the standard oil company
developed after the oil-strikes in the contiguous pennsyl-
vania territory and needing an oleaginous name they
couldnt call it oil city because there was already an oil
city so some genius picked out olean which is appropriate
distinctive and descriptive

  to be the leading citizen of olean or any other place
requires certain attributes that are available to almost
anybody who will set out in earnest to attain them the
first is a high hat that must be worn to church every
sunday morning in conjunction with what is known in
leading-citizen sections as a prince albert coat the
second is an impressive handshake that confers distinction
on the shakee the third is a calm dignified judicial
demeanor the fourth is the ability or the disability
rather to think exactly in common with all other sub-
leading citizens and with the sub-sub-leading citizens
the leading citizen must be grave ponderous conven-
tional in short he must always live up to his high hat
and his prince albert coat

  now there is a route that will bring success to any man
if he is narrow enough to travel it without bumping against
the sides he must identify himself with every  move-
ment he must be colorless for if he isnt he will make
enemies

  pretty soon his admiring townspeople will make him
village trustee and he will attain eminence in other ways
then they will send him to the legislature after that
he need only preserve his conventional equilibrium and
the paths to glory are open for political bosses need
respectability they nominate men for office not be-
cause of the men themselves but because they know the
masses who are to do the voting your average voter is a
great humbug no matter what he may be himself he
will not vote for any person who does not live up to his
high hat and his prince albert coat

  it came out according to schedule with higgins he
served in the state senate and became lieutenant-
governor then came a campaign where help was needed
it would not do to nominate a man who was not impec-
cable and they nominated higgins the high hat and the
prince albert coat had won and new york has a governor
who is as conventional as a pound of rolled oats

  the governor is a small pursy man with a placid face
on which there is no distinguishing feature he radiates
dignity he looks as if he was about to hold up an impress-
ive hand and say now children i feel constrained to

remark that if you would succeed in life you must do
unto others as they would do unto you be virtuous and
you will be happy honesty is the best policy

  after he became governor he decided that it would
never do for him a leading citizen to be reproached with
the term partisan he admitted of course that he is a
party man but he evolved the idea that the men who put
him in his place are not so good as they might be and he
developed the remarkable brand of independence that
has puzzled everybody who has watched him it wasnt
real independence it was independence in spots trotted
out only at times when higgins thought he might make
something for himself through it far be it from him
a leading citizen to be swayed by any but those motives
that make for the good of all the people all the time he
was elected by all the people-on his side-except a hun-
dred thousand or so who voted for president roosevelt
and would not vote for him and he must take up that trust
as a sacred one

  from time to time he lighted signal-fires on capitol hill
at albany and called the attention of the public to his
independence he never lighted a fire when there was
any danger that he would get scorched by it himself
once in a while when he had president roosevelt behind
him for instance or when the person he could squash was
of small importance he assumed a heroic pose and beat his
breast and called on all bosses to leave his sight forever
it didnt hurt him any and there was a chance that he
might impress somebody

  constitutionally higgins can no more be independent
than he could wear a pink shirt he isnt that kind all
his life he has succeeded by falling in behind and edging
his way up to the front rank he figured that his ever-
present aid in time of stress would be president roosevelt
he knew the presidents frame of mind he asserted him-
self when he thought the president was looking or when
the president asked him to and all the rest of the time he
was the same leading-citizen higgins wedded to precedent
convention and the greatest good for the higgins family

  the governor is tom constantly with conflicting im-
pulses and fears he wants so much to be a strong noble
figure standing there in albany ruling for the people and
without regard to the exigencies of politics and he is
mortally afraid that if he does he will get the worst of it
he vetoed a bill last winter that most of the big men leaders
of his party and men who had put him where he is wanted
him to sign he vetoed it for the specific reason that he
wanted to show that he was not a governor who would
ever evade any right by a hairs-breadth no matter if every
voter in the state asked him to he chose this bill as the
crowning act of his series of independence evolutions it
was to be brave to be defiant of the bosses to show the
leaders that he could not be influenced besides the bill
was a personal one and as it affected but an individual
higgins didnt see where he could lose many votes

  it was a master-stroke but it so happened that the
newspapers knew the very reason higgins let the bill die
was this reason that he wanted to make a grand-stand
play on it and not one of them referred to it it was a
sad sad day for higgins he foozled his master-stroke
still it had its value for it showed the kind of independence
the higgins brand is

  he is making another similar attempt just now nat-
urally he is anxious for a renomination that does not
seem likely in the present state of affairs and the only
way higgins can see to gain it is to get the support of the
president all his efforts are devoted to proving with an
eye single on oyster bay that he is not bound by any
pledges to leaders that he is his own governor his
independence is the made-to-suffice kind

  still these are personal peculiarities developed by
personal ambitions and fostered by congenital character-
istics no person can say anything against higgins as a
man he is clean honest decent and of exemplary habits
look him over from head to foot and he must be stamped
 k he is affable considerate kind-hearted and has
made a fortune for himself of several millions which is
not so small a trick as it seems to be the burr under
the saddle is the miserable in-and-out sort of politics he
plays

  he had a chance to be really independent he was
governor and he could do as he pleased instead he
became rigidly the governor when his own fortunes would
not be hurt and subserviently the governor when he saw
a possible impairment of his future the result is that
whenever he tries to make a record as an independent
greatest-good-to-all-the-people governor the people say
oh fudge for they know the independence has not
the hallmark on it

                                                                                

stories of stuyvesant fish

 rjlhe trouble is that your goods wont wear out fast

   enough said stuyvesant fish to a friend who com-
plained of not growing rich yes i understand he
continued smilingly interrupting a protest you dont
want to make anything unless you make it well but
instead of making things of iron why not make soap
and the man did and made a fortune

  it is by such flashes of half-humorous insight that the
real stuyvesant fish is seen a man still in the prime
of life of physical and financial weight several inches over
six feet in height ordinarily slow in his motions ordinarily
of few words and those of simple directness

  until the recent cataclysmic insurance revelations he
was practically unknown then suddenly he came into
wide prominence as standing for honesty and full investi-
gation and as the man to whom more than any other the
stockholders of one of the great insurance companies looked
for the safeguarding of their interests

  he has no pride in offhand inspiration he loves to
revolve a difficult proposition deliberately and to take it
with him up to his farm and keep it over sunday-his
farm being a great estate opposite west point which his
father purchased on the very day on which fort sumter
was fired upon

  there is much to connect this man with prominent
americanism he is directly descended from colonel
nicholas fish the friend of washington and another
ancestor was the great dutch-american peter stuyvesant
and his father was hamilton fish secretary of state under
grant

  his stand for honesty raised up powerful enemies bent
upon his irretrievable and discrediting defeat they
endeavored to minimize his insurance influence they
tried to destroy him with the illinois central railroad of
which for twenty years he has been president it was first
privately represented to him that if he would go out quietly
he might put his own figure on his holdings but he replied
with that calm which is sometimes mistaken for heaviness
that he was not in the habit of considering his own interests
apart from those of the stockholders and that in short so
long as the stockholders wanted him to he guessed he
would stay and he did

  it is amusing to contrast the absence of public prominence
as regards himself with the prominence which for years
has been accorded to his wife the leader of the 
while mrs fish has been making social history with her
illimitably varied entertainments her peasant dances
her fetes k la trianon her dinners mr fish has gone on
his unnoticed way working as hard as if he really had to
in his big many-windowed office on the top floor of a
bowling green skyscraper with its splendid view of miles
of water and land

  when mrs fish planned a colonial dance and the society
columns frantically announced that every man guest must
be clean shaven and gave fanciful pictures of this or that
social light before and after shaving it did not occur to the
society reporters that there was a certain big giant with a
reddish mustache who would have a good deal to say
about such a matter

  mr fish feels a personal love for his railroad for he
entered its service as a junior clerk immediately upon his
graduation from columbia under his presidency its

serious and frivolous facts

about

the

and

the

near

great

mileage and its dividends and its capital stok have more
than doubled it was through his direct inception that
an advanced type of car was built for suburban traffic
with doors opposite every seat he has inaugurated a
pension system for old and disabled workers based upon
the number of years they have been employed by the
railroad some years ago he also introduced a system by
which employees might purchase stock and thus become
personally interested in the prosperity of the company
as to the growth of the capital stock of the company he
points out that at least par value has been received for
every new share issued that there has been no expense
whatever for underwriting and that thus it is evident   that
the shares are held for honest investment and that the
stockholders have abiding faith in everything he
believes in a stock company for the benefit of the stock-
holders and it is this that has made him a tower of strength
not only in railroad matters but in insurance

  he feels a keen interest in the development of that part of
the south tapped by his railroad and stands urgently for
the making of good highways and the development of good
farming he owns two model plantations in mississippi-
although he personally disclaims the designation model
-and on the subject of roads he says a good wagon road
is worth more to a community than a poor railroad

  he is a live railroad president and spends much of his
time in chicago when he became president of the illinois
central the population of cities of over ten thousand
inhabitants reached by his railroad was only between
eight and nine hundred thousand now twenty years
later it is almost four million

  he is a man of many sides he enjoys the management
of great capital but he does not love wall street its
frequently undigested securities provokes him to say that
wall street needs to have its appendix cut out in the
way of recreation he best loves his farm his chickens his
cows his dogs his vegetables but he also has a splendid
town house in new york in the italian style filled with
paintings and statuary rich in marble and gilt and with a
great hall patterned after the hall of the doges and he has
a mansion built magnificently in colonial style at newport
nor can it be said that such things are entirely the idea of his
wife in such matters husband and wife must be in accord
especially when the husband is a forceful and original man

  he belongs to many clubs but is seldom seen at them
when did you bring me a letter last he asked of one
of the old attendants at the union club

  i think it was eighteen months ago sir

  are you sure it wasnt my brother

  his youth still clings to him a long telescope is
mounted at one of his office windows  just for amuse-
ment and with a smile of humorous deprecation
yes the smile broadens i went off in a yacht
down there the other day and i said to my friends that
wed have to be careful because every one of the boys in the
office would take turns watching me through that glass
that he is a college man in business is evidenced in a
certain formality of quotation when he makes an address
for his speech is likely to be full of direct references to
herbert spencer to emerson and john stuart mill

  he thinks in statistics when he deplores the present-
day wastefulness he says if each one of our eighty-five
millions saves or wastes but five cents a day it makes an
annual loss or saving of 

  he declares that the evil with corporations lies in too
few men having undertaken to manage too many corpora-
tions and to point this generalization he adds that one
man is a director upon  boards another upon  that
 new york men hold directorships in  well-known

corporations

  his many generations of american blood do not make
him feel dread of the hosts of foreigners now flocking here
our only danger is from their remaining in the cities
get them back to the land and well assimilate them
and he adds that he thinks it probable that the influx
of immigrants is no greater now in proportion to our entire
population than it was some years ago before the outcry
against immigration began

  born to a wealth of millions to which he has greatly
added he has no fear of danger from the growth of individ-
ual fortunes or great corporations let great financial
power be lawful and regulated and it will be safe is his
firm belief americans should be the last people to
object to amalgamation our forty-seven states are the
strongest argument for e pluribus unum

  recently he found himself appointed executor of a small
estate it was the case of a family living near his hudson
river home who had naively trusted him to help them
he assumed the responsibility straightened out tangled
affairs advertised an auction of household and farm
articles and on the day of the sale was there in person

  the clump of gathered farmers astonished watched him
as he mounted a wagon and began the sale as auctioneer
he worked with enthusiasm and secured undreamt of
prices then when it was all over there was not
enough money in it to justify hiring an auctioneer said

he went to sea from kennebunkport maine as a cabin-boy
when he was thirteen years old sailed before the mast to all
parts of the world and when he landed in california in
 he came as an a b on the sailing ship galatea from
new orleans

d k watson of ohio chairman of the commission to
revise the laws maintains he is the author of the gold
plank in the republican national platform of  sen-
ator lodge of massachusetts and senator platt of new
york also claim to be authors of the plank ex-senator
chandler has investigated and says the glory belongs to
lodge

a disciplinary vote

john i fay a well-known lawyer of ohio claims to be
the only man in the united states who was unanimously
indorsed for an office by all parties and defeated

  fay lived in a suburb of columbus and was nominated
for mayor he was indorsed by both parties it fell
out that he had business in cincinnati on election day
and he went there without stopping to vote

  the farmers began to come in they all asked for fay
no one knew where he was this is a fine mess said one
of them here we are voting for a man who hasnt
enough interest in the job to be on hand

  lets put up a man of our own said another

  they held a convention nominated another man and
voted for him too fay came back about five oclock
he voted for himself and complacently waited for the votes
to be counted when they were counted it was discovered
that fay was beaten by eight votes

when speech was golden

the late david simpson who for the greater part of his
life occupied a position of responsibility and trust
with the firm of armour  co owed his good fortune to
the fact that in his boyhood he possessed the full allowance
of aplomb and independence supposed to be the birthright
of young america

  one morning mr p d armour seated at his desk
received at the hands of a messenger-boy a telegram of
unusual importance and after reading it over the second
time sat with knitted brows absorbed in thought and
oblivious of the waiting mercury the silence finally was
broken by an imperious young voice which said

  come sign this book my time is money

  turning the millionaire saw at his elbow a small rosy-
cheeked boy who held out the book pointing with insistent
finger to the spot waiting for the recipients name

  well said mr armour looking him over approvingly
i shouldnt wonder if we could use a boy of your stamp
what wages are you getting now

  twenty-three dollars a month was the reply

  i will give you twenty-five

  done said the small boy promptly and the next
morning he reported bright and early and began his daily
round of duties

  however the exuberant spirits of youth dominated him
at times and having one day overstepped the bounds of
prudence he was discharged meekly the lad took his
leave but the next morning he was back again as usual

  hello said the head of the firm as he passed the
department in which dave was at work i thought
you had been dismissed

  and so i was mr armour was the reply but i have
thought it all over and i find that i cannot leave you for
two reasons

  and what are your reasons

  one is that i cant afford to give up so good a boss as
you are and the second that you cant afford to lose so
good a boy as i am

  his employer laughed and passed on-and dave was
a fixture for life

a veiled warning

john h tennant a well-known new york editor
and robert edgren the athlete were sailing a small
boat up long island sound early one morning

  they came to city island there is a channel on one
side where small boats may go in safety provided they
take absolute bearings on a certain red buoy that marks
a dangerous shoal this channel saves an hour of sailing
around the other way

  it was foggy but edgren who was at the tiller thought
he could make the short channel he sent tennant up
to the bow to look for the red buoy and they squared
away tennant strained his eyes peering into the fog
he could not pick up the buoy they heard the water
rushing over the shoals and knew that if they didnt soon
get a correct bearing they would go aground

  after a short time while edgren howled at tennant
for his bearings tennant saw through the fog a black
object that looked like a boat

     ahoy there  he shouted f where is that red buoy   
   were tied to it fishin came back a hoarse reply

  hurry  screamed edgren get that buoy or were
gone

  the buoy shouted tennant into the fog where
in thunder is that red buoy i cant see it

   probably not came back the calm reply you see
ive hung my coat on it

               n the first of my
shame articles i had
the pleasant task of
telling the terrible
truth about harvard
where the gentleman trust is holding a
corner in the early spring crop of learning
and sacred traditions this present expo-
sure leads us from the sacred to the profane i intend to
reveal a situation particularly distressing at new haven
where the university corporation of yale a corporation
mind you is conducting within easy smell of the new
york new haven and hartford railroad the most active
the most flagrant democratic machine that ever fed upon
the fairest youth of our land for leagues around new
haven you can hear the cogs and wheels of that great fac-
tory pounding away day and night to the tune of a
ceaseless rah-rah-rah chucking raw freshmen through the
boiling vats sliding them as sophomores along to the
planing and trimming department over the elevators as
juniors to be given into the hands of lathers and scroll-
sawers down the chute as seniors to the polishing and
varnishing rooms from which they are bounced in truck-
loads out into the world each bearing the date of his
manufacture and stamped plainly with his trademark a
yale man and throughout the process the continual
rah-rah-rah-ing of the machinery keeps up drowning out
the plaintive cry of the freshman who wont be happy
till he gets it

  and have you heard the song of the machine that toots
from its thousand pipes with a horrid insistence the
refrain of private ownership and corporate industry
flaunting its power to the humiliated muckers of new
haven 

      when johnnie went off to yale to yale

        he was a parlor boarder

      they sent him down to eli town
        to study law and order

      they told him not to study much
        because he was so frail -

      i wonder what his ma-mah will say
        when johnnie comes back from yale

      when johnnie comes back from yale again

       huroo huroo

       hell greet his pa with a rah-rah-rah

         and his aunts and uncles too

      the local band and the fire patrol

       will chase the pig up a slippery pole

         and therell be a scream from the baseball team
           when johnnie comes home from yale

       when johnnie went off to yale to yale
         he was a son of peace man

      but he soon became the pet of fame
      when he whipped a fat policeman

      he sat up nights by the candle lights
      till his face grew rather pale-

      but i wonder what his ma-mah will say
        when johnnie comes home from yale

                 when johnnie comes home from
                     yale again

                   hurang hurang

                    hell stop the clocks for several
                         blocks

                         and the fire-alarms will clang

                   the family horse will neigh and
                       prance

                    and grandmamma will try to dance

the democratic machine at yale

dux et demitasse - john kendrick bangs

       twill be for the good of the neighborhood
          when johnnie comes home from yale

       when johnnie went off to yale to yale

          his foliage was vernal

        but now on his vest hes wearing a crest
          in an order of greek fraternal

       his friends refined are awfully kind
          in keeping him out of jail -

       but i wonder what his ma-mah will say
         when johnnie comes home from yale

  at harvard learning is kept in cold storage-at the
sign of the marble minerva at yale the article is served
on a hot platter fresh from the great brain-works which
glow continually like a blast-furnace lighting up the new
haven sky on winter nights with the radiance of an aurora
borealis no earnest reformer can go to new haven
without feeling a little blue

   we are democratic says the machine with a thousand
voices at yale

   the brakeman ere he lets you off the train yells

        noo-oo haven noo-oo haven

           democ-ra-see
             with a one two three

               and here you be

            right at the great univer-si-tee

rah-rah-rah yale

  the cabman who drives you up to the campus repeats
the cheer as he slaps up his lame horse and the colored
waiter at the hotel shouts in your ear

             lam chops pok chops

                 coffee or tea sah

              mince pie apple pie

                 whichll it be sah

              wes democracktick heah yo see
              eberybody loves de facultee

               yah yah yah

               rah-rah-rah

                     yale

   the democratic machine will tell you that there are no
money-prejudices among the students i myself have no-
ticed that the railway presidents son living in vanderbilt

                 carries with him
                 no social stigma

               he is often as 
               well received i
               am told as any

                poor student-waiter in the university
eating-clubs if a man runs an auto-
mobile and keeps a yacht his snobbish
display of personal property is apt to be overlooked as
merely incidental to his many sterling qualities and any
embarrassment he may feel is promptly drowned in a sea
of cheers

   this system has led to the personal popularity habit
which as practiced at yale has become a violent physical
exercise often more fraught with dangers than the prac-
tice and application of football only last year the most
popular man in his class was slapped on the back until he
became a cripple for life

   everywhere it is a case of yale-fellow-well-met the
son of eli is surcharged with temperament which makes
it necessary for him to be yelling singing talking practical
joking continually when there is nothing really impor-
tant in the way of athletics or ambrosial nights to hold the
undergrads attention he thinks of his neglected education
and buys a pony with which he rough-rides for a brief
season through ancient greece president roosevelt has
a yale temperament with a harvard training much as
secretary taft has a yale training with a heidelberg shape
and here the question naturally arises have our univer-
sities been responsible after all for the shaping of our great
national figures

   it has been pretty clearly proven of late that yale has for
years been secretly in league with the beef trust where
if not has she secured her football material with so little
effort-those gargantuan leviathan mounds of beef and
bone which have kept the blue pennant aloft as if planted
in solid rock  and what reply can she make furthermore
when i charge her with maintaining a special secret stand-
ard oil pipe-line direct from the rockefeller tank to the
consuming-can of new haven the dormitories of yale
burn annually enough midnight oil substantially to enrich the
rockefeller interests  the italics are my own i have
told you where yale gets her oil and her beef now let me
show you what she does with them

   any evening after ten during the university term if
you happen to be abroad in the streets of new haven
you will notice that the atmosphere has suddenly become
thick heavy tarry almost prehensile like the closest soft-
coal gusts of pittsburg you choke you sneeze as the
burning poisonous gases enter your lungs-and you find
a student already semi-asphyxiated singing the stein
song and clinging desperately to a lamp-post ask any
policeman about this he will tell you that it has always
been so after ten oclock when the midnight oil is beginning
to burn and is sputtering smoking from a thousand win-
dows around the campus

   when first i whiffed this penetrating this memorable
odor i was standing in front of a large dormitory from
which twinkled many yellow lights
where doubtless as many pale
students were grinding in solitary
confinement for to-morrows exams

moved by the spirit of investiga-	

tion i quickly disguised myself as
a college charwoman and crept
stealthily unnoticed through the
dark hallways till i paused before a

                                 a transom i could hear
                                 the voices of many pale
                                 students within and
                                 remembered that it was
                                 a college custom for pale
                                 students to foregather to
                                 discuss the work of rne

                                 which came from within

  the new haven distilleries of college spirits are re-
sponsible i believe for the increasing habit of holding
alumni reunions on mondays wednesdays and fridays
on the yale campus once a year the dear old class of
umpty-steen comes roaring back to drink soft and sparkling
drinks till far into the gray a m when they adjourn to
the college square to play hop-scotch or paint their class
numerals on the chapel steps sometimes there are three or
four of these reunions going on at once sometimes more
the class of  holding its decennial will collide with the
class of  holding its quindecennial the two classes will
stop and give the yell in front of durfee when along will
roll the famous class of  holding its semi-centennial
these three parties locking arms will combine and hold a
fusion meeting on the walk they will promise earnestly
to come back next year they always do there is no
such thing as really graduating from yale because the
reunions keep the old fellows on the campus most of the
time

  during a quiet hour of the morning i saw a solitary
figure sitting on the fence in front of durfee it was thai
of a very old man whose beard brushed the pebbles of
the walk

  youd better get off that fence grandfather i
said or some sophomore will come along and do you
harm

  i dont much care sighed the old un this fence
aint like the one we had way back in-

  then youre a yale man i cried

  well i guess  answered the graybeard im here on
this here fence a-holdin my class centennial im the only
survivin member o the class o  and reunions are
gettin to be pretty solum affairs lately im too young a
man to be sittin lonesome on a fence without doin some-
thing for my college so here goes the class-yell anyhow

  he drew his corn-cob pipe from between his gums and
with quavering enthusiasm wheezed

  ricketty whee ricketty whix

   anno -

       wow

  and the reunion habit has pene-
trated the undergraduate body so far
that even the freshmen hold reunions
between classes and continue them
till a late hour in the evening the
reunion system is based on a double-
unit known as chums for the
college life moves first by classes
then two-by-two damon  pythias

david  jonathan scylla  charyb-
dis klaw  erlanger

   chums college sentiment class-
yells songs all contribute to a some-
what adhesive combination which
has come to be known as the dear
old college story this form of
narrative is not confined to the

student-literature it breaks out now and then on the
stage or in current fiction and is altogether a close second
to the home-and-mawther song as a tickler among the
tear-vats to be successful the dear old college story
must be chock full of local color and must run something
like the following feeble and liberally expurgated sample
the twilight was falling over the dear old campus as the
dear old prexys carriage drove by students were strag-
gling in from all sides returning from their dinners at dear
old commons back to the dormitories alone in his room
sat dear old jim hooligan puffing at his dear old briar a
look of sadness on his handsome face around the dear old
wall were many dear old trophies dear old steins dear old
tennis-rackets dear old prom programs and the dear
old banjo which jim had twanged so merrily in the dear
old banjo club jim was weeping

  out by the dear old fence the dear old glee club was
sweetening the twilight with their close-harmony-barber-
shop-symphony strains the refrain of dear old boola
rose plaintively to jims open window

  i wish thug-dear old thug thomas-would
come home thought jim grasping the beer-keg doggedly

 thug had been jims confidante for four years now-who
else could advise him like thug-dear old thug

  there came a rap at the door ah thought jim that
must be the dear old fellow now the knob turned vio-
lently the figure of a woman stood in the door she
fumbled with her cloak a moment then laid a slip of paper
in jims hand it was the dear old laundry bill

     how is it mrs sullivan that this bill is twelve dollars  
asked jim sternly

  everything comes dear at dear old yale answered
the good woman

  and thereupon jim closed the dear old door softly in
her face

  another serious objection to the democracy evil as
i found it clinging to the tines of my muck-fork was

dear old  college vstory-

its influence on the ego of every young man it seems that
the human ego is a rather valuable thing and awfully hard
to get fixed when once out of order i never really appre-
ciated this until i heard about it in a lecture by a professor
of applied theology his talk was on yale democracy 
and he showed how the yale system was all wrong because
it made the young men in the same class do the same things
take the same studies think the same thoughts play the
same jokes in chapel till they had all distributed their
egos  so thoroughly that they always graduated as alike as
a thousand matches he said that you could tell a member
of the class of  by his left shoulder being higher than his

the r

e union

habit

right and that to deter-
mine a man of the class
of  all you had to do
was to look for an eye-
tooth missing on the left
side of the upper jaw

  because these words
were uttered by a clergy-
man i believed them ex-
plicitly furthermore

i put the speech down
as another black mark
against the democratic
machine and proceeded
to gather evidence in
less than an hour such is
the rapidity with which i
investigate i went over
the whole student-life
from grammar school
rush to tap day and
i found that students
chosen from the mass
for social honors like
the skull and bones or

wolfs head were not thus distinguished because they
were different from their fellows but because they were
more like them than any one else

  but as more eloquent than any experience of my own let
me give you an extract from the affidavit of w john
smythe of new canaan connecticut his experience will
prove how insidious how effacing is the effect of the demo-
cratic system on an impressionable lad any one wishing
to substantiate the details of the following story may call
on mr smythe at new canaan he has moved away i
believe

  before my boy archibald went to college the affi-
davit reads i called him to me and said my son you
come of a fast dying but proud race-the smythes the
smythes have been notable for strength of character rather
than beauty you have the smythe nose the smythe
knock-knees the smythe stutter and upon close examina-
tion i observe that you have the smythe strawberry mark
under the left ear remember my boy you are not like
other commonplace lads you are marked by a distinctive
homeliness which makes you a smythe and nothing else
dont let them-here i confess my voice broke into a
sob-dont let the yale spirit of democracy rob you of
your birthright good-by 

  archibald was gone nearly a year during which period
my wife and i longed almost continually to see the sym-
phonic smythe features of our dear boy at last toward
commencement week we could bear it no longer-so we
went quietly to new haven prepared to give archibald a
little surprise

  as we neared the campus we saw many sights which
disturbed our minds very much on elm street two young
men were running away with a large sign which said  meals
at all hours it was a cheap gaudy sign and i could not
understand why those youths who looked refined and
prosperous should have cared to steal anything so inex-
pensive suddenly a policeman leaped in front of them
from a doorway and cried halt the boys halted and
the policeman held them till the patrol drove up

  as the students were being put aboard the patrol
several of their fellows to the number of seventy-five or
eighty all well-raised youths apparently crowded about
the young men and shook them cordially by the hand
saying congratulations dear old boy-i knew youd
get in-and bully for you swipes well make you
president of the club

  i was naturally interested as well as shocked so i
inquired what they meant by the club

  why the criminals club said one of the students
 you cant get in unless youve ragged something and been
pinched for it these fellows have been trying to get in for
almost four years now they graduate in about two weeks

                       and theyll be proud to tell their folks
                       that they belong to such a nice club
                       i did not dare express my views
                       on such a custom goes on the affi-
                       davit but i sent my wife back to
                       the hotel and proceeded alone for
                       she has a weak heart and i feared the
                       worst presently along came a youth
                       who stopped suddenly and looked at
                       me with suspicious enthusiasm this
                       seemed especially strange because the
                       lads whom i had met up to now had
                       passed me by with indifference he
                       walked around me three times put
                       his finger on his lips and wrote down
                       something in a notebook after a
                       while he came up to me and asked
                       politely

pardon me but are you mr

              xi

the two young english officers
were convinced that ruiz was mj i
mad how do you say that-
tile loose-eh  but the doctor an

observant scotsman with much shrewdness and philosophy
in his character told me that it was a very curious case
of possession i met him many years afterward but he
remembered the experience very well he told me too
that in his opinion that woman did not lead gaspar ruiz
away into the practice of sanguinary treachery by direct
persuasion but by the subtle way of awakening and keep-
ing alive in his simple mind a burning sense of an irrep-
arable wrong maybe maybe but i would say that
she poured half of her vengeful soul into the strong clay
of that man as you may pour intoxication madness
poison into an empty cup

   if he wanted war he got it in earnest when our victo-
rious army began to return from peru systematic
operations were planned against this blot on the honor
and prosperity of our hardly-won independence general
robles commanded with his well-known ruthless severity
savage reprisals were exercised on both sides and no
quarter was given in the field having won my promo-
tion in the peru campaign i was a captain on the staff

  gaspar ruiz found himself hard pressed at the same
time we heard by means of a fugitive priest who had been
carried off from his presbytery and galloped eighty miles
to perform the christening ceremony that a daughter was
born to them to celebrate the
event i suppose he executed
one or two brilliant forays
clear away at the rear of our
forces and defeated the detach-
ments sent out to cut off his
retreat general robles had
nearly a stroke of apoplexy
from rage he took to railing
and storming at me about my
strong man and from our
impatience to end this inglori-
ous campaign i am afraid that
all we young officers became
reckless and agog to take undue
risks on service

  nevertheless slowly inch
by inch as it were our columns
were closing upon gaspar ruiz
though he had managed to raise
all the araucanian nation of
wild indians against us then
a year or more later our
government became aware
through its agents and spies
that he had actually entered
into alliance with carreras the
so-called dictator of the so-
called republic of mendoza on

the other side of the mountains whether he had a deep
political intention or whether he wished only to secure a
safe retreat for his wife and child while he pursued remorse-
lessly against us his war of surprises and massacres i
cannot tell the alliance however was a fact defeated
in his attempt to check our advance from the sea he
retreated with his usual swiftness and preparing for
another hard and hazardous tussle began by sending his
wife with the little girl across the pequena range of moun-
tains on the frontier of mendoza

  now carreras under the guise of politics and liberal-
ism was a scoundrel of the deepest dye and under his rule
the unhappy state of mendoza was the prey of thieves
robbers traitors and murderers he was under a noble
exterior a man without heart pity honor or conscience
he aspired to nothing but tyranny and though he would
have made use of gaspar ruiz for his nefarious designs
yet he soon became aware that to propitiate the chilean
government would answer his purpose better i blush
to say that he made proposals to our government to deliver
up on certain conditions the wife and child of the man who
had trusted him and that his offer was accepted so on her
way to mendoza over the pequena pass she was betrayed
by her escort and given up to the officer in command of

                         the chilean fort on the upland at the
                         foot of the main cordillera range

                     this atrocious transaction
might have cost me dear for as
a matter of fact i was a prisoner in gaspar ruiz camp
when he received the news i had been captured during
a reconnaissance my escort of a few troopers being speared
by indians of his bodyguard i was saved from the
same fate because he recognized my features just in
time no doubt my friends thought i was dead and i
would not have given much for my life at any time but
he treated me very well because he said i had always
believed in his innocence and had tried to serve him when
he was a victim of injustice

   and now was his speech to me you shall see that i
always speak the truth you are safe

    i did not think i was very safe when i was called up to
go to him one night he paced up and down like a wild
beast exclaiming betrayed betrayed he walked
up to me clenching his fists

  i could cut your throat

     will that give your wife back to you   i said as quietly
as i could

     and the chica he yelled out as if mad he fell into
a chair and laughed in frightful boisterous manner  oh
no you are safe 

   i assured him that his wifes life was safe but i did not
say what i was convinced of that he would never see her

                         again he wanted war to the
                         death and the war could only
                         end with his own death

                            he gave me a strange in-
                          explicable look and sat mut-
                          tering blandly in their
                          hands in their hands

                                i kept as still as death
                              what am i doing here
                              he cried and opening the door
                              he yelled out orders to saddle
                              and mount  what is it  he
                              stammered coming up to me
                              the pequena fort a fort of
                              palisades nothing i would
                              get her back if she were hidden
                              in the very heart of the moun-
                              tain   he amazed me by add-
                              ing with an effort i carried
                              her off in my two arms while
                              the earth trembled and the
                              child at least is mine

                            those were bizarre words
                          but i had no time to wonder

                             you shall go with me he
                           said violently i may want

the saturday evening post



  this was true enough between him and the rest of
incensed mankind there could be no communication held
according to the customs of honorable war

   in less than half an hour we were in the saddle flying
wildly through the night he had only an escort of twenty
men at his quarters but would not wait for more he
sent however messengers to peneleo the indian chief
then ranging in the foothills directing him to bring his
warriors to the uplands and meet him at the lake called
the eye of water near whose shores the frontier fort of
pequena was built

   we crossed the lowlands with that untried rapidity of
movement which had made gaspar ruiz raids so famous
we followed the lower valleys up to their precipitous heads
the ride was not without its dangers a cornice road on a
perpendicular wall of basalt wound itself around a but-
tressing rock and at last we emerged from the gloom of the
valley upon the upland of pequena

   it was a plain of green grass and thin flowering bushes
but high above our heads patches of snow hung in the
folds and crevices of the great walls
of rock the little lake was as round
as a staring eye the garrison of the
fort were just driving in their small herd
of cattle when we appeared then the
great wooden gates swung to and that
four-square inclosure of broad blackened
stakes pointed at the top and barely
hiding the grass roofs of the huts inside
seemed deserted empty without a
single soul

     but when summoned to surrender by
a man who at gaspars order rode fear-
lessly forward they answered by a volley
which rolled him and his horse over i
heard ruiz by my side grind his teeth

     it does not matter he said now
you go

   worn and faded as its rags were the
vestiges of my uniform were recognized
and i was allowed to approach within
speaking distance and then i had to wait
because a voice clamoring through a loop-
hole with joy and astonishment would
not allow me to place a word it was the
voice of major pajol an old friend he
like my other comrades had thought me
killed long time ago

     spur your horse man  he yelled in
the greatest excitement we will swing
the gate open for you

   i let the bridle fall out of my hand
and shook my head

  i am on my honor i cried

    to him  pajol shouted with infinite
disgust

   he promises you your life

  our life is our own and do you

santierra advise us to surrender to that
rastrero 

  no i shouted but he can cut
you off from water

    then she would be the first to suffer

you may tell him that look here-
this is all nonsense we shall dash out
and capture you

     you shall not catch me alive i said
firmly

   imbecile

      stop  i continued hastily  do not
open the gate  and i pointed at the
multitude of peneleos indians who cov-
ered the shores of the lake i had never
seen so many of these savages together

their lances seemed as numerous as
stalks of grass their hoarse voices made
a vast inarticulate sound like the murmur
of the sea

   my friend pajol was swearing to him-
self well then-go back  he shouted
exasperated but as i swung round he repented for i
heard him say hurriedly  shoot the fools horse before
he gets away

  he had good marksmen two shots rang out in the
very act of turning my horse staggered fell and lay still
as if struck by lightning i had my feet out of the stirrups
and rolled clear of him but i did not attempt to rise

  it was lying on the ground that i saw the masses of
indians begin to move they rode up in squadrons
trailing their long chusos then dismounted out of musket-
shot and throwing off their fur mantles advanced naked
to the attack stamping their feet and shouting in cadence
a sheet of flame flashed along the face of the fort without
checking their steady march they passed me and
crowded right up to the very stakes flourishing their
broad knives but this palisade was not fastened to-
gether with hide lashings but with cross-beams and long
iron nails which they could not cut this was too much

for them dismayed at the failure of their usual method
of forcing an entrance the heathen who had marched so
steadily against a murderous fire now broke and fled

  directly they had passed me on their advance i had
got up and had rejoined gaspar ruiz on a low ridge which
jutted uponthe plains the musketry of his own men had
covered the attack but now at a sign from him a trumpet
sounded the cease fire together we looked in silence at

the hopeless rout

  it must be a siege then he muttered and i de-
tected him wringing his hands stealthily

  but what sort of siege could it be there was no need
for me to repeat to him my friend pajols message he
dared not cut the water off from the besieged they had
plenty of meat and indeed if they had not had he would
have sent food into the stockade had he been able but
as a matter of fact it was we on the plain who were begin-
ning to feel the pinch of hunger

  peneleo the indian chief sat by our fire folded in his
ample mantle of guanaco skins he was an athletic

savage with an enormous square shock head of hair
resembling a straw beehive in shape and size and with
grave surly features in his bad broken spanish he re-
peated growling like a bad-tempered wild beast that
if an opening ever so small were made in the stockade his
men would march in and get the senora-not otherwise

  gaspar ruiz sitting opposite him kept his eyes fixed
on the fort night and day as it were in awful silence and
immobility meantime by runners from the lowlands
that arrived nearly every day we heard of the defeat of one
of his lieutenants on the maijoo valley scouts sent afar
brought news of a column of infantry advancing through
distant passes to the relief of the fort they were slow but
we could trace their toilful progress up the lower valleys
i wondered why he did not march to attack and destroy
this threatening force in some wild gorge fit for an ambus-
cade in accordance with his genius for partisan warfare
but his genius seemed to have left him to his despair

  it was obvious to me that he could not tear himself
away from the sight of the fort i protest to you seiiores
that i was moved almost to pity by the sight of this power-
less strong man sitting on the ridge indifferent to sun to
rain to cold to wind with his hands clasped round his
legs and his chin resting on his knees gazing-gazing-
gazing

   and the fort he kept his eyes fastened on was as still
and silent as himself the garrison gave no sign of life
they did not even answer the desultory fire of his men
directed at the loopholes

    one night as i strolled past him he without changing
his attitude spoke to me unexpectedly

     i have sent for a gun he said  i shall have time to
get her back and retreat before your robles manages to
crawl up here

    he had sent for a gun to the plains

   it was long in coming but at last it came it was a
seven-pounder field gun dismounted and lashed cross-
wise to two long poles it had been carried up the narrow

                 paths between two mules with ease his
    wild cry of exultation at daybreak when
    he saw the gun-escort emerge from the
    valley rings in my ears now

      but senoresy i have no words to
    depict his amazement his fury his
    despair and distraction when he heard
    that the animal loaded with the gun-
    carriage had during the last night march
    somehow or other tumbled down a preci-
    pice he broke into menaces of death
    and torture against the escort i kept
    out of his way all that day lying behind
    some bushes and wondering what he
    would do now retreat was what was
    left for him but he could not retreat

       i saw below me his artillerist jorge
     an old spanish soldier building up a sort
     of structure with heaped-up saddles the
     gun ready loaded was lifted on to that
     but at the act of firing the shot the whole
     thing collapsed and the bullet flew high
     above the stockade

      nothing more was attempted one
    of the ammunition-mules had been lost
    too and they had no more than six shots
    to fire-ample enough to batter down the
    gate providing the gun was well laid
    this was impossible without it being
    properly mounted there was no time
    or means to construct a carriage already
    every moment i expected to hear robles
    bugle-calls echo among the crags

       peneleo wandering about uneasily
    draped in his skins sat down for a
    moment near me growling his usual tale

      make an entrada-a hole if make
    a hole bueno if not make a hole then
    vamos-we must go away

      toward evening i saw with surprise
    the indians making preparation as for
    another assault their lines stood ranged
    in the shadow of the mountains on the
    plain in front of the first gate i saw a
    group of men swaying about in the same
    place

       i walked down the ridge disregarded
    the moonlight in the clear air of the
    uplands was bright as day but the intense
    shadows confused my sight and i could
    not make out what they were doing i
    heard the voice of jorge the artillerist
    say in a queer doubtful tone it is
    loaded senor

      then another voice in that group
    pronounced firmly the words  bring the
    riata here

       it was the voice of gaspar ruiz
then a silence fell in which the pop-
ping shots of the besieged army rang out
sharply who too had observed the group but the dis-
tance was too great and in the spatter of spent musket-
balls cutting up the ground the group opened closed
swayed giving me a glimpse of busy stooping figures in its
midst i drew nearer doubting whether this was a weird
vision a suggestive and insensate dream

  a strangely stifled voice commanded haul the

hitches tighter

   si senor several other voices answered in tones of

awed alacrity

   then the stifled voice said

     like this i must be free to breathe

  then there was a concerned noise of many men to-
gether

  help him up hombres steady under the other
arm

  that deadened voice ordered

the saturday evening post

august  

by harlow n higinbotham

the only safe course is to go to his jobber and give him full information

the opening of a new store in a community is always
the signal for a transference of trade which is most
deceptive to the proprietor of the new establishment
and if he is not a man of rare shrewdness and has not a natu-
ral faculty for credits he will be sure to make the remark
my trade is good-way beyond my expectations
judging from surface indications this observation is
warranted but why because the new store always
gets the customers who have accumulated debts or griev-
ances of some kind with the merchants who are already
established and who have sifted out their customers
instead of considering this sudden influx of trade as an
omen of prosperity it should be regarded in exactly the
opposite manner and so treated rightly considered it
is a red lantern sign of  danger ahead these rejections
from the other and established merchants are generally
shrewd enough to pay cash for the first or second and
perhaps the third month and then they begin to ask for
credit generally this is done very adroitly and the
request at the start will be to allow the amount to run
until saturday night or until the first of the month
when this time comes the game of partial payment will be
begun generally this is done on the basis of special pleas
alleging sickness or some phase or other of bad luck
but one thing may be depended upon this class of
customers will play the game in a progressive ratio and see
that the balance against them is increased week after week
and month after month what is the result

  when the storekeeper finally wakes up to the situation
he will find that the customer has him at a disadvantage
if i press him too hard reasons the storekeeper i am
likely to lose the whole account and therefore i must
deal gently with him

  there are few things more difficult in merchandizing
than to get a slow pay customer to reduce a large
balance by gradual payment in fact the storekeeper
who is shrewd enough to accomplish this is too keen to get
into such a situation with many of his customers the
merchant who gets a line of these undesirable customers is
under the necessity of keeping them carefully in his mind
and this as a rule means that he must  carry in his head 
the balance against them-or practically so not only
this but he must have his clerks do likewise this is not
so easy a matter as it might seem and in most cases the
storekeeper finds himself constantly allowing a slow
customer  to increase rather than forcing him to diminish
his balance

  inevitably the result of doing this kind of a business is
that the merchant is finally forced to ask his jobber to
carry him when he reaches this stage his first inclination
generally speaking is to think that by spreading out
and dealing with other jobbers as a temporary measure
he can cover his situation in the eyes of jobbers with
whom he has previously placed the burden of his trade

  instead of concealing his predicament this expedient
is a sure way of giving notice to the credit man of his old
jobbing house that he is in hard straits for no modern
credit man fails to understand the significance of this
process of spreading out when the merchant in question
is a little slow in his payments

  the only safe course for the storekeeper who finds him-
self in these straits is to go to his jobber and give him

editors note-this is the second of four papers on the success-
ful conduct of a retail business the third will appear shortly

          full information and to keep his indebtedness
          bunched together instead of scattered about
          if the man is worth saving the jobber prin-
          cipally interested will give him the support of
          extended credit and will also aid him by sound
          advice and practical suggestions suited to his
          individual needs

           when the unfortunate and deluded store-
         keeper follows an opposite course and attempts
         to cover his embarrassment by spreading out
         to new jobbers the result will be that the old
         jobber or perhaps some of the ones to whom
         he has shifted will realize that the race is to
         the swift and that the first man to close in on
         the unstable customer will be likely to get the
         most out of him

           i know one decidedly successful merchant
who determined to make his credits according
to a fixed principle and that he would not vary
his system under any conditions nominally
he was supposed to do a cash business but at
last felt that he must extend credit to a por-
tion of his customers he did it in this way
he would not even discuss the opening of an
account with a customer about whom he felt any doubt
whatever then when the man came in to arrange for an
account the merchant asked him how much of a line
cf credit do you wish me to give you

  well fifty dollars responded the customer

  and now about the question of time inquired the
storekeeper

  make it sixty days replied the customer

  very well answered the storekeeper i will give you
just what you ask for in the matter of credit and will
make the memorandum right here on the ledger page which
will carry your account but let us understand one thing
clearly right from the start you are not to ask me for
five cents more than the amount of credit i have given you
nor are you to ask me for an extension of time certainly
you cant complain at my making this rule rigid when
i have given you at the beginning all that you have
asked for you have set your own stakes and cannot
reasonably resent it if you are asked to abide by them
this system of credit worked admirably in the case of the
storekeeper to whom i referred for the reason that he held
every customer rigidly to the limitations fixed at the outset
though the storekeeper should keep the most careful and
constant watch upon every one in his employ he should be
slow to accuse a clerk or any other member of his force of
dishonesty lax methods of accounting are often
if not generally the cause of apparent discrepan-
cies which lead to suspecting crookedness on the
part of employees the merchant who does not
keep his books in a condition which will tell him
at any time just exactly his standing to a dollar
is in a poor position to bring accusations against
a clerk or cashier unless he has absolute knowl-
edge of that employees dishonesty or misconduct

  it is scarcely too much to say that the first
impulse on the part of the storekeeper who arrives
at the conclusion that there must be a  leak some-
where in his business is to accuse a clerk of
stealing there is neither justice nor common-
sense in acting upon this impulse without solid
facts upon which to base the accusation many
a merchant by hasty action of this sort has not
only deprived himself of a useful assistant but
he has also shamed and humiliated if not actually
disgraced a clerk entitled to respect and confi-
dence if a merchant employs his relatives he
should on their account as much as his own
watch them with the same care that he would a
clerk entirely unrelated to him not only does
this course establish a proper sense of responsi-
bility but it also promotes the feeling among his
help that he is fair and impartial again if a
situation arises in the store which seems clearly to
indicate that some employee is indulging in pecu-
lations the relative of the proprietor is in a far
better position under a system of impartial scru-
tiny than if the head of the establishment took
it for granted that it was only necessary for him
to watch those of his help not connected with him
by family ties

   a practically universal source of loss to country
merchants is the failure to charge all the goods
which go out of the store it is scarcely too much
to say that there is not a single country store in

existence which does not suffer a loss of one to five per
cent of its business from this cause consequently the
first thing for the wide-awake storekeeper to do is to settle
it with himself that not a dimes worth of goods shall go out
of his establishment unless charged or paid for

  this resolution cannot be made really effective unless
the storekeeper has determination enough to resort to the
radical measure of throwing out the time-honored old-style
day-book as a book of original entry and substituting in
its place the duplicate carbon-slip system no matter
how frequently and emphatically he may tell his clerks to
charge every item  if the house is on fire they will sooner
or later begin to leave items uncharged if the old day-book
system is adhered to the clerk for example is standing
in front of the store doing up a package of fruit for a charge
customer when a carriage drives up and its occupant
beckons to the clerk to come to the edge of the curbstone
in the course of taking the order of the lady in the carriage
he naturally forgets to charge the fruit which he hastily
pushed into the hands of the other customer if an
instance of this kind has occurred once it has ten thousand
times in the history of storekeeping and that is putting it
very mildly as a matter of fact it is a daily occurrence
in almost every town in the united states there is no
remedy for it excepting to change the system

  each clerk should be supplied with a little flimsy book
of the style used by all clerks in modern city department
stores each leaf of this book is made up of a stub and
detachable leaf with a sheet of carbon between so that
the entries on one are manifolded upon the other at the
same writing

   there is room for several items on each slip and stub and
the stubs with their corresponding slips are numbered
consecutively throughout the book the rule for handling
these books is that each purchaser whether a charge or a
cash customer must receive along with his goods the slip
containing the memorandum of his purchases the
customers very soon learn that they are expected to take
this memorandum and consequently they quickly fall
into the way of expecting it

  this system has various other advantages beyond that
of making it more difficult for the clerk to let goods go
without charging them as each clerk has his individual
charge book it is a very easy matter for the storekeeper to
keep accurate account of the business done by each clerk
in other words he has readily at his hand the total of each
clerks sales for a day a week a month or a year again
it should be remembered that the mere volume of a clerks

concluded on page 

this class of customers will play the game in a progressive ratio

chance

m

      xii- continued

ortimer had
gone from his in-
terview with plank
directly to quarriers office
missing the gentleman he
was seeking by such a small
fraction of a minute that
he realized they must have
passed one another in the
elevators he ascending while
quarrier was descending

mortimer turned and hur-
ried to the elevator hoping

to come up with quarrier in the rotunda or possibly in the
street outside but he was too late and furious to think
of the time he had wasted with plank he crawled into a
hansom and bade the driver take him to a number he gave
designating one of the new limestone basement houses
on the upper west side

  all the way uptown as he jolted about in his seat he
angrily regretted the meeting with plank even in spite of
the check what demon had possessed him to boast-to
display his hand when there had been no necessity  plank
was still ready to give him aid at a crisis-had always been
ready time enough when plank turned stingy to use
persuasion time enough when plank attempted to dodge
him to employ a club and now for no earthly reason
intoxicated with his own vanity catering to his own long-
smoldering resentment he had used his club on a willing
horse-deliberately threatened a man whose gratitude
had been good for many a check yet

  ass that i am fumed mortimer now when im
stuck ill have to go at him with the club if i want any
money out of him confound him hes putting me in a
false position hes trying to make it look like extortion
i wont do it im no blackmailer ill starve before i go
to him again no blundering clumsy dutchman can
make a blackmailer out of me by holding hands with that
scoundrelly wife of mine thats the reason he did it too
between them they are trying to make my loans from
plank look like blackmail it would serve them right if i
took them up-if i called their bluff and stuck plank up
in earnest but i wont to please them i wont do any
dirty thing like that to humor them not much

  he lay back rolling about in the jouncing cab scowling
at space

  not much he repeated ill shake down quarrier
though ill make him pay for his treachery-scaring me
out of amalgamated that will be restitution not
extortion

  he was the angrier because he had been for days screwing
up his courage to the point of seeking quarrier face to face
he had not wished to do it the scene and his own attitude
in it could only be repugnant to him although he con-
tinually explained to himself that it was restitution not
extortion

  but whatever it was he didnt like to figure in it and he
had hung back as long as circumstances permitted but
his new lodgings and his new friends were expensive
and plank he supposed was off somewhere fishing so
he hung on as long as it was possible then exasperated by
necessity started for quarriers office only to miss him by
a few seconds because he was fool enough to waste his
temper and his opportunity in making an enemy out of a
friend i

  oh he groaned what an ass i am and he got
out of his cab and entered a very new limestone basement
house with red geraniums blooming on the window-sill

  the interior of the house was attractive in a rather
bright new clean fashion there seemed to be a great
deal of white woodwork about a wilderness of slender
white spindles supporting the dark rich mahogany hand-
rail of the stairways elaborate white grilles between

colonial mantel reflected a glass chandelier and paneled
walls hung with pale blue silk

  all was new very clean very quiet the maid too who
appeared at the sound of the closing door and took his hat
and gloves was as newly groomed as the floors and wood-
work and so noiseless as to be conspicuous in her swift
silent movements

  and into the tinted light framed in palest blue and white
waddled mortimer appropriate as a june-bug scrambling
in a svres teacup

  anybody here he growled leering into the drawing-
room at a tiny grand piano cased in unvarnished circassian
walnut

  there is nobody at home sir said the maid

  the southern sun was warm in the room the windows
open but not a silken hanging stirred

  the maid left and returned with an apple cut into thin
wafers and a decanter of port and mortimer lay back in
his chair sopping his apple in the thick crimson wine until
the apple was all gone and the decanter three-fourths
empty

  it was very still in the room-so still that mortimer
opening his eyes at longer and longer intervals to peer at the
door finally opened them no more

   

  it was still daylight when mortimer awoke conscious
of people about him as he opened his eyes a man laughed
several people seated by the windows joined in then
straightening up with an effort something tumbled from
his head to the floor and he started to rise

  oh look out leroy dont step on my hat cried
a girls voice and he sank back in his chair gazing stupidly
around

  hello you people he said amused i guess ive
been asleep oh is that you millbank whose hat was
that-yours lydia

  he got on to his massive legs and went over to shake
hands with a gravity becoming the ceremony

   how dye do miss hutchinson  thought you were at
asbury park how de do miss del garcia have you
been out in millbanks motor yet

  we broke down at mcgowans pass said miss del
garcia laughing the laugh that had made her so attractive
in a word to the wise

  muddy gasoline nodded millbank tersely-an iron-
jawed overgroomed man of forty with a florid face
shaved blue

  wte passed mr planks big touring-car observed
lydia vyse shifting tinto her japanese spaniel to the
couch and brushing the black and white hairs from her
automobile coat how much does a car like that cost
leroy

  about twenty-five thousand he said gloomily then
looking up hold on millbank dont be going why
cant you all dine with us never mind your car ours
is all right and well run out into the country for dinner
how about it miss del garcia

  but both miss del garcia and miss hutchinson had
accepted another invitation in which millbank was also
included

       they stood about veils
     floating leather-decorated
     coats thrown back linger-
     ing for a while to talk the
     garage talk which fascinates
     people of their type then
     millbank looked at the clock
     made his adieus to lydia
     nodded significantly to
     mortimer and followed the
     others downstairs

      there was something
amiss with his motor for it
made a startling racket in
the street finally plunging forward with a kick

  lydia laughed as the two young girls in the tonneau
turned to nod to her in mock despair then she came
running back upstairs holding her skirt free from her

hurrying little feet

  well she inquired as mortimer turned back from

the window to confront her

  nothing doing he said with a sombre smile

  she looked at him slowly divesting herself of her light
leather-trimmed coat

  i missed him said mortimer

  she flung the coat over a chair stood a moment her
fingers busy with her hairpegs then sat down on the couch
taking tinto into her lap she was very pretty dark
slim marvelously graceful in her every movement

  i missed him repeated mortimer

  cant you see him to-morrow she asked

  i suppose so said mortimer slowly oh i hate this

business

 hasnt he misused your confidence hasnt he taken
your money she asked it may be unpleasant for you
to make him unbelt but youre a coward if you dont
easy easy now muttered mortimer im going
to shake it out of him i said i would and i will

  i should hope so its yours

  certainly its mine i wish id held fast now i never
supposed plank would take hold it was that driveling
old bel wether who scared me stiff the minute i saw
him scurrying to cover like a singed cat i was fool enough
to climb the first tree ive had my lesson

  i hope youll give howard his somebody ought to
she said quietly

  about half-past eight they dined in a white and pink
dining-room furnished in dull gray walnut and served
by a stealthy white-haired pink-skinned butler chiefly
remarkable because it seemed utterly impossible to get a
glimpse of his eyes they had planned to go for a spin in
mortimers motor after dinner but in view of the quarrier
fiasco neither was in the mood for anything

  mortimer as usual ate and drank heavily he was a
carnivorous man and liked plenty of thick fat underdone
meat as for lydia her appetite was as erratic as her
own impulses her table always wastefully elaborate
no doubt furnished subsistence for all the relatives of her
household below stairs and was sufficient for any ambitious
butler to make a decent profit on

  do you know leroy she observed as they left the
table and sauntered back into the pale blue drawing-room
do you know that my servants havent been paid for
three months

  oh for heavens sake he expostulated dont
begin that sort of thing  

  i only mentioned it she said carelessly

  i heard you all right im dead tired of being up
against it every day of my life when a man has anything
somebody gets it before he can side-step when a mans
dead broke theres nobody in sight to touch

  you had an opportunity to make howard pay you

  didnt i tell you i missed him

  yes what are you going to do

 do

    of course you are going to do something i suppose   
they had reached the gold and green room above
lydia began pacing the length of a beautiful kermanshah
rug-a pale delicate marvel of rose and green on a ground
of ivory-lovely but doomed to fade sooner than the
pretty woman who trod it with restless silk-shod feet

  mortimer had not responded to her last question she
said presently you have never told me how you intend
to make him pay you back

  what inquired mortimer turning very red

  i said that you havent yet told me how you intend
to make howard return the money you lost through his
juggling with your stock

  i dont exactly know myself admitted mortimer
still overflushed  i mean to put it to him squarely as a
debt of honor that he owes i asked him whether to
invest he never warned me not to he is morally
responsible any man who would sit there and nod
monotonously like a mandarin knowing all the while what
he was doing to wreck the company and let a friend put
into a rotten concern all the cash he could scrape together
is a swindler

   i think so too she said studying the rose arabesques
in the rug

   there was a little click of her teeth when she ended her
inspection and looked across at mortimer something in
her expressionless gaze seemed to reassure him and give
him a confidence he may have lacked

  i want him to understand that i wont swallow that
sort of contemptible treatment asserted mortimer
lighting a thick dark cigar

   i hope youll make him understand she said seating
herself and resting her clasped brilliantly-ringed hands
in her lap

   oh i will-never fear he has abused my confidence
abominably he has practically swindled me lydia
dont you think so

  she nodded

  ill tell him so too blustered mortimer shaking
himself into an upright posture and laying a pudgy
clenched fist on the table im not afraid of him hell
find that out too i know enough to stagger him not
that i mean to use it im not going to have him think
that my demands on him for my own property resemble
extortion

extortion she repeated

yes i dont want him to think im trying to intim-
idate him i wont have him think im a grafter but
ive half a mind to shake that money out of him in one way
or another

   he struck the table and looked at her for further sign of
approval

  im not afraid of him he repeated i wish he were
here and id tell him so

   she said coolly i was wishing that too

   for a while they sat silent preoccupied avoiding each
others direct gaze when she rose he started watching
her in a dazed way as she walked to the telephone

   shall i she asked quietly turning to him her hand
on the receiver

  wait w-what are you going to do he stammered
  call him up shall i

   a dull throb of fright pulsed through him

   you say you are not afraid of him leroy

no he said with an oath i am not go ahead
she unhooked the receiver after a second or two her
low even voice sounded there came a pause she
rested one elbow on the walnut shelf the receiver tight to
her ear then

  mr quarrier please    yes mr howard
quarrier    no no name say it is on business
of immediate importance    very well then
you may say that miss vyse insists on speaking to him

   yes ill hold the wire

   she turned the receiver at her ear and looked narrowly
at mortimer

  wont he speak to you he demanded

  im going to find out hush a moment  and in the
same calm almost childish voice oh howard is that
you yes i know i promised not to do this but that was
before things happened    well what am i to do
when it is necessary to talk to you    yes it is
necessary  i tell you it is necessary   

i	am sorry it is not convenient for you to talk to me but i
really must ask you to listen    no i shall not
write i want to talk to you to-night-now  yes you
may come here if you care to  i think you had
better come howard    because i am liable to
continue ringing your telephone until you are willing to
listen    no there is nobody here i am alone
what time    very well i shall expect you
good-by

  she hung up the receiver and turned to mortimer
hes coming up at once did i say anything to scare
him particularly

  one things sure as preaching said mortimer hes
a coward-and im glad of it he added naively relight-
ing his cigar which had gone out

  if he comes up in his motor hell be here in a few
minutes she said suppose you take your hat and go
out i dont want him to think what he will think if he
walks into the room and finds you waiting you have
your key leroy walk down the block and when you
see him come in give him five minutes

  her voice had become a little breathless and her color
was high mortimer too seemed apprehensive things
had suddenly begun to work themselves out too swiftly

  do you think thats best he faltered looking about
for his hat tell merkle that nobody has been here if
quarrier should ask him do you think were doing it in
the best way lydia it smells of a put-up job to me
but i guess its all right its better for me to just happen
in isnt it dont forget to put merkle wise

   he descended the stairs hastily merkle of the invisible
eyes held his hat and gloves and opened the door for him

   once on the dark street his impulse was to flee-get out
get away from the whole business a sullen shame was
pumping the hot blood up into his neck and cheeks he
strove to find an inoffensive name for what he was propos-
ing to do but ugly terms synonym after synonym crowded
in to characterize the impending procedure and he walked
on angrily half-frightened looking back from moment to
moment at the house he had just left

  on the corner he halted breathing spasmodically for
he had struck a smarter pace than he had been aware of

  few people passed him once he caught a glimmer of
a policemans buttons along the park wall and an un-
pleasant shiver passed over him at the same moment
an electric hansom flew noiselessly past him he shrank
back into the shadow of a porte-cochere the hansom
halted before the limestone basement house a tall
figure left it stood a moment in the middle of the sidewalk
then walked quickly to the front door it opened and
the man vanished

  the hansom still waited at the door mortimer his
hands shaking looked at his watch by the light of the
electric bulbs flanking the gateway under which he stood

  there was not much time in which to make up his mind
yet his fright was increasing to a pitch which began to
enrage him with that cowards courage which it is impos-
sible to reckon with

  he had missed quarrier once to-day when he had been
keyed to the encounter was he going to miss him again
through sheer terror  besides was not quarrier a coward 
besides was it not his own money had he not been
vilely swindled by a pretended friend urging lashing
himself into a heavy shuffling motion he emerged from the
porte-cochere and lurched off down the street no time
to think now no time for second thought for hesitation
for weakness he had waited too long already he had
waited ten minutes instead of five was quarrier going to
escape again was he going to get out of the house
before-

  fumbling with his latch-key but with sense enough
left to make no noise he let himself in passed silently
through the reception-hall and up to the drawing-room
floor where for a second he stood listening then some-
thing of the perverted sportsman sent the blood quivering
into his veins he had him he had run him down
the game was at bay

  an inrush of exhilaration steadied him he laid his
hand on the banister and mounted gloves and hat-brim
crushed in the other hand when he entered the room
he pretended to see only lydia

   hello  he said laughing are you surprised to-

  at that moment he caught sight of quarrier and the
start he gave was genuine enough never had he seen in a
mans visage such white concentration of anger

  quarrier  he stammered for his acting was becoming
real enough to supplant art

  quarrier had risen his narrowing eyes moved from
mortimer to lydia then reverted to the man in the com-
bination

  rather unexpected isnt it said mortimer staring
at quarrier

   is it returned quarrier in a low voice

  i suppose so sneered mortimer did you expect
to find me here

  no did you expect to find me asked the other
with an emphasis unmistakable

  what do you mean demanded mortimer hoarsely

 what the deuce do you mean by asking me if i expected
to find you here if i had id not have traveled down to
your office to-day to see you id have come here for you
quarrier motionless white to the lips turned his eyes
from one to the other

it doesnt look very well does it asked mortimer
and he stood there smiling danger written all over him
here you are handsome jolly and irresistible as ever
quarrier looked at lydia and his lips moved you
asked me to come he said

  no you offered to i wished to talk to you over the
wire but-her lip curled and she shrugged her shoulders
- you seemed to be afraid of something or other

  i couldnt talk to you in my own house with guests in
the room 

  why not did i say anything your fashionable
guests might take exception to am i likely to do any-
thing of that kind you coward

  quarrier stood very still then noiselessly turned and
made one step toward the door

  one moment interposed mortimer blandly as
long as i traveled downtown to see you and find you here
so unexpectedly i may as well take advantage of this
opportunity to regulate a little matter you dont mind
our talking shop for a moment lydia  thank you its
just a little business matter between mr quarrier and
myself-a matter concerning a few shares of stock which i
once held in one of his companies bought at par and

tumbled to ten and- what is the fraction quarrier

 forget

  quarrier thought deeply for a moment then he raised
his head looking full at mortimer and under his silky
beard an edge of teeth glimmered did you wish me to
take back those shares at par he asked

  exactly i knew you would i knew youd see it in
that way cried mortimer heartily confound it all
quarrier ive always said you were that sort of man-that
youd never let a friend in on the top floor and kick him
clear to the cellar as a matter of fact i sold out at ten
and three-eighths wait heres a pencil lydia give
me that pad on your desk here you are quarrier its
easy enough to figure out how much you owe me

  and as quarrier slowly began tracing figures on the pad
mortimer rambled on growing more demonstrative and
boisterous every moment  its white of you quarrier-
ill say that legally of course you could laugh at me
but ive always said your business conscience would never
let you stand for this sort of thing you can talk and
talk ive told people many a time but youll never
convince me that howard quarrier hasnt a heart no
by jinks they couldnt make me believe it and heres
my proof-heres my vindication lydia would you mind
hunting up that check-book i left here before din-

  he had made a mistake the girl flushed he choked
up and cast a glance at quarrier but quarrier if he
heard made no motion of understanding perhaps it
had not been necessary to convince him of the conspiracy

  when he had finished his figures he reviewed them
tracing each total with his pencils point then quietly
handed the pad to mortimer who went over it and nodded
that it was correct

  lydia rose quarrier said without looking at her
i have a blank check with me may i use one of these
pens

  so he had brought a check had he supposed that a
check might be necessary was he prepared to meet any
demand of hers too even before mortimer appeared

  as long as you have a check with you howard said
lydia quietly suppose you simply add to mr mortimers
amount what you had intended to offer me

  he stared at her without answering

  that little remembrance dont you recollect

  no said quarrier

  why howard didnt you promise me all sorts of
things when i wanted to go to your friend mr siward and
explain that it was not his fault i got into the patroons
club dont you remember i felt dreadfully that he
was expelled -that i was simply wild to write to the gov-
ernors and tell them how i took merkles clothes and drove
to the club and waited until i saw a lot of men go in and
then crowded in with the push

  mortimer was staring at quarrier out of his protruding
eyes the girl leaned forward deliberate self-possessed
the red lips edged with growing scorn

  	that was a dirty trick said mortimer heavily he
took the pad added a figure passed it to lydia and she
coolly wrote a total underscoring it heavily

  that is the amount she said

  quarrier looked at the pad which she had tossed upon the
desk then he slowly wetted his pen with ink and laying
the loose check flat began to fill it in afterward he dried
it and reading it carefully pushed it aside and rose

  it wouldnt be advisable for you to stop payment you
know observed mortimer insolently lying back in his
chair and stretching his legs

  i know said quarrier pausing to turn on them a
deathly stare then he went away after a while they
heard the door close but there was no sound from the
electric hansom and mortimer rose and walked to the
window

  hes gone he said

the heat which had been severe in june driving the
last fashionable loiterer into the country continued
fiercely throughout july august was stifling the chest-
nut leaves in the parks curled up and grew brittle the
elms were blotched brown stretches scarred the lawns
the blazing color of the geranium beds seemed to intensify
the heat like a bed of living coals

  nobody who was anybody remained in town-except
some wealthy business men and their million-odd em-
ployees but the million being nobodies didnt count
the saturday evening post



  the house of mrs mortimer was closed and boarded up
the caithness mansion was closed the ferralls the
bonnesdels the pages the shannons mrs vendennings
all were sealed up like vaults a caretaker apparently
guarded major belwethers house peeping out at intervals
from behind the basement windows as for planks great
pile of masonry edging the outer hundreds in the north
several lighted windows were to be seen in it at night and a
big yellow and black touring-car whizzed downtown from
its bronze gateway every morning with perfect regularity

  for there was a fight on that had steadily grown hotter
with the weather and plank had little time to concern
himself with the temperature or to mop his red features
over the weather bureau report harrington and quarrier
were after him horse foot and dragoons harrington had
even taken a house at seabright in order to be near in per-
son  and quarriers move from long island to shotover
house was not so flippant as it might appear for he had his
private car there and a locomotive at black fells crossing
station and he was with-
in striking distance of
rochester utica syracuse
and albany which was
what harrington thought
necessary

  the vast unseen machin-
ery set in motion by har-
rington and quarrier had
begun to grind in may
and at the first audible
rumble the aspect of
things financial in the
country changed a few
industrials began to rocket
nobody knew why but
the markets first tremor
left it baggy and spineless
and the reaction already
overdue became a sodden
and soggy slump nobody
knew why

the noise of the fray in
the papers which had first
excited then stunned the
outside public continued
in a delirium of rumor re-
port forecast and sum-
ming up at the weeks end

  scare-heads involving
 everybody and everything
 from the district-attorney
 to planks office boy suc-
 ceeded one another

 planks name headed col-
 umn after column already
 becoming familiar in the
 society and financial sec-
 tions it began to appear
 in neighboring paragraphs

 who was plank  and the
 papers told people with
 more or less inaccuracy
 humor or sarcasm what
 was he trying to do the
 papers tried to tell that
 too making a pretty close
 guess with comments
 good-natured or ill-
 natured according to cir-
 cumstances over which
 somebody ought to have
 some control what was
 harrington trying to do to
 plank-if he was trying to
 do anything they told
 that pretty clearly what
 was quarrier going to do to
 plank that also they
 explained in lively detail

 a few clergymen who stuck
 to their churches began to
 volunteer pulpit opinions
 concerning the ethics of
 the battle a minister
 who was generally sup-
 posed to make an unmitigated nuisance of himself in poli-
 tics dealt plank an unexpected blow by saying that he
 was a  hero some papers called him  hero  plank for
 a while but soon tired of it or forgot it under the stress of
 the increasing heat

   besides plank scarcely noticed what the press said of
 him he was too busy his days were full days brimming
 over deep into the night brokers lawyers sycophants
 tipsters treacherous ex-employees of quarrier detectives
 up-state petty officials lobbyists from albany newspaper
 men men from wall street broad street mulberry street
 forty-second street-all these he saw in units relays regi-
 ments-either at his offices or after dinner-and sometimes

after midnight in his own house and these were only a
few picked from the interested or disinterested thousands
who besieged him with advice importunity threats and
attempted blackmail and he handled them all in turn
stolidly but with decision his obstinate under lip pro-
truded further and further with rare recessions his heavy
head was like the lowered head of a bull undaunted
inexorable slow to the verge of stupidity at times at times
swift as a startled tiger this new amazing personality
steadily developing looming higher heavier athwart the
financial horizon-in stature holding his own among giants
then growing gradually inch by inch-dominated his
surrounding level sky-line

  the youth in him was the tragedy to the old the sudden
silence of the man the danger to the secretive harrington
was already an old man quarriers own weapon had
always been secrecy but the silence of plank confused him
for he had never learned to parry well anothers use of his
own weapon the left-handed swordsman dreads to cross

 with a man who fights with the left hand and harrington
 hoary seamed scarred maimed in onslaughts of long-
 forgotten battles looked long and hard upon this wraith
 of his own dead youth which now rose towering to confront
 him menacing him with the armed point of the same shield
 behind which he himself had so long found shelter-the
 law

   the closing of the courts enforced armed truces along
 certain lines of planks battle-front the adjournment of
 the legislature emptied albany once it was rumored that
 plank had passed an entire morning with the governor of
 the greatest state in the union and that the conference
 was to be repeated a swarm of newspaper men settled

about the governors summer cottage at saratoga but
they learned nothing nor could they find a trace of planks
tracks in the trodden trails of the great spa

  besides the racing had begun desmond burbank
sneed and others of the gilded guild had opened new club-
houses  the wretched half-starved natives in the surround-
ing hills were violating the game-laws to distend the
paunches of the overfed with five-inch troutlings and grouse
and woodcock slaughtered out of season so there was
plenty of copy for newspaper men without the daily specu-
lative paragraphs devoted to the doings of beverly plank
some scandal too-but newspapers never touch that
and after all it was nobodys affair that leroy mortimer
drove a large yellow-and-black french touring-car new
model all over saratoga county perhaps the simi-
larity of machines gave rise to the rumor of planks pres-
ence  perhaps not because the car was often driven by a
tall slender girl with dark eyes and hair and nobody ever
saw that sort of pretty woman in planks motor or saw

                            leroy mortimer for many
    days without a companion
    of that species

      mortimers health was
    excellent the races had
    not proved remunerative
    however and his new
    motor-car was horribly ex-
    pensive and he began to
    be seriously afraid that by
    the end of august he would
    be obliged to apply to
    quarrier once more for
    some slight token of that
    gentlemans good will

      plank it was known
    had opened his great house
    at black fells his serv-
    ants gamekeepers were
    there his stables kennels
    greenhouses model stock-
    farm-all had been put in
    immaculate condition
    pending the advent of the
    master but plank had
    not appeared his new sea-
    going steam yacht still lay
    in the east river and at
    rare intervals a significant
    glimmer of bunting dis-
    closed the owners pres-
    ence aboard for an hour
    or two that was all
    however and the cliff-
    watchers at shotover
    house and the fells looked
    seaward in vain for the big
    siwanoa as yacht after
    yacht heralded by the
    smudge on the horizon
    turned from a gray speck
    to a white one and crept
    in from the sea to anchor

      the ferralls were at
    shotover with their first
    installment of guests
    sylvia was there quarrier
    expected-because kemp
    ferralls break with him
    was not a social one and
    graces real affection for
    sylvia blinded neither her
    nor her husband to the
    material and social im-
    portance of the intimacy
    siward was not invited
    neither had an invitation
    to him been even discussed
    in view of what grace was
    aware of and what every-
    body knew concerning the
    implacable relations exist-
    ing between him and
    howard quarrier

      bridge yachting and
motoring were the august
sports the shooting set had not yet arrived of course in
fact there was still another relay expected before the season
opened and brought the shooting coterie for the first two
weeks but sylvia was expected to last through and hold
over with a brief interlude for a week-end at lenox so
was quarrier and grace always animated by a lively but
harmless malice hoped to heaven that plank might arrive
before quarrier left because she adored the tension of
situations and was delightedly persuaded that plank was
more than able to hold his own with her irritating cousin

oh to see them together in a small room she sighed
ecstatically in sylvias ear id certainly poke them up if

a work and no play

the short-story contest with thousand-dollar prizes has
been run into the ground it is doubtful whether
such a contest ever brought forth a really great story or
one that would never have seen the light of day except
for the bait of the big prize offered there is a large
steady market for good stories and it is easy enough to
break into the market if the author can furnish the right
kind of goods with the theatre it is different actors
and managers are supposed to lie awake nights in their
anxiety to discover new plays but the young playwright
seems to find a good deal of trouble in attracting the atten-
tion of the anxious actor or manager

  the market for plays is not an easy one to break into
for this reason a play contest-such as the new theatre
organization of chicago has announced-may produce
some interesting results the new theatre itself is a
modest attempt to improve the conditions of theatrical
production by organizing a stock company to give during
a season of thirty weeks fifteen plays that shall be worth
seeing they have a guarantee fund an advance sub-
scription sale of tickets and a board of trustees composed
of gentlemen interested in the theatre it is organized
along the lines of the famous thomas orchestra associa-
tion that has given chicago one of the two or three best
orchestras in the world and housed it in its own hall

  the play contest is for the benefit of the young american
dramatist the new theatre wants only american plays
of modern life and acting plays the prize will be an
adequate production and if successful a two-weeks run
with the usual royalties the rights to remain with the
author it is not a huge prize compared with the five-
thousand-dollar-story contest prize but it should be
enough the budding dramatist is after production if he

 can get his work before the public suitably he is confident
 that some other power will see its opportunity and seize it
 all the budding dramatist wants is publicity it is well
 to limit the contest to plays of american life that is
 what the new dramatist should be writing about the
 regular theatres offer enough of the imported british
 society play or french adaptations the home field has
 hardly been touched and when the public finds that good
 plays can be written about the life they know there will
 probably be less chance for the present sort of rot if the
 new theatre contest brings out one strong american play
 it will be a great success

whats the news 

everybody has a grievance against the newspapers
dog days aggravate many grievances some object
to this characteristic some to that but we believe the
great mass of objection arises subconsciously from the fact
that the papers are dull consider your least-hated daily
there is the inevitable family jar from pittsburg does
it really interest you there is the full page of sporting
events which may be interesting but only an expert can
understand the jargon in which it is written there is
the society department-the leading items concerning
the   smart set   gathered at considerable pains and expense
while the paragraphs concerning the more numerous stupid
set are sent in or brought personally to the office by the
ladies whose important departures for the seaside or returns
thence are thus certified to a weary world

   the alleged function of a newspaper is to print the news
 what is the news why whatever is in the papers of
 course it is made news by the simple fact that the
 papers print it every editor will tell you with pride
 that his paper daily throws away as much matter as it
 publishes our wonder why it doesnt try throwing
 away what it prints and printing what it throws away is
 provoked by no spirit of levity but by an earnest con-
 sideration of the possibility of improving one of our greatest
 institutions

   in every large city there are newspapers that nobody
reads-or nobody worth mentioning these are exactly
the papers that most religiously print the news-that
is the happenings which a consensus of newspaper judg-
ment has approved as the staples of the trade and which
accordingly are furnished by the associated press and
local news bureaus other papers have a great measure
of popularity these are the ones that print something
besides the staple news the conclusion is inevitable
much of the so-called news is a bore and an affliction
everybody has a grievance against the newspapers be-
cause even the best of them print so much of it

the first offering of panama canal bonds-
in amount-brought a premium of about three and a
half per cent the old two per cents have held at a premium
of three to four per cent for a long time and unless a great
business depression intervenes there is no doubt that the
remainder of the canal issue whatever the amount may
be can be sold at a premium

   say we expend two hundred millions in digging the canal
the fixed charge devolving upon the people of the united
states will be four millions a year or less than three per
cent of the annual pension-roll-which nobody minds
it is an interesting suggestion of the power of a great
government-or of our government for no other could
match this feat in borrowing british government bonds
bearing two and a half per cent interest sell at a discount
of about twelve per cent the canal bonds are available
as a basis for national bank circulation on the same terms
as the old twos-the tax on such circulation being only
one-half of one per cent a year experts expect that the
canal issue therefore will result in an important expansion
of national bank circulation hence of the total stock of
money in the country thanks largely to the old two per
cents national bank notes in circulation increased in the
sum of  in the fiscal year ending july 
most persons are familiar with the axiom that prosperity
begins with spending money and going in debt un-
fortunately only a few of us are able to adjust the formula
successfully to our petty individual cases

art exploded theory

the purpose of the war department to establish a
small powder factory of its own is interesting out of
proportion to the size of the plant we used to hear a
great deal more than we do now about the efficiency of
private as compared with government management it
was said many times that a private corporation could
conduct the postal business of the country more econom-
ically than the government did probably that statement
so far as it goes is still true but nobody who has intelli-
gently studied contemporaneous trust history can really
doubt that if the postal business were in the hands of a
typical private corporation the public would get a worse

service at a higher cost-not because the management
would be incompetent but because it would be greedy
the powder trust is believed to be admirably efficient
but that does not mean cheap powder it means big
profits

   the secret is now fairly out all those multi-millionaires
 of so new growth did not get their money from fairy god-
 mothers they sequestrated it in one way or another
 out of the wealth of the country mr carnegies three
 or four hundred millions were contributed by the con-
 sumers of steel the standard oil company has never
 undergone the stock-watering process which is so common
 an incident of trust-making hence affords a clearer
 illustration of the profits derivable from practical monopoly
 of a staple article the last five years it has paid its
 stockholders dividends to the amount of two hundred and
 nineteen million dollars or two and a fifth times the amount
 of its capital stock considerable extravagance might be
 introduced into the management and still give consumers
 their kerosene and axle grease cheaper there are of
 course certain exceptions but most of the trusts are
 inspired by a get-rich-quick motive so long as they are
 thus inspired and have a free rein their efficiency whatever
 its degree will do consumers no good the war depart-
 ment will evidently be much disappointed if its little
 powder plant doesnt help to blow up what remains of the
 notion that mere managerial efficiency tells the whole story

the machines handicap

former governor yates of illinois who now desires to
represent that commonwealth in the upper house of
congress is telling his audiences that senators cullom and
hopkins and speaker cannon took him up into a high
hotel room where he was offered the post of ambassador to
mexico if he would deliver his convention delegates at a
critical juncture he thinks this illustrates the difficulties
which beset his path in seeking a senatorship in opposition
to the wishes of the gentlemen who control the federal jobs
in his state but as mr yates is a politician of much skill
and experience and as he adds that he has repeated the
story from the platform in one hundred and two counties it
seems to us to illustrate something else even more forcibly
-to wit that it is becoming increasingly difficult for a
political machine with whatever power and sagacity it
may be operated to overcome the handicap of being a
machine the adroit ex-governor evidently judges that
his best card consists in showing that he is opposed by a
powerful machine and he shrewdly calculates that the
better he succeeds in impressing his audiences with an idea
of the potency of the machine the better chance he will
stand of triumphing over it

  the case is typical of the times the mightier the
machine the weaker it is its liability to overthrow is
exactly in proportion to the energy that has been expended
in constructing it before the ides of november we shall
see many gentlemen violently seeking to detach them-
selves-at least until the campaign is over-from the
machines which they have toilfully created and prob-
ably eagerly pointing out for their own vindication such
evidences as they can discover of defects in their mechanical
efficiency-as where a collectorship or postmastership
got away from them

the great dividend

this is the time of year when the stock-ticker lies limp
in the brokers office and the farmer has the floor it
is of vastly more importance to know whether it is good
growing weather than whether the attorney-general
has brought a new suit against the standard oil or mr
cassatt has taken the steamer for home or mr gates is
optimistic about his country all over the land from
rocky maine to sunny california something is going on
day and night that is of first-rate consequence to every one
of eighty millions of human beings water is trickling
down the hillsides moistening the soil green stalks of
corn are swelling with juice grass is waist-high wheat is
growing golden under the hot rays of the sun the earth
is hard at work producing its annual dividend and on its
increase depends pretty much everything else-the mills
the railroads the stores-the dinner-pail and the automo-
bile for next year

  we talk a lot about trusts and captains of industry
about the senate and the supreme court but mother
nature really does the business each year she gives the
country several billions more or less of clear unmortgaged
profits with which wall street may play its game of paper
securities and the factories may open their doors for
business

  it is good to walk over the fields in the long midsummer
days and know that graft or no graft with or without mr
roosevelts permission and no matter what we may think
of mr rockefeller the corn continues to ripen and the
apples are turning red in the orchard it may be a wicked
world where the few take all the jack-pots but the earth
is a good mistress and she repays at usurious rates whatever
is put into her

human documents in the case of the new slavery

 by mrs john van vorst

a short journey in the cars from portland maine
to dover new hampshire carries one across a
state border-line and therewith into a realm new as
regards the legal aspect of the cotton-mill industry

  dover though mild and conservative in appearance
boasts a population of fifteen thousand souls two-fifths of
whom are foreigners from that part of europe which the
good new englander mentions with a downward curve of
the lips there are among them both french and swedes
to be sure but these nationalities represent already a labor-
ing aristocracy which looks down upon the other classes
formed of armenians portuguese greeks poles russians
and other slavs

  it was with some hesitation that the agent of one of the
larger mills consented to my visiting the vast precincts of
his industrial domain he accompanied me upstairs and
downstairs  

     i believe   said this agent who is a disciple of tolstoi -
 i believe in respecting the law i enforce the spirit by the
letter my overseers understand that i only want suitable
help it would not greatly affect us if they took all our
smallest hands when the truant officer came in about six
weeks after vacation was over he found only one boy who
could not show his certificate on request and that boy had
his at home

  as i walked on through the upper rooms where the
old mule spinners were installed i noticed a num-
ber of very little boys at work these mule spinners
which produce an extremely fine and perfect thread are
composed of so complicated a machinery that they must be
tended not by a child but by a man for the merely
mechanical attention to that part of the moving frame
which is close to the ground however the little hands
are indispensable

  pointing to one of the tiny aids not more evidently than
twelve years old i questioned the tolstoian agent

  oh he responded with a somewhat indifferent air
the children twelve and thirteen years old come in at three
oclock as soon as school is over to help their parents

   but this is a tacit breaking of the law   i asked

  the agent shrugged his shoulders as though there were
an inward conflict between conscience and expediency

  i tried to stop this helping system he said but the
parents protested after all the children are better off
here than they would be in the streets of a town like dover

  new hampshire permits children to work in the factories
at the age of twelve during the vacations of the public
schools during the full school session the boys and girls
up to fourteen years must followr the instruction given
and those who cannot read and write must until sixteen
years of age go to the school or attend the night-classes

  one of the militant members of the federation of
womens clubs speaking of the conditions in new
hampshire expressed herself to me as follows

  as far as i can ascertain there are children under age
employed at the mills in many towns when we tried to
urge an investigation we were begged by the authorities
not to  stir up  the matter as conditions are not very bad
in new hampshire she concluded in a melancholy way
the men and women of our state are willing to let things
drift

   there is to be sure no factory inspection in the state of
new hampshire and as has been often remarked laws
have no real value except through their enforcement

  at nashua the herd of foreigners is more dense even
than in dover more villainous more swarming more
rapacious more heedless of the laws in a country whose
patriotism for them echoes only to the ring of a silver dollar

  the two thousand hands of one manufacturing estab-
lishment in nashua are almost all foreign i questioned
many of the children in the spinning-room those who
were able to speak english gave their ages as fourteen
those who could not speak english were without excep-
tion according to their own verdict over sixteen years old
though their diminutive size their immaturity declared
them to the most casual observer as not above twelve
or thirteen years of age as soon as i spoke to them upon
this delicate subject their expression of intensity changed
to one of merriment-they rushed to tell their comrades of
their adroitness in deceiving a stranger and as i passed

i left behind me a trail of hilarity

  one girl who spoke only french had been ten years
in the mills her voice was gone her eyes were dulled
she looked a thousand years old and there was something
gruesome in the way she spat upon the ground grinning
the while as she twisted a broken thread between her
fingers joining it to the whirling bobbin which she had
tended for a decade

  at the office the brisk young american clerks had but one
verdict to give regarding the social disadvantages of the

    laborer from southern
    europe he is like an
    animal he herds with
    his compatriots into quar-
    ters which his habitation
    renders so filthy that
    afterward no american
    is willing to take up his
    abode there

       at the city hall where
     i talked for a time with
     the young lady assist-
     ant i learned to what
     an extent the prejudice
     against the foreigner has
     become ferocious in towns
     which like nashua boast
     truly old and venerable
     inhabitants-and to what
     extent also this preju-
     dice affects the very des-
     tinies of america

          why   the young lady
      assistant protested
      these foreigners have ten
      and eleven children in a
      family theyre just like
      animals and theyre re-
      sponsible for all the pov-
      erty here it seems as if
      they had no sense what-
      ever having such fami-
      lies

       then after a moments
     reflection in which it
     seemed she were sum-
     moning courage for a
     denunciation almost anti-
     patriotic she added
     they dont have my
     approval if they do have

president roosevelts at our charity societies we are
perfectly disgusted with them

   there is something appalling in the statistics of certain
of the cotton mills in manchester the floor space of
these factories covers one hundred and twenty-five acres
the spindles that twist in their revolutions thread for a
world of cotton garments number six hundred thousand
the total number of yards of cloth woven not in a century
but in a week amounts to  the pay-roll dis-
penses  hard-earned dollars and the hands who
receive them form a body of  persons in other
words these mills are the largest in the world

  almost one-half of the fifty-six thousand manchester
inhabitants are foreigners they are monopolizing every-
thing-so the legend goes-because of their large families

  why said the little school-teacher to me weve so
many foreigners that they keep our children back the
americans she added with an air of superiority many
of them have no children the educated prefer quality to
quantity theyd rather have two and give them a good
education and theyd rather have none than give them no
education at all lots of the american hands when they
marry go right on working they have no home and no
children they just board around

  it was the clerk at the hotel who gave me the word of
introduction necessary for opening the doors of the larger
mills and a young office-boy accompanied me on my round
through one factory he was of the energetic type we
designate as thoroughly american self-respecting
ambitious proud neat smart alert and resolute

   theres lots of children here underage he volunteered
but so long as the truant officer doesnt get after them
theyre all right

  and presently as we passed by a mule spinning-frame
which had two tiny boys in attendance my companion
proffered

  you wouldnt think that little fellow was fourteen
would you

  no i responded

  well he says he is but he isnt-none of them
are theyre all foreigners lots of em cant even read
and write their own names you see he explained
weve got to have the work done and the americans wont
do it-its too dirty for them-so we take in foreigners
and how do they get in  they must have a certificate
verifying their age how can they obtain this  

  well my informant responded the parents swear
falsely about their childrens ages and besides that they
move around from one ward to another change their names
and use the new certificate of the older children for those too
young to get a certificate of their own

  so light and airy a sense of legal obligations seems
hardly credible yet such are the facts a family takes
out certificates in one part of the town under the name of
blanche the following year they move into another
quarter install themselves under the name of white and
the younger children thus as little whites provide them-
selves with the certificates of the older brothers who are

already serving in the army of laborers under the appella-
tion of blanche

  it is in the pursuit of such miscreants that the truant
officers can alone act effectually in a state where there is no
official factory inspector the work done by the present
superintendent of schools at manchester is irreproachable
all that conscientious and persistent endeavor can contrib-
ute to reform is here being accomplished by thop who
enforce with rigid precision the new hampshire school-
laws but alas there is a faith so implicit placed in
 parents and guardians  that their oath made in no matter
what spirit of rapacity is accepted without question and
thus it happens that one finds in the mills a goodly number
of children whose parents swear theyre fourteen when

theyre only twelve

   having obtained at the schools in manchester a list of
truants i set out upon an expedition into the poorer
quarters of this thriving industrial town

   the prodigious mills are massed together in a block which
sways to the rhythm of the huge and forceful machines
within a broad and busy avenue-framed with double
rows of tempting stores whose vast plate windows reflect
the trolley cars that flash right and left-traverses man-
chester from west to east yet out of this thoroughfare so
animated a step carries one into the poorer quarters

   there is one expression used by the dilettantes of charity
 as by the most democratic of philanthropists they say
 when setting out upon a round among the poor we are
 going down to the slums this down inasmuch as from a
 geographical point of view it does not always mean a direc-
 tion implies a certain worldly concession a moral conde-
 scension instinctive and therefore more poignant which
 those who are not strictly of the  slums   feel for that part
 of the world whither the very poor have been relegated

   as a matter of fact from a spiritual point of view-given
the lesson we learn there of self-abnegation and christian
disinterested devotion of charity and of love-we might
well say in speaking of our visits to the poor that they take
us not down but up to the slums

the terrible truants

it was almost six oclock when i rapped at the landrys
door rose they had told me at the school and josie
her older sister were both of them truants this somewhat
romantic word invoked visions of other runaway children
whose lives had begun with escapades and continued in
adventures of all kinds but the dismal entrance of the
landrys tenement dulled at once whatever rose-color had
momentarily enveloped the images of these two fugitives

   a light step sounded in response to my tap at the door
which was thrown open by a child on whose little face was
a smile of greeting as she welcomed me without question
in the hospitable tone of the very poor to whom the
stranger is an object of especial courtesy she bade me be
seated and wait until her mother came in

    but it was you i came to see i explained you are

rose landry arent you

   yes maam 

   she had placed one hand on either hip and stood with
her arms thus akimbo a light cotton jacket hanging loose
from her narrow little shoulders her eyes all eagerness and
her thin frail body bent forward with the intensity of the
working woman weary herself alert for others

   you are eleven years old arent you

   yes maam

   then why arent you in school

   she threw out both hands with a pretty gesture indul-
  gent despairing and then she laughed

   why i have all the housekeeping to do and mammas
 dinner to carry and besides she added i have these two

  to take care of

   these two were a boy of nine and a girl of six who sat
  demurely in the corner looking at a picture-book as i
  turned to speak to them there was a sound from the direc-
  tion of the kitchen which announced that something on the
  fire needed attention rose in an instant quieted the sim-
  mering disturbance on the stove and returning explained
  i love school better than anything but i must help
  mamma im up you see every morning at half-past four
  ive got my floors to scrub and the breakfast to cook then
  i go to market and i have to get mammas dinner ready
  and take it to the factory its getting mammas dinner
  she added that bothers me from going to school

    then perhaps something in my expression offended
 her for she protested quickly a flash of loyalty in her dark
 bright eyes

    i dont have to scrub my floors and do quite all these
  things mamma dont want me to but i do it to advance
  her at the mill when she comes home at night i dont
  want her to have a thing to do

    the tenement was shining with cleanliness on the
 table which was spread for supper a red cloth reflected
 gayly the light from a neatly-trimmed lamp there was
 order and cheer in all that this little housekeeper had
 touched

    long before i heard a sound on the stairs rose-alter-
  nating moments of conversation with flights into the

kitchen for the preparation of supper-sounded the signal
of those accustomed to waiting for a returning footstep at

the close of the day	

  hark she cried theres josie

  and presently the door opened and the second of the
truants aged thirteen came in from a ten-hour days work
at a shoe-shop she too was doing it to advance
mamma and the burden she carried too heavy for so
young shoulders had put something prematurely resigned
into the dignity of her bearing when school was spoken of
-and indeed it seemed almost inappropriate to propose
classes to one for whom life had been itself so full a lesson-
josie smiled with a certain pride she opened a desk that
stood at one side of the room and took from it a handful of
copybooks in which her clear round handwriting showed
the application of a faithful pupil

  id love to have graduated she said  i had only one

more year

  again the warning note of rose the vigilant sounded
this time there was a ring of tenderness in her voice as she
cried lifting up her little hand

   hark theres mamma 

  the step that approached slowly by the steep tenement
stairway was heavy with fatigue and the greeting mrs
landry gave as she pushed open the door was listless

  rosie she said turning to the little housekeeper
youve been and scrubbed those floors again 

  but rosies gay ringing laugh defied the pity implied in
these few words of affectionate reproach the mother laid
aside her shawl put in its place the dinner-pail she moved
as one moves who has no real hope in life to prompt new
energy and impulse when i questioned her she was
reticent admitting only that her husband was living
somewhere in new hampshire-how she did not know for
he had given her no news of himself since deserting her

  the two youngest children had slid down from their
seat in the corner and stood close to the mother rubbing
against her shyly as they listened without understanding

to what she said

  though she had been gone from the house since five
in the morning mrs landry did not sit down she
was inspecting me inwardly she had a misapprehension
that i had come from some charitable or philanthropic
society and the idea to her of accepting help other than
such aid as one friend gives another was repellent it was
only after i had reassured her of my official interest that she
relaxed admitting slowly in her hoarse broken voice

  its been a pretty hard pull then she added i
dont carry my cross i drag it but i have the children 
-her hand rested on the head of the little one by her side-
and-shefinished the sentence to herself- im happy
because i believe in god

  the following day i visited josie at the shoe-shop had
i been myself the truant officer i would i am sure have been
tempted in this case to make an exception in the laws
enforcement had josie been taken from factory had
rose been put back into school the landry family would
have been broken up an asylum would have replaced
home for the two younger children and the evil done them
and the mother would perhaps have been greater than was
the premature physical fatigue provoked by the incessant
effort to triumph over misfortune and the fight for an ideal
dearer than welfare to those who do not live by bread alone

   yet how make exceptions to the law how alter the
letter without entailing license for the oppressor 

when wages wane

  tjy ven with the clearingjof the children from the spinning-
  i-i rooms the wages of the laborers have not as it might
  be expected augmented on the contrary they have for
  twenty years diminished steadily the recent long and
  terrible fall river strikes sufficiently attest to the gradual
  exasperation of the cotton-mill hand who has been cut
  down as he puts it to starvation rates and if we
  believe the verdict of the expert this  cutting down  has
  been an economic necessity referring to the outcome of
  the fall river strikes the new york times says in an
  editorial

  if the forty-one corporations had been required to dis-
  burse  more wages annually irrespective of their
  profits it is hardly too much to say that the prospect of the
  continuance of the industry would have been imperilled

     the annual reports and meetings are pitiful read-
  ing for anybody interested in the industry

   what does it all mean then

    that reform is inconsistent with prosperity

   that vexatious labor-laws actually do hamper the

  manufacturer 

   before deciding thus peremptorily against the prac-
  ticability of enforcing throughout other states such laws
  as are observed strictly in massachusetts there are a num-
  ber of things to be considered

    in the first place as a nation we export large quantities
  of raw cotton and import quantities of manufactured
  prints and ginghams these manufactured cotton goods
  which we import are-as even the most casual shopper
  has observed-four and five times more expensive to buy

and they are also infinitely finer than our own cotton
cloths

  we are creating a scarcity in the raw material and
importing the manufactured article think what a compe-
tition results

  a second observation to be made is this within five
years the southern states have increased their consump-
tion of cotton from  bales to  bales the
northern mills have increased theirs absolutely by 
the north has still  spindles as against -
 in the south but this disproportion cannot long
continue already the spinning-rooms in the southern
mills look like crowded playrooms for children by com-
parison with the fall river factories

   now the older the hands the more intelligent and expert
they presumably are why therefore should not the
northern manufacturer take advantage of a necessity
which the law has forced upon him  and since the south
has become in the matter of coarse cotton cloths so lively
a competitor with the north why should not the north
in turn with her equipment of hands over fourteen
compete against europe and replace by home production
the entire category of imported goods such a move
would harmonize with the enforcement of the child-labor
laws in the north

the root of the evil

in the south the problem is very different there
shortage in the labor supply seems to be at the root of
the difficulties as the retired agent put it no one
would want to use children but we cant get the big help

  for the moment it would seem that in the north it is
quality of labor and in the south quantity that is required
in order from a commercial point of view to make prac-
tical the enforcement of proper legislation

  the opinion of those competent to judge is in favor
of encouraging at once the right sort of immigration toward
the southern mills

  now although there will be an immense step in the right
direction the day that labor-laws are passed limiting in
every state the age at which children can work the chances
are that these laws as in alabama will remain a dead
letter until the question of shortage in labor supply is
settled until there are factory inspectors appointed and
until there are compulsory school-iaws made and truant
officers named rigorously to execute them

  now although in the south for the time being at
least scientific philanthropy can and necessarily must
supplement the work of legal reform in the north yet
in maine and new hampshire there is no reason why
the laws in their strictest forms should not be enforced
there is plenty of school room and there are truant
officers to look after the children who escape from lessons
to go to the mills

  all sorts of arguments are put forth by the ignorant and
the rapacious regarding the chance evils of child-labor
 if the children werent in the factory they would be in the
streets saysome work doesnt hurt little childrensay
others   the spinners are better off than the newsboys

  yet the truth is always more eloquent than anything
that can be said against it with regard to the accumu-
lation of fatigue which assails even the strongest hands
engaged in mill work a few statistics taken from the
revue scientifique are exceedingly to the point

an important member of the faculty of medicine of
montpelier has compiled the following observations re-
garding the time of day in which the greatest number of
accidents occur in the factories out of  accidents
recorded the order of progression was as follows

 at   a m    at  p m    
 i i      i   c      i i  
 i i      i   i      i i  
 i       i   i      i i  
 i i     i i  i i        
 t i     i i  i i     i i  
  i   m i                    
    there is a slight diminution at twelve and at six oclock
 owing to the fact that the machinery slackens at these
 hours and that many hands lay off or clean up for
 fifteen to twenty minutes before the noon and night

 whistles blow

   as for the days of the week the lesson they import
 is still more striking according to the scientific review
 for september  and october  the accidents
 have occurred in the following proportion as the week
 goes on

 on monday

  tuesday

   wednesday

   thursday

  friday

   saturday

what could be more convincing than the testimony of

 such figures as the above

   we must lift this burden of fatigue from frail young
 shoulders if we would see the child of to-day grow into the
 man the woman the parent of to-morrow

  he had concluded to extend the quarters
of his grocery department equip it with
convenient fixtures and hire a qualified
department manager

  with the matter of fixtures principally
in mind and with one eye open tor a
competent manager he visited the leading
groceries of a larger city at one place he
was met by a clean-cut young man who
answered his inquiry concisely

  no sir the proprietor is not in i am
his assistant perhaps i can serve you
the merchant was at once pleased and
impressed with the young mans appearance
and explained to him that his only business
was to secure ideas in regard to fixtures for
use in his store in another city

  i shall be glad to show you what we
have if you will take the time if my work
calls me you will of course excuse me
the merchant followed where he led
mentally noting that the young mans
manners were absolutely perfect tea
and coffee canisters were opened and closed
fruit and vegetable bins inspected and the
merits of the roll-top refrigerator and the
computing scales were explained in detail
by tne careful young man

  a complaining customer had had atten-
tion a stock-boy had been reprimanded
and a drivers report had in turn been
inspected during the tour of the store
the merchant witnessed each transaction
and noted courtesy thoughtfulness and
he thought a certain measure of executive
ability

  the trend of the merchants thoughts had
somehow turned from fixtures to manager
and he reflected this is the man i want
i am sure i must sound him and see if i
can get him

  when the cold-storage plant had been
inspected the young man noted that the
noon hour had approached and said-
politely still

  it is now time for my luncheon and i
must ask you to excuse me i shall be glad
to see you in the store this afternoon
the merchant lingered near the door and
saw the young man get his hat register his
departure at the time-clock and start to
leave as he passed a desk the telephone
attendant called him

  mr bamlee call ---

  sorry ive registered out was his
reply

  but mr bamlee its a customer she
has called twice and she said it was im-
portant

  sos my luncheon cant talk to her
on my own time shell have to wait till
i get back  - and the young man was gone

  the merchant left too and did not return
in the afternoon	-w a d

breaking in

a was a surveyor and at twenty-two
 joined the force of b who was chief
engineer of the western lines of the great
x-y railway system a at first gained
valuable experience in the field then was
placed in the office at headquarters as
draftsman when b discovered that a
was a good draftsman and accurate mathe-
matician he refused to send him out and
kept him in the office where a knew
there was small chance for promotion

  a branch line had been surveyed across
the mountains it was called the selkirk
extension and a had made the drawings
one day b came to him and said

  you take sufficient men go out to
selkirk mountain section and verify the
profiles

  a	performed the work without a hitch
but while at mount selkirk had made a
discovery b was a haughty man and

a	hesitated to mention the matter but
on making his report he gathered his
courage and said

  i would like to offer a suggestion con-
cerning the grade around mount selkirk

  b	nodded sternly and a proceeded
  the grade there is steep and two miles of
track are exposed to snowslides why not
tunnel the mountain and avoid a trouble-
some grade

  b	glared at the young man in silence
the next day a received an envelope and
his discharge he promptly found work
with a bridge company but could not for-
get selkirk mountain a month later he
learned that b had been transferred to the
eastern lines when the same week the
general manager of the x-y arrived a
went to headquarters and asked for an
audience with the great man he made
two efforts and failed the manager was
busy then a penned a line on his card
and sent it in the line read i have a
plan whereby the x-y can save a million
dollars he was admitted and the
manager said

   well who are you what is it 

  a lost no time and produced a drawing
i am no financier but i am familiar with
the survey on the selkirk extension
and--

  are you employed by the company
no sir but i lost my job because i
roposed that a tunnel be driven through
elkirk mountain here are the grades
two miles of useless track to be buried in
snow all winter now since mr b has
gone i dared to call your attention to the
proposition i want to work for your
company

  the general manager studied the plan
intently then he looked and keenly
observed the young man

  i want an opportunity said a
give me a trial ana i ask you to give me
full charge of the selkirk extension

  a was put through a half-hours strenu-
ous cross-examination and at its close the
manager turned to his desk to write an
order when a left the office he carried
with him the desired appointment and
since has advanced to the office of chief
engineer of the x-y system - l f

a dozen clothespins

a young clerk who had concluded the
time was ripe for him to leave counter
duties and move up in the service of his
company went to the manager with a
request that he be allowed to try city
soliciting the manager shook his head
and the clerk went back to his desk a
month later he again broached the matter
with an intimation that he intended to try
soliciting if it had to be with another firm
he was a good clerk- too good to spoil-
so the manager sat up and took notice it
was policy to pacify him for john was a
first-class counter man and he wanted to
keep him there finally he said

  john here is a price schedule i will
give you the account of smith  jones to
work on when you get an order from
them bring it to me

  john did not find that the company
had an account with smith  jones he
learned the reason the first time he called
on their buyer

you are a new man arent you i

ii

presume your company sent you to me as
a joke if you dont know it you may as
well learn that smith  jones have no
use for your concern never have and never
will do any business with you and you are
wasting your time as well as my own by
calling goo d-day 

  that was the beginning other solic-
itors had encountered the same reception
and given smith  jones a wide berth it
was an old breach and in the card system
of the sales department smith  jones were
listed cant do business with them
but john hadnt any more sense than to
keep on calling and the buyer being bored
and perceiving some humor in the situation
one day referred him to smith of the firm
who being interested in young men for
business reasons asked the persistent
little rat into his private office in ten
minutes he had guessed correctly the motive
of johns persistency

  you want a place as city solicitor and
your manager has turned you loose on us
to dampen your ardor what salary do
you get

  fifteen a week gasped the astonished
john

  what would soliciting pay

  twenty to start

  well tell your house to send us a rush
order of one dozen clothespins c  d

and if you dont get your job come back
to me we have some city soliciting to
do ourselves

  but john did not come back except to
solicit more business-and to get it

-e d e

 get the business 

tn a certain office building in chicago
jl there is a room which seems out of place
in this beehive of commercial industry
it is furnished like a schoolroom and
adjoins the offices of one of the large
insurance corporations at nine oclock
every business morning this room is the
scene of an unusual gathering a dozen or
more well-dressed young men and some
older ones congregate here for instruction
an elderly man appears punctually at the
desk and for a half-hour delivers to them
a discourse which for terseness pointed
meaning and genuine inspiration is a
model of eloquence there is no general-
ization the manager is talking to his
solicitors and the one and only object in
view in this assemblage is to develop the
ability to get business these two words
are the keynote of every talk the parting
admonition of every session of the class
when the manager has finished his talk he
calls two of the solicitors to the front

  jones you may proceed to sell smith
here a bond

  then begins an argumentative contest the
like of which the solicitor seldom equals
in real business as a preliminary he
briefly ingratiates himself into the good
graces of his prospective customer smith
gives him the stony stare pleads too
busy that he is already loaded with
insurance that he must see his partner
that he prefers another companys proposi-
tion and ad infinitum it is a battle of
wits and the instructor and the remainder
of the class watch the contest closely
occasionally breaking in with disconcerting
interruptions at the end a vote is taken
as to whether the solicitor technically sold
the bond and if not whether he met the
situation adequately rivalry is intense
and the man who can technically sell a well-
posted fellow-solicitor feels almost as much
elation as if the deal were a real one at
ten oclock the class hurries away to the
real work of the day is it any wonder
these men get business and work by pref-
erence on a commission basis

to prevent boiler explosions

being an employee of a railroad com-
pany i have been deeply impressed by
the number of fatalities arising from the ex-
plosion of locomotive boilers and i have
noticed that the majority of such accidents
have occurred through the engineer allowing
the water to get low in the boiler so low that
the crownsheet becomes white hot one of
two things then happens either the pres-
sure forces the crownsheet through the stay-
bolts that hold it or the engineer injects cold
water into the superheated crownsheet in
either case invariably causing an explosion
the frequence of such explosions has brought
me to give the matter much thought and i
have endeavored to figure out some plan by
which as soon as the water sinks to a dan-
gerous level in the boiler warning may be
given the engineer by an automatic alarm
thus far i have been unable to devise
how this can be accomplished but it is
surely a good idea for any one of an inventive
turn of mind for every railroad in the coun-
try would equip its engines with such a
device if it were possible to get one

  in nearly all cases of explosion the engi-
neer will maintain that his gauge showed a
proper level of water in the boiler but the
examining experts can usually establish the
cause beyond a doubt from the conclusive
evidence of a burned crownsheet this
leads one to believe that the gauge must
have failed to reveal the real conditions pres-
ent in the boiler that sediment or scale had
plugged the connection to the glass and was
holding water in sight when the real level in
the boiler was below the crownsheet the
intention of my corrective device would be
to give warning to the engineer in case of a
defective water gauge - m r r

the shame of the colleges

  i denied the compliment as good-
naturedly as i could and the young man
immediately stampeded away toward the
railway station

  stop i cried why do you ask me
this strange question and then hurry away
thus

  lama heeler replied the young man

   a what   i gasped

  a heeler he repeated a scout a
reporter for the news i go among the
holy pokers of divinity in dwight hall in
the guise of a sinner come to grace then i
go among the wassail-tossers of profanity
at the new haven house in the guise of a
sinner driven to drink i am all things to
all students until i learn their hearts
secrets-then out pops my cloven hoof and
a four-line item in the college daily

  he seemed a nice young man in spite
of his hard life so when i told him that i
was looking for my son in the freshman
class he took me on my news-value and said
that he would lead me over to the quad-
rangle and show me some freshmen as
we were going across the square hand in
hand i saw a very serious-looking student
who stood beneath an elm tree and recited
poes raven in a loud clear voice he
was doing the piece so nicely that i did not
notice for a moment that up in the tree
was another student who as his friend
recited dropped peanuts on his head and
chanted never-r-rmore-coo-coonever-
r-r-rmore-coo-coo 

  this seemed to me such a vapid such
a trivial ceremony that it quite enraged me

i told the heeler that i thought it a shame
for freshmen to be taken into the university
so young and frivolous

  these are not freshmen said the
heeler indignantly they are honor
men both members of the nut club its
a great distinction to belong i tried to
but i couldnt make it

    i was about to protest again when my
attention was arrested by a loud clattering
of wheels and a discordant cheering and
rah-rah-ing round the comer there
rolled a large omnibus fairly crammed
with men in baseball flannels and bright
sweaters they were apparently celebrat-
ing a great victory

    do they allow the freshmen athletes
to behave so boisterously on the campus
i asked the kindly heeler

  but he merely answered thats the
faculty baseball team returning from their
game with the phi beta kappa theres
professor torrey of the department of
semitic languages and that big chap is
merritt the university registrar

  i didnt ask if president hadley was
yelling with the rest of the boys in the
omnibus but i have no doubt that he was
there

    going through the phelps gateway into
the quadrangle i saw a great flock of college-
boys capering like school-children up and
down the turf in the yard while mr yales
beautiful statue looked on somewhat
disturbed i thought some of the boys
were playing a silly game in which they
dropped a rubber-ball into holes in the
ground after which they hit each other
with it the ball not the ground this
game i am told is called nigger baby
i should think that the police or president
hadley or secretary taft or somebody
in authority would stop it others of
these fellows were spinning tops and rolling
hoops around the walks and when i asked
one nice-looking boy if they were quite
right in their minds he answered

  oh no sir theyre seniors

  if these are seniors i said for
heavens sake show me some freshmen
so the young man pointed out some
boys sitting in a row in the corner of the
ard they were very quiet and well-
ehaved and a good example for their
elders i thought i approached these
boys and as i got closer i saw that there
were thirteen of them in a row i went up
to the freshman sitting on the end and
was about to inquire about archibald when
he looked up and lo it was archibald
archibald my boy i cried

   but at my word all thirteen of the boys
raised their eyes and behold every one
of them looked like archibald  the italics
are my own

   and what puzzled me still more was the
fact that the lad whom i had at first sup-
posed to be my son did not resemble
archibald in every way his nose was

i

           concluded from page 

certainly not so much the smythe nose as
that which adorned the appealing face
of the boy who sat third from the end
there were five sets of smythe knock-knees
in the crowd and the smythe strawberry-
mark was under six left ears

  then the bitter yale-blue truth burst
upon me and almost smote me to the earth
-the yale democratic spirit had gotten
hold of my boy and hypnotized him into
sharing his smythe character his smythe
traditions even the features of his smythe
face with the fellow-members of his class

  crushed by the contemplation of my
sons fatal generosity i turned away in
despair how would i know even my own
son in a freshman class where all the men
were alike true he had only a limited
number of eyes and ears and noses to give
to his fellows but the smythe features were
plain american enough to go a great way
indeed

  i broke the news gently to my poor wife
when i reached our hotel and together we

journeyed sadljr back to our native town
immediately on arriving there i sent the
following message to president hadley

   ship boy home at once- smythe

   in an hour the answer came

  which one-hadley

   i did not hesitate in replying

   use your own discretion there aint
much choice- smythe

   so closes the affidavit of w john smythe
a man whose personal friendship i have
enjoyed for so many years that i can vouch
for the inaccuracy of his statements as i
can for any other statements in these arti-
cles i myself having gathered them from
the most unreliable sources several trunk-
loads of evidence i still have on hand sewed
up for some future article when i shall
bring twenty-three charges against the
faculty of yale count them-

vaiti of the islands

concluded from page 

the vigor of her language would have dis-
persed them

  the trawl-net and the tangle of manila
were hanging over the stem held up by a
single rope vaiti glided to the rail holding
a sharp knife in her hand -i always did
think she kept one somewhere among her
frillygigs commented harris silently as he
caught the flash of the steel -and waited
still as a statue

  presently out of the darkness shot a hail
accompanied by a perfect constellation of
oaths its apparent object was to ascertain
the sybils reason for steering such a course
the sybil answered not a word but steered
the course some more

  the hail at the second time of repeating
became a yell with a strong note of terror
in it on came the sybil a dim unlit tower
of blackness taking as much notice of the
shouts as the flying dutchman those on
board the margaret macintyre gave them-
selves up for lost there was even a rush
made for one of the boats but the threat-
ening shape swept past her bows so near
that the furious captain could have tossed a
biscuit on board-so near that the sybils
kanaka crew thinking that papalangi
officers meant to ram the stranger uttered
war-cries wherein pure delight was mingled
with overjoyed surprise

   it was all over in a minute and the sybil
was well away on the margaret macintyres
port side before the latter vessel discovered
through the medium of a horrible jar from
the engine-room and a powerful odor of oil
that the screw was badly fouled leaving
them like st paul with nothing to do but
make the best of circumstances and wish
that it were day 

  a member of the trading firm that owned
the sybil was considerably surprised while
walking down the wharf of wellington
two days later to see one of his companys
schooners lying comfortably alongside
when her engagements demanded that she
should have been in papeete it did not
lessen his anger to run across the sybils
captain on lambton quay a few minutes
later very finely dressed and accompanied
by his daughter attired in a gown that
evidently purported to be paris

  may i ask what this means captain
saxon   demanded the man of money-bags
with iced civility

    it means that ill buy the sybil at your
own price and let you into a good thing if
you want one answered his employee
cheerfully come along into the occi-
dental and well have a talk but vaiti must
be in it shes in everything and i dont
know what any of us would do without her

a pictorial revenge

this is the story of the painting that
first brought jacquet fame then much
advertising through a lawsuit then money
and finally gave all paris a laugh jacquet
and his pink-and-white pierrot heads are
now known the length and breadth of the
fifth avenue picture-shops but time was
when they had little fame and far less cash
between them jacquet was a young man
then and had no american market to
supply but there came a time as it
always does with a man of his talent and
originality when he caught the public eye
a little water-color of his on exhibition
made quite a stir and one of its chief
admirers was alexandre dumas fils a
friend of m dumas went to jacquet and
told him how much his work was admired
intimating that m dumas would willingly
buy if the price asked twenty-five thousand
francs had not been set beyond his means
he could pay ten thousand though and
the friend strongly advised jacquet to let
his water-color go for the lesser figure

  jacquet readily agreed and the little
 water-color was soon hanging in dumas
 house between the two front windows of
 his drawing-room one day however a
 friend asked jacquet if he had heard the
 news dumas had sold his picture for
 seventy-five thousand francs jacquet
 ran the story down and found it true
 straightway he rushed to m dumas and
 indignantly demanded his original price
 as a testimonial of his regard for the genius
 of a fellow-artist he had been willing to
 forego his fixed price but if monsieur was

to turn picture-dealer- but dumas

 for his part could not see it at all busi-
 ness was business

  shortly after came the exhibition of the
society of the aquarellists with a small
but beautifully-painted picture by jacquet
called the jew pedler it represented an
eastern scene in which a jew was selling
to a simple-looking young traveler some of
his wares the jew was an excellent
portrait of m dumas and the young man
was jacquet

  the story of the picture-sale had been
going the rounds and everybody recognized
the point of jacquets little joke on a
crowded day m dumas son-in-law came
in posed before the picture spoke con-
temptuously of it and smashed frame
glass and picture with his heavy stick
scoring thereby a noble revenge

  but no coffee and pistols for two for
jacquet instead the son-in-law was
summoned to court to answer suit for
seventy-five thousand francs at the
trial of the case jacquet was called to the
witness-stand his examination went on
something like this m jacquet have
you ever sold an aquarelle for seventy-five
thousand francs

  no monsieur

  do you really ever expect to

  i fear not

  then monsieur how can you have the
audacity to demand any such sum for this
small picture

  that was the price monsieur

  how can that be proved

    it was so printed in the catalogue

  sure enough what everybody thought
was a misprint for  fr was intentionally
 fr jacquet knew what to expect
and had set his trap in advance in the
end dumas had to pay

    bueno stand away from me men
i pushed my way through the recoiling
circle and heard once more that same
oppressed voice saying earnestly

  forget that i am a living man jorge
forget me altogether and think of what
you have to do

  be without fear senor you are
nothing to me but a gun-carriage and i
shall not waste a shot

  i heard the spluttering of a fort-fire
and smelt the saltpetre of a match i saw
suddenly before me a nondescript shape on
all fours like a beast but with a mans
head drooping below a tubular projection
over the nape of the neck and the gleam
of a rounded mass of bronze on its back

  in front of a silent semicircle of men
it squatted alone with jorge behind it and
a trumpeter motionless his trumpet in his
hand by its side

  jorge bent double muttered to it
port-fire in hand

    an inch to the left senor too much

-so- now if you let yourself down

a little by letting your elbows bend i
will  

  he leaped aside lowering his port-fire
and a burst of flame leaped violently out
of the muzzle of the gun lashed on the
mans back

  then gaspar ruiz lowered himself
slowly

   good shot he asked

     full on senor
     then load again

  he lay there before me on his breast
under the darkly glittering bronze of his
monstrous burden such as no love or
strength of man had ever had to bear in
the lamentable history of the world his
arms were spread out and he figured a
black cross upon the moonlit ground

  again i saw him raised to his hands and
knees and the men stand away from him
and old jorge stoop glancing along the gun

  left a little-right an inch- for

dios senor stop this trembling where
is your strength  

  the old gunners voice was cracked
with emotion again he stepped aside and
quick as lightning brought the spark to the
touch-hole

  excellent he cried tearfully but
gaspar ruiz lay for a long time silent flat-
tened on the ground in the shape of a cross

  i am tired he murmured at last
will another shot do it

  without doubt said jorge bending
down to his ear

    then -load i heard him utter dis-
tinctly  trumpeter 

     i am here senor ready for your word 
blow a blast at this word that would
be heard from one end of chile to the
other hombre he said in an extraordinarily
strong voice and others stand ready
to cut this accursed riata for then will
be the time for me to lead you in your rush
now raise me up and you jorge-be
quick with your aim 

  the rattle of musketry from the fort
nearly drowned his voice the palisade
was wreathed in smoke and flame

  exert your force forward against the
recoil this amo  said the old gunner shakily
dig your hands into the ground-so -
now 

  a cry of exultation escaped him after
the shot the trumpeter raised his trum-
pet nearly to his lips and waited but no
word came from the prostrate man i fell
on my knees and heard all he had to say
then

     something broken he whispered lift-
ing his head and turning his eyes toward
me in his hopelessly crushed attitude

  the gate hangs by no more than a
splinter  yelled jorge

    then trumpet   his voice
died out in his throat and i rose from my
knees while they rolled the gun off his
broken back he was insensible

  i kept my lips shut of course and the
signal for attack was never given instead
the bugle-calls of the relieving force for
which my ears had thirsted so long burst
out terrifying like the call of the last day
to our surprised enemies

  a tornado senores a real hurricane of
stampeded men wild horses mounted
indians swept over me as i cowered on
the ground by the side of gaspar ruiz
still stretched out in the shape of a cross
peneleo galloping for life made a jab at
me with his long chuzo in passing-for luck

i suppose how i escaped the flying lead
is more difficult to explain venturing to
rise on my knees too soon some soldiers of
the seventeenth taltal regiment my own
regiment in their hurry to get at something
alive nearly bayoneted me on the spot and
looked very disappointed too when some
officers galloping up drove them away
with the flat of their swords

  it was general robles with his staff
he wanted badly some prisoners he too
seemed disappointed for a moment

      what is it you   he cried

  but he dismounted at once to embrace
me for he was an old friend of my family
i pointed to the body at my feet and said
only these two words

  gasnar ruiz

             p

  he threw his arms up with astonish-
ment

     aha your strong man always to
the last with your strong man no matter
he saved our lives when the earth trembled
enough to make the bravest faint with fear
i was frightened out of my wits but he-
no que guape wheres the hero who
got the best of him ha ha ha what
killed him chico f

     his own strength general answered

     but he breathed yet i had him carried
in his poncho under the shelter of some
bushes on the very ridge from which he had
been gazing so fixedly at the fort while
unseen death was hovering already over his
head

  our troops had bivouacked round the
fort toward daybreak i was not surprised
to hear that i was designated to command
the escort of a prisoner that was to be sent
down at once to santiago of course the
prisoner was gaspar ruiz wife

  i have named you out of kindness for
her general robles remarked though the
woman really ought to be shot

  and as i made a movement of shocked
protest he continued

    now he is as well as dead she is of no
importance nobody will know what to do
with her however the government wants
her he shrugged his shoulders i sup-
pose he must have buried large quantities
of his loot in places that she alone knows of

  at dawn i saw her come up the ridge
guarded by two soldiers and carrying her
child on her arm

     i walked to meet her

  is he living yet she asked turning
to me that white impassive face he used to
look at in an adoring way

  i bent my head and led her round a
clump of bushes without a word his eyes
were open he breathed with difficulty
and spoke with a great effort

  erminia

  she knelt at his head the little girl
unconscious of him and with her big eyes
looking about began to chatter suddenly
in a joyous thin voice she pointed a tiny
finger at the rosy glow of sunrise behind
the black shapes of the peaks and while
that child-talk incomprehensible and sweet
to the ear lasted those two the man
stretched on his back and the kneeling
woman remained silent looking in each
others eyes listening to the frail sound
then the prattle stopped the child laid
its head against its mothers breast and
was still

  it was you he began forgive
his voice failed him presently i heard
him mutter and caught the words not
strong enough 

  she looked at him with an extraor-
dinary intensity he tried to smile and
in a humble voice

forgive  he repeated  leaving you

h i

she bent down i cannot i can-
not she sobbed dry-eyed on all the
earth i have loved nothing but yougaspar 
  his head made a movement his eyes
sparkled

  at last he sighed out-then anx-
iously   but is it true     is it true f
  as true as that there is no mercy and
justice in this world she answered him
assionately she stooped over his face
e tried to raise his head but it fell back
and when she kissed his lips he was already
dead his eyes stared wide at the sky on
which pink clouds floated very high but
i noticed the eyelids of the child pressed
to its mothers breast droop and close
slowly she had gone to sleep

the widow of gaspar ruiz the strong
man let me lead her away without a word

                                  a prime reason
why good serv-

to rid the rooms of their ash-dust and dirt servants
prefer homes warmed by

boilers

american radiators distribute the uniform warmth of hot water or low pressure
steam heating all through the house-day and night-but they cannot carry dust and
ashes with the aid of ideal boilers and american radiators the home is far
more easily cared for and good servants retained besides where relieved of such
drudgery good servants have more time to perform better things in domestic science
-rightly earn their pay where mother prefers to do her own work they save her

the saturday evening post

august  

   for traveling we had arranged for her a
side-saddle very much like a chair with a
board swung beneath to rest her feet on
and the first day she rode without uttering
a word and hardly for one moment turning
her eyes away from the little girl whom she
nursed on her knees all the time at our
first camp i saw her during the night walk-
ing about rocking the child in her arms and
gazing down at it by the light of the moon
after we had started on our second days
march she asked me how soon we could
come to the first village of the inhabited
country

  i said we would be there about noon
 and will there be women there she
inquired

  i told her that it was a large village
there shall be men and women there
senora i said whose hearts shall be made
glad by the news that all the unrest and war
is over now

   yes it is all over now she repeated
then after a time  senor officer what will
your government do with me 

  i do not know sevora i said they
shall treat you well no doubt we re-
publicans are not savages and take no
vengeance on women

   she gave me a look at the word repub-
lican which i imagined full of undying hate
but an hour or so afterward as we drew up
to let the baggage-mules go first through a
narrow path she looked at me with such a
sad troubled face that i felt a great pity for
her

     senor officer she said am weak i
tremble it is an insensate fear and
indeed her lips did tremble while she tried
to smile at her own terror of the narrow
pass which was not so dangerous after
all i am afraid i shall drop the child
gaspar has saved your life you remember
once    take her   

  i took the child out of her extended
arms

  shut your eyes senora and trust your
mule i recommended

  she did so and with her pallor and her
wasted thin face she looked deathlike i
held the little girl on my left arm at a
turn of the path where a great crag of purple
porphyry closes the view of the lowlands i
saw her open her eyes i rode just behind

      the child is all right  i cried encourag-
ingly

  yes she answered faintly-and then
to my intense terror i saw her stand up on
the foot-rest staring horribly and throw
herself forward into the chasm on our right

  i cannot describe to you the horrid and
abject dread that came over me at that
dreadful sight it was a dread of the abyss
the dread of the crags which seemed to nod
upon me my head swam i pressed the
child to my side and sat my horse as still as
a statue i was mute and cold all over
the mule staggered sidling close to the rock
and then went on my horse pricked up his
ears with a slight snort and at this my heart
stopped with fear and from the depths of
the precipice the stones rattling in the bed
of tne furious stream made me almost in-
sane with their sound

  next moment we were round the turn
and on the broad back of a grassy slope
and then i yelled men came running
back to me in great alarm it seems that at
first i did nothing but shout  she has given
me the child she has given me the child 
they thought i had gone mad

  general santierra ceased and rose from the
table and that is all seiiores  he con-
cluded with a courteous glance at his tu-
multuously rising guests

   but what became of the child general 

  ah the child the child wait 

  he walked to one of the windows opening
on his beautiful garden the refuge of his
old days whose fame was great in the
land keeping us back with a raised arm
he called out

  erminia erminia oh daughter
he waited then his cautioning arm
dropped and we crowded to the windows

  from a clump of trees a woman had come
upon the broad walk bordered with flowers
we could hear the rustle of her starched
petticoats and observe the vast spread of her
old-fashioned black silk skirt she looked
up and saw all these eyes staring at her
stopped frowned smiled shook her finger
at the general who was laughing boister-
ously and drawing a black lace shawl she
had on her head so as to conceal her face
passed out of our sight walking with stiff
dignity

  you have beheld the guardian angel of
the old man-and her to whom you owe all
that is seemly and comfortable in my hos-
pitality somehow sefiores though the
flame of love had been kindled early in my
breast i have never married and perhaps
it is because of that that the sparks of the
sacred fire are not yet extinct here 

  he struck his broad chest

  still alive still alive he said with a
serio-comic emphasis but i shall not
marry now she is general santierras
daughter and heiress

  one of our fellow-guests a young naval
officer described her afterward as a  short
squat old girl of forty or thereabouts
but we all noticed that her hair was turning
gray and that she had very fine black eyes
and general santierra continued
neither will she marry for anything
a real calamity good patient devoted
to the old man a simple soul but i
would not advise any of you to ask for
her hand for if she took yours into hers it
would be only to crush your bones ah
she does not jest on that subject and
she is the own daughter of her father the
strong man who perished through his own
strength of his muscle of his simplicity-
of his love

building up a retail business

sales is not always a true criterion of his
salesmanship in other words some clerks
get into the habit of increasing the volume
of their sales at the expense of the proprie-
tors profits

   the practice of cutting prices is quite as
much a matter of personal disposition as it
is of necessity without realizing it clerks
who have a weakness in this direction fall
into the way of shaving a little off from the
price whenever there seems to be the slight-
est possible excuse for so doing others
adopt this practice deliberately and for the
urpose of making the total of their sales
ook attractive in the eyes of the storekeeper
thus paying him the poor compliment of
believing that he is not shrewd and discern-
ing enough to detect their trick of course
the stores regular books of entry are writ-
ten up from the stubs of these small books
and if a number is missing in any one of
them it is a legitimate reason for inquiry
not fifty per cent of the country merchants
use these books which would in my opin-
ion probably cut down three-fourths of
lost charges

  economy of time is another matter al-
together too slightly considered by the
average storekeeper there is always some-
thing to do about a country store and the
successful merchant is one who is best able
to employ to advantage the time of his
clerks when they are not occupied by wait-
ing on customers it is not sufficient
however to keep the clerks occupied to
advantage during all their work hours but
the matter of economy in time should extend
beyond this and be applied to a suitable
arrangement of conveniences the mer-
chant who has his stock so arranged as to
handle it to the best possible advantage
can make a saving of anywhere from fifteen
to twenty-five per cent of actual labor in the
dealing out of goods it is not to be ex-
pected that the country store can be de-
signed upon a model plan as can the big
city merchandizing establishment but it
is true that the number of country stores in
which the maximum of possible conye-
nience has been obtained through an in-
telligent arrange-
ment of merchan-
dise is few

  so far as the ad-
vertising to be done
by the country mer-
chant is concerned
little need be said

concluded from page 

beyond the simple statement that he should
always bear in mind that trait of human
nature which will cause a customer to go to
unusual pains and inconvenience in order
to get the benefit of a bargain he may
depend upon it that if he advertises
some staple article at a figure which the
public knows must be very close to cost
or below it he will draw special custom
to his store-and that when these cus-
tomers are once within his doors they
will naturally buy other goods not adver-
tised or sold at a sacrifice price this it
seems to me is the whole story of success in
advertising so far as it concerns the country
storekeeper the thrifty farmer will drive
five miles over muddy roads to get a barrel
of salt on which he knows he is saving ten
cents while at the same time he will buy
other goods which the thrifty merchant
sells him at a good margin of profit
this is simply human nature it has
always been thus since country stores
began and will continue to be so as long as
they are run

  before dismissing the subject of selling
goods it should be said that the storekeeper
must always keep in mind the principle of
not allowing his customers to make his prices
the world is full of shrewd buyers and
every town has its proportion of them
these sharp traders have learned that if
they can get the prices on the merchants
goods they will get the best end of the
bargain when a customer comes into a
store and informs the merchant that his
competitor is selling sugar for two cents
less than the price which has just been
named to him the storekeeper should at
once settle it with himself that he is estab-
lishing a dangerous precedent and playing
into the hands of the customer if this
reported cut in price is met without care-
ful investigation and even then he should
generally stand firm and refuse to meet this
competitive attack the man who sells the
right goods in the right way has no need to do
business at a loss on any article or to allow
his competitor or his customers to make his
prices

  there are two classes of country store-
keepers who keep up the large percentage of
failures in this line of business these are
the merchants who are not contented with
small beginnings but insist in starting out
with a splurge and a show involving an
investment and expenditure beyond that
which the business will warrant and those
who on the other hand are content to drift
like logs down the stream and feel that they
are doing a fairly good business if they are
able to make sixty dollars a month with noth-
ing charged for carrying their investment

  there are thousands of small storekeepers
who are satisfied to make the wages of a
day laborer and who have little ambition
beyond this of course this means that
the margin between the profit and loss of
their total business is so small that a little
carelessness or a little misfortune turns
their balance against them when their
capital is so small and their resources are so
limited that they are unable to stand their
reverse even in a temporary way and are
therefore closed up by their creditors
this should emphasize the fact that no
matter how small may be the business of the
storekeeper it is absolutely essential to his
existence to figure his cost so that no item
or element will be left out to see that all of
his running expenses or fixed charges are
included in his cost that no goods are per-
mitted to pass over his counter without
being paid for or charged that he practices
thorough economy and does so in a con-
sistent and systematic way which applies
both to his handling of goods and to his use
of the services of his employees that he
keeps his store in a clean and attractive
manner and that he does not allow his
customers or his competitors to lead him
into making prices which do not yield him
a fair and substantial profit

   by thus stopping all the little leaks on the
one hand and by a consistent and energetic
expansion of profitable business on the other
the country storekeeper may amass a very
comfortable competency in almost any
locality which enjoys a reasonable de-
of prosperity depend upon it every

                community will
                have its prosperous
                storekeeper and he
                will succeed because
                he conducts his
                business upon the
                principles which
                have been indicated

the fighting chance

                                  continued from page 

they only turned around sulkily in the
corners of the cage and evinced a desire
to lie down

  what a mischief-maker you are said
sylvia listlessly and though grace became
very vivacious in describing her plans to
extract amusement out of planks hoped-
for presence sylvia remained uninterested

  there seemed in fact little to interest
her that summer at shotover house and
though she never refused any plans made
for her and her attitude was one of quiet
acquiescence always she never expressed
a preference for anything a desire to do
anything and if let alone was prone to
ace the cliffs or stretch her slim rounded
ody on the sand of some little sheltered
crescent beach apparently content with
the thunderous calm of sea and sky

   her interest too in people had seemingly
been extinguished once or twice she
did inquire as to marions whereabouts
and learned that miss page was fishing in
minnesota somewhere but would return
to shotover when the shooting opened
somebody captain voucher perhaps
mentioned to somebody in her hearing that
si ward was still in new york if she
heard she made no sign no inquiry the
next morning she remained abed with a
headache and grace motored to wendover
without her but sylvia spent the rest of
the day on the cliffs and played bridge
with the devils own luck till dawn piling
up a score that staggered mr fleetwood
wno had been instructing her in adversary
play a day or two before

  the hot month dragged on quarrier
came agatha caithness arrived a few
days later-scheme of the ferralls in-
volving alderdene-but the siwanoa did
not come and plank remained invisible
leila mortimer arrived from swans harbor
toward the middle of the month offering
no information as to the whereabouts of
what major belwether delicately designated
as her legitimate but everybody knew
he was at last to be crossed off and struck
clean out and the ugly history of the winter
now so impudently corroborated at sara-
toga gave many a hostess the opportunity
long desired mortimer as far as his own
particular circle was concerned was down
and out leila accepted as a matter of
course without him remained quietly
uncommunicative if the outward physi-
cal change in her was due to her marital
rupture people thought it was well that it
had come in time for she bloomed like a
lovely exotic and her silences and en-
thusiasms and the fragrant freshness of her
developing attitude toward the world first
disconcerted then amused then touched
those who had supposed themselves to be
so long a buckler for her foibles and a shield
for her caprice

  as for rlank he was too busy to know
what the thermometer was about he had
no time for anything outside of his own
particular business except to go every day
to the big darkened house in lower fifth
avenue where the days had been hard on
si ward and the nights harder

  siward however could walk now using
his crutches still but often stopping gently
to test his left foot and see how much weight
he was able to bear on it-even taking
a tentative step or two without crutch
support he drove when he thought it
prudent to use the horses in the heat
usually very early in the morning though
sometimes at night with plank when the
latter had time to run his touring car
through the park and out into the bronx
or westchester for a breath of air

  but plank wanted him to go away
get out of the city for his convalescence
and siward flatly declined demanding that
plank permit him to do his share in the
fight against the inter-county people

  and plank utterly unable to persuade
him and the more hampered because of
his anxiety about siward-though that
young man did not know it-wore himself
out providing siward with such employ-
ment in the matter as would lightly occupy
him without doing any good to the enemy

  so siward stripped to his pajamas pored
over reams of typewritten matter ana took
his brief walking exercise in the compara-
tive cool of the evening and drove when he
dared use his horses or sitting beside
plank whizzed northward through the
starry darkness of the suburbs

  then one sultry day toward the last
week in august a certain judge of a certain

court known among some as harringtons
judge sent secretly for plank and
plank knew that the crisis was over
but neither harrington nor quarrier
dreamed of such a thing

  fear sat heavy on that judges soul-the
godless selfish fear that sends the first
coward slinking from the councils of
conspiracy to seek immunity from those
slowly grinding millstones that grind ex-
ceeding fine

  quarrier at shotover with his private
car and his locomotive within an hours
drive strolled with sylvia on the eve of her
departure for lenox with leila mortimer
then when their conference was ended he
returned to agatha calmly unconscious
of impending events

  harrington at seabright paced his
veranda awaiting this same judge an-
noyed as two boats came in without the
expected guest and never for one instant
did he dream that his creature sat closeted
with plank tremulous sallow nearing
the edge of cringing avowal-only held
back from utter collapse by the agonizing
necessity of completing a bargain that
might save himself from the degradation of
the punishment that had seemed inevitable
all day long he sat with plank nobody
except those two knew he was there and
after a very long time plank consented that
nobody else except siward and harrington
and quarrier should ever know so he
called up harrington on the telephone
saying that there was in the office some-
body who desired to speak to him and
when harrington caught the judges first
faint stammered word he reeled where he
stood ashen unbelieving speechless the
shaking but remorseless voice went on
dinning horribly in his ear then ceased
and planks heavy voice sounded the curt
coup de grce

  harrington was an old man a very old
man mortally hurt but he steadied him-
self along the wall of his study to the desk
and sank into the chair 

   after a little while he passed a thin hand
over his eyes over his gray head over the
mouth that all men watched with fear
over the shaven jaw now grimly set but
trembling his hand too shook with
palsy as he wrote painfully picking out the
words and figures of the cipher from his
code-book but he closed his thin lips and
squared his unsteady jaw and wrote his
message to quarrier

its all up plank will take over

  inter-county come at once

   plank slept the sleep of utter exhaustion
that night the morning found him hag-
gard but strong cool in his triumph serious
stem-faced almost sad that his work was
done the battle won

  from his own house he telegraphed a
curt summons to harrington and to
quarrier for a conference in his own office
then finishing whatever business his
morning mail required put on his hat and
went to see the one man in the world he
was most glad for

  he found him at breakfast sipping
coffee and wrinkling his brows over the
eternal typewritten pages and planks
face cleared at the sight and he sat down
laughing aloud

  its all over siward he said har-
rington knows it quarrier knows it by
this time their judge crawled in yesterday
and threw himself on our mercy and the
men whose whip he obeyed will be on their
way to surrender by this time   
well havent you a word  

  many said siward slowly too many
to utter but not enough to express what i
feel if you will take two on account here
they are in one phrase thank you

   debts canceled said plank laughing
do you want to hear the details

  the narrative exchanged by plank in
return for siwards intensely interested
questions was a simple limpid review
of a short but terrific campaign that only
yesterday had threatened to rage through
court after court year after year in the
sudden shock of the cessation from battle
plank himself was a little dazed yet he
himself had expected the treason that
ended all he himself had foreseen it he
had counted on it as a good general counts
on such things confidently but with a
dozen plans as substitutes in case that
plan failed-each plan as elaborately
worked out to the last detail as though it

alone existed as the only hope of victory
but if siward suspected something of this
it was not from plank that he learned it

  plank he said at last there is
nothing in the world that men admire
more than a man it is a good deal of a
privilege for me to tell you so

  plank turned red with surprise and
embarrassment stammering out some-
thing incoherent

  that was all that was said about the
victory siward unusually gay for a
while presently turned sombre and it
was planks turn to lift him out of it by
careless remarks about his rapid con-
valescence and the chance for vacation
he so much needed

  once siward looked up vacantly
where am i to go he asked id as
soon stay here

  but im going insisted plank the
fells is all ready for us

  the fells i cant go there
w-what faltered plank looking at
siward with hurt eyes

  cant you-dont you understand
said siward in a low voice

  no you once promised--

  plank ill go anywhere except there
with you id rather be with you than
with anybody can i say more than
that   

  i think you ought to siward a-a
fellow feels the refusal of his offered roof-
tree

  man man it isnt your roof i am
refusing i want to go id give anything
to go if it were anywhere except where
it is id go fast enough now do you
understand if-if shotover house and
shotover people were not next door to
the fells id go now do you under-
stand

  plank said i dont know whether i
understand if you mean quarrier hes
on his way here and hell have business to
keep him here for the next few months i
assure you but  - he looked very gravely
across at siward-if you dont mean

quarrier-- he hesitated ill at ease

under the expressionless scrutiny of the
other

  do you know whats the matter with
me plank he asked at length

   i think so

  i have wondered i wonder now how
much you know

   very little siward

  how much

  plank looked up hesitated and shook
his head one infers from what one hears
infers what

  the truth i suppose replied plank
simply

  and what insisted siward have you
inferred that you believe to be the truth
dont parry plank it isnt easy for me
and i-i never before spoke this way to
any man  it is likely i should
have spoken to my mother about it   
i had expected to it may be weakness
-i dont know but id like to talk a
little about it to somebody and theres
nobody fit to listen except you

   if you feel that way said plank slowly
i will be very glad to listen

  i feel that way ive been through-
some things ive been pretty sick plank
it tires a man out a mans head and
shoulders get tired oh i dont mean the
usual reaction from self-contempt disgust-
the dreadful aching sadness  it all which
lasts even while desire stunned for the
moment wakens into craving i dont
mean that it is something else-a deathly
mental solitude that terrifies i tell you
no man except a man smitten by my
malady knows what solitude can be
   there i didnt mean to be

theatrical i had no intention of--

  go on cut in plank heavily

  go on    yes i want to
you know what a pillow is to a tired mans
shoulder i want to use your sane intel-
ligence to rest on a moment its my brain
thats tired plank

  siward rested his head on one clenched
hand how much chance do you think
i have he asked wearily

  plank considered for a moment then
you are not trying siward

  i have been trying since-since march
plank looked at him curiously what
happened in march

  siward cheek crushed against his fist
his elbow on the desk gazed at him steadily

   in march he said miss landis spoke
to me ive made a better fight since
planks serious face darkened is she
the only anchor you have



  plank i am not even sure of her i
have made a better fight since then that
is all i dare say     i know what
men think about a man like me i know
they demand character pride self-denial
but plank i am driving faster and faster
toward the breakers and these anchors
are dragging for it is not in my case the
physical failure to obey the will it is the
will itself that has been attacked from the
first that is the horror of it and what
is there behind the will-power to strengthen
it only the source of will-power-the
mind it is the mind that cannot help me
what am i to do

  there is a spiritual strength said
plank timidly

  i have never dreamed of denying it
said siward i have tried to find it

through the accepted sources-accepted
by me too god has not helped me in the
conventional way or through traditional
methods  but that has not inclined me to
doubt him as the tribunal of last resort
he added hastily i dont for a moment
waver in faith because i am ignorant of
the proper manner to approach him the
arbiter of all knows that i desire to
be decent he must be aware too that
all anchors save one have failed to hold
me

  he looked up at plank curiously em-
barrassed

  your body is normal your intelligence
wholesome balanced sane and i want
to ask you if you think that perhaps
without understanding how i have found
in her or through her in some way the
spiritual source that i think might help me
to help myself

  and as plank made no reply

  or am i talking sentimental cant
dont answer if you think that i cant
trust my own mind any more anyway
and with an ugly laugh ill know it all
some day-the sooner the better

  dont say that growled plank
you were sane a moment ago

  siward looked up sharply but the other
silenced him with a gesture

  wait you asked me a perfectly sane
question-so wholesome so normal that
im trying to frame an answer worthy of it
i intimated that after the physical the
mental the ethical phenomena there re-
mained always the spiritual instinct like
a wireless current if a man can establish
communication it is well for him whatever
the method you assented i think
yes

  and you ask me if i believe it possible
that she can be the medium

  yes

  plank said deliberately yes i do
the silence was again broken by plank
siward you have asked me what i think
now you must listen to the end if you
believed that through her-her love
marrying her-you stood the best chance
in the world to win out it would be cowardly
to ask her to take the risk as much as i
care for you i had rather see you lose the
fight than accept such a risk from her
now you know what i think-but you
dont know all siward i say to you that
if you are man enough to take her take her
and i say that of the two risks she is running
to-day the chance she might take with you
is infinitely the lesser risk for with you
if you continue slowly losing your fight
the mental suffering only will be hers
but if she closes this bargain with quarrier
the light will go out of her soul for ever
he leaned heavily toward siward
stretching out his powerful arm

  you marry her and keep open your
spiritual communication through her if
that is the way it has been established and

hang on to your god that way until your
body is dead i tell you siward to marry
her i dont care how you do it i dont
care how you get her take her yours
of the two is the stronger character or
she would not be where she is does she
want what you cannot give her cure
that desire-it is more contemptible than
the craving that shatters you i say let
the one-eyed lead the blind miracles are
worked out by mathematics-if you have
faith enough

  he rose holding out his broad hand

  good-by he said harrington is
about due at my office quarrier will
probably turn up to-night i am not
vindictive i shall be just with them-as
just as i know how which is to be as
merciful as i dare be good-by i-i
believe you and she are going to get well

  both as to taste and in its nourishing sustaining qualities that there
  is no comparison
