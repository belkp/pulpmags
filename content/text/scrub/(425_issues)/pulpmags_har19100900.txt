this hitherto unpublished novel turns on divergen-

saxon and though not quite finished but standing
complete as far as it goes it is worthy to rank with
the authors greatest work

it gives clear views of english life in town and
country gives strongly individualized characters

english and irish some of great charm and others
though lacking that quality win the readers sym-
pathy because the writers power of presentation
makes them so well understood and beyond all it
sets forth in a remarkably impartial and human way
the attitude toward each other of these two races and
the elements that cause it

be that much deducted from the rest of the magazine the part that pleases those
readers who dont like serials so we said  nothing doing and stuck to it for

of novelette short stories sketches and verse all complete in each number and
then put on sixteen more pages to allow for a serial installment

vogue just now than those of any other man in the english-speaking world be-
cause theyre real life and brimful of action and fire the illustrious prince

     havoc beginning in this number is his latest and biggest as the story
progresses it gets more tense and exciting and ends in a very cyclone of startling
happenings better arrange now to get every number

    octobers going to be a corking good issue

   the complete novel is to be something quite unusual the haunted
pajamas-doesnt that tickle your curiosity francis perry elliott the
author has a singularly pleasing style and youll like the hero its the kind
of novel thats read clear through at one sitting

best sellers today contributes a strong story of domestic life  a second chance
angela morgans newspaper story  the craving is a tense illuminating
account of the way some great beats are obtained may isabel fisks

              this month-sixteen pages added

    a lot of people wanted a big serial story this was against the old estab-

fore he began to write in this book are some of his earliest
humorous lectures and speeches it contains several hun-
dred some long and some short it shows in an accentuated way
mark twains chief characteristics conceived and composed to be
spoken these speeches are even more simple and direct than his written
works he qualities of humor philosophy and great understand-
ing of life are as paramount here as in mark twains books these
speeches however are all humorous in their style and method they
show one remarkable thing about mark twains work whether spoken
or written-he never repeated himself it naturally follows that these
lectures cover almost every conceivable subject from weather and
women to politics and fishing

   the book has an introduction by w d howells and also a preface
written by mark twain himself this page is one of the most charac-
teristic bits he ever wrote

   the speeches of mark twain in point of time cover a little more
than half of his life many of them were delivered at important occa-

ceived the doctors degree from that university speeches at various

the success of  the wild olive  is even
greater than that of  the inner shrine 
because the story is greater better finer

 the wild olive  has a broader basis of
plot a nobler conception of character a
higher idealism it is-above all else-a
remarkably human story

    it is assured of a success not inferior to that of  the inner shrine of the two
novels we place  the wild olive first-aw orleans picayune

    from the opening chapter it seizes the readers attention and this grip isnt
released until the last word is said-san francisco chronicle

   an even better success and better deserved is attending the wild olive   
for the new book is in its workmanship a remarkable advance uon the other

  biancas daughter

by justus miles forman

this is a society story-plus a mystery both
of these mr forman does well but never
before has he done them with such distinction

 mr forman is one of the most expert novel writers of
the time this story is the very best that has ever come
from his pen-salt lake tribune

opened biancas daughter and left neither the chair nor the
book until we had turned the last page-new york world

a romance of strenuous affection

galloping scintillating sparkling
fun from beginning to end-and
withal clean and sweet as a girls

to our readers

tj intelligent american fathers and mothers realize that
nothing-literally nothing-can compensate for failure to
give their children not only the best general education to
be obtained but the best special advantages and environ-
ment which the nature and temperament of each child
imperatively needs for material success in after life in pleasant
social environments

if harpers magazine for many years has published the adver-
tisements of a larger number of high-grade schools than
any other periodical in the world and harpers magazine
has been the means of placing in the best schools a larger
number of desirable pupils than any other periodical

  because-

 harpers magazine properly jealous of its unrivalled stand-
ing admits none but advertisements of schools deservedly
having unquestioned reputation and because harpers maga-
zine works as conscientiously in the interest of parents and
pupils as it works in the interest of the schools which ad-
vertise

tf if you are in doubt as to where you will send your boy
or girl or cannot find just the sort of school you seek
among the large number advertised in this issue feel per-
fectly free to write for information and suggestions to

harpers bookshelf

it is not often that an author otherwise
well equipped for doing a distinctive
work in fiction can draw upon a store of
material so rich and striking as that which
zaue grey lias lavishly used in liis now novel
the heritage f the desert it must be said
that mr grey lias worthily lived up to a
of the greatest opportunities ever a writer
had to produce
a strongly orig-
inal and char-
acteristically
american novel

the scene of the
story lies in
southern i tali
and nortiiem
arizona - the
country domi-
nated by t h e
grand canon
and by the mys-
teries of the
desert z a n e
grey knows this
region as lies
beach knows the
alaskan gold-
fields or llam-
lin garland the
west of his boy-
hood  for here
in the wilder-
ness he has
shared the life
of hunters and
ranchmen mor-
mons and nava-
jos it is a life
of which little
has ever reached
the outside
world and its
full revelation
adds the touch of strangeness to a tale that
s in itself sufficiently romantic tt is a
pleasure to add that although the novel is
brilliantly atmospheric-saturated with that
feeling for environment which only a few
writers can express-it is no mere picture
it is a virile romance full of action in which
mcn are swayed by strong primitive motives

facing ik-ath carelessly seldom has the
 elemental  note been sounded so truly

  the hero john hare is a consumptive
invalid sent west for his liealth drifting
about from place to place he at last arrives
in southern utah where he hopes to find
employment on the cattle ranges hut the

country to which
he has come is
terrorized by a
band of outlaws
and cattle-
rustlers  whose
captain is a man
n a m e  dene
dene at once
suspects that
ilare is a spy
a n d threatens
his life turn-
ing back hares
strength fails
him on the trail
he loses his way
and is found in
a dying condi-
tion by a mor-
mon named
august naab
who takes pity
upon him and
shields him from
his pursuers

  on his first
appearance the
man naab im-
presses the read-
er strongly and
the conviction of
his genuineness
and real bigness
grows as the
story advances tie is a tremendous and
striking figure physically he is a giant
and his force of character matches his size
he is of a peaceable nature yet he has a
trick with a gun which makes him quick as
lightning on the draw moreover he is a
man with a great heart kind to all living
things dointr all tlie good he can and trust-
harpers bookshelf

ing rod i fore at ones first entrance into
the desert country one meets a man of
primitive strength and primitive faith like
a patriarch of the old testament lie lives
in peace ami plenty with his sons and laugh-
ters in a remote oasis thither he transports
tho invalid making him practically one of
his own family naali is above all else a
man and he is determined to make a man
of hare lie sends him to the high sheep
ranges to regain his health with him he
semis his adopted daughter mescal-a half-
spanish half-indian girl whose regular work
is the tending of tho sheep thus at tho very
outset of the story strong sympathy is
aroused for the sick man given a last des-
perate chance for life and longing inex-
pressibly for health ami manhood is most
appealing and mescal with her entirely nat-
ural but strangely complex personality draws
interest irresistibly the first stage of tho
story is a curiously picturesque idyl contain-
ing some exciting episodes and showing tlie
development of hare from a feeble dis-
couraged creature hardly able to walk into
a man of rugged strength and ready resource
at the same time the growth of his love for
mescal is pictured with delicacy and restraint

  then the story widens out august naab
has an enemy-the rancher holdemess
lloldemess is really a cattle-rustler hand and
glove with dene and his band he is resolved
to ruin naab and to possess himself of his
property by seizing his water-holes the very
sources of life to men and cattle alike re-
peated aggressions result in a war in which
hare stands nobly by his benefactor but his
position is rendered difficult by t m fact that
mescal whom ho loves is promised in mar-
riage to tho mormons eldest son  snap
naab-a worthless renegade who eventually
deserts to dene to escape a union with a
man she loathes mescal taking an indian
companion flees across the painted desert
hare goes to find her and the story of the
search is told with a vividness and imagina-
tive power that make it an episode almost
without parallel in tho fiction of the time
august naab long remains true to his prin-
ciples of peace but the killing of one of his
sons throws him into a berserker rage and
he begins a struggle which despite some
strongly tragic features finally results in hap-
piness for hare and mescal and all the people
whom the reader has grown to love

  the tale overflows with exciting happen-
ings not the least of which is the taming
of the splendid wild horse silvermane-one
of the great horses of fiction yet the nar-
rative is no more series of adventures all
that is related seems perfectly natural in-
contestably real every motive is so genuine
all the people are so convincing tho spell
of the desert is so insistent that the reader
soon loses tlie sense of strangeness-almost
of bewilderment-with which the story at
first affects him through absorption in the
sheer human interest of the drama he fairly
forgets that he is reading a tale of extraordi-
nary exploits violent acts and occasional
bloodshed one lays down the book with the
feeling that he has read a novel of real
finality one that does ftl  justice to the
dramatic possibilities and tho strong in-
herent interest of its theme

  stories written in the form of confessions
or revelations of intimate feeling and lifo-
exporience have come to ik- regarded with
a certain suspicion they are in fact only
toe likely to prove insipid or cheaply sensa-
tional or both but the reader of o dor-
sets a successful wife will find a story of
tho intimately revealing sort that is both
arresting and worthy of serious attention
despite the fact that it is written in the
simplest possible way-save for its connected-
ness almost like a diary or a letter-a
successful wife is a well-planned finely
executed novel holding the interest strongly
from beginning to end it is full of dramatic
elah and struggle and the character of the
heroine is a triumph although esther
carey is just a simple unimaginative woman-
ly girl-absolutely true in her mental traits
to the type of working-girl she represents-
there is never the slightest appearance of
improbability in tlie influence she maintains
over the brilliant erratic man she marries
or in the unconscious attraction she exercises
upon every other man in the story

  esther is loft fatherless at fifteen and is
faced with the necessity of supporting herself
and a family of five she is not of tho com-
monplace type in which devotion to duty
takes the place of every other emotion but
she has no time to be sentimental or to think
of herself she learns stenography but is
forced to leave her first position through the
undue attentions of her employer then she

mrs falsworth is superficial and faddish
her husband is starved for the affection and
sympathy his wife should give him will
falsworth falls in love with esther and half
persuades her to elope with him meanwhile
she has become the head of a typewriting
establishment of her own one day a promi-
nent politician senator bellars dictates to
her a sharp letter addressed to his nephew
stephen kirkland in paris in it he orders
stephen to come to him and offers him  one
more chance  if he will reform when
kirkland arrives he turns out to be a hand-

ners and all the jxdish of foreign travel me
is irresistibly drawn to esther who feels
somehow that he needs her more than will
falsworth she helps him through one or
two periods of intense temptation to drink
even walking all over the city with him at
night falsworth makes a scene but is sent
alwt his business then in spite of bitter
protests from senator bellars esther and
kirkland are married

  in her wifehood esther suffers all that a
woman can suffer from a man who is dis-
sipated and eeeentric but never forgets that
he is  gentleman first kirkland tries
literature and the refusal of the drama in
blank verse upon which he has based his
hopes plunges him into despair and drunken-
ness recovering he goes into finance hut
his speculations fail at the same time he

with a lien ifn  voting girl who apparently
commits suicide for his sake to all these
troubles esther applies her unfailing rem-

to throw over the burden she has assumed
her husband promises her unasked that he

of emotional experiences it is a fine study
of character and of human nature-genuinely
thoughtful too since the less the heroine
philosophizes the greater is the need of insight

author it is sympathetic not analytical yet
rouses far more than a passing sentimental

gration naples-warm golden pas-
sionate wonderful-her fair brows set

lo	tho sea bound by tin- sea as though
by a turquoise band is as brimming with
folk as a cup is full of wine-as deep
with sound ami murmurs as a hive the
city is in the grip of life not as tho
west understands living but in the ori-
ental sense of the term

  the place pays the price of its charm
and is both loved and hated as for the
neapolitans they snap their fingers at
all italy the tortuous redolent foul
old town is content with itself and its
divinity the sea the peoples gods their
loves and fears their delights and super-
stitions are happily and noisily contained
in this southern metropolis circled by
azure waves hound again by shores of
pearl the bay studded by islands that
lie like blue roses on a lapis-lazuli table
thus the eyes of the neapolitans are
feasted with beauty

   mv of napoli they shrug and cut
off all italy with a sweep and are still
like a kingdom of their own and tem-
peramentally isolated in revenge the
north hates naples heartily  earth-
quakes the romans exclaim but of
course and eruptions of vesuvius of
coiirr-what do you expect t naples is
a very wicked city it is the scum of
tlie kingdom it will be with them as
it was in sicily and small loss

  fronting the bay tho riviera di
chiaia extends its broad avenue flanked
by the sea-wall the spray of the ocean
dashing up bright and salt on the air

there is a cluster of streets indicating
the parco nazionale and back of this
stretches the line of imposing eighteenth-
century houses this is the elegant quar-
ter of naples more rechcrchs in the
time of lady hamilton and nelson than
now the facades of these adorable
houses are pink and yellow there are
green iron balconies there are pale-green
shuttered windows the riviera di
chiaia is still the fashionable promenade
of an afternoon and napless modish ex-
istence defiles and rolls and clatters ami
dashes past along the avenue between the
old city and the sea and from the high-
way crawl the narrow cobbled streets wind
and twist the narrow alleys to old naples
there are banchi di lotto along the
riviera and the dandy whose miniature
cart drawn by a miniature donkey waits
at the curb jostles the barber and the
hotel porter at the ticket-sellers window
for these are the types of the purchasers
down here in more worldly naples

  sheer up from the blue the gateway
of the sea at one end the big square of
the via toledo at the other runs a prin-
cipal artery of the city the via di
chiaia so narrow that when two tiny
carriages find themselves abreast they are
embarrassed the street is built up so
high that the balconied houses appear to
form an apex over it this thorough-
fare is never liberated from its throng
and the tangle of human network winds
and unwinds and forms again - all
naples every profession character and
type jostle throng and exist hen in the
via di chiaia the big shops line it
on either side busy with traffic of coral
and shell and the middle of the street is
ns good to the pedestrian as the ribbon-
like sidewalk and the dashing cabs
swung high on impossible springs drawn
by the gaylv harnessed valiant stallions
tear like mad when they can move at
all through hilly streets their progress
obstructed by beggars and foot passengers
by flower merchants whose arms are full
of violets camellias and roses little
horse tram-cars not meant for rails
blunder over the cobbles laden down with
a gay load of passengers beautiful pri-
vate carriages drawn by horses of moor-
ish strain and the procession forms un-
der the bluest of skies tlie most brilliant
of pictures of street life imaginable a
neapolitan fishgrmbn

medieval gateway cuts across the middle
of the street forming an arch under
which tlie bright procession passes and
every now and then on either side the
famous stairways of naples climb into
the hilly city

  from the via li chiaia ran the famous
gradini of naples highways of steep
stone staircases reaching to hilly in-
clines forming picturesque passages
crowded with life flanked by narrow-
windowed high houses and literally
ablaze with camellias roses violets lielio-
trope these passages pour into the
boulevard their oceans of color and light
tlie streets themselves are so highly
built that they affect to meet above in
the sunlight whose brilliance comes
flickering down its way broken and scat-
tered by flags of drying clothes fluttering
in the misty light the chinese quarter
in old san francisco the precincts of
peking have something in common with
this crowding of naples here in these
obscurer alleys the black hand is fos-
tered and every now and then a fever
stalks here and cleans out a few of the
herded citizens and there is always the
mad fever of the lotto to eat the in-
habitants like a live creature whose pur-

suit is fascination and whom nobody
wishes to escape over the turmoil hangs
a sky of supernal azure and now ami
again at the end of the street one catches
sight of the sea framed by the houses
and now and again through tlie close
atmosphere comes the breath of the sea
blowing divinely in purification an ap-
peal from the cleansing force that washes
around these shores

  at the end of the via chiaia on the
fine old piazza is the big golden-brown
reddish palace with its green blinds and
its terraces fronting the sea its appear-
ance is regal and its most vivid and in-
teresting life was in the eighteenth cen-
tury during tlie bourbon reign when the
strong-minded queen caroline left an un-
questionable influence over naples and
when in her villa at posilipo lady ham-
ilton danced her ravishing dances and
from her window waved lier white hand
to nelson

  there are many treasures in the casa
reale and one after another festival and
ball and banquet rooms stretch their lino
-their windows seaward giving on
orange-grown terraces-and here in the
gallery there is a picture too of the
bewildering emma the adorable lady

  death in most countries wears a sol-
emn face but in naples it is like some
festival from the middle ages the
hearses are of gold and curiously wrought
with nodding plumes before the funeral
chariot the procession is of the most
brilliant acolytes in white robes with
huge candles and troops of eager inter-
ested people swell the procession but
more singular than all are the mummers
the hired mourners dressed either in
snow-white robes from head to foot
hooded dresses from which their eyes
peer forth or all in crimson gazing out
through their masks the candles flare
and smoke upon the air the horses are
trapped in scarlet or white harness and
in and out the narrow street at the foot
of the stairway with their flowers to the
gray damp church of st francis the
procession files through the town at one
sharp comer there is a block and the
file pauses the majordomo driving
the hearse on his high box in his gor-
geous livery looks up for it is saturday
and bis hearse has stopped just in front
of a banco di lotto mechanically as
if from habit the driver touches his
breast where in bis wallet are his lottery
tickets oh if to-day he were only  for-
tunate perhaps who knows and
the obstruction removed he gathers up
his reins and drives his burden on and
the dead man no doubt for the first time
is not interested in the winning number

  jutting out on the point the sea-
dogs lapping around the stones the gas-
tello dell oro lifts a brown bastion rock-
like on its inky reef it has all the fascina-
tion of hoary age and contains napless
ancient mysteries here old conquerors
before the middle ages held high car-
nival and there were dreadful doings in
those dungeons below the sea modern
barracks crowd up against the castel but
nothing except the sea shocks its rest

is very great of flounders lily-like carp
coral-like carp coral-like slender fish

octojii are the most appreciated food of
the neapolitan the devil and jelly fish
are sold in squares and the agitated
feelers of the octopus and squirming parts
of the eels ciif hip hul still alive make
a curious picture over all is the odor
of the ftillura-fried bits of fish which
a street cook offers to the epicure from
his brilliantly polished brazier of bril-
liant grease

there are brown red and green and
yellow and pink leathers in process of
dyeing for slippers worn by the belles
of naples there are slippers being made
in the streets fresh from the newly dyed

crowded with peasants with fresh young

   why the lotto is an excellent thing
for the people mi intelligent roman
told me those people arc so miserably
poor what would you for six days
in the week they dream when saturday
comes then they are deceived they
only hare one day of despair and six days
of hope not many jieople can say that
as soon as the lotto is drawn at five oil
saturday they nil begin to hope again
kcoo it is a real inspiration

  this roman a man of family and dis-
tinction played the lotto himself faith-
fully and he surely should know its power
of uplift

  in the midst of the filth of porta
capuana arises the chtirch of santa
maria del carmine a little square is
its outlook tumbledown filthy old houses
are its surroundings before its doors
the amazingly simple little passengers on
the country diligence arrive ami depart
in front of the church is the ceaseless
defile of the people of the quarter and
on every side one looks at the vistas and
isles of crowded steaming streets hung
with the banner of the wash multicolored
with the drying fluttering clothes crime
and birth and death desire and life and
tho takimr of it all go on here in a vio-
lent ardent fashion and above the tu-
mult just a little apart from it santa
maria del carmine mothers it all the
slippered feet pattering along the streets
turn in here to confession the sailors
blow in from a hundred different port
fresh from the sea eager to find a priest

  on this day covered by the most filthy
racs a girl of about eighteen years of
age crouched on tlie stones indifferent
alike to the compatriot and to the stran-
ger she sings in a crooning voice her
head is wrapped in an old scarf once
comfortably settled in her corner she
spreads her treasures out upon her knees
untying an old handkerchief in which
harpers monthly magazine

each has a lottery ticket in her blouse

her jewels are kept she finds a bit of
tinselled rac and a string of blue beads
ami a lottery ticket she kisses her treas-
ures one by one crooning over them un-
der the shade of mao- of the carmine

  as the chimes of five oclock ring out
a crowd of sailors roll in to find the
confessor a crowd of women in strident
voices fight over some bagatelle on the
square it is saturday and just five
oclock at this moment is the drawing
of the lotto but the foolish-minded girl
kisses her treasures and does not mark
the hour the drawing of the lotto has
at last become indifferent to her luna-
tics therefore and the dead are immune

 the santa maria del carmine is
very ancient it dates back to the
eleventh century it is charming plain
and old and quiet and sombre about
it is the charm of those churches sought
and loved by the poor great miracles

have been wrought
at these shrines
there is a virgin
there painted by
st luke and cel-
ebrated for h e r
healing powers
there is also the
christ on ii i s
cross-the miracle
cross-to whom t be
people lift their
poor bleeding
hands this christ
hung here during
the siege of the
ttrince of aragon
and just as the
cannon-ball sped
throng h t h e
church making
the head of the
crucified saviour
its mark they say
that the meek
head bent forward
upon tho breast
and short of the
mark the cannon-
ball dropped at
the holy altar
rich with legend
and colored pic-
tures santa maria
del carmine has its peculiar beauty
here bending in candlelight the women
pray to win at the lotto and there is no
way of telling what the christ or the vir-
gin of st luke thinks of these prayers

  king humbert the first made the rules
for the public lottery of italy

  	the public lottery is temporarily
maintained by the favor of tlie state
under the following laws

  	it is administered by the minister
of finance under whom the chiefs are
chosen for their respective functions

  	the lotto is formed fay ninety num-
bered from  to flo inclusive five of which
drawn by chance determine the successful

  	one can play the lotto in the
following manner

  on one number very rarely played

 on all five numbers very rarely
played

  on two numbers-the  amlio
naples ani the lotto



  on three numbers-which is known as
the  terno

  on four numbers-which is known as
the  quaterno

  	when one number is played the
winner is paid ten times and a half his
output when two numbers are played
the winner is paid  times his output
when three numbers are played the win-
ner is paid  times his output when
four numbers are played the winner is
paid  times his output therefore
if one has by any chance bought a num-
ber  ticket and wins the four numbers
quaterno ho wins 

  at five oclock on every saturday after-
noon throughout all italy the drawing of
the lotto takes place in naples the
ceremony is held at the end of a foul
filthy alley known
as the  impresa
back in a great
courtyard in full
view of the people
on the balcony of
an oll palace from
early in the after-
noon until the fatal
hour the streets of
santa chiara and
the alley fill up with
 e crowd whose
hope on this day is
to be deceived the
streets are always
so full of life that
for this extra crowd
jostling pushing
a n  eager then
would seem to be no
place it is com-
prised of the very
poor the better
classes watch f r
the telephone or the
showing of the
numbers in the va-
rious banks in the
city to discover
their fate but in
the impresa the
crowd of people is
as dense as a shad-
ow over it all
however then- is
the odor of tonin-
toes onions garlic

and other wares sold in the little
shops along the side and the eager
compressed mass seethes and sways talk-
ing crying explaining telling of their
systems and their fortunate combinations
as their eyes are fixed on the balcony of
the palace whose green blinds are not
yet drawn there are many here who
have played their last cent for a tieket
   there are many here who are in debt
for the shoes they wear and will never be
able to pay for them but at the stroke
ot the church clock the blinds of the bal-
cony open and the paraphernalia of tha
lotto are brought out a long green table
on which is placed a crystal ball bound
with silver and an iron box containing
ninety other little boxes iu which the
ninety numbers are locked by the state

harpers monthly magazine

tlie officers of this performance are coolly
indifferent and the only figure deserving
of note is that of the little orphan child
dressed in snowy white chosen by law
from the orphan asylum to draw up from
the crystal ball the five magic- numbers

  at the sight of these familiar lookcd-
for objects the crowd begin to cry and
chant to beseech and evoke they beg
the little orphan child to draw well they
bless him they call him little jesus
and little saint and the child in his
white rolie his innocent eyes on the mass
of people looks down on the lieggars with
their yellow looks and on the appealing
mass one by one the balls are taken
out from their sealed boxes displayed to
the people and dropped into the big bowl
when they have all been shaken about
and number  has fallen in the enthu-
siasm breaks forth and the popular sig-
nification of the different numbers is
cried out number  means the sea
 the passion of christ these are for-
tunate numbers a silence falls on the
crowd when the numbers are all within
and the officers turn the big bowl around
and around until the white globes with
their numbers donee like the mad dance
of fate the orphan child is blindfolded
and led up to the great bowl the cries
are so impetuous now that some one
says hush you will frighten the
little angel let him decide our fortunes
in peace

  there is not a filthy beggar in the com-
pany but expects that he will be a rich
man when the child draws the numbers
some of them have paid five francs for
their tickets though the majority cost
but a few pence there are shoemakers
in tbit crowd second gaetanos who will
go mad if they draw the big prize there
is the gardener from the bertolini palace
who is hated by the people this fellow
was fortunate last week lie saw a stab-
bing and a fire and his child died and
he played the numbers  to and  and
won  lie is wondered at by the
people and hated as well for his success
already since the last drawing he has
paid out  for lotto tickets  is
gains will soon go back to the government

  crouched against the wall of the op-
posite bouse is a dishevelled woman with
a cage under her arm she is one of the
white-rat sellers down at the santa

chiara and she cannot leave her mer-
chandise behind her even for the drawing
of the lotto she murmurs that she has
mortgaged her little animals to buy her
last lotto ticket her eyes are as red
as the rats eyes  qui lo sa she whis-
pered  i mny win then i will go and
live in the country with my people

  they have blindfolded the little bam-
bino and lie stands on a chair for lie is
only eight years of age and is small in
full sight of the people tlie balls hav-
ing been shaken around for the last time
the child puts bis hand in and draws
the first number that he pulls out is
called forth- number  now every
italian who has bought number  for
place has either won or lost no one
holds this number in this crowd how-
ever and there is a murmur and a fresh
adjuration for the child to draw well
the people who have drawn for the terno
and the quaterno still have their eliance
the child draws again this time num-
ber  ami the holders of the terno
are now the interested ones for the next
will lie their last chance the enthu-
siasm breaks forth again with murmurs
and cries and prayers and the quiet child
before the urn in his white dress hears
them and trembles for he knows that he
is menaced before the people there is
a blackboard and a man posts up the
numbers as they are drawn   

	and  and this series of five is
discussed yelled at challenged cursed
for not one in the crowd has drawn a
fortunate number the childs eyes are
unbound and he is put down and set free
the balls are returned into their boxes
scaled up and carried away under the
eyes of the crowd which after waiting
for a moment unable to believe its ill
fortune breaks up and disrupts apathy
is thrown upon the majority as much
as such a state of mind is possible to a
neapolitan mass as they begin in groups
to discuss the failure of their schemes
and their combinations

  glancing at the numbers on the board
which nrc now telephoned and telegraphed
throughout all italy the face of the
gardener of the bertolini palace is a
study he stands close to the wall next
to the woman with her white rats if
i had only listened to my wife he mur-
murs   she told me to play the childs
naples and the lotto

her death showing hi tickets ho goes a being of chance a believer in ultimate
on to say think if i had played the good fortune and this saturday ceases

for see  hold llir oilier numbers	are turned toward next saturday  qui

the perfect hour

 by mary heaton vorse

jimsie lay full length on tlie soft
grass of tlie promontory that over-
looked the sound louise sat be-
side him

  being but newly married they bad
refused to go sailing and had seen the
others go off grumbling among them-
selves at tlie lamentable change wrought
by marriage in a jolly fellow like jimsio
bate and in a corking girl like louise
when louise had announced that she
didnt feel like sailing and bad prophesied
that they would get becalmed anyway
her brother brick had whistled rudely
no wedding bulls for me at which one
of the girls snickered and caused jimsie
who disliked to behave as a mr newly-
wed before all the world to remark in a
tone that he strove to make casual

  i guess therell be a breeze louise
lets go thereby shifting the burden of
the whole thing on his wife

  but louise replied promptly

  i dont want to go sailing being
like all women less sensitive in these
matters than a man for a man will do
any number of things that he doesnt
want to do to keep his life from reading
like the comic supplement of a sunday
paper while a woman is touchingly ready
to accept ridicule if she con only have
what she wants

  hero brick remarked impishly

  aw come ahead jimsie wo got a
new spinnaker-nnd a new balloon-jib
he added insinuatingly playing on
timsies love for piling on oil the canvas
there was timsie ached to see that
spinnaker and that balloon-jib but he
was under the grip of a passion greater
than that of sailing a boat powerful as
that was he didnt want to miss one
minute of louise and though he flushed
at thus being  caught with the goods
under cover of lighting a cigarette he
muttered that he guessed lie wouldnt go
as he said this be felt like an awful ass
nd yet supremely hoppy

  vfl cxxi -no -

  during her brothers speech louise
liad sat waiting every nerve tense it
seemed to lier as though her whole life
was being swung in the balance if
jimsie decided to go without her she
couldnt live through the afternoon in-
deed she must have followed him

  with a curious little tightening of her
heart she realized that whatever he did
she would follow him as for her life
and jimsie were one and the same thing

  so the young people had gone their
way sailing with the superior feeling
that the heart-free have in the presence
of wedded love all tlie world may love
a lover and look with indulgence upon
young people so absorbed in one anotlx-r
that they see nothing else but there is
something in a spectacle of too obvious
devotion of young married people that
is exasperating alike to those who are
unmarried and to married people who
have gotten over this first acute stage
of complete absorption in the beloved
these latter shriir a shoulder at that
page of love forever closed to them and
the unmarried look upon it with blank
amazement and mutter  another good
fellow spoiled

  timsie knew how his friends felt
he was near enough to the old life
to know exactly what sort of a figure
he was cutting in their eyes and lie
was clad when their voices bad ceased
to echo in his ears and he end louise
were left olone in the company of on
aunt ond uncle of louises ond louises
father and mother the eyes of the
older men rested upon him with humor-
ous tolerance but in the eyes of louises
mother were tenderness and understand-
ing and alo a certain wistfulness as
though she said mutely

   hold fast to these hours of deep
and complete understanding like tho
first golden hours of summer these days
are short for you spring has passed
with its white blossoms and the roses


narpers monthly magazine

are now in bloom but the time of the
full bloom of tho roses is short the
summers heat withers them so enjoy
every one of these perfect ilays while
you have them that you may remem-
ber them in time of drought arid in the
fall when things become green again
and through the long days of winter

  moved by a common impulse louise
and jimsie drifted from the piazza into
tho garden and then without talking
of taking a walk they had gone on and
on until they found themselves in this
field overhanging the water borne there
by their common need of getting away

  it was not only tliat they wanted to
be out of ear-shot of other people they
wanted to be quite by themselves where
no casual relative would break in upon
the magic circle around them it was
as though solitude enclosed them in some
shimmering radiant atmosphere-an at-
mosphere impossible to retain in tike
presence of another person it was be-
cause of this radiant understanding that
jimsie was willing to leave all the life
he knew for the sake of louise and
louise her own dear and familiar world
for the sake of a man she had met only
 to speak the day before

  at first they talked but little and
watched the little fleet of pleasure-boats
which dotted the sound like a flock of
white birds then little by little the
fountains of speech became unloosed
jimsie told stories of his adventures of
his boyhood and youth lie handed out
to louise these small adventures with the
air of a man making startling disclosures
so sure was he that the slightest detail
concerning him was of value to her
she responded by telling the stories of
her own life they had a great many
such stories to tell for they knew little
about each other this to them was
a subject of congratulation they felt
very wise that they had been clever
enough to get engaged as jimsie put it
 off the bat instead of waiting around
for years and years for it is a note-
worthy fact that whichever way people take
for getting engaged they have the same
sublime conviction that their road is the
only one which leads to true happiness

  so jimsie walked happily through the
hours of his past calling forth the face
of a friend an escapade or the story of

a dog and presented them to louise as
a child brings pebbles from the shore
to show its mother sure that the things
which he brings are wonderful and rare

  under this reminiscence louise felt
a little restless she liked to hear all
these things she loved everything jimsie
had to say to her but she liked too to
talk about the present she didnt ever
want him to go far from her not even
back into her own past so she asked

   what was the happiest hour of your
life jimsie i mean the really happiest
hour of all and she waited to hear
something concerning herself with the
confidence that a child holds up its face
to be kissed but jimsie repeated with a
little half-puzzled frown

  my very happiest hour thats an
awfully queer thing louise ive often
thought about it but theres hardly any-
thing to tell dont yon know how little
things mean so much more sometimes
than big ones i remember once when
i was a kid there was a wreck on a rail-
way train i was in there was a lot of
glass smashed and women screeched and
a man got his leg jammed and i was
thrown down and got my head cut-
right here see and he pointed to a
small white sear hidden by his hair
 and all the time i was thinking  this
is an adventure id always wanted
one but this was awfully stupid and flat
we waited for hours on a siding and it
was hot and tiresome and i didnt get
a bit excited and yet if anybody had
told me when i started out that i was
going to be in a collision i would have
thought it was great thats the way
it is-when things get exciting you are
too busy to notice that they are interest-
ing or else they dont seem to amount
to anything and some little thing will
happen and you cant forget it

  he spoke a little jerkily and hesitating-
ly for jimsie rate was no hand for
analysis and had the young anglo-
saxons aversion to baring tlie secret
places of his soul for fear perhaps of
not being understood and also from a
deep-seated modesty which makes a
sound-hearted youth delicate about the
personal experiences which have meant
something to him and which is like no
other feeling so much as it is like the
modesty of a girl
byu a kirkpalruk

 quite by themselves where no casual relative would break in

tiie perfect iour

  jimsie paused a moment lost in happy
reverie at his words louise had shrunk
back so his happiest hour had nothing
to do with her it seemed still perhaps
it might after all it couldnt he that
 imsie would have any happy hour that
he would rememler in preference to those
that they had spent together-the hours
they had spent before they were married
for instance or the recent times when
they had been perfectly happy in ar-
ranging their own home louise counted
over these hours to herself with such
tenderness afraid lest tlie passing of
time should blur the outline of one of
them for it had seemed to her that
each succeeding day as it went was
the very happiest of her life now she
brought jimsie back from his reverie
saying softly

  what was the time you liked the
liest jimsie

  ilo lifted his head with a boyish ges-
ture and smiled at her a boyish grin
that showed his even white teeth a lit-
tle puzzled look still on his forehead

   i was trying how to say it he told
her  because there isnt anything to
tell it happened quite a while ago-
two or three summers i think-when i
was boarding up on the sound and one
saturday afternoon the fellows were go-
ing somewhere that i didnt want to go
and i came baek to the boarding-place
and there was a woman sitting upon the
piazza she was just there for two or
three days and i had talked to her after
dinner the night before she seemed
to me like an awful white sort and i
saw her sitting there and i said

  dont you want to go swimming
and she said  yes i would like to
go she was one of those women dont
you know who always say yes as if
that was the thing they had been wanting
to do awfully and make you feel that
you were pretty smart to have guessed
so well what it was they wanted to do
louise glanced up swiftly at jimsie
as she made a mental comparison between
herself and this woman jimsies idea
of exactly the most amusing thing to do
and louises did not always keep step
curiously enough it had never occurred
to louise before that this was any ones
fault but jimsies a quick stab of sus-
picion pierced her so he was trying to

read her a lesson but jimsie launched
in his story was sublimely unconscious
of the look louise had thrown him he
now took up his artless tale

   then i said

    dont lets go in swimming right
lie re lets go down to the beach

   it was about two miles away and
she said

    come on in j ust the way sho had
spoken before

   so we started off and i dont know
how it was but i felt right off as if i
had known her all my life and she acted
os if she had known me sho bad been
sort of reserved and quiet in the
boarding-house without being stiff and
you know that i dont talk much in a
strange bunch but just as soon as we
got out of sight of the village and on to
tho country road we began to act like
a couple of kids we did all sorts of
silly things

  what kind of silly things louise
asked a curious numbness was stealing
over her she felt like a queen who finds
that her crown jewels are made of paste

   oh i dont know said jimsie
vaguely  kid things we chased a
wild rabbit and her hair came down and
sho looked like twelve years old i told
her so and she said she thought i must
be about eight she said went on
jimsie dreamily that its the happiest
thing in the world to forget for a fow
hours that youre grown up and just be
kids again i suppose thats what made
it so nice of course you know as i
said there isnt anything to tell

  did you go swimming asked
louise she spoke naturally not to dis-
turb the unconscious jimsie

   sure said jimsie  wo swam and
swam she could swim like anything
then i threw water on her and she
ducked me and i would have ducked her
but i remembered just in time that girls
dont like to get their liair wet then
we lay for a long time on the hot sand
and there wasnt anybody there at all
tim eaeh was too unhandy just a
couple of ramshackle bath-houses and
a sandy lane away from everything the
woods on one side and the sea on the
other and a queer shut-up house on a
point she made up stories about it
she had lots of imagination and some-

way we grew happier and happier every
minute and before we knew it the sun
got quite low and we knew it must be
getting awfully late but she said

    oh lets stay were so late now
we might as well be later

   i never would have thought of go-
ing home

     lots stay she said  until the sea
eats up our castle

   we had built a castle in the sand and
pretended we lived in it say he broke
out  you must think i am a fierce kid
he took louises hand in his she
let it stay there as inert as a stone she
was far from thinking him a kid all
the jealousy of a wounded woman very
much in love was alive in her tlie
pure gold of jimsies happiest afternoon
had passed her by for with wide and
startled eyes she saw in jimsies heart
the reflection of another womans face
where she had thought to see her own
jimsie took louises silence for under-
standing of his mood and went 

   she said that when our castle was
gone we would have to go back and
be grown up

  then what did you do louise
nsked the blood was humming in her
ears but her cool and tranquil tone sur-
prised herself

   oh we got dressed and went home
what did you talk about louise
asked

  i dont remember jimsie answered
 we didnt talk much we just fooled
we didnt need to talk any more than
kids do when theyre having a good time
we just felt as if we knew each other
too well to talk i suppose just before
we got to the gate she said

    well not forget this afternoon

   and i said  no though i didnt
think i would remember it the way i
always have

   everybody was through supper and
her husband was awfully worried because
nobody had seen us go you see he
didnt know what had happened

   her husband  gasped louise

   sure jimsie responded  i told
you she was married didnt i they
went away a couple of days afterward

   its queer you never told me about
her before you have told me about all
your other friends

   why there wasnt anything to tell
jimsie answered still sunk in his dream
of that perfect afternoon-a moment
that comes to people only once or twice
in a lifetime when the hands of time
turn back to the golden moments of
childhood where everything is innocence
and peace and where one has added to
the joy of childs play and the rollick-
ing heart-stirring laughter tlie knowl-
edge of how happy one is-the moment
when two people fare forth to tlie
elysian fields leaving behind them at
the gate all the conventions with which
as a rule we are so sadly cloaked from
all our fellow creatures such moments
come like the gift of the gods handed
out without rhyme or reason it would
seem and jimsie had treasured his mo-
ment always and now for the first time
had spoken of it giving it to louise to
look at as one would some precious
thing wishing as he did to share with
her everything in his life that seemed
worthy of her

 was she pretty louise asked
 imsie

  he frowned trying to evoke from his
memory the face of his companion

   i dont remember she had light
hair she looked like a kid when it
came down

 what was her name

 her name jimsie wondered i
dont know i dont think i ever caught
her name why louise-why louise
whats the matter for louise had
wrenched her hand from jimsies and
sat staring at him angry tears in
her eyes

   youre keeping something from me
jimsie she cried  you do know her
name how can you say that you dont
know the name of tlie woman who gave
you the happiest moment of your life

  had she struck him he couldnt have
been more dazed a little flicker of
anger answered hers jimsie bate wasnt
used to being told he lied

   i tell you ho said with a touch
of sternness i don i know her name
i never did know it i never saw her
again

  tlie long tension of self-control had
worn upon louise and she hid her face
in the grass and wept she sobbed like
an angry and disappointed child jimsie
the perfect hour



looked at her dnmfonnded what was
the matter i what  earth was she cry-
ing about he had told her lots worse
things he had confessed to her things
that really mattered that he bad done
ond she hadnt seemed to mind it one bit
and here he hod told her this innocent
sweet experience and she was crying
angrily she couldnt be jealous how
could a woman be such a fool as to be
jealous but the unmanning spectacle
of her tears washed away his anger he
had never seen louise cry before the
whole thing was inexplicable to him
tlie end of the world apparently had
come and lie didnt know how or why
she must bo jealous-that must be it
at this his nature rose in revolt if he
had been analytical enough to put words
to it he would have said that he was
shocked to the core of his being in his
matter-of-fact mans life moments of
pure poetry were rare enough ond this
little bit of pure gold hod shone to
him always in the rather dull alloy of
his days now louise treated it as if
it were a piece of stolen gold he felt
smirched and hurt

  louise was a delicate ond sweet-minded
woman ond he a man no better thon any
other man and yet it is true in a world
where good and bad are so mingled that
your ordinary man moy have finer strains
in him thon o sweet-minded woman ond
that the woman moy foil into spiritual
grossness through lack of understanding
ond imagination and above all through
her devouring egotism which demands
graspingly that her man shall be hers all
of him

  and here jitnsie in his blindness did
exactly the wrong thing he tried to
reason with louise but when one has
been hurt in the heart one con only
be heoled through the heart he stooped
to justify himself with

   see here louise there wasnt any-
thing in it i tell you i never saw
her again i dont know what her
name was i dont even remember how
she looked

  but at that moment louise was far
from jealousy she was sobbing over
her fallen empire crying because she
hod not been able to give jimsie the
happiest moment of his life faltcring-

lv with deep sobs she told him this

   oh but you have you do of
course i am happier with you than with
anybody else but dont you see this wos
just sort of o little piece of different
 never thought of it in the same mo-
ment with you louise

  i see she answered dully i un-
derstand

  she dried her eyes and after a time
they wolked home together in silence
finding they had come a distance insup-
portably long louise felt hot all over
ashamed as a boy might who has cried
before another boy tears had been rare
in her life always and when they had
come she had hidden them she longed
for her own room with the door locked
and silence the dim meaning of what
jimsies experience had meant came to
her and she realized also that by show-
ing that she had not understood it slie
had lost some empire over jimsie-an
empire that she might perhaps never
regain and at this the tears welled up
again and fell down her cheeks and
jimsie said

   dont you think you have cried
about enough louise at which she sat
down by the side of the road and sobbed
in broken fashion to his utter dismay
and her own both having the cold
fear in their hearts of some one pass-
ing by who would know them at last
louise said

   let me go home alone jimsie i
know you will say something and i shall
cry i know i shall she made this con-
fession burning olive with shame and
with anger ot him for lioving witnessed
her degradation with anger at herself
for not having been able to control her-
self-as dismayed as jimsie concerning
the scene they hod passed through

  so they went their separate ways
both feeling as if some catastrophe hod
overtaken them each of them looking
down for the first time into the im-
measurable gulf that separates all men
and women driven asunder by what had
made them one because jimsie was a
man and louise a woman they had loved
each other and now for the same reason
they were being driven apart neither
understanding what had happened nor
comprehending the deep hurt that each
had given the other

  it is so much harder to meet the small

meaningless tempests of life that come
upon one when the air is tranquil and
i he sky blue than to stand up manfully
to the deeper tragedies

  as she had done when she was a little
girl when she was going home too late
beyond the hour fixed by her mother
louise went in guiltily by a side gate
and up the back stairs to her room
where she locked the door and breathed
a sigh of relief at being alone she bail
thirsted for this solitude but here in her
own room jimsie pursued her all
around were signs of his occupation
neckties hung over the mirror brushes
were scattered about his sweater hung
over a chair here in her own blue-and-
white room where she had lived her life
as a girl-not even here could she es-
cape him she sat down to think what
had happened nothing had happened
and everything

  the story of jimsies perfect afternoon
seemed now to her a far-off and shadowy
thing it seemed unimportant to her
that he should have been happier for a
moment with somebody else the thing
that mattered was that they had been
as one and now their sky was changed
and darkened sbe suffered intolerably
there was no one in the world who could
help her-no one she cotdd go to for
there was nothing to tell- one whose
advice she could ask for there was noth-
ing to ask advice about

  yes tho sky was changed why she
didnt know any more than jimsie
knew as he walked slowly along the
dusty road wondering blindly what had
struck louise

  tie had watched her retreating figure
staring as though he could not believe
what was happening before his eyes
what had happened that is what he
would have liked to know as he asked
himself this question anger at the in-
justice of things arose in him men
are less patient about such matters
than women perhaps because they are
less accustomed to them injustice
troubles the average woman very little
but it is a thing that a man simply
cannot bear

  what jimsie asked himself had he
done to bring this upon his head
their life together which had been so
sweet only a few minutes before seemed

to lie in pieces about him he knew that
women had moods he had seen tlmt for
himself he had heard they were un-
reasonable - rumors of the unaccount-
able performances of the female were
constantly getting to jimsie from his
married friends so this was it then
this sort of tantrum which came from
no cause that one could name and
turned the sweet things of life dark
and ugly and for which one could do
nothing that was the thing that chafed
him absolutely nothing he had done
all that a man could do he told himself
not realizing that he had left out the
one thing that could have helped mat-
ters for jimsie bate had not lived long
enough in the world of the emotions to
realize that it is affection that a woman
wants when she cries and not reason

  some men never realize this all their
lives and look upon tlie tears of their
partner with anger or with mute dismay
according to their temperaments and go
on through the years trying to bettor
matters by explanation t such matters
most of us both men and women re-
main children forever there are wives
who make their husbands angry in pre-
cisely the same way two hundred days in
the year and men who hurt their wives
in precisely the same manner after ten
years of marriage that they did when they
first made them cry

  but for the life of him even if this
way of comforting louise had occurred
to him he could not have done it he
was sorry for her but he was sorry for
her with a certain raging despair he
was still sorrier for himself-jimsie bate
-jimsie who had given up sailing only
to have a scene because he had told his
wife a story as harmless as a fairy-tale

  nothing had happened no great quar-
rel had come for he could not say that
they really bad quarrelled but every-
thing was changed for the world of
the emotions knows no logical reason
a most trivia occurrence may be more
blighting than some great catastrophe
a man may leave his well-known world
and follow a woman for no better reason
that you could put into words than a
trick she lias of lifting her eyebrows
but later on her manner of asking a
question may make her almost unbear-
able none of us knows a thing about
the perfect hoir

fill

it no man can give a reasonable reason
why one woman indifferently good-
looking of no more intelligence than
her neighbors makes up the world for
him for a while or knows why after a
while she ceases to do this

  there seems to be one general rule
to govern what men and women will not
forgive each other-we cant bear for
long that which takes away our peace
of mind and this is what jimsie and
louise had done for each other

  jimsie lagged along the road for the
first time in his life he didnt want to
see louise it was with relief that he
found her with the others on the piazza
for all the way home he had been con-
fronted by tho necessity of saying some-
thing to her and he realized that he had
nothing to say-nothing whatever all
he wanted was peace lie was emotion-
ally bankrupt lie was glad of the in-
significant chatter of a crowd they
soon went in to supper and as he watch-
ed louise across the table he realized
that never before had she seemed to him
so much a stranger why she had
seemed nearer to him tlie first day he
had seen her-standing before the mast
of the sailboat when the wind blew
her hat into the sound a strange and
alien woman she seemed to him now
filled with violent emotions whose deptlis
he could not fathom and he-he must
seem to her equally far off since she
could so misunderstand the things he
had to tell her

  a sense of loneliness grew upon him
overwhelmingly it is a very bitter
thing to realize how alone one really is
in tho world there are some sensitive
and morbid people who hove gone mad
with nothing more than this knowledge
of their own isolation and jimsie normal
and happy-hearted didnt know how to
wrestle with the sadness that poured over
him and mingled with his sadness was
a strain of definite irritation-irritation
of the average married man which voices
itself in the words

 barn women anyway what ails
em

  after supper tlie chatter of the people
became intolerable to jimsie and lie
strolled off with a cigarette in his bond
to the soothing darkness of the garden
oppressed by his loneliness angry with
himself with louise and with the in-
justice of things and above all dismayed
at the change in his own world that
seemed so impregnably secure now
that world hod changed it could never
be the simple matter that it had been
doubts there would bo and misunder-
standings it amounted to os much as
that although there was nothing one
could tell anybody besides what had
hoppened  a quorrel wos o human un-
derstandable thing for one could make it
up some one might say he was in tlie
wrong but this this struck at the very
foundation of things slight as it was
and mode of nothing grcoter thon o few
teors and a difference in point of view
it yet marked the limits of the garden
of eden for louise and jimsie since
it marked the limits of where they could
go together hand in hand with com-
plete understanding

  as jimsie strolled mournfully about
the garden he saw on a bench beneath
one of the trees a dejected white figure
in a pose that looked just as lie felt and
before lie knew it louise wos in his arms
for since his own heart was sore and
needed comforting he knew all at once
how to comfort her and how to lie com-
forted by her together they clung to
each other before the door that they
might never again enter for love has
its perfect moment-a perfect moment
that is very perishable and that tlie first
ndverse wind must wither and so cling-
ing together they realized that tlie per-
fect moment for them was over-that
they could no longer think themselves
wiser and more fortunate in their love
than any other of the people they knew
but they realized too that nothing mat-
tered very much so long as they still
cared the deep misunderstandings of
sex might be always tliere and yet could
not really hurt them nor could anything
so long os they should love each other

when messrs houghton  mif-
flin became owner of the
allantic monthly mr hough-
ton fancied having some breakfasts and
dinners which should bring tho pub-
lisher and the editor face to face with
the contributors who were bidden from
far and near of course the subtle
fiend of advertising who has now grown
so unblushing bold lurked under the
covers at these banquets and the junior
partner and the young editor had their
joint and separate fine anguishes of mis-
giving as to the taste and the principle
of them but they were really very simple-
hearted and honestly meant hospitalities
and they prospered as they ought and
gave great pleasure and no pain i for-
get some of the  emergent occasions
but i am sure of a birthday dinner most
unexpectedly accepted by whittier and
a birthday luncheon to mrs stowe
and i think a birthday dinner to long-
fellow but the passing years have left
me in the dark as to the pretext of that
supper at which clemens made his awful
speech and came so near being the death
of us all at the breakfasts and lunch-
eons we had the pleasure of our lady-
oontributors company but that night
there were only men and because of our
great strength we survived

  i suppose the year was about s
but here the almanac is unimportant
and i can only say that it was after
clemens hail become a most valued con-
tributor of the magazine where he found
himself to his own great explicit satis-
faction lie had jubilantly accepted our
invitation and had promised a speech
which it appeared afterward he had pre-
pared with unusual care and confidence
it was his custom always to think out
his speeches mentally wording them and
then memorizing them by a peculiar sys-
tem of mnemonics which be had invented
on the dinner table a certain succession

of knife spoon saltcellar and butter-
plate symbolized a train of ideas and
on the billiard-table a ball a cue and
a piece of chalk served the same pur-
pose with a diagram of these printed
on the brain be had full command of
the phrases which his excogitation hail
attached to them and which embodied the
ideas in perfect form he believed he
had been particularly fortunate in his
notion for the speech of that evening
and he had worked it out in joyous self-
reliance it was the notion of three
tramps three deadbeats visiting a cali-
fornia mining-camp and imposing them-
selves upon the innocent miners as re-
spectively ralph waldo emerson henry
wadsworth long-fellow and oliver wen-
dell holmes tlie humor of the con-
ception must prosper or must fail ac-
cording to the mood of the hearer but
clemens felt sure of compelling this to
sympathy and he looked forward to an
unparalleled triumph

  but there were two things that he had
not taken into account one was the
species of religious veneration in which
these men were held by those nearest
them a thing that i should not be able
to realize to people remote from them
in time and place they were men of
extraordinary dignity of the thing called
presence for want of some clearer word
so that no one could well approach them
in a personally light or trifling spirit
i do not suppose that anybody more truly
valued them or more piously loved them
than clemens himself but the intoxica-
tion of his fancy carried him beyond tho
bounds of that regard and emboldened
him to the other thing which he had
not taken into account namely the im-
mense hazard of working his fancy out
before their faces and expecting them
to enter into the delight of it if neither
emerson nor longfellow nor holme-
had leim there the scheme might possibly
my memories ok mark twain

have carried but eveu this is doubtful
for those who so devoutly honored them
would have overcome their horror with
difficulty aiul perhaps would not have
overcome it at all

  the publisher with a modesty very
ungrateful to me had abdicated his office
of host and  was the hapless president
fulfilling the abhorred function of call-
ing people to their feet and making them
sx-ak when i came to clemens i intro-
duced him with the cordial admiring i
had for him us one of my greatest con-
tributors and dearest friends here i
said in sum was a humorist who never
left you hanging your head for having
enjoyed his joke and then the amazing
mistake the bewildering blunder the
cruel catastrophe was upon us  be-
lieve that after the scope of the burlesque
made itself clear there wan no one there
including the burlesquer himself who
was not smitten with a desolating dis-
may there fell a silence weighing
many tons to the square inch which
deepened from moment to moment and
was broken only by the hysterical and
blood-curdling laughter of a single guest
whose name shall not be banded down
to infamy nobody knew whether to
look at the speaker or down at his plate

	chose my plate as the least affliction
and so  do not know how clemens
looked except when i stole a glance at
him and saw him standing solitary amid
bin appalled and appalling listeners with
bis joke dead on his hands from a
first jrlanee at the great three whom bis
jest had made its theme i was aware
of ixmgfellow sitting upright and re-
garding the humorist with an air of
pensive puzzle of holmes busily writing
on his menu with a well-feigned effect
of preoccupation and of emerson hold-
ing his elbows and listening with a
sort of jovian oblivion of this nether
world in that lapse of memory which
saved him in those later years from so
much bother clemens must have
dragged his joke to the climax and left
it there but i cannot say this from any
sense of the fact of what happened
afterward at the table where the im-
mense the wholly innocent the tndy
tmimagined affront was offered i have
no longer the least remembrance i next
remember being in a room of the hotel

   vol cxxt--n  - 

where clemens was not to sleep but to
toss in despair and charles dudley
warners saying in the gloom  well
mark youre a funny fellow it was
as well as anything else he could have
said but clemens seemed unable to ac-
cept tlie tribute

  i stayed the night with him and the
next morning after a haggard breakfast
we drove about and he made some pur-
chases of brie-il-brac for his house in

	art tori i with a soul as far away from
bric-il-brne as ever the soul of man was
he went home by an early train and he
lost no time in writing back to the three
divino personalities which he had so in-
voluntarily seemed to lout they all
wrote back to him making it as light
for him as they could i have heard that
emerson was a good deal mystified and
in his sublime forgetfulness asked who
was this gentleman who apjieared to think
he had offered him some sort of annoy-
ance but i am not sure that this is
accurate what i am sure of is that
ixmgfellow a few days after in my
study stopped before a photograph of
clemens and said  ah he is a wag
and nothing more holmes told nve with
deep emotion such as a brother humorist
might well feed that he had not lost an in-
-tant in replying to clemenss letter and
assuring him that there had not leen
tlie least offence and entreating him nev-
er to think of the matter again  lb-
said that lie was a fool but lie was gods
fool holmes quoted from the letter
with a true sense of the pathos and humor
of the self-abasement

  to me clemens wrote a week later
 it doesnt get any letter it burns like
fire hut now i understand that it was
not shame that burnt but rage for a
blunder which he had so incredibly com-
mitted tlmt to have conceived of those
men the most dignified in our literature
our civilization as impersonate by three
hoboes ond then to have imagined that
he could ask them personally to enjoy
ihe monstrous travesty was a break
he saw too late for which there was no
repair yet the time came and not so
very lone afterward when some mention
was made of the incident as o mitake
and he said with all his fierceness  but
 dont admit that it was a mistake and
it was not so in the minds of all witnesses

at second hand the morning after the
dreadful dinner there came a glowing
note from professor child who had read
the newspaper report of it praising
clemenss burlesque as the richest piece
of humor in the world and betraying
no sense of incongruity in its perpetra-
tion in the presence of its victims i
think it must al-
ways have ground
clemenss soul
that he was the
victim of circum-
stances and that
if ho had so mo
more favoring oc-
casion he could re-
trieve his loss in
it by giving the
thing the right
setting-not more
than two or three
years oro he came
to try me its to
trying it again at
a meeting of news-
paper men in
washington i had
to own my fears
while i alleged
childs note on
the other hand
but in the end he
did not try it with
tlie newspaper
men i do not
-know whether lie
has ever printed

 it or not but since tlie thing happened
 i have often wondered how much offence
 there really was in it i am not sure
 but the horror of the spectators read
 more indignation into the subjects of the
 hapless drolling than they felt but it
 must have been difficult for them to bear
 it with equanimity to be sure they
 were not themselves mocked nevertheless
 their personality was trifled with and i
 could only end by reflecting that if i
 had been in their place i should not have
 liked it myself clemens would have
 liked it himself for he had the heart for
 that sort of wild play and he so loved
 a joke that even if it took the form of
 a liberty and was yet a good joke he
 would have loved it

  he was oftenest at my house in cam-
bridge but he was also sometimes at my
house in belmont wlien after a year in
europe we went to live in boston be was
more rarely with us we could never be
long together without something out of
the common happening and one day
something far out of the common hap-
pened which for-
tunately refused
the nature of ab-
solute tragedy
while remaining
rather the saddest
sort of comedy
we were looking
out of my library
window on that
view of the
charles which i
was so proud of
sharing with my
all - but - next - door
neighbor doctor
holmes when an-
other friend who
was with us called
out with curiously
impersonal inter-
est  oh see that
w o m a n getting
into the water
this would have
excited curiosity
and alarmed anx-
iety far less live-
ly tlinn ours and
clemens and i
rushed down - stairs and out through
my basement and back gate at the
same time a coachman came out of a
stable next door and grappled by the
shoulders a woman who was somewhat
deliberately getting down the steps to
the water over the face of the em-
bankment before we could reach them
he had pulled her up to the drive-
way and stood holding lier there while
she crazily trrieved at her rescue as
soon as he saw us he went back into his
stable and left us with the poor wild
creature  our hands she was not very
yountr and not very pretty and we could
not have flattered ourselves with the no-
tion of anything romantic in her suicidal
mania but we could take her on the
broad human level and on this we pro-

posed to escort her up beacon street till
we could give her into the keeping of
one of those kindly policemen whom our
neighborhood knew naturally there was
no policeman known to us or unknown
ik whole way to the public uarden wo
bad to circumvert our charge in her
present design of drowning herself and
walk her past the streets crossing beacon
in the river at these points it needed
considerable reasoning to overcome her
wish and some active lnameuvring in
both of us to enforce our arguments
nobody else appeared to be interested
and though we did not court publicity
in the performance of the duty so strange-
ly laid upon us still it was rather dis-
appointing to be so entirely ignored

  there are some four or five crossings to
tin- river between ioj beacon street and
the public gar-
den and the sug-
gestions at our
command w e r e
pretty well ex-
hausted by t h e
time we reached
it still the ex-
pected policeman
was nowhere in
sight hut a bril-
liant thought oc-
curred to clemens
lie asked m e
where the nearest
police station was
and when i told
him he started
off at his highest
speed leaving me
in sole charge of
our hapless ward

all my powers of
suasion were now
taxed to the ut-
most and i began	mb
attracting atten-
tion as a short

stout gentleman in early middle life
endeavoring to distrain a respectable
female of her personal liberty when
his accomplice had abandoned him
to his wicked design after a much
long time than i thought  should
have taken to get a policeman from
the station clemens reappeared in easy
conversation with an officer who bad

probably realized that he was in the eom-
pany of mark twain and was in no hurry
to end the interview he took pos-
session of our captive and we saw her
no more i now wonder that with our
joint instinct for failure we ever got rid
of her but i am sure we did and few
things in life have given me greater re-
lief when we got back to my house we
found the friend we had left there quite
unruffled and not much concerned to
know the facts of our adventure my
impression is that lie had been taking a
nap on my lounge he appeared re-
freshed and even gay but if i am inexact
in these details he is alive to refute me

  a little after this clemens went abroad
with his family and lived several years
in germany ilis letters still came but
nl longer intervals and the thread of our

howkllss house at cambrioge

intimate relations was inevitably broken
he would write me when something i
had written pleased him or when some-
thing signal occurred to him or some
political or social outrage stirred him to
wrath and he wished to free his mind
in pious profanity during this sojourn
he came near dying of pneumonia in
berlin and he had slight relapses from
harpers monthly magazine



it after coming home in berlin also lie
liad the honor of dining with the german
emperor at the table of a cousin married
to a high officer of the court clemens
was a man to enjoy such a distinction
lie knew how to take it as a delegated
recognition from the german people
but as coming from a sovereign who
had as yet only his sovereignty to
value himself upon he was not very
proud of it lie expressed a quiet dis-
dain of the event as between the im-
periality and himself on whom it was
supposed to confer such glory crowning
his life with the topmost leaf of laurel
tie was in the same mood in his ac-
count of an english dinner many years
before where there was a little scotch
lord  present to whom the english
tacitly referred clemenss talk and
laughed when he laughed and were grave
when he failed to smile of all the men
i have known he was the farthest from a
snob though he valued recognition and
liked the flattery of the fashionable fair
when it came in his way he would not
go out of his way for it but like all able
and brilliant men he loved the minds of
women their wit their agile cleverness
their sensitive perception their humorous
appreciation the saucy things thev would
say and their pretty temerarious de-
fiances he had of course the keenest
sense of what was truly dignified and
truly undifrnifipd in people but he was
not really- interested in what we call
society affirs they scarcely existed for
him though his books witness how he
abhorred the dreadful fools who through
some chance of birth or wealth hold them-
selves different from otlier men

  commonly he did not keep things to
himself especially dislikes and con-
demnations ipon most current events
he had stromr opinions and be uttered
them strongly after a while he was
silent in them but if you tried him you
found him in them still he was apt
to wear himself out in the vehemence
of his resentments or he had so
spent himself in uttering them that
he had literally nothing more to say
you could offer clemens offences that
would anger other men and be did not
mind he would account for them from
human nature but if he thought you had
in any way played him false you were

anathema and niariinatha forever yet
not forever perhaps for by and by after
years he would be silent there were
two men half a generation apart in their
succession whom he thought equally
atrocious in their treason to him and
of whom he used to talk terrifyingly
even after they were out of the world
he went farther than heine who said
that he forgave his enemies but not
till they were dead clemens did not
forgive his dead enemies their death
seemed to deepen their crimes like a
base evasion or a cowardly attempt to
escape he pursued them to the grave he
would like to dig them up and take venge-
ance upon their clay so he said but
no doubt he would not have hurt them
if lie had had them living before him
he was generous without stint he trusted
without measure but where his generosity
was abused or his trust betrayed he was
a tire of vengeance a consuming flame of
suspicion that no sprinkling of cool pa-
tience from others could quench it had
to burn itself out he was eagerly and
lavishly hospitable but if a man seemed
willing to batten on him or in any way
to lie down upon him clemens despised
him unutterably in his frenzies of re-
sentment or suspicion lie would not and
doubtless could not listen to reason but
if between the paroxysms he were con-
fronted with the facts he would own them
no matter how much they told against
him at oue period he fancied that a
certain ncwspaer was hounding him
with biting censure and poisonous para-
graphs and he was filling himself up with
wrath to le duly discharged on the edit-
ors head later he wrote nie with a
humorous joy in his mistake that warner
had advised him to have the pajh-r watch-
ed for these injuries he had done so
nnd how many mentions of him did i
reckon he had found in three months
just two and they were rather indifferent
than unfriendly so the paper was ac-
quitted and the editors life was spared
the wretch never knew how near he was
to losing it with incredible preliminaries
of obloquy and a subsequent devotion
to lasting infamy

  his memory for favors was as good as
for injuries and be liked to return
your friendliness with as loud a band of
music a could be bomrlit or bribed for
mark twain and mr howells at lakiavood 

the occasion all that you had to do
was to signify that you wanted his help
when my father was consul at toronto
during arthurs administration he fan-
cied that his place was in danger and
he appealed to me in turn i appealed
to clemens bethinking myself of his
friendship with grant and grants
friendship with arthur i asked him to
write to grant in my fathers behalf
but no he answered me i must come to
hartford and we would go on to new
york together and see grant personally

i bis was before and long ix-fore clemens
became grants publisher and splendid
benefactor but the men liked each other
i such men eould not help doing clem-
ens made the appointment and we went
to find grant in his business office that
place where his business innocence was

afterward so betrayed tie was very
simple and very cordial and i was in-
stantly the more at home with him be-
cause his voice was the soft rounded
ohio river accent to which my years
were earliest used from my steam-
boating uncles my earliest heroes when
t stated my business he merely said
oh no that must not be he would
write to president arthur and he did
so that day-and my father lived to lay
down his office when he tired of it with
no urgenee from above

  it is not irrelevant to clemens to say
that grant seemed to like finding himself
in company with two literary men one
of whom at least he could make sure
of and unlike that silent man lie was
reputed he talked constantly and so far
as he mitrht he talked literature at least


harpers monthly magazine

he talked of john pha-nix that delight-
lulest of the early pacific slope humorists
whom he had known under his real name
of george ii derby when they were
fellow cadets at west point it was
mighty pretty as pepys would say to
see the delicate deference clemens paid
our plain hero and the manly respect
with which ho listened while grant
talked his luncheon whs brought in from
some unassuming restaurant near by and
he asked us to join him in tho baked
beans and coffee which were served us in
a little room out of i lie office with about
the same circumstance as at a railroad
refreshment-counter the baked beans
and coffee were of about the railroad-
refreahment quality but eating them
with grant was like sitting down to
baked beans and coffee with julius
cajsar or alexander or some other great
plutarehan captain

  one of the highest satisfactions of
clemenss often supremely satisfactory
life was his relation to grant it was
his proud joy to tell how he found grant
about to sign a contract for his hook on
certainly very gooil terms and said to
him that he could himself publish the
book ami give him a percentage three
times as large lie said grant cmd to
doubt whether he could honorably with-
draw from the negotiation at that point

but clemen-- overbore such scruples and
it was his unparalleled privilege bis
princely pleasure to pay the author a far
larger cheek for his work than had ever
been paid to an author before he valued
even more than this splendid opportunity
the sacred moments in which their busi-
ness brought him into the presence of
the slowly dying heroically living man
whom he was so befriending and he
told me in words which surely lost none
of their simple pathos through his report
how grant described his suffering

  the prosperity of this venture was the
beginning of clemenss adversity for it
led to excesses of enterprise which were
forms of dissipation the young sculptor
who had come back to him from paris
modelled a small bust of grant which
clemens multiplied in great numbers to
his great loss and the success of grants
book tempted him to launch on publish-
ing seas where his bark presently foun-
dered the first and greatest of his dis-
asters was the life of pope leo xiii
which he came to tell me of when he had
imagined it in a sort of glorious intoxi-
cation i le had no words in which to
paint the magnificence of the project or
to forecast its colossal success it would
have a currency bounded only by the
number of catholics ih christendom it
would be translated into every language

mark twains final home  stohmhelu  remiina connecticut
 stonmfieu - lookino toward the peroola

which was anywhere written or printed
it would be circulated literally in every
country of the globe and clemenss book-
agents would carry the prospectuses and
i hen the hound copies of tlie work to
the ends of the whole earth not only
would every catholic buy it but every
catholic must as he was a good catholic
os ho liojcd to be saved it was a mag-
nificent scheme and it captivated me as
it had captivated clemens it dazzled us
both and neither of us saw the fatal
defect in it the event proved that tho
immeasurable majority did not wish to
read the life of the pope though it was
written bv a dignitary of t m church and
issued to the world with every sanction
from the vatican the failure was in-
credible to clemens his sanguine soul
was utterly confounded and soon a si-
lence fell upon it where it had been so
exulierantly jubilant

  tho occasions which brought us to
new york together were not nearly so
frequent as those which united us in
boston but there was a dinner given him
by a friend which remains memorable
from the fatuity of two men present
so different in everything but their
fatuity one was the sweet old comedian
billy florence who was urging the un-

successful dramatist across the table to
write him a play about oliver crom-
well and giving the reasons why he
thought himself peculiarly fitted to por-
tray the character of cromwell the
other was a modestly millioned rich
man who was then only beginning to
amass the moneys afterward heajied so
high and was still in the condition to
be flattered by the condescension of a
yet greater millionaire his contribu-
tion to our gavety was the verbatim re-
port of a call he had made upon william

ii	vanderbilt whom lie bad found just
about starting out of town with his
trunks actually in the front hall but who
had stayed to receive the narrator he
had in fact sat down on one of the
trunks and talked with easiest friendli-
ness and quite we were given to infer
like an ordinary human being clemens
often kept on with some thread of the
talk when we came away from a dinner
nut now lie was silent as if  high sor-
rowful and cloyed and it was not till
well afterward that i found he had noted
the facts from the bitterness with which
he mocked the rich mail and the pity he
expressed for the actor

tie had begun before that to amass
those evidences against mankind which
stormfieid  -the living-room

eventuated with him in his theory of
what he called  tho damned human race
this was not an expression of piety but
of tho kind contempt to which ho was
driven by our follies and iniquities as ho
had observed them in himself as well as
in others it was as mild a misanthropy
probably as ever caressed the objects of
its malediction but i believe it was
about the year  that his sense of our
perdition became insupportable and
broke out in a mixed abhorrence and
amusement which spared no occasion so
that i could quite understand why mrs
clemens should have found some com-
pensation when kept to her room by
sickness in tho reflection that now she
should not hear so much about the
damned human race he told of that
with the same wild joy that he told of
overhearing her repetition of one of
his most inclusive profanities ami her
explanation that she meant him to hear
it so that he might know how it sounded
the contrast of the lurid blasphemy with
her heavenly whiteness should have been
enough to cure any one less grounded
than he in what must be owned was as
fixed a habit as smoking with him

when i first knew him he rarely vented
his fury in that sort and i fancy he
was under a promise to her which he
kept sacred till the wear and tear of his
nerves with advancing years disabled
him then it would be like him to
struggle with himself till ho could strug-
gle no longer and to ask his promise
back and it would be like her to give
it back his profanity was the herit-
age of his boyhood and young manhood
in social conditions and under the duress
of exigencies in which everybody swore
about as impersonally as he smoked it
is best to recognize the fact of it and i do
so the more readily because i cannot sup-
pose tlie recording angel really minded
it much more than that guardian angel
of his it probably grieved them about
equally but they could equally forgive it
nothing came of his pose regarding the
damned human race except his invention
of the human race luncheon club this
was confined to four persons who were
never all got together and it soon perished
of their indifference

  in the earlier days that  have more
specially in mind one of the questions
that we used to debate a good deal was
my memories of mark twain



whether every human motive was not
selfish wo inquired as to every impulse
the noblest the holiest in effect and he
found them in the last analysis of selfish
origin pretty nearly the whole time of
a certain railroad run from new york
to hartford was taken up with the
scrutiny of the self-sacrifice of a mother
for her child of the abandon of the lover
who dies in saving his mistress from
fire or flood of the heros courage in tlie
field and tho martyrs at the stake each
he found springing from the unconscious
love of self and the dread of the greater
pain which the self-sacrificer would suf-
fer in forbearing the sacrifice if we
had any time left from this inquiry that
day he must have devoted it to a
high regret that napoleon did not carry
out his purpose of invading england for
then he would have destroyed the feudal
aristocracy or  reformed the lords as
it might be called now he thought
that would have been an incalculable
blessing to the english people and the
world clemens was always beautifully
and unfalteringly a republican none
of his occasional misgivings for amer-
ica implicated a return to monarchy
yet he felt passionately the splendor of
the english monarchy and there was a
time when lie gloried in that figurative
poetry by which the king was phrased as
the majesty of england he rolled
the words deep - tliroatedly out and
exulted in their beauty as if it were be-
yond any other glory of the world he
read or road at english history a great
deal and one of the by-products of his
restless invention was a game of eng-
lish kings like the game of authors for
children i do not know whether he over
perfected this but i am quite sure it
was not put upon the market very
likely he brought it to a practicable
stage and then tired of it as he was
apt to do in the ultimation of his vehe-
ment undertakings

  he satisfied the impassioned demand
of his nature for incessant activities of
every kind by taking a personal as well
as a pecuniary interest in the inventions
of others at one moment the damned
human race was almost to be redeemed
by a process of founding brass without
air bubbles in it if this could once be
accomplished as i understood or mis-
vol cxxi - no tj -

understood brass could be used in art-
printing to a degree hitherto impossible
i dare say i have got it wrong but i am
not mistaken as to clemenss enthusiasm
for the process and his heavy losses in
paying its way to ultimate failure he
was simultaneously absorbed in the per-
fection of a type-setting machine which
he was paying the inventor a salary to
bring to a perfection so expensive that
it was practically impracticable we
were both printers by trade and i could
take the same interest in this wonderful
piece of mechanism that he could and
it was so truly wonderful that it did
everything but walk and talk its in-
genious creator was so bent upon realiz-
ing the highest ideal in it that he pro-
duced a machine of quite unimpeachable
efficiency but it was so costly when
finished that it could not be made for
less than twenty thousand dollars if the
parts were made by hand this sum was
prohibitive of its introduction unless
the requisite capital could be found for
making tlie parts by machinery and
clemons spent many months in vainly
trying to get this money together in
the moan time simpler machines had been
invented and the market filled and his
investment of three hundred thousand
dollars in the beautiful miracle remained
permanent but not profitable i once
went with him to witness its performance
and it did seem to me the last word in
its way but it had been spoken too ex-
quisitely too fastidiously i never heard
him devote the inventor to the infernal
gods as he was apt to do with the
geniuses he lost money by and so i think
he did not regard him as a traitor

  tn these things and in his other
schemes for the subiti guadagni of the
speculator and the  sudden making of
splendid names  for the benefactors of
our species clemens satisfied the colonel
sellers nature in himself from which ho
drew the picture of that wild and lovable
figure and perhaps made as good use of
liis money as he could he did not core
much for money in itself but he luxuri-
ated in the lavish use of it and he was as
generous with it as ever a man was he
liked piving it but bo commonly wearied
of giving it himself and wherever ho
lived ho established on almoner whom
be fully trusted to keep his left hand


harpers monthly magazine

ignorant of what his right hand was do-
ing i believe he felt no finality in
charity but did it because in its pro-
visional way it was the only thing a man
could do i never heard him go really
into any sociological inquiry and i have
a feeling that that sort of thing baffled
and dispirited him no one can read
the connecticut yankee and not be
aware of the length and breadth of his
sympathies with poverty but apparently
lie liad not thought out any scheme for
righting the economic wrongs we abound
in i cannot remember our ever getting
quite down to a discussion of the matter
we came very near it once in the day of
the vast wave of emotion sent over the
world by looking backward and again
when we were all so troubled by the
great coal strike in pennsylvania in
considering that he seemed to be for
the time doubtful of the justice of the
working-mans cause at all other times
he seemed to know that whatever wrongs
tlie working-man committed work was
always in the right

  when clemens returned to america
with his family after lecturing round
the world i again saw him in new york
where i so often saw him while he was
shaping himself for that heroic enter-
prise he would come to me and talk
sorrowfully over his financial ruin and
picture it to himself as the stuff of some
unhappy dream which after long pros-
perity had culminated the wrong way
it was very melancholy very touching
but the sorrow to which lie had coine
home from his long journey had not that
forlorn bewilderment in it iio was look-
ing wonderfully well and when i wanted
the name of his elixir he said it was
plnsmon he was apt for a man who had
put faith so decidedly away from him to
take it back and pin it to some super-
stition usually of a hygienic sort once
when he was well on in years he came to
new york without glasses and an-
nounced that he and all his family so
astigmatic and myopic and old-sighted
had so to speak burned their spectacles
behind them upon the instruction of
some sage who had found out that they
were a delusion the next time he came
he wore spectacles freely almost ostenta-
tiously and i heard from others that the
whole clemens family had been near

losing their eyesight by the miracle
worked in their behalf now i was not
surprised to learn that the damned hu-
man race was to be saved by plasmon
if anything and that my first duty was
to visit the plasmon agency with him
and procure enough plasmon to secure
my family against the ills it was heir to
for evermore i did not immediately un-
derstand that plasmon was one of the
investments which he had made from
 the substance of things hoped for and
in the destiny of a disastrous disappoint-
ment but after paying off the credit-
ors of his late publishing firm he had
to do something with his money and it
was not his fault if he did not make a
fortune out of plasmon

  for a time it was a question whether
he should not go back with his family to
their old home in hartford perhaps the
fathers and mothers hearts drew them
there all the more strongly because of
the grief written ineffaceably over it but
for the younger ones it was no longer
the measure of the world it was easier
for all to stay on indefinitely in new
york which is a sojourn without circum-
stance and equally the home of exile
and of indecision the clemenses took
a pleasant spacious house at rivcrdale
on tlie hudson and there i began to see
them again on something like the sweet
old terms they lived far more unpre-
tentiously than they used and i think
with a notion of economy which they
had never very successfully practised
i recall that at the end of a certain
year in hartford when they had been
saving and paying cash for every-
thing clemens wrote reminding me of
their avowed experiment ond asking
me to guess how many bills they had
at new-years he hastened to say that
a horse-car would not have held them
at riverdale they kept no carriage
and there was a snowy night when i
drove up to their handsome old mansion
in tlie station carryall which was crusted
with mud as from the going down of the
deluge after transporting noah and his
family from the ark to whatever point
they decided to settle at provisionally
but the good talk the rich talk the talk
that could never suffer poverty of mind
or soul was there and we jubilantly
found ourselves again in our middle
my memories of mark twaix



youth it was the mighty moment when
clemens was building his engines of war
for the destruction of christian science
which superstition nobody and he least of
all expected to destroy it would not
bo easy to say whether in his talk of
it his disgust for the illiterate twaddle
of mrs eddys book or his admiration
of her genius for organization was the
greater he believed that as n religious
machine the christian science church
was as perfect as the roman church
and destined to be more formidable in
its control of the minds of men lie
looked for its spread over the whole of
christendom and throughout the winter
he spent at riverdale be was ready to
meet all listeners more than half-way
with his convictions of its powerful grasp
of tho average human desire to get some-
thing for nothing the vacuous vul-
garity of its texts was a perpetual joy
to him while he bowed with serious re-
spect to the sagacity which built so
securely upon the everlasting rock of
human credulity and folly one sun-
day afternoon we went together to hear
an able judge from kansas a clever
lawyer and a politician of note deliver
a christian science discourse which was
intellectually so much chopped food for
cattle to a congregation of three thou-
sand prosperous persons mainly in seal-
skin sacks ond frock coats i suppose
that this extraordinary spectacle afforded
clemens a satisfaction which could have
been matched for him only by the claim
of shakespcore to be shakespeare when
lie bad come to the full perception that
bacon was shakespeare

  an interesting phase of his psychology
in this business was not only his admira-
tion for the masterly policy f the chris-
tian science hierarchy but his willingness
to allow the miracles of its healers to be
tried on his friends and family if they
wished it he had a tender heart for
the whole generation of empirics as well
a tho newer sorts of scientitians but he
seemed to base his faith in them largely
tipon the failure of tlie regulars rather
than upon their own successes which also
he believed in tie was recurrently but
not insistently desirous that you should
try their strange mil trios when you were
ffoinn to try the fomilior medicines

  the order of my acquaintance or call

it intimacy with clemens was this our
first meeting in boston my visits to him
in hartford his visits to me in cam-
bridge in belmont and in boston our
briefer and less frequent meetings in
oris and new york all with repeated
interruptions through my absences in eu-
roe and his sojourns in london ber-
lin vienna and florence and bis flights
to the many ends and odds and ends of
the earth i will not try to follow the
events if they were not rather the sub-
jective experiences of those different
periods and points of time which i must
not foil to moke include his summer at
york harbor ond his divers residences in
new york on tenth street and on fifth
avenue at riverdale and at stormfield
which his daughter has told me he loved
best of all his houses and hoped to mako
his home for long years

  not much remains to me of the week
or so that we lmd together in paris early
in the summer of  the first thing
 got at my bonkers wos a cable message
announcing that my father was stricken
with paralysis but urging my stay for
further intelligence and t went about
till the final summons came with my
bead in a mist of core and dread
clemens was very kind and brotherly
through it all lie was living greatly to
his mind in one of those arcaded little
hotels in the rue de rivoli and he was
freo from all household duties to range
with me we drove together to make
colls of digestion ot many houses whore
ho hod got indigestion in his reluc-
tance from their hospitality for lie hated
dining out but as he explained his
wife wanted him to moke these visits
and he did it as he did everything she
wanted at one place some suburban
villa he could get no answer to his ring
nnd ho  hove  bis cards over the gate
just as it opened and he had tlie sliome
of explaining in his unexplanatory
french to tlie man picking them up
tie was excruciatingly helpless with his
cabmen but by very cordially smiling
and easting himself on the drivers mercy
he always managed to get where he wont-
ed the family was on tlie verge of
their many moves ond he was doing
some small errands he said that tho
others did the main thing and left him
to do what the cat might

  it was with that return upon the
buoyant billow of plsmon renewed in
look and limb that clemenss universal-
ly pervasive popularity began in his own
country he had hitherto been more in-
telligently accepted or more largely
imagined in europe and i suppose it
was my sense of this that inspired the
stupidity of my saying to him when we
came to consider  the state of polite
learning among us you mustnt ex-
pect people to keep it up here as they
do in england but it appeared that
his countrymen were only wanting the
chance and they kept it up in honor of
him past all precedent one does not
go into a catalogue of dinners recep-
tions meetings speeches and the like
when there are more vital things to speak
of he loved these obvious joys and he
eagerly strove with the occasions they
gave him for the brilliancy which seemed
so exhatistless and was so exhausting
his friends saw that he was wearing him-
self out and it was not because of mrs
clemenss health alone that they were
glad to have him take refuge at river-
dale the family lived there two happy
hopeless years and then it was ordered
that they should change for his wifes
sake to some less exacting climate
clemens was not eager to go to florence
but his imagination was taken as it
would have been in the old-young days
by the notion of packing his furniture
into flexible steel cages from his house
in hartford and unpacking it from them
untouched at his villa in fiesole he
got what pleasure any man could out
of that triumph of mind over matter
but the shadow was creeping up his
life one sunny afternoon we sat on the
grass before the mansion after his wife
had begun to get well enough for removal
and we looked up toward a balcony where
presently that lovely presence made itself
visible as if it had stooped there from
a cloud a hand frailly waved a hand-
kerchief clemens ran over the lawn to-
ward it calling tenderly what
what as if it might lie an asking for
him instead of the greeting it really was
for me tt was the last time i saw her
if indeed t can be said to have seen her
then and long afterward when i said how
beautiful we all thought her how good
how wise how wonderfully perfect in

every relation of life he cried out in
a breaking voice  oh why didnt you
ever tell her she thought you didnt
like her how incredible how impos-
sible is experience what a pang it was
not to have told her but how could we
have told her his unreason endeared
him to me more than all his wisdom

  to that riverdale sojourn belong my
impressions of one of those joint epi-
sodes of ours which strangely enough
did not eventuate in entire failure
as most of our joint episodes did
he wrote furiously to me of a wrong
which had been done to one of the
most helpless and one of tho most
helped of our literary brethren asking
me to join with him in recovering the
money paid over by that brothers pub-
lisher to a false friend who had withheld
it and would not give any account of it
our hapless brother had appealed to
clemens as he had to me with the facts
but not asking our help probably because
he knew he need not ask and clemens
enclosed to me a very taking-by-the-throat
message which he proposed sending to
the false friend for once i had some
sense and answered that this would never
do for we had really no power in the
matter and we had better use the deli-
cacy of agag than the truculence of
samuel i contrived a letter so softly
diplomatic that i shall always think of
it with pride when my honesties no
longer give me satisfaction saying that
this incident had come to our knowledge
and suggesting that we felt sure he would
not finally wish to withhold the money
nothing more practically than that but
that was enough there came promptly
back a letter of justification cover-
ing a very substantial check which we
hilariously forwarded to our beneficiary
but the helpless man who was so used
to being helped did not answer with the
gladness i at least expected of him
he acknowledged the check as he would
any ordinary payment and then he made
us observe that there was still a large
sum due him out of the moneys with-
held at this point i proposed to clemens
that we should let the nonchalant victim
collect the balance himself clouds of
sorrow had gathered about the bowed
head of the delinquent since we be-
gan on him and my fickle sympathies
my memories of mark twain



wore turning his way from the victim
who was really to blame for leaving his
affairs so unguardedly to him in the first
place clemens made some sort of grim
assent and we dropped the matter he
was more used to ingratitude from those
he helped than i was who found being
lain down upon not so amusing as he
found my revolt he reckoned i was
right he said and after that i think we
never recurred to the incident it was
not ingratitude diat he ever minded it
was treachery that really maddened him
past all forgiveness

  during the summer he spent at york
harbor i was only forty minutes away
at kittery point and we saw each other
often but this was before the last time
at riverdale he had a wide low cot-
tage in a pine grove overlooking york
river and we used to sit at a corner
of the veranda farthest away fronj mrs
clemenss window where we could read
our manuscripts to each other and tell
our stories and laugh our hearts out
without disturbing her at first she had
been about the house and there was one
gentle afternoon when she made tea for
us in the parlor but that was the last
time i spoke with her after that it was
really a question of how soonest and
easiest she could be got back to river-
dale but of course there were specious
delays in which she seemed no worse and
seemed a little better and clemens could
work at a novel he had begun he had
taken a room in the house of a friend
and neighbor a fisherman and boatman
there was a table where he could write
and a bed where he could lie down and
read and there unless my memory has
played me one of those constructive
tricks that peoples memories indulge in
he read me the first chapters of an ad-
mirable story the scene was laid in a
missouri town and the characters such
as he had known in boyhood but often
as i tried to make him own it ho denied
having written any such story it is pos-
sible that i dreamed it but i hope the
ms will yet be found

  i cannot say whether or not he believed
that his wife would recover be fought
the fear of her death to the end for her
life was far more largely his than the
lives of most mens wives are theirs
for his own life i believe he would

never have much cared if i may trust
a saying of one who was so absolutely
without pose as he was he said that
he never saw a dead man whom he did
not envy for having had it over and
being done with it life had always
amused him and in the resurgence of its
interests after his sorrow had ebbed away
he was again deeply interested in the
world and in the human race which
though damned abounded in subjects of
eurious inquiry when the time came
for his wifes removal from york harbor
i went with him to boston wljere he
wished to look up the best means of her
conveyance to new york the inquiry
absorbed him the sort of invalid-car he
could get how she could be carried to
the village station how the car could
be detached from the eastern jrain at
boston and carried round to the southern
train on the other side of the city and
then how it could be attached to the
hudson river train at new york and
left at riverdale there was no par-
ticular of the business which he did not
scrutinize and master not only with his
poignant concern for her welfare but
with his strong curiosity as to how these
unusual things were done with the usual
means with the inertness that grows
upon an ageing man he had been used to
delegating more and more things but of
that thing i perceived that he would not
delegate the least detail

 he had meant never to go abroad
anain but when it came time to go he
did not look forward to returning he
expected to live in florence always after
that they were used to tho life and
they had been happy there some years
earlier before he went with his wife
for the cure of nauheim but when he
came home again it was for good and
all it was natural that ho should wish
to live in new york where they had
already had a pleasant year in tenth
street i used to see him there in an
upper room looking south over a quiet
open space of back yards where we
fought our battles in behalf of the
filipinos and tho boers and he carried
on his campaign against the mission-
aries in china he had not yet formed
his habit of lying for whole days in
bed and reading and writing there yet
he was a good deal in bed from weak-

ness i suppose aud for the mere
comfort of it

  my perspectives are not very clear and
in the foreshortening of events which al-
ways takes place in our review of the past
i may not always time things aright
but i believe it was not until he had
taken his house at  fifth avenue that
he began to talk to me of writing his
autobiography he meant that it should
be a perfectly veracious record of his life
and period for the first time in literature
there should be a true history of a man
nnd n true presentation of the men the
man had known as we talked it over
the scheme enlarged itself in our riotous
fancy we said it should be not only a
book it should be a library not only a
library but a literature it should make
good thg worlds loss through omars
barbarity at alexandria there was no
image so grotesque so extravagant that
we did not play with it and the work
so far as he carried it was really done
on a colossal scale but one day ho said
that as to veracity it was a failure he
had begun to lie and that if no man ever
yet told the truth about himself it was
bccause no man ever could how far he
had carried his autobiography i cannot
say he dictated the matter several hours
each day and the public has already
seen long passages from it and can
judge probably of the make and matter
of the whole from these it is immense-
ly inclusive and it observes no order
or sequence whether now after his
death it will be published soon or late
i have no means of knowing once or
twice he said in a vague way that it was
not to be published for twenty years so
that the discomfort of publicity might lie
minimized for all the survivors sud-
denly he told me he was not working at
it hut i did not understand whether he
had finished it or merely dropped it i
never asked

  we lived in the same city but for old
men rather far apart he at tenth
street aud i at seventieth and with our
colds and other disabilities we did not
see each other often he expected me
to come to him and i would not without
some return of my visits hut we never
ceased to lie friends and good friends
so far as t know i joked him once as
to how i was going to come out in his

autobiography and he gave me some sort
of joking reassurance there was one
incident however that brought us very
frequently and actively together he
came one sunday afternoon to have me
call with him on maxim gorky who was
staying at a hotel a few streets above
mine we were both interested in
gorky clemens rather more as a revolu-
tionist and i as a realist though 
too wished the russian czar ill and
the novelist well in his mission to the
russian sympathizers in this republic
but i had lived through the episode of
kossuths visit to us and his vain en-
deavor to raise funds for the hungarian
cause in  when we were a younger
and nobler nation than now with hearts
if not hands opener to the  oppressed of
europe the oppressed of america the
four or five millions of slaves we did
not copnt i did not believe that gorky
could get the money for the cause of
freedom in russia which he had come
to get as i told a valued friend of his
and mine i did not believe he could get
 and i think now t set the fifrur
too high i had already refused to sign
the sort of general appeal his friends
were making to our principles and
pockets because i felt it so wholly idle
and when the paper was produced in
gorkys presence and clemens put bis
name to it i still refused tlie next
day gorky was expelled from his hotel
with the woman who was not his wife
but who i am bound to say did not
look as if she were not at least to me
who am however not versed in those
aspects of human nature

  i might have escaped unnoted but
clemenss familiar head gave us away
to the reporters waiting at the elevators
mouth for all who went to see gorky
as it was a hunt of interviewers ensued
for us severally and jointly i could re-
main aloof in my hotel apartment re-
turning answer to such guardians of the
public right to know everything that t
had nothing to say of gorkys domestic
affairs for the public interest had now
strayed far from the revolution and now-
centred entirely upon these but with
clemens it was different he lived in a
house with a street door kept by a single
butler and lie was constantly rung for
i forgot how long the siege lasted but
my memories of mark twain



long enough for us to have fun with
it that was the moment of the great
vesuvian eruption and we figured our-
selves in easy reach of a volcano which
was every now and then  blowing a cone
off as the telegraphic phrase was the
roof of tlie great market in naples had
just broken in under its load of ashes
and cinders and crushed hundreds of
people and we asked each other if we
were not sorry we had not been there
where tlie pressure would have been
far less terrific than it was with us in
fifth avenue the forbidden butler
came up with a message that there
were some gentlemen below who wanted
to see clemens

  how many  he demanded

   five the butler faltered

  reporters

  the butler feigned uncertainty

 what would you do he asked me

  i wouldnt see them i said and
then clemens went directly down to
them how or by what means he ap-
peased their voracity i cannot say but
i fancy it was by the confession of the
exact truth which was harmless enough
they went away joyfully and he camo
hack in radiant satisfaction with having
seen them of course he was right and i
wrong and he was right as to the point
at issue between gorky and those who
had helplessly treated him with such
cruel ignominy in america it is not
the convention for men to live openly
in hotels with women who are not their
wives gorky had violated this conven-
tion and he had to pay the penalty and
concerning the destruction of his effi-
ciency as an emissary of the revolution
his blunder was worse than a crime

  to the period of clemenss residence
in fifth avenue belongs his efflorescence
in white serge he was always rather
aggressively indifferent about dress and
at a very early date in our acquaintance
aldrich and i attempted his reform by
clubbing to buy him a cravat but he
would not put away his stiff little black
bow and until he imagined the suit of
white serge lie wore always a suit of
black serge truly deplorable in the cut
of the sagging frock after his measure
had once been taken he refused to make
his clothes the occasion of personal inter-
views with his tailor he sent the stuff

by the kind elderly woman who had been
iu the service of the family from the
earliest days of his marriage and ac-
cepted the result without criticism but
the white serge was an inspiration which
few men woidd have had the courage
to act upon the first time i saw him
wear it was at the authors hearing before
the congressional committee on copy-
right in washington nothing could
have been more dramatic than the gesture
with which he flung off his long loose
overcoat and stood forth in white from
his feet to the crown of his silvery head
it was a magnificent coup and he dear-
ly loved a coup but the magnificent
speech which he made tearing to shreds
the venerable farrago of nonsense about
non-property in ideas which had formed
the basis of all copyright legislation
made you forget even his spectacularity

  it is well known how proud he was of
his oxford gown not merely because it
symbolized the honor in which he was
held by the highest literary body in the
world but because it was so rich and
so beautiful the red and the lavender
of the cloth flattered his eye as the silken
black of the same degree of doctor of
letters given him years before at yale
could not do his simple-hearted happi-
ness in it mixed with a due sense of
burlesque was something that those lack-
ing his poet-sotil could never imagine
they accounted it vain weak but that
would not have mattered to him if he
had known it in his london sojourn
he had formed the top-hat habit and for
a while he lounged splendidly up and
down fifth avenue in that society em-
blem but he seemed to tire of it and
to return kindly to the soft hat of his
southwestern tradition

  he disliked clubs i dont know whether
he belonged to any in new york but i
never met him in one as i have told he
himself had formed the human race
club but as he never could get it together
it hardly counted there was to have
been a meeting of it the time of my only
visit to stormfield in april of last- year
but of three who were to have come i
alone came we got on very well without
the absentees after finding them in the
wrong as usual and the visit was like
those i used to have with him so many
years before in hartford but there was


harpers monthly magazine

not the old ferment of subjects many
things had been discussed and put away
for good but we bad our old fondness for
nature and for one another who were so
differently parts of it he showed his ab-
solute content with his house and that
was the greater pleasure for ine because it
was my son who designed it the architect
had been so fortunate as to be able to plan
it where a natural avenue of savins the
close-knit slender cypress-like cedars of
new england led away from the rear
of the villa to the little level of a per-
gola meant some day to be wreathed and
roofed with vines but in the early spring
days all the landscape was in the beauti-
ful nakedness of the northern winter it
opened in the surpassing loveliness of
wooded and meadowed uplands under
skies that were the first days blue and
the last gray over a rainy and then a
snowy floor we walked up and down
up and down between the villa terrace
and the pergola and talked with the
melancholy amusement the sad tolerance
of age for the sort of men and things
that used to excite us or enrage us now
we were far past turbulence or anger
once we took a walk together across
the yellow pastures to a ehasmal creek
on his grounds where the ice still
knit the clayey banks together like
crystal mosses and the stream far
down clashed through and over the
stones and the shards of ice clemens
pointed out tho scenery he had bought
to give himself elbow-room and showed
me the lot he was going to have me
build on the next day we came again
with the geologist he hod asked up to
stormfield to analyze its rocks truly he
loved the place though he hod been so
weary of change and so indifferent to it
that he never saw it till he came to live
in it he left it all to the architect
whom he had known from a child in
the intimacy which bound our families
together though we bodily lived far
enough apart i loved his little ones
and he was sweet to mine and was
their delighted-in and wondered-at friend
once and once again and yet again and
again the black shadow that shall never
be lifted where it falls fell in his house
and in mine during the forty years and
more that we were friends and endeared
us the more to each other

  my visit at stormfield came to an end
with tender relucting on his part and
on mine every morning before i dressed
i heard him sounding my name through
the house for the fun of it and i know
for the fondness and if i looked out of
my door tliere he was in his long night-
gown swaying up and down the corridor
and wagging his great white head like a
boy that leaves his bed and comes out in
the hope of frolic with some one the last
morning a soft sugar-snow had fallen and
was falling and  drove through it down
to the station in the carriage which had
leen given him by his wifes father when
they were first married and been kept all
those intervening years in honorable re-
tirement for this final use its springs
had not grown yielding with time it
had rather the stiffness and severity of
age but for him it must have swung
low like the sweet chariot of the negro
 spiritual  which i lieard him sing with
such fervor when those wonderful hymns
of the slaves began to make their way
northward oo down daniel was one
in which i can hear his quavering tenor
now he was a lover of the things he
liked and full of a passion for them
which satisfied itself in reading them
matchlessly aloud no one con id read
uncle remus like him his voice echoed
tho voices of the negro nurses who told
his childhood the wonderful tales i
remember especially his rapture with mr
cables old creole days and tho thrill-
ing force with which he gave the for-
bidding of the lepers brother when the
citys survey ran the course of an avenue
through the cottage where the leper lived
in hiding  strit must not pass

  out of a nature rich and fertile beyond
any i have known the material given
him by the mystery that makes a man
and then leaves him to mako himself
over he wrought a character of high
nobility upon a foundation of clear and
solid truth at the last day ho will not
have to confess anything for all his
life was tho free knowledge of any one
who would ask him of it the searcher
of hearts will not bring him to shame
at that day for ho did not try to hide
any of the things for which ho was often
so bitterly sorry he knew where the
responsibility lay and he took a mans
share of it bravely but not the less
loves comings

fearlessly lie left the rest of the answer
to the god who had imagined men

  it is in vain that i try to give a no-
tion of tho intensity with which he
pierced to the heart of things and the
breadth of vision with which he com-
passed the whole world and tried for the
reason of things and then left trying
we had other meetings insignificantly
sad and brief but the last time i saw
him alive was made memorable to me by
the kind clear judicial sense with which
he explained and justified the labor-
unions as the sole present help of the
weak against the strong

  next i saw him dead lying in his
coffin amidst those flowers with which
we garland our despair in that pitiless

hour after the voice of his old friend
twichell had been lifted in the prayer
which it wailed through in broken-
hearted supplication i looked a moment
at the face i knew so well and it was
patient with the patience i had so often
seen in it something of puzzle a great
silent dignity an assent to what must
be from the depths of a nature whose
tragical seriousness broke in the laugh-
ter which the unwise took for the whole
of him

                  part 

the skipper of the sephora had a
thin red whisker all round his face
and the sort of complexion that goes
with hair of that color also the particu-
lar rather intense shade of blue in the
eyes lie was not exactly a showy figure
his shoulders were high his stature but
middling-one leg slightly more bandy
than the other he shook hands looking
vaguely around a spiritless tenacity was
his main characteristic i judged i re-
ceived him with an icy punctilious polite-
ness which seemed to disconcert him
perhaps he was shy he mumbled to me
as if he were ashamed of what he was
saying gave his name it was something
like archbold-but at this distance of
years i hardly am sure his ships name
and a few other particulars of that sort
in the manner of a criminal making a
reluctant and doleful confession he had
had terrible weather on the passage out-
terrible-terrible-wife aboard too

  by this time we were seated in the
cabin and the steward brought in a tray
with a bottle and glasses  thanks no
never took liquor would have some
water though he drank two tumbler-
fuls terrible thirsty work ever since
daylight had been exploring the islands
round his ship

  what was that for-fun t asked
with an appearance of polite interest

  no he sighed painful duty

  as he persisted in his mumbling and i
wanted my double to hear every word i
hit upon the notion of informing him that
i regretted to say i was hard of hearing

   such a young man too he nodded
keeping his smeary blue unintelligent
eyes fastened upon me  what was tlie
cause of it-some disease he inquired
without the least sympathy and as if he
thoupht that if so id got no more than
i deserved

  yes disease t admitted in a cheer-
fully polite tone which seemed to shock

him but my point was gained because
he bad to raise his voice to give me his
tale it is not worth while to record that-
version it was just over two months
since all this had happened and he had
thought so much about it that he seemed
completely muddled as to its bearings
but still immensely impressed

   what would you think of such a thing
happening on board your own ship ive
had the sephora for these fifteen years i
am a well-known shipmaster

  he was densely distressed-and per-
haps i should have sympathized with him
if i had been able to detach my mental
vision from the unsuspected sharer of my
cabin as though he were my second self
there he was on the other side of the
bulkhead four or five feet from us no
more as we sat in the saloon i looked
politely at captain archbold if that was
his name but it was the other i saw in
a gray sleeping-suit seated on a low stool
his bare feet close together his arms fold-
ed and every word said between us fall-
ing into the cars of his dark head bowed
on his chest

   i have been at sea now man and boy
for seven-and-thirty years and ive never
heard of such a thing happening in an
english ship and that it should be my
ship wife on lioard too

  i was hardly listening to him

   dont you think i said  that the
heavy sea which you told me came
aboard just then might have killed the
man  i have seen the sheer weight of a
sea kill a man very neatly by simply
breaking his neck

  good god he uttered impressively
fixing his smeary blue eyes on me  the
sea no man killed by the sea ever looked
like that he seemed positively scandal-
ized at my suggestion and as i gazed
at him certainly not prepared for any-
thing original on his part he advanced
his head close to mine and thrust his
wf  ayiu-xrd

tiie secret-sharer



tongue out at me so suddenly that i could-
nt help starting back

  after scoring over my calmness in this
graphic way he nodded wisely if i had
seen the sight he assured me i would
never forget it as long as i lived the
weather was too bad to give the corpse a
proper sea burial so next day at dawn
they took it up on the poop covering its
face with a bit of bunting lie read a short
prayer and then just as it was in its oil-
skins and long boots they launched it
amongst those mountainous seas that
seemed ready every moment to swallow
up the ship herself and the terrified lives
on board of her

   that reefed foresail saved you i
threw in

   under god-it did he exclaimed fer-
vently  it was by a special mercy i
firmly believe that it stood some of those
hurricane squalls

 it was the setting of that sail
which  i began

   gods own hand in it he interrupted
me nothing less could have done it
i dont mind telling you that i hardly
dared give the order it seemed impos-
sible that we could touch anything with-
out losing it and then our last hope would
have been gone

  the terror of that gale was on him yet
i let him go on for a bit then said casu-
ally-as if returning to a minor subject
 you were very nnxious to give up
your mate to the shore people i believe
he was to the law his obscure
tenacity on that point had in it something
incomprehensible and a little awful
something as it were mystical quite
apart from his anxiety that he should not
lie suspected of  countenancing any do-
ings of that sort seven-and-thirty vir-
tuous years at sea of which over twenty
of immaculate command and the last
fifteen in the sephora seemed to have
laid him under some pitiless obligation

 and you know he went groping
shamefacedly amongst his feelings  i
did not engage that young fellow tti
people had some interest with my owners
i was in a way forced to take him on
he looked very smart very gentlemanly
and nil that but do you know-i never
liked him somehow i am a plain man
 ou see he wasnt exactly the sort for the
ehief mate of a ship like tlie sephora

  i had become so connected in thoughts
and impressions with tho secret occupant
of my cabin that i felt as if i personally
were being given to understand that i
too was not the sort that would have done
for the chief mate of a ship like the sep-
hora i had  doubt of it in my mind

   not at all the style of man you un-
derstand he insisted superfluously look-
ing hard at me

  i smiled urbanely he seemed at a loss
for a while

   i suppose i must report a suicide

   beg pardon 

   sui-cide thats what ill have to
write to my owners directly i get in

   unless you manage to recover him lie-
fore to-morrow i assented dispassion-
ately     i mean alive

lie mumbled something which i really
did not catch and i turned my ear to him
in a puzzled manner he fairly bawled
 the land-i say the mainland is at
least seven miles off my anchorage

   about that

  my lack of excitement of curiosity of
surprise of any sort of pronounced in-
terest began to arouse his distrust but
except for the felicitous pretence of deaf-
ness i had not tried to pretend to any-
thing i had felt utterly incapable of
playing the part of ignorance properly
and therefore was afraid to try it is
also certain that he had brought some
ready-made suspicions with him and that
he viewed my cold politeness as a strange
and unnatural phenomenon and yet how
else could i have received him heartily
that was impossible for psychological
reasons which i need not state here my
only object was to keep off his inquiries
surliness might have provoked a point-
blank question from its novelty to him
and from its nature a chilly distant
courtesy was the manner best calculated
to restrain the man but there was the
danger of his breaking through my de-
fence bluntly i could not i think have
met him by a direct lie also for psycho-
logical not moral reasons if he had
only known how afraid i was of his put-
ting my feeling of identity with the other
to the test but strangely enough-i
thought of it only afterward-i believe
that he was not a little disconcerted by the
reverse side of that weird situation by
something in nie that reminded him of


harpers monthly magazine

the man he was seeking-suggested a
mysterious similitude to the young fel-
low he had distrusted and disliked from
the first

 however that might have been the
silence was not very prolonged then he
took another oblique step

   i reckon i had no more than a two-
mile pull to your ship not a bit more

   and quite enough too in this awful
heat i said

  another pause full of mistrust followed
necessity they say is mother of inven-
tion but fear too is not barren of in-
genious suggestions and i was afraid
he would ask me point-blank for news of
my other self

  nice little cabin isnt it i re-
marked as if noticing for the first time
the way his eyes roamed from one closed
door to the other  and very well fitted
out too here for instance i con-
tinued reaching over the back of my seat
negligently and flinging the door open
 is my bath-room

  he made on eager movement but hardly
gave it a glance i got up shut the door
of the bath-room and invited him to have
a look round as if i were very proud of
my accommodation he had to rise and
be shown round but lie went through the
business without any raptures whatever

  and now well have a look at my
stateroom i declared in a voice as
loud as i dared to make it crossing the
cabin to the starboard side with purposely
heavy steps

  he followed me in and gazed around
my intelligent double had vanished i
played niv part

  very convenient-isnt it

  very nice very comf    he
didnt finish and went out brusquely as
if to escape from some unrighteous wiles
of mine but it was not to be i had
been too frightened not to feel vengeful
i felt i had him on the run and i meant
to keep him on the run my polite in-
sistence must have had something men-
acing in it because he gave in suddenly
and i did not let him off a single item
mates mom pantry storerooms the very
sail-looker which was also under the poop
-he had to look into them all when
at last i showed him out on tlie quarter-
deck he drew a long spiritless sigh and
mumbled dismally that he must really be

going back to his ship now i desired my
mate who had joined us to see to the
captains boat

  the man of mustaches gave a blast on
the whistle which lie used to wear hanging
round his neck  sephoras away my
double down there in my cabin must have
heard and certainly could not feel more
relieved than i four fellows came run-
ning out from somewhere forward and
went over tlie side while my own men
appearing on deck too lined tlie rail i
escorted my visitor to tlie gangway cere
moniously and nearly overdid it he was
a tenacious beast on the very ladder he
lingered and in that unique guiltily
conscientious manner of sticking to
the point

   i say    you    you dont think
that  

  i covered his voice loudly

   certainly not    quite the con-
trary good-by

  i had no idea of what he meant to say
but it was the privilege of the defective
hearing he was too shaken generally to
insist but my mate close witness of that
parting looked mystified and his face took
on a thoughtful cast as i did not want
to appear os if i wished to avoid all com-
munication with my officers he had the
opportunity to address me

   seems a very nice man his boats
crew told our chaps a very extraordinary
story if what i am told by the steward is
true i suppose you had it from tlie cap-
tain sir

  yes i had a story from the captain
  a very horrible affair-isnt it sir
   it is

   beats all these tales we hear about
murders in yankee ships

   i dont think it beats them i dont
think it resembles them in the least

   bless my soul--you dont say so but
of course iv no acquaintance whatever
with american ships not i so i couldnt
go against your knowledge its horrible
enough for me    but the queerest part
is that those fellows seemed to have some
iilea the man was aboard here they had
really did you ever hear of such a thing 
preposterous-isnt it

  we were walking to and fro athwart the
quarter-deck no one of tlie crew forward
could lie seen the day was sunday and
the mate pursued
tiie secret-sharer



   there was some little dispute about it
our chaps took offence  as if we would
harbor a thing- like that they said
 wouldnt you like to look for him in our
coal-hole v quite a tiff but they made
it up in tlie end  suppose he did drown
himself dont you sir 

  i dont suppose anything

 you liave uo doubt in tlie mat-
ter sir 

   none whatever

  i left him suddenly i felt i was pro-
ducing a bad impression but with my
double down there it was most trying to
be on deck and it was almost as trying
to be below altogether a nerve-trying
situation but on the whole i felt less
torn in two when i was with him there
was no one in tlie whole ship whom i dared
take into my confidence sinee the hands
had got to know his story it would have
been impossible to pass him off for any
ouo else and an accidental discovery was
to be dreaded now more than ever   

  the steward being engaged in laying
the table for dinner we could talk only
with our eyes when i first went down
later in the afternoon we had a cautions
try at whispering the sunday quietness
of the ship was against us the stillness
of air and water around her was against
us the elements the men were against
us-everything was against us in our
secret partnership time itself-for this
could not go on forever the very trust
in providence was i suppose denied to
his guilt shall i confess that this
thought cast me down very much  and as
to the chapter of accidents which counts
for so much in the book of success i could
only hope that it was closed for what
favorable accident could be expected 

 did you hear anything were my
first words as soon as we took up our
position side by side leaning over my
bed-plnce

  ne had and the proof of it was his
earnest whisper  the man told yon he
hardly dared to give the order

  i understood the reference to be to that
saving foresail

  yes he was afraid of it being lost
in the setting

  i assure you he never gave the order
he may think be did but he never gave it
he stood there with me on the break of
the poop after the maintopsail blew away

and whimpered about our last hope-
positively whimpered about it and noth-
ing else-and the night coining on to
hear ones skipper go on like that in such
weather was enough to drive any fellow
out of his mind it worked me up into
a sort of desperation i just took it into
my own hands and went away from him
boiling and    but whats the use tell-
ing you i you know  do you think
that if i had not been pretty fierce with
them i should have got the men to do any-
thing not itl tho bosn perhaps
perhaps  it wasnt a heavy sea-it was a
sea gone mad i suppose the end of the
world will be something like that and a
man may have tho heart to see it coming
once and be done with it-but to have to
face it day after day  i dont blame
anybody i was precious little better than
the rest only-i was an officer of that
old coal-wagon anyhow  

   i quite understand i conveyed that
sincere assurance into his ear he was
out of breath with whispering i could
hear him pant slightly it was all very
simple the same strung-up force which
had given twenty-four men a chance at
least for their lives had in a sort of
recoil crushed out an unworthy muti-
nous existence

  but i had no leisure to weigh the merits
of the matter-footsteps in tho saloon a
heavy knock  theres enough wind to
get under way with sir there was tlie
call of a new claim upon my thoughts and
even upon my feelings

   turn the hands up i cried through
the door  ill be on deck directly

  i was going out to make the acquaint-
ance of my ship before i left the cabin
our eyes met-tlie eyes of the only two
strangers on board i pointed to the re-
cessed part where the little camp-stool
awaited him nnd laid my finger on my
lips he made a gesture-somewhat
vague-a little mysterious accompanied
by a faint smile as if of regret

  this is not the place to enlarge upon
tlie sensations of a man who feels for the
first time a ship move under his feet to
his own independent word in my case
they were not unalloyed i was not
wholly alone with my command for there
was that stranger in my cabin or rather
i was not completely and wholly with her
part of me was absent- that mental


harpers monthly magazine

feeling of being in two places at once
affected me physically as if the mood of
secrecy had penetrated my very soul be-
fore an hour had elapsed since the ship
had begun to move having occasion to
ask the mate he stood by my side to
take a compass bearing of the pagoda i
caught myself reaching up to his ear in
whispers i say i caught myself but
enough had escaped to be caught by the
man i cant describe it otherwise than
by saying that he shied a grave preoc-
cupied manner as though he were in pos-
session of some perplexing intelligence did
not leave him henceforth a little later
i moved away from the rail to look at
the compass with such a stealthy gait that
the helmsman noticed it-and i could not
help noticing the unusual roundness of
his eyes these are trifling instances
though its to no commanders advantage
to be suspected of ludicrous eccentricities
but i was also more seriously affected
there are to a seaman certain words ges-
tures that should in given conditions come
as naturally as instinctively as the wink-
ing of a menaced eye a certain order
shoidd spring on to his lips without think-
ing a certain sign should get itself made
so to speak without reflection but all
unconscious alertness had abandoned me
i had to make an effort of will to recall
myself back from the cabin to the con-
ditions of the moment i felt that i was
appearing an irresolute commander to
those people who were watching me more
or less critically

  and besides there were the scares on
the second day out for instance coming
off the deck in the afternoon i had straw
slippers on my bare feet i stopped at
the open pantry door and spoke to the
steward he was doing something there
with his back to me at the sound of my
voice he nearly jumped out of his skin as
the saying is and incidentally broke a cup

   what on earths the matter with
you i asked astonished

  he was extremely confused  beg
your pardon sir i made sure you wero
in your cabin

  you see i wasnt

  no sir i could have sworn i had
heard you moving in there not a moment
ago its most extraordinary    very
sorry sir

  i passed on with an inward shudder i

was so identified with my secret double
that i did not even mention the fact in
those scanty fearful whispers we ex-
changed i suppose he had made some
slight noise of some kind or other it
would have been miraculous if he hadnt
at one time or another and yet haggard
as he appeared he looked always perfectly
self-controlled more than calm-almost
invulnerable on my suggestion he re-
mained almost entirely in the bath-room
which upon the whole was the safest
place there could le really no shadow of
an excuse for any one ever wanting to
go in there once the steward had done
with it it was a very tiny place some-
times he reclined on the floor his legs
bent his head sustained on one elbow
at others i would find him on the camp-
stool sitting in his gray sleeping-suit and
cropped dark hair like a patient unmoved
convict at night i would smuggle him
into my bed-place and we would whisper
together with the regular footfalls of the
officer on the watch passing and repassing
over our heads it was an infinitely mis-
erable time it was lucky that some tins
of fine preserves were stowed in a locker
in my stateroom hard bread i could al-
ways get hold of and so he lived on
stewed chicken pate de foies gras aspara-
gus cooked oysters sardines-on all sorts
of abominable sham delicacies out of tins
the early morning coffee he always drank
and it was all i dared do for him in
that way

  every day there was the horrible
manoeuvring to go through so that my
room and then the bath-room should be
done in the usual way i came to hate the
sight of the steward to abhor tho voice of
that harmless man i felt that it was he
who would bring on the disaster of discov-
ery it hung like a sword over our heads

  the fourth day out t think we were
then working down the east side of the
gulf of siam tack for tack in light
winds and smooth water-the fourth day
i say of this miserable juggling with the
unavoidable as we sat at our evening
meal that man whose slightest movement
i dreaded after putting down tlie dishes
ran up on deck busily this could not be
dangerous presently he came down
again and then it appeared that he had
remembered a coat of mine which i had
thrown over a rail to dry after having
the secret-siiarer



been wetted in a shower which had passed
over the ship in the afternoon sitting
stolidly at the head of the table i be-
came terrified at the sight of the garment
on his arm of course he made for my
door there was no time to lose

   steward i thundered my nerves
were so shaken that i could not govern my
voice and conceal my agitation this was
the sort of thing that made my terrific-
ally mustachioed mate tap his forehead
with his forefinger i had caught a sight
of him using that gesture while talking
on deck with a confidential air to the car-
penter it was too far to hear a
word but i had no doubt that this
pantomime could only refer to the strange
new captain

   yes sir the pale-faced steward
turned resignedly to me it was this mad-
dening course of beiug shouted at
checked without rhyme or reason arbi-
trarily chased out of my cabin suddenly
called into it sent flying out of his pantry
on incomprehensible errands that ac-
counted for the growing wretchedness of
his expression

   where are you going with that coot
  to your room sir

   is there another shower coming

   im sure i dont know sir shall i
go up agnin and see sir

   no i never mind

  my object was attained as of course my
other self in there would have heard
everything that passed during this
interlude my two officers never raised
their eyea off their respective plates but
the lip of that confounded cub the second
mate quivered visibly

  i expected the steward to hook my coat
on and come out at once he was very
slow about it but i dominated my nerv-
ousness sufficiently not to shout after him
suddenly i became a wore it could be
heard plainly enough that the fellow for
some reason or other was opening the door
of the bath-room it was the end tlie
place was literally not big enough to
swing a cat in my voice died in my
throat and i went stony all over i ex-
pected to hear a yell of surprise and ter-
ror and made a movement but had not
the strength to get on my legs every-
thing remained still had my second self
taken the poor wretch by the throat  i
dont know what i would have done next

moment if i had not seen the steward
come out of my room close the door and
then stand quietly by the sideboard

   saved i thought  but no i lost i
gone he was gone

 i laid my knife and fork down and
leaned back in my chair my head swam
after a while when sufficiently recovered
to speak in a steady voice i instructed
my mate to put the ship round at eight
oclock himself

  i wont come on deck i went on
 i think ill turn in and unless the wind
shifts i dont want to be disturbed before
midnight i feel a bit seedy

   you did look middling bad a little
while ago the chief mate remarked
without showing any great concern

  they both went out and i stared at
the steward clearing the table there was
nothing to be read on that wretched mans
face but why did he avoid my eyes i
asked myself then i thought i should
like to hear the sound of his voice
steward

   sir i startled as usual

   where did you hang up that coat 

   in the bath-room sir the casual anx-
ious tone  its not quite dry yet sir
for some time longer i sat in the cuddy
had my double vanished as he had come
but of his coming there was an explana-
tion whereas his disappearance would be
inexplicable  i went slowly into my
dark room shut the door lighted the
lamp and for a time dared not turn round
when at last i did i saw him standing
bolt-upright in the narrow recessed part
it would not be true to say i had a shock
but an irresistible doubt of his bodily
existence flitted through my mind can it
be i asked myself that he is not visible
to other eyes than mine it was like be-
ing haunted motionless with a grave
face he raised his hands slightly at me in
a gesture which meant clearly  heavens
what a narrow escape narrow in-
deed t think i had come creeping quietly
as near insanity as any man who has not
actually gone over the border that ges-
ture restrained me so to speak

  the mate with the terrific mustaches
was now putting the ship on the other
tack and in the moment of profound
silence which follows upon the hands go-
ing to their stations i heard on the poop
his raised voice hard alee and the
harpers monthly magazine

distant shout of the order repeated on the
maindeck the sails in that light breeze
made but a faint fluttering noise it
ceased the ship was coming round slow-
ly i held my breath in the renewed still-
ness of expectation one wouldnt have
thought that there was a single living soul
on her decks a sudden brisk shout
mainsail haul broke the spell and in
the noisy cries and rush overhead of the
men running away with tho main-brace
we two down in my cabin came together
in our usual position by the bed-plaee

  he did not wait for my question  i
heard him fumbling here and just man-
aged to squat myself down in the bath
he whispered to me  the fellow only
opened the door and put his head in to
hang the coat up all the same   

   i never thought of that i whispered
back even more appalled than before at
the closeness of the shave and marvelling
at that something unyielding in his char-
acter which was carrying him through so
finely there was no agitation in his
whisper whoever was being driven dis-
tracted it was not lie he was sane and
the proof of his sanity was continued
when he took up the whispering again

   it would never do for me to come to
life again

  it was something that a ghost might
have said but what he was alluding to was
his old captains reluctant admission of the
theory of suicide it would obviously
serve his turn-if i had understood at all
the view which seemed to govern the un-
alterable purpose of his action

   you must maroon me as soon as ever
you can get amongst these islands off the
cambodje shore he went on

  maroon you we are not living in a
boys adventure tale i protested his
scornful whispering took me up

   we arent indeed theres nothing of
a boys tale in this but theres nothing
else for it i want no more you dont
suppose t am afraid of what can be done
to me  prison or gallows or whatever they
may please but you dont see me coming
back to explain such things to an old fel-
low in a wig and twelve respectable trades-
men do you  what can they know whether
i am guilty or not-or of what i am
guilty either thats my affair what
does the bible say driven off the face of
the earth very well  am off the face of

the earth now as i came at night so i
shall go

 impossible i murmured you
cant

   not     not naked like a soul on
the day of judgment i will freeze on to
this sleeping-suit the last day is not
yet-and    you have understood thor-
oughly didnt you 

  i felt suddenly ashamed of myself i
may say truly that i understood-and my
hesitation in letting that man swim away
from my ships side had been a mere sliam
sentiment a sort of cowardice

   it cant be done now till next night
i breathed out  tlie ship is on the off-
shore tack and the wind may fail us

   as long as you know that you under-
stand he whispered  but of course you
do its a great satisfaction to have got
somebody to understand you seem to
have been there on purpose and in the
same whisper as if we two whenever we
talked had to say things to each other
which were not fit for the world to hear
he added  its very wonderful

  we remained side by side talking in
our secret way-but sometimes silent or
just exchanging a whispered word or two
at long intervals and as usual he stared
through the port a breath of wind came
now and again into our faces the ship
might have been moored in dock so gently
and on an even keel she slipped through
the water that did not murmur even at
our passage shadowy and silent like a
phantom sea

  at midnight i went on deck and to my
mates great surprise put the ship round
on the other tack ilis terrible mustaches
flitted round me in silent criticism i
certainly should not have done it if it had
been only a question of getting out of
that sleepy gulf as quickly as possible i
believe he told tho second mate who re-
lieved him that it was a great want of
judgment the other only yawned that
intolerable cub shuffled about so sleepily
and lolled against the rails in such a
slack improper fashion that i came down
on him sharply

   arent you properly awake yet 

  yes sir i am awake

   well then be good enough to hold
yourself as if you were and keep a look-
out tf theres any current well bo clos-
ing with some islands before daylight
on the very ladder he lingered
ilaitfkrs monthly magazine

  the east side of the gulf is fringed with
islands some solitary others in groups
on the blue background of the high coast
they seem to float on silvery patches of
calm water arid and gray or dark green
and rounded like clumps of evergreen
bushes with the larger ones a mile or two
long showing the outlines of ridges ribs
of gray rock under tlie dank mantle of
matted leafage unknown to trade to
travel almost to geography the manner
of life they harbor is an unsolved secret
there must be villages-settlements of
fishermen at least-on the largest of them
and some communication with the world
is probably kept up by native craft but
all that day as we headed for them fanned
along by the faintest of breezes i saw no
sign of man or canoe in the field of tlie
telescope j kept on pointing at the scat-
tered group

  at noon i gave no orders for a change
of course and the mates mustaches be-
came much concerned and seemed to be
offering themselves unduly to my notice
at last i said

    am going to stand right in quite
in-as far as i can take her

  the stare of extreme surprise imparted
an air of ferocity also to his eyes and he
looked truly terrific for a moment

   were not doing well in the mid-
dle of tho gulf i continued casually
 i am going to look for the land
breezes to-night

  bless my soul do you mean sir in
the dark amongst the lot of all them is-
lands and reefs and shoals

   well-if there are any regular land
breezes at all on this coast one must get
close inshore to find them mustnt one
bless my soul he exclaimed again
under his breath all that afternoon he
wore a dreamy contemplative appearance
which in him was a mark of perplexity
after dinner t went into my stateroom as
if i meant to take some rest there we
two bent our dark heads over a half-
unrolled chart lying on my bed

   there i said  its got to be koli-
ring ive been looking at it ever since
sunrise it has got two hills and a low
point tt must be inhabited and on
the coast opposite there is what looks like
the mouth of a biggish river-with some
town no doubt not far up tts the best
chance for you that i can see

  anything koh-ring let it le

  he looked thoughtfully at the chart as
if surveying chances and distances from
a lofty height-and following with his
eyes his own figure wandering on the
blank land of cochin-china and then
passing off that piece of paper clean out
of sight into uncharted regions and it
was as if the ship had two captains to
plan her course for her i had been so
worried and restless running up and down
that i had not had the patience to dress
that day i had remained in my sleeping-
suit with straw slippers and a soft floppy
hat the closeness of the heat in the gulf
had been most oppressive nnd the crew
were used to see me wandering in that
airy attire

   she will clear the south point as she
heads now i whispered into his ear
goodness only knows when though but
certainly after dark ill edge her in to
half a mile as far as t may be able to
judge in the dark   

   be careful he murmured warningly
-and i realized suddenly that all my
future the only future for which i was
fit would perhaps go irretrievably to
pieces in any mishap to my first command

  i could not stop a moment longer in
the room i motioned him to get out of
sight and made my way on the poop that
unplayful cub had the watch i walked
up and down for a while thinking things
out then beckoned him over

   send a couple of hands to open the
two quarter-deck ports i said mildly

  he actually had the impudence or else
so forgot himself in his wonder at such an
incomprehensible order as to repeat

   open the quarter-deck ports wliat
for sir

   the only reason you need concern
yourself about is because i told you
so have them open wide and fastened
properly

  ho reddened and went off but i be-
lieve made some jeering remark to the
carpenter as to the sensible practice of
ventilating a ships quarter-deck t know
he popped into the mates cabin to im-
part the fact to him because the mus-
taches came on deck as it were by chance
and stole glances at me from below-for
signs of lunacy or drunkenness i suppose

  a little before supper feeling nioro
restless than ever i rejoined for a mo-
te  ec k et-sjaiiek

imiit my second self and to find him
sitting so quietly was surprising like
something agaiust nature inhuman

  i developed iny plan in a hurried
whisper

    shall stand in as close as i dare and
then put her round i shall presently find
means to smuggle you out of here into
the sail-locker which communicates with
i ik lobby hut there is an opening a sort
nf square for hauling the sails out which
gives straight on the quarter-deck and
which is never closed in fine weather so
as to give air to the sails when the
ships way is deadened in stays and all the
hands are aft at the nmin-hraees you shall
have a clear road to slip out and get over-
board through the open quarter-deck port
ive had them both fastened up use a
ropes end to lower yourself into the water
so as to avoid a splash-you know it
could be heard and cause some beast-
ly complication

  he kept silent fur a while then whis-
pered  i understand

   i wont be there to see you go i be-
gan with an effort the rest  i
only hope i have understood too

  you have from first to last-and
for the first time there seemed to be a fal-
tering something strained in his whisper
 caught hold of my arm but the ring-
ing of the supper bell made me start he
didnt though he only released his grip

  after supper i didnt come below again
till well past eight oclock the faint
steady breeze was loaded with dew and
the wet darkened sails held all there was
of propelling power in it the night
clear and starry sparkled darkly and the
opaque lightless patches shifting slowly
against the low stars were the drifting
islets on the port bow there was a big
cite more distant and shadowily imposing
bv the great space of sky it eclipsed

  on opening the door i had a hack view
of my very own self looking at a chart
he had come out of the recess and was
standing near the fable

  quite dark enough i whispered

  he stepped back and leaned against my
bed with a level quiet glance t sat on
tin- couch we had nothing to say to each
ther over our heads the officer of the
vatch moved here and there then i
heard him move quickly i knew what
hat meant he was making for the com-

panion and presently his voice was out-
side my door

   we are drawing in pretty fast sir
land looks rather close

   very well  answered  i am com-
ing on deck directly

  i waited till he was gone out of the
cuddy then rose my double moved too
the time hail come to exchange our last
whispers for neither of us was ever to
hear each others natural voice

   look here i opened a drawer and
look out three sovereigns take this
anyhow ive got six and id give you the
lot only i must keep a little money to
buy some fruit and vegetables for the
crew from native boats as we go through
sunda straits

  he shook his head

   take it i urged him whispering
desperately  no one can tell what   
lie smiled and slapped meaningly the
only pocket of the sleeping-jacket it was
not safe certainly but i produced a large
old silk handkerchief of mine and tying
the three pieces of gold in a corner pressed
it on him he was touched i suppose
because he took it at last and tied it
quickly round his waist under the jacket
on his bare skin

  our eyes met several seconds elapsed
till our glances still mingled t extend-
ed my hand and turned the lamp out
then i passed through the cuddy leav-
ing the door of my room wide open   
 steward

  he was still lingering in tlie pantry in
the greatness of his zeal giving a rub-up
to a plated cruet stand tlie last thing be-
fore going to bed being careful not to
wake up the mate whose room was op-
iosite i spoke in an undertone

  he looked round anxiously sir

   can you get me a little hot water
from the galley

   i am afraid sir the galley fires been
out for some time now

   go and see

  he fled up the stairs

   now i whispered loudly into the
saloon-too loudly perhaps but i was
afraid t couldnt make a sound he was
by my side in an instant-tho double oap-
taiu slipped past the stairs-through a
tiny dark passage    n sliding door we
were in the sail-locker scrambling on our
knees over the sails a sudden thought


harpers monthly magazine

struck in- i saw myself wandering bare-
footed bareheaded the sun beating on
my dark poll i snatched off my floppy
hat and tried hurriedly in tlie dark to ram
it on my other self he dodged and fend-
ed off silently i wonder what he thought
had come to me liefore he understood and
suddenly desisted our hands met grop-
ingly lingered united in a steady motion-
less clasp for a second  no word
was breathed by either of us when
they separated

  i was standing quietly by the pantry
door when the steward returned

   sorry sir kettle barely warm shall
i light the spirit-lamp

   never mind

  i came out on deck slowly it was now
a matter of conscience to shave the land
as close as possible-for now he must go
overboard whenever the ship was put in
stays must there could lie no going
back for him after n moment i walked
over to leeward and my heart flew into my
mouth at the nearness of the land on the
bow under any other circumstances t
would not have held on a minute
longer the second mate had followed
me anxiously

  t looked on till i felt  could command
my voice

   she will weather i said then in a
quiet tone

  are you going to try that sir he
stammered out incredulously

  i took no notice of him and raised
my tone just enough to be heard by
the helmsman

  keep her good full

   good full sir

  the wind fanned my cheek the sails
slept the world was silent the strain
of watching the dark loom of the land
grow bigsrer and denser was too much for
me i had shut my eyes-because the ship
must go closer she must the stillness
mas intolerable were we standing still

  when i opened my eyes the second view
started my heart with a thump the black
southern hill of koh-ring seemed to hang
right over the ship like a towering frag-
ment of the everlasting night on that
enormous mass of blackness there was not
a gleam to be seen not a sound to be
heard it was gliding irresistibly toward
us and yet seemed already within reach
of the baud i saw the vague figures of

the watch grouped in the waist gazing in
awed silence

   are you going on sir inquired an
unsteady voice at my elbow

  i ignored it i had to go on

  keep her full dont check her way
that wont do now i said warningly

   i cant see the sails very well the
helmsman answered me in strange qua-
vering tones

  was she close enough already she
was i wont say in the shadow of the
land but in the very blackness of it
already swallowed up as it were gone
too close to lie recalled gone from
me altogether

   give the mate a call i said to the
young man who stood at my elbow as still
as death  and turn all hands up

  my tone had a borrowed loudness re-
verberated from the height of the land
several voices cried out together  we
are all on deck sir

  then stillness again with the great
shadow gliding closer towering higher
without a light without a sound such a
lnish had fallen on the ship that she might
have been a hark of the dead floating in
slowly under the very gate of erebus

   my god where are we j

  it was the mate moaning at my ciimiw
he was thunderstruck and as it were
deprived of the moral support of his
mustaches he clapped his hands and
absolutely cried out  lost

   lie quiet i said sternly

  he lowered bis tone but i saw the
shadowy gesture of his despair  what
are we doing here

   looking for the land wind

  he made as if to tear his hair ami
addressed me recklessly

   she will never get out you have
done it sir i knew it d end in some-
thing like this she will never weather and
you are too close now to stay shell drift
ashore before shes round o my god

   caught his arm as he was raising it
to batter his poor devoted head and shook
it violently

   shes ashore already he wailed try-
ing to tear himself away

  ts she    keep good full there
good full sir cried tlie helmsman
in a frightened thin ehild-like voice

  t hadnt let go the mates arm and went
on shaking it  ready about do you
the secret-siiarer

bear you go forward-shake-and
stop there-shako-and hold your
noise -shake- and see these head-
sheets properly overhauled  - shake
shake-shake

  anil all the time i dared not look
toward the land lest my heart should fail
me i released my grip at last and he
ran forward as if fleeing for dear life

   wondered what my double there in
the sail-loeker thought of this commo-
tion lie was able to hear everything-
nnd perhaps he was ablo to understand
why on my conscience it had to be thus
close-no less my first order  hard
alee re-echoed ominously under the
towering shadow of koh-ring as if i had
shouted in n mountain gorge and then
i watched the land intently in that
smooth water and light wind it was im-
possible to feel the ship coming-to no
i could not feel her and my second
self was making now ready to slip out
and lower himself overboard perhaps
he was gone already   

  the great black mass brooding over
our very mastheads began to pivot away
from the ships side silently and now
i forgot the secret stranger ready to de-
part and remembered only that i was a
total stranger to the ship i did not know
her would she do it how was she to
he handled

  i swung the mainyard and waited help-
lessly she was perhaps stopped and
her very fate hung in the balance with
the black mass of koh-ring like the gate
of the everlasting night towering over
her taffrail what would she do now
had she way on her yet i stepped to
the side swiftly and on the shadowy
water i could see nothing except a faint
phosphorescent flash revealing the glassy
smoothness of sleeping surface it was
impossible to tell-and t had not learned
yet the feel of my ship was she mov-
ing what was wanted was something
easily seen a piece of paper which i
could throw overboard and watch t had
nothing on me to run down for it i
didnt dare there was no time all at
once my forced yearning stare dis-
tinguished a white object floating within
n yard of the ships side white on the
black water a phosphorescent flash
passed under it what was that thing

	  i recognized my own floppy hat

it must have fallen off his head   
and hi- didnt bother now i had what i
wanted-the saving mark for my eyes
but i hardly thought of my other self
now gone from the ship to be hidden
forever from all friendly faces to be a
fugitive ami a vagabond on the earth
with no brand of the curse on his sane
forehead to stay a slaying hand    too
proud to explain

  and t watched the hat-the expression
of my sudden pity for his mere flesh it
had been meant to save his homeless head
from the dangers of the sun and now-
behold-it was saving the ship by serving
me for a mark to help out the ignorance
of my strangeness ha it was drifting
forward warning me just in time that
the ship had gathered sternway

  shift the helm i said in a low
voice to the seaman standing still like
a statue

  the mans eyes glistened wildly in the
binnacle light as he jnmjied round to the
other side and spun round the wheel

  i walked to the break of the poop on
the overshadowed deck all hands stood by
the forebraees waiting for my order all
the stars ahead seemed to le gliding from
right to left and all was so quiet in the
world that i heard the remark  shes
round passed in a tone of intense relief
between two seamen

   let go and haul

  the foreyards ran round with a great
noise amidst cheery cries and now the
frightful mustaches were being heard
giving various orders already the ship
was drawing ahead and i was alone
with her nothing no one in the world
should stand now between us throwing a
shadow on the way of silent knowledge
nnd mute affection the perfect commun-
ion of a seaman with his first command

  walking to tho taffrail t was in time
to make out on the very edge of a dark-
ness thrown by a towering black mass
like the very gateway of erebus-yes i
was in time to catch an evanescent
glimpse of my white hat left behind to
mark the spot where the secret-sharer of
my cabin and of my thoughts as though
lie were my second self had lowered him-
self into the water to take his punish-
ment a free man a proud swimmer
striking out for a new destiny

steamers disgorging their cargoes

in port

by george harding

the liner ardmore lying at her dock
in philadelphia one blustry winter
morning was a storm-scarred craft
-standing out as such from the snow-
covered docks and the drifting floes on
the river beyond she was just in-
the breaking seas had recorded their
height  the ice-sheathed masts and
rigging and the pale had whipped this
same spray along her length enshrouding
the rails ami decks in a mass of ice
men were chopping the ice from the
hatch-coverings to land the trunks of the
passenger who stood shivering on the
dock waiting for the customs to examine
their baggage t crossed her treacherous

deck and went down the alleyway to the
second engineers room some one turned
in the bunk as i opened tho door ami
a familiar voice which i failed to recog-
nize on the instant drawled in a sleepy
fashion  are we in dock yet 

  by that time t made out in the dim-
ness of the room barnes second engineer
on  he british prince with whom i had
spent a roaring last night ashore some
ten days ago such was my surprise that
i remember a breath of wind would have
knocked me over a minute later barnes
was dangling his legs over the edge of
the bunk and telling me about it

   the old prince is gone he began
in port

-

 she ivin in a couple hiui-
dred fathoms o tumblin
water a hundred miles to
the eastard o cape sable
islam this steamer hove
in sight on friday night
and took us oft before she
went down

  i propped myself on the
wash-stand and fired ques-
tions at him lie began
giving details such as had
become impressed on his
mind particularly did he
condemn the luck of losing
the vessel the whole engine-
room force had slaved twen-
ty hours making repairs
tho seas rolled the ship so
that they had to work with
one hand and hang on with
the other

   then mind you he
went on we were repaired
and just gettin under way
when the blasted steerin-
gear locked a couple o
swopin seas took her broad-
side on and hove her over

the cargo shifted to leeard
and held her down liftin
the seacocks above water

there was nothin to do but stop the engine
again this time for lack of water in the
condenser down in the engine-room we
waited orders the poundin seas was
loosenin her plates the water came in
gettin nearer and nearer to the fires
and at last puttin em out she was
smotherin in the eross-seas we could
hear the noise of the bellowin cattle on
deck as the seas washed over and pounded
them hack and forth the old man
ordered us up on deck where they was
havin their own time fightin it out
the ardmore was in sight and we sinkin
fast the old prinre looked like a junk-
pile above decks-listed over tin rail
alonir the how twisted off the canvas
weather-sheets and side of bridge missin
a dented stack and the only life-boat left
hi the chocks stove in i went aioard
the ardmore in the second boat she sent
its it was a question in my mind which
was lw-st ehosin-the prinre or the life-
boat we was in we boarded tliisn all
right they took the last half-dozen off

tmb ships officer

after nightfall from the ardmore we
saw a few lights movin and above the
wind heard the bellow of the cattle the
last crowd said the sea was strewn with
the wreckage the cattle was swimmin
around among oil-barrels and disappear-
in as the sharks pulled them under

   aboard this we stowed away all right
our old man put tip with the ardmores
all our gansr o cattlemen anil firemen are
in the steerage quarters i turned in
washing up

with jim borrowed some of his clothes
and used his hunk while ho was  duty

  barnes was finishing his story when
my friend the ardmores second caine
in off duty now that tho ship was safely
docked he held out his greasy hand in
greeting to me and i grasped it about the
wrist wliere the grime was less

   well we been pieking up passengers
all the way over this trip he commented
still got the pilot on board from the
other side then picked barnes and his
crowd up la-t friday-all of it kept us
three days late very nice to have barnes
as passenger it was seldom the british
prince and the ardmore were in port
at the same time

  we went out en deck the stevedores
were busy at all the hatches winches
were driving cargo was coming out into
the lighters alongside men were yelling
and waving their arms as they gave sig-

nals above the din already the grain-
elevators and coal-barges were tilling the
dock the sun had broken through the
grayness and its rays added to the clouds
of escaping steam were melting the ice
it dropped in great chunks to the deck

  a hours time said barnes and
this meltin ice will all lie off her and
theyll ik washin down her decks same rfs
in summer

   yes said the ardmonn second with
a wry smile  and as much as three
days in port liefore she goes to sea
again bgob

  the days in port-when the steamer
disgorges itself of tlie cargo and refills
the empty bolds-are welded as it were
into one continuous day of activity it
is the time to overhaul and repair
above decks they repaint below the
water-line they overhaul engines ami
boilers i remember one day spent in
 in port



the boiler-room of tlie ardmore eight
bells sounded  the iron bar save an
electric light or two and the glare from
an open fire-box door on a half-stripped
figure shovelling coal the alleyway be-
tween one row of boilers seemed deserted
tlie bells were still striking out of the
empty fire-boxes came ash-covered men
squeezing through the furnace doors
some head foremost others feet foremost
mopping their blackened faces with the
damp towels bung around their necks
climbing up the ladder to the gratings
in the engine-room  encountered greasy
men tightening bolts and filling oil-cups
on deck sailors were sliding down from
the scaffold on the
stack and scram-
bling up over the
rail where they
had painted the
ships sides steve-
dores coats in
hand climbed
from tho holds
some with hand-
kerchiefs over
their mouths and
nostrils and pow-
dered all over
with white grain-
dust crawled from
the batch where
the wheat w a s
pouring in men
came from every-
where down rig-
ging up ladders
across gangways
from lighters all
heading for the
dock with their
dinner-pails

  the noon hour
was the only lull
ill tho task of
preparing the
steamer to meet
tho gales of the
next passage

bowsprit reaches far over the shore
overhanging the teams and freight-
cars of tlie quay it is a quiet spot
in the busy world of docks day
after day stevedores slowly stow tlie
cargo then the hatches are battened
down the crew comes aboard and the
ship departs on the next tide the harbor
tugs tow her to sea she spreads her
canvas wings the sails fill and under
this white-winged structure she drives
on her voyage adverse winds must be
overcome before the ships anchor is let
go in the port of destination

another night the atlas arrived and i
sat talking with her captain iu the eaffi

which is frequented by habitues of
tho maritime exchange with us was
the passenger who came around in the
bark from san francisco  an invalid
ordered to take a long sea-voyage the
skipper told me but added on the side
 to get him away from his dram
i think

  the passenger told of ice sighted off
the horn of fog and heavy sea en-
countered during a calm and how the
vessel uncontrolled by eitlicr sail or rud-
der rolled about like a log iio remem-
bered a sea carrying him the length of
the deck he recalled how lie turned into
his bunk and read the skippers entire
library of two books while the steward
dried his heavy clothes at the galley fire
the skipper told of not sighting sail or
smoke all the way down the west coast
not till they had put on their summer
clothes again  this side then a three-
mast french bark had signalled that
her captain was dead and wanted to
know her latitude

   that was all we sighted said the
skipper  till off hatteras an english
tramp passed us must have been him
reported us the agent told me we were
reported monday by a steamer in nor-
folk

  by and by the captain sighted in the
entering crowd of the cafti  neally o
the borderer hadnt seen him for
three years then in honolulu-would we
excuse him a minute while he ran over
to him

  you remember tlie sewellt asked
the passenger  she sailed a year ago
and after reinsurance was listed as miss-
ing in frisco they told the captain
to look for signs of wreckage about the
horn it was thought out there she
might have collided with field ice in
a fog

   well this was my first voyage in a
sailing-ship he went on and i visited
the dock every day for a couple of weeks
watching them stow the cargo the last
day the skipper and mate were fuming

a winter dav on tin wiiakvis
utiif by gftwfr hut dint

a foreign ship in port

ix rort

over tlie ships fore-and-aft trim the
stevedores sail - makers riggers and
sailors speaking for berths were all
mixed in together an old man who had
been standing about all day endeavoring
to speak to the skipper at last came over
and spoke to me some

	told him i was to sail
on the  lias

  youre goin around
on her be says i told
him yes he started
telling me that his son
was shipped on the over-
due sewell she was
listed as missing i felt
sorry for tlie old fellow
lie was very downcast

  she may have been
blown back around the
horn i told him i
really thought so myself

	seemed impossible that
a big ship like tho one we
were standing on could
lie lost we stood talk-
ing for a long time

meanwhile the crew came
aboard with their sea-
chests from the sailors
boarding-houses

   the old fellow was
brighter when he found
i agreed with him that
the ship or at least the
crew would come to port

why ik said with a
sudden burst of hope
she may have leaked and
the bags o sugar swelled
up and broken open and clogged the
pumps tis possible they rowed ashore
like the crew o the slarbuck

   i talked to him till tlie tug came
alongside to haul us out the last thing
lie asked me was to write and tell him if
we saw any sign of wreckage or the crew

   well the passenger continued  i
beard the skipper tell his agent this after-
noon that as long as there was no word
now she must ik lost with all hands-
not the slightest doubt of it in his mind

  silence fell over our table in the cafe
nnd it was several minutes before the
passenger spoke again

  ive got to write to the old man he
said  t promised to what can i say 

  tramp steamers wander wherever a
cargo offers they are fashioned with two
straight masts a single red funnel around
which the bridge and deck-houses cluster
tho pigeon-breasted bows and clumsy
hulls are scarred with rust patches

hailin from cuba

  the vallore two years seven months
out of peckersgill yard  the clyde was
bound to glasgow for overhauling she
was one of the tramps that seldom see
their home port in that time her skip-
per said she had experienced the ty-
phoons of the tropics shaved icebergs

atlantic she bad put in a chinese port
with lier cargo of cotton afire and taken
aboard the salved cargo of ease-oil of a
sister ship wrecked on a remote south
sea island macnab the captain took
command on her maiden trip before
that he was skipper of  bark came in
from a sis months voyage and a week
later was transferred by his owners to
harpers monthly magazine

mrjw

a sailors boarding-house

the vallore he was a typical deep-
water seaman lacking information on
the petty news of the local world but well
posted on such topics as air-ships and
turbine otherwise his interest was nil
iu his ship

   shes a very profitable boat he told
me never been without a charter she
was built on speculation at the shipyard
when the depression o ship-buildin was
hangin over the clyde a week after
buying she was ready for sea-with the
firms colors on the stack and her name
painted on the bow and stem then
she started out and been on the go with
little repairin ever since her losses in

this time macnab went on were lit-
tle-an anchor two life-boats and a set
o cabin dishes smashed during a kale
when she was smothered like a submarine
her crews though were enough to worry
n man sick lie said  this trip there
were sailors o a half-dozen countries
aboard anil the whole lot o firemen were
chinese theyll fine ye if any of the
heathen chinamen desert in this coun-
try he went on so the agent sends n
watchman aboard to keep an eye on them
while the ships in dock macnab
talked for a long time about crews of
lascar- and chinamen he had shipped
in times past once they fought among
themselves so much that in port lie had
them arrested and held until he was ready
to sail then he told of discussing with
tlie engineer of the clan maciver alut
the point of maritime inw involved iu the
ease of the steamer with a crew of chi-
nese lost off carolina two weeks before

  twere a question in my mind said
macnab who would be responsible if
any of the chinks got away after reaehin
shore whether it was the life-savers
for brinein em ashore the captain for
wreckin his ship or was the british
consul to be fined for not sendin em
intact out o the country to the port they
was shipped in

 macnab smiled as he recalled the
reply

  twas a ease the engineer said
 where it was easy for the skipper to add
to the list o gear lost in the wreck-so
many chinamen it was a similar case
to the man the clan maciver reported
lost overboard a day or two afore nr-
rivin why said the engineer lie
was not missed till an hour after we
reached dock when i tells the old man
he says  did any one see him go 
no sir t answered well then
the old man says with a wink that i
understood well report one chinese
fireman lost overboard in the big sea
that she poked her nose into off five-
fathom bank 

   it saved the  faclvers eaptain
added macnab with a broad grin  a
couple hundred dollar fine

  then with the time near when mac-
nab must be under way to pass the lower
slioal on the high tide-the ship was
loaded with wheat in bulk-he told me
in port

of a case on the high seas wherein he
thought to drive a canny bargain  we
was bound to philadelphia with n cargo
of iron ore and in no great hurry to get
there until the day the new tariff went
into effect lowering the duty on that
particular cargo off the hanks we ran
into a noreast gale and in the fog we
fair walked into a freighter a-wallowin
around almost rollin the funnel out o
herself and signals o distress flyin we
made her out to be an ulster-line boat
ami when she lifted her tail high enough
that she was the bangore-and finally
that she was without her propeller just
lier shaft peepin out o water

  its very convenient i said to our
first officer mr hlaek that were in 
bony supposiu you go aboard her and
find out how long shes been a-waitin us
and if she is in a grand rush on account
o the tariff stretch the point i said
that we is say  well captain this is
tough luck-im supposin youre in a
hurry on account o the tariff like we
are never let on its cheaper for us
to take our time we was three hundred
miles from st johns at the time and

i	figured that the mileage charge was one
hundred dollars per mile for towage

   the first officer made the offer per-
haps it was a bit high at any rate they
thought it was

  not havin any passengers or mail
aboard and bein bound to a canadian
port yelled her skipper  ill not agree
to such outrageous terms

    but does you understand inter-
rupted my first officer  were under or-
ders o the shipper- and there is a con-
siderable different- in customs duty on
our cargo

   this argument cooled him a bit and
might have boro fruit if out o tho fog
hadnt the whistle of a law-abidin steamer
blown-she was evidently careful o her
own safety or nearly cuttin down a fish-
erman i dont know which that whistle
was enough to take the fear out o the
bangores skipper and at the same time
a bit o the cockiness out of my first
officer there was nothin left for him
to do but make a bargain before the
other fellow came along and snaped her
up under our nose the understanding
was the settlement to be made in port-
her skipper was evidently a friend o
the lawyers

   in short order the two lines were
aboard her and we was gettin under way

a chinese cbew

agaiu i was on the bridge-lookiu tlie
tow over aud thinkin o what  liked to
do to the fellow that proved the snag in
the bargain-in the liftin fog away ahead
of us i saw what must have been the
whistle-blowin law-abidin craft would
you believe it sir macnab added with
a scowl a faint echo of his original rage
 she was a fast liner and wouldnt have
stopped to tow

  the old wharf lies slowly crumbling
the posts are eaten away with tho
chafing of many hawsers at the river
end a wind-swept scrub tree grows and
between the cobbles patches of grass
struggle a pensive air of past pros-
perity hangs about it while the throng
of busy river traffic passes on to the great
steamer docks beyond nowadays the
foreign sailing-ships lie there discharg-
ing ballast and awaiting charters in-
side the pate the old watchman dozes

away the afternoon iu a cloud of tobacco
smoke he is a bow-legged old fellow-
trousers tucked iu boots and slightly
stooped as he taps along with his cane

ii	is weather-beaten face and frowsy
lcard are capped with a faded felt hat

  here sir he says is where the
odds and ends of shipping comes they
are of all kinds-great steel ships and
weather-beaten wooden barks and imrkcn-
tines with white saints for figureheads
they hail from castellamare bremer-
haven and narvick tlie crews art- all
foreign sailors swarthy follows with red
sashes and sabots tliick-set sea-booted
men of tho north sea ports with a
sprinkling of all-nation crews

   i generally tells where they come
from says the old watchman  by the
ballast whether it be sand or pebble or
dirt another way is by the cock-
fightcrs bird-cages or flowers they have
aboard then the ships thats ever had

tiie crew coming aboard with tiieir sea-chests
the soui line

grain cargo lias tlie rats-them thats
brought bones from buenos ayres has
the worms always sorry he went on
 to see them bring a bone-ship so many
flies come along with it aboard em
fir the crews sleep covered with fly-
nettings anti they dont feed em any
better than t he pigs on a steel ship then
theres the cryolite ships that comes here
from greenland theyre nice and clean
though the mates aboard em tells me
o the strange sealskin people of ivigtut
the other day a fellow on one of the
greenland barks got a letter all covered
with postmarks that had followed him
about for over two years

 the old fellow took me into the
tumble-down store and pointed to the
list of ships that had docked in the last
year my eye fell on the ban ignacio de
loyola what was she like i asked

  oh a dirty brigantine hailin from
cuba he answered  with a skipper who
had the airs o a steamboat captain

 and what was the fooling sveyf
i questioned

   a fine four-masted bark a-flyin the
american flag she had me guessing
he said till the mate told me she was
on eastern trader owned in honolulu
and when the islands became american
she got tlie registry along with em so
we went through the list- this one a
tramp steamer held up for libel proceed-
ings that one-let me see-oh yes the

gibson was a derelict that was towed in
and sold at auction youve heard of
missing ships he said  well heres
where they start from many ships have
left this dock in my day and never
reached port on that list them with
the black line drawn around the name
is the ones that was lost after leavin
here theres the jules henry the tank
bark-she blew up in marseilles the
calcium was burned at sea em thats
got the question mark alongside are ones
 doubted if they would reach tlieir
destination they was so worn out

  looking closely i saw that the doubtful
marks and tlie black lines usually went
side by side

   the old east-indiamen lie went on
 used to dock at this wharf with spices
and tea and ships with sugar and
molasses came from the west indies
yes i remembers them all-remembers
the day when a forest o masts lined this
water-front when ships came to the
wharf under sail and the crews came
ashore from a twelvemonth voyage

  the old fellow lighted his pipe and pre-
pared to go out to his chair again his
great misshapen hand on my knee he
turned and said  theres a heap o ships
come to these docks in my day and i
often wonders who sees the most-em
at travels around or me thats stayed
here seven days a week for more than
thirty-two years

richardson hail taken his house at crad-
ley because his wife had a fancy to try
the country she was thirty pretty slim
and extremely restless in london she
ranged through innumerable sensations
until she tired of all that was how she
came to want the country people were
talking of the simple life and it sounded
well at any rate it sounded like a change
and a change was what ellice richard-
son wanted georg was wont indul-
gently to grant her most of what she
wanted lie was a novelist of repute
with a standing in literary circles and
an income not capable of indefinite ex-
pansion c rad ley in its remoteness and
its silence satisfied his needs for he had
enjoyed life iu his forty years and now
liked to stand iu the wings and look on
aslant at the performance with a perfect
knowledge of the conditions in which if
was taking place if he hail been unable
to do this he would not have been able to
write his novels sound broad-minded
wise sweet-blooded and cynical hooks like
himself with the relaxation of lifes ar-
dent claim on him he had also developed
an interest in nature other than human
he faced the wind on the lieatb with
rare pleasure lie was a spectator of the
human show but a partisan on the hills
the acrid smell of gorse upon a hot after-
noon was as perfume to his nostrils he
was part of that now rather than of big
cities and tlie whole complex and mo-
notonous social system so he found
cradley to his taste while his wife tired
of it

  ellice indeed may bo said to have
tired of it ere she gave it a proper trial
they had lied from london in the early
spring when the country exhibited to
eyes weary of the drab winter-time its
most pleasinir features daffodils nodded
in the meadows tho violets had come

ami the sweet o the year entered with
i lie primrose ellice gushed over nature
ami formed innumerable plans for the
garden for excursions for settling into
rural life-forever

   isnt it far more delightful than
noisy staring unhealthy town sbe asked
her husband in staccato adjectives and
he agreed the taxicabs-she made
a sound of despairing disapproval-the
dirt the noise she paused tho
taxis were useful she added pensively

  hut this mood of satisfaction was not
destined to endure cradley was dull
beyond question and perhaps even in-
defensibly dull george richardson nev-
er attempted to defend it against her
attacks when the first rapture had dis-
appeared spring passed into summer
and despite her full pageant summer
proved dull a beauty may be dull you
know and very often is the resplen-
dent lanes and wood and hills were dull
and then the hot flays brought the dust
and ellice missing the shops and tho
parties and the theatres and the restau-
rants and the unceasing stream of people
known and unknown declared the situa-
tion intolerable they had agreed to
forego their summer holiday partly be-
cause of the expense incurred by their
removal and partly because tho change
to cradley was to be regarded in the light
of a holiday so in the dog-days with
her heart in london ellice richardson
moped the chief source of her dis-
satisfaction was the fact that none of
the best people in the countryside had
called carfields meleombes bea-
mans bostocks and their congeners all
abstained quite unconscious of the in-
trusion of the newcomers society
straddled between religions works ami
hunting in summer there was  hunt-
ing but there were always religious
works and plenty of old maids to be
absorbed in them for the male part of
tho inhabitants hunting was the prime

the fairfax comedy

consideration and george did not hunt
lie could not have a horded to hunt even
if he had wanted to which he certainly
did not of course the vicars wife
mrs mowbray called on ellice but she
though young was prim and heavy and
yauche as well and so did not count very
much the doctors wife on the other
hand was elderly with rather a vulgar
sense of humor and so  second-rate 
that it was of no consequence to know
her she counted even less there re-
mained tlie landed gentry whose wives
were in no hurry it appeared to make
ellices acquaintance george had prof-
fered reasons out of his imagination
mainly for the purposes of consolation
nnd reassurance hut somewhat in in-
dulgence of his humor

  it is obvious they want us to be on
probation he said  you see it is an
important matter to be admitted into the
familiarity of country society

  didnt ellice know it was important
that was the very reason she was in-
dignant what did these people mean
by not rushing to make her acquaint-
ance they were merely rustics clod-
hoppers louts   

   well thank goodness they dont call
then said george with sly good humor

 theres not one of the women knows
how to dress declared ellice scorn-
fully

   not one agreed her husband survey-
ing her pleasant figure in its appro-
priate gown

 this had become the burden of their
private exchanges until even georges
placid patience showed signs of giving
of course with the selfishness of man
ik could not detach himself from his
own satisfaction

  he strolled the lawn that july after-
noon enjoying the cooling air that
streamed over the rhododendrons poised
between two incidents for a plot ho
wanted to fix his mind on one and it
persisted in dividing as did -eneass so
often he fluttered he hesitated and he
would have come down on one or the
other if he had had the chance but
fate intervened with ellice-ellice and
two

    strong good-natured clean-limbed
and empty-beaded puppy hounds which
lie had on leash ellice usually pale and
more than ever pallid lately with the heat

  voi cxxt -no  -



was flushed and breathless the pups
exploring in different directions simul-
taneously wound her round tho arch of
a pergola

  george she called for goodness
sake come and take these creatures-
these blessed dogs i wish they were-
george took one over while she dis-
entangled herself

   i believe he said mildly  tlmt
these things are called hounds and that
cradley does not forgive any one who
calls them dogs

  nonsense said ellice crossly as
the hound she still held endeavored to
make after a distant cat  there ill
let the beast go

 sparker thus manumitted darted
across the lawn and disappeared iu a
shrubbery his companion whimpering
and straining at the leash in an endeavor
to follow mrs richardson yon see had
undertaken to  walk puppies  for the
cradley pack on offer to which she had
been stimulated by the beaming friend-
liness of major weldon at the time
she had not known that the major was
a bachelor and incorrigibly catholic iu
bis acquaintances no one considered a
person merely because major weldon
knew him or her that painful discovery
was to follow the neighborhood did
not stream in after the major

  i thought i heard a voice at the
gnte said george lighting a cigarette

   oh young beaman said his wife
impatiently

   as devoted as ever he replied
lightly

  young beamon was five-and-twenty
extremely elongated in body and very
shy as yet his devotion had not brought
mr beaman or the misses beaman to
ilolt place which was another matter
that vexed ellices stricken heart

  go away-do george keep that
bea-st off she said crossly as the sec-
ond hound puppy made a sudden man-
ifestation of its affection for her by
rising on its hind legs and pawing at
her fre-h summer frock george jerked
back the beast

   whats the use of the silly fellow 
she went on reverting to young beaman
 here have i been walking puppies
ugh for four months and nothing
has happened lady carfield lady


harpers monthly magazine

melcombe the hassalls-none of them
have called

  ellice was pretty after her fashion
and her figure was nice she had a talk-
ative nature and could sustain a con-
versation with spirit-but humor bad
been denied to her george richardsons
eyes ruffled up in a twinkle

   it is pretty bad of them he declared
as they began to walk toward the house
 ive a good mind to send in a bill for
puppy-biscuits to lord carfield and so
bring his wife to reason

   oh if youre going to be sarcastic-
protested ellice hotly

  george disclaimed any intention of
sarcasm he had noticed that his wife
was constitutionally unable to distin-
guish between sarcasm and humor-
levity if you will but he was conscious
that he was properly rebuked for treating
the matter with levity it was an occa-
sion for serious discussion he got rid
of the dog-hound that is-and followed
ellice to the drawing-room she had
divested herself of her hat but still had
tho effect he thought of sitting at her
own tea table like a visitor she opened
on him without ceremony  i cant
stand it george we must go

  this was tlie ultimatum and it filled
him with misgivings in his minds eye
he saw ellice as was her wont mounting
from stage to stage of emotional revolt
against her circumstances and he was
dismayed his means were limited and
he was in the middle of a novel besides
the place did suit him he pondered
perhaps it was selfish of him to look at
it in that way but after all it had
been ellices idea and he had offered
resistance of a sort at any rate criticism
she was rattling on apparently incensed
at his silence

   its all very well for you you have
your work and you enjoy talking to the
villagers i dont i am accustomed to
something better this is stagnation i
feel the mould growing over me its no
good i cant stand it

   theres mrs blenkinsop murmured
george weakly and old weldon isnt
bad and-

  he had invited the thunder and he got
it mrs blenkinsop was third-rate
old weldon was of no account  its
the second-rates i know-not one of the

people who really matter not one she
pronounced with embittered emphasis

  young beaman- george would
have begun but was snapped up

   beaman  where are the beamans i
she demanded in ringing accents of scorn
and a connection making in her fretted
brain she turned upon him again of
course it might have been different if
i knew how to ride if you had only
had lessons for me when you knew that
we were coming into this wilderness

  george richardson discovered it was
time to act if this went on the flood
would carry him away he pulled him-
self together and faced the situation
boldly he put his teacup down and
crossed his legs

   we give hostages to fortune when we
abandon town i warned you of that
he said you are good enough to con-
sider me a very clever fellow my dear
and i am disposed to agree with you
but it is a mistake to suppose that clever-
ness counts much in life

   what counts  she asked

  various things-money position ad-
vertisement but not cleverness you told
me that you thought my book illusion
was the most brilliant novel you had read
for years you have an admirable lit-
erary taste dear now if you were to
go up to cradley park to lord garfields
house-party assembled this coming sep-
tember for partridge shooting you would
find ears blank to illusion and my very
name possibly you might catch some
ones attention richardson lives
here is that the writin chap no i
never read any but i believe my sister
read one once but mind you that
would be an extra well-informed guest
theyre not interested in me or what i
do they buy my books if they buy them
at all as they buy groceries you dont
call on your grocer

   its all shameful declared ellice
simmering

   what i do obviously doesnt count
books are produced and so are guns and
motor-cars they couldnt produce any
one of these why should they consider
the person who produces books for them
to buy as more important than the per
sons who produce guns or motor-cars
in fact the man who makes their guns i
more important than such as i he does
the fairfax comedy



count theyll know his name and have
a respect for him

  then why did you bring me here
demanded ellice tragically  we must
leave at once

  at this moment the maid announced
mrs mowbray the vicars wife who ap-
proached slowly in all the righteous
resignation of her dull and sober raiment
ellices face showed a perfunctory wel-
come but george bustled about in a way
which was alien to his usual large de-
liberation he proffered a chair a cup
of tea and a plate of cake

  you must try this-buzzards you
know he explained in a delicately in-
timate way ellice was silent wondering
the vicars wife uneasily eating buz-
zards broached the object of her visit
with characteristic tactlessness it might
have eased poor ellices raw wounds had
even this dull lady come for social ameni-
ties but she had not munching a
buzzard delicacy which she had not even
the wit or savoir faire to commend she
unlimbered her ordnance

  mrs richardson must have noticed the
state of the liells no ellice was flat
she had not recovered herself but mr
richardson had he professed waiting
anxiously to know what their condition
might be they were badly hung it
seemed and there were defects in two
hadnt mr richardson she appealed to
him now noticed the tenor of course
mr richardson had that seemed to
make it easier for the vicaress well
the vicar was anxious to restore the bells
in accordance with the dignity of the
church and its traditions lord carfield
had been approached and was in cordial
agreement-in fact it need be no secret
that his lordship was heading the sub-
scription with twenty guineas the total
cost would be about two hundred pounds
staid mrs mowbray was shrewd and
business-like if dull she invitingly
eyed george richardson beaming over
tails which he hated

   of course i am willing to help with
mite be declared choosing the word
oute as most seripturally suitable for the
ady  but my dear mrs mowbray it
h take some trouble to raise that sum
 these hard times

  tho vicaress sighed unconsciously for
had she not debated this very point with

her husband ere setting out on her beg-
ging round

   the richardsons ought to give five
pounds he had said  i believe novel-
ists are well paid and mrs richardson
comes regularly to church

  yet it would take to be precise forty
five-pound notes or checks to make up
 mrs mowbrays sigh was an in-
voluntary testimony to her discourage-
ment ellice eyed her hardly realiz-
ing now that this was no social call
but merely an official stand-and-deliver
to her intense amazement george went
on genially

   i think i may be of help to you
there if you will allow me we might
arrange for a dramatic performance or
something in that line

  mrs mowbray looked doubtful  yes
she assented her mind adding up the
various attractions and accomplishments
of the parishioners  captain hassall
acts and there are the melcombe girls
she suggested still doubtfully  i think
they acted somewhere in private theat-
ricals last year

  ellices attention tautened georges
idea was good after all clever men liad
their uses  she overlooked in her ap-
proval the scrawny bodies of the mel-
combe girls recognized and bitterly
criticised from church pews

   yes georges assent this time was
doubtful  i hardly designed a local af-
fair i was thinking i might assist you
in another way i might get miss es-
telle fairfax

  miss fairfax mrs mowbray woke
up deserting parish and bells and the nar-
row confines of cradley  you mean
miss fairfax the actress

  her mind flashed over leagues of wil-
derness to rare nights at the euphrosyne
nights of enjoyment nights of stolen
pleasures in a round of dull duty nights
touched with as nearly delirious romance
as placid natures are capable of she
saw george richardsons nod  yes

  in that instant also ellices heart
homed and she was in a taxi wrapped
about with fluffy things on her way to
the euphrosyne piccadilly roared and
surged about her in the summer twilight
she remembered the block at hvde park
comer the imperturbable police   
constitution tiill    the soft murk of
harpers monthly magazine

the rain    darkness and the lights of
the street but what was this strange
business of george and estelle fairfax

   it would be desirable of course that
it should be educational proceeded her
husband leaning back in his chair with
a leisurely and indulgent smile was
it possible that be saw mrs mowbrays
face drop and change at that estimable
and ugly word 

   of course she murmured

  what in the name of conscience and
goodness did george mean 

   do you think for example lord gar-
field would lend his grounds for a pas-
toral play

 oh mrs mowbray brightened
 im sure he would hes always so
anxious to help but what-

  i had an idea of at you like it
suggested george offhand and as though
appealing to her judgment

  mrs mowbray only remembered shake-
speare dimly but the name of the play
sounded nice

   the forests you know the healthy
open life of the woods the exiled dukes
court pretty girls and all the pomp
of romance

  the drab little vicaress moribund be-
fore her time brightened anew her face
was flecked with color and she smiled
 that would be nice she said still
restricted as to the adjective it is not
only in conduct that one must be nice
but in attributes also meanwhile under-
standing went up in a flare through
fllice richardsons soul oh how clever
was george clever people always were
the best

   i think it would be simply splendid
the declared

   i should hazard at a guess that you
could raise fifty pounds easily by that
means said george reflectively adding
after a moments punctuation  of course
miss fairfax would make no charge
she would come at my invitation

   how very kind of you said the
vicaress kind was kin to nice  im
sure lord carfield will give his consent
 it should be great fun speculated
the plotter  miss fairfax of course
as rosalind have you seen her shes
amazing

   no-o mrs mawbrays negative was
a diminuendo expressive of regret

   the miss melcombes captain ilas-
sall lady carfield i dare say    but
miss fairfax could leave that to lady
carfield and yourself

  so did the official visitation merge
strangely into a pleasant social affair
at which wonderfully mundane things
were discussed george richardson you
see alarmed and active was now in com-
mand with all the advantages of a lively
healthy and unscrupulous imagination
the instant result was an improvement
in the domestic atmosphere with an
admiration of georges literary gifts
his wife had combined an undervalua-
tion of his tact-or tactics if you will
she now perceived him to be a general
of resource

   but can you get estelle fairfax to
come she had asked that evening when
the most alluring aspects of the proposal
lind been canvassed he looked at her
a little quizzically

   you know i knew her he said after
a pause

   yes but i didnt know you had known
her so well as that was ellices remark

   i used to see a good deal of her when
clayton was alive lie said

  his quizzical look altered as he re-
garded her but there was no signal of
jealousy or even of suspicion in her at-
titude indeed there was if she should
know all no reason why there should be
later in tlie evening when his wife was
in bed richardson made a draft of the
letter which he sent the next day to
estelle fairfax running thus

  deak polly - perhaps you havent
forgotten me some eight years since
you vowed that you owed me something
can you pay it now or is it barred by
the statute of limitations it is pro-
posed that a pastoral play as you like
it shall be produced in lord garfields
park here if you could take the part
of rosalind i should feel you had more
than discharged your debt the affair
is i believe to buy bells or something
of the kind for a church you know
im married

        yours sincerely

george richardson

  when lie had finished he sat back with
the aroma of a particularly nice cigar

tiie fairfax comedy



lingering on his palate he pushed aside
the table contemplated tlie bookcase and
pursed his lips unconsciously he was
reviewing phases of polly fairfaxs life
clayton a composer of genius had not
been the first to intervene in that life
he bad come third he thought but
clayton his friend had taken the dis-
ease with rampant passion at once he
tyrannized and adored and polly was
so friendly so amusing so good-natured
and so natural that it was impossible to
dislike her or to bear a grudge against
her after all clayton was foredoomed
by his own qualities he failed as a
man because be was a genius often
it is so was it pollys fault that she
could not give him only what and all
that he wanted she was always frank
ns frank as good-natured and on the
whole pretty reasonable the only ex-
planation of her was that she had an
individual code of morals george had
thought the connection would be better
cut and when polly cut it had
helped her clayton stormed denied him
forgave him thanked him and died as
will be remembered somewhat tragical-
ly why should he condemn or even
judge polly fairfax who had since float-
ed into conspicuous fame was the
woman of samaria condemned before
the thought of whom after all polly
would or ought to blush with one
passing mental glance at a newspaper
paragraph he had lately seen respecting
miss estelle fairfax and the famous
actor graham gordon george richard-
son gave up the problem and went to bed

  pollys answer came after a delay of
two days

 my dear quixote-i dare say youve
grown stouter but then you were always
too thin yes ill come write it off
that ledger i was going to harrogate
early in august but fll come to you if
youll name tlie day is she pretty

polly

  this letter opportunely arrived an hour
or two before mrs mowbrays excited
visit gone now was every vestige of
the official manner tlie sallow face
quickened over the emotional storm be-
low lady carfield was delighted at the
idea if miss estelle fairfax could be
secured  and we look upon you to ar-

range that interjected the vicaress
lord carfield would willingly give his
park- the wild garden explained the
lady-for the performance and lady
carfield and she had already gone into
the question of the actors and actresses
lady carfield thought that miss mel-
combe might play audrey but she mrs
mowbray thought that the part of celia
ought to be entrusted to lady carfield
from the conversation it was evident that
the two ladies had been resuming ac-
quaintance with shakespeare and the
forest of arden ellice having the news
of miss fairfaxs consent was now the
conduit of its conveyance and mrs mow-
bray and she exchanged and interchanged
views george had started the engine
he deserved his comfortable pipe

  meanwhile up in cradley park it is
permissible to overhear a conversation
which has already taken place lady
carfield a fluffy flighty thing carries
tho news to her husband blond and forty-
odd with great white teeth and his roots
in solid duties and practical pleasures

   mrs mowbray wants to know if we
will lend the place for a pastoral play
his lordship grunts  you see dear
theyre going to get estelle fairfax

   what cries his lordship  mrs
mowbray

   no its some one-those people we
heard had taken holt place he writes
doesnt he so was george richard-
sons prophecy vindicated   harrison 
no richardson lady carfield amended
her guess

 oh lord carfield as became a
very substantial british person contem-
plated he had once met estelle fairfax
at tin house of the home secretary whose
wife was  smart and wrote bad plays
he remembered her then as enlivening
and he had always admired her acting
and her figure

  if shell come by all means better
write and ask her down said his lord-
ship

  that was ellice richardsons first
triumph and it was what made her
realize to the full the beauty of georges
mancpuvre for miss fairfax appealed
to in one of lady carfields scented
sheets of note-paper excused herself on
the ground that she was to stay with
mr and mrs richardson polly fair-


harpers monthly magazine

fax dropped this item into a hasty letter
fixing- her date and ellice glowed next
day it also dribbled down from carfield
towers through mrs mowbray that is
airs mowbray did not know that the
countess had invited miss fairfax but
she heard from the countess that miss
fairfax was to stay with tho richardsons
it was certain now that the carfields
knew of the existence of the richardsons
indeed it was no longer possible for any
one in the neighborhood to profess ig-
norance now the idea of the pastoral
play had set the heather afire in an
expiring season it had aroused enthu-
siasm captain ilassall the mclcombe
girls and lady carfield were in constant
communication with one another they
had decided the precise theatre for the
occasion in a little glade a clearing em-
bowered in rising heights of wood as it
were the upper cloths of a stage ellice
receiving news of this state of commotion
withered it seemed that she had counted
her chickens too soon it was not until
estelle fairfax arrived that a restitution
of tho balance took place

  mrs richardson accompanied estelle
fairfax to cradley park on a broiling
afternoon  i thought wed better get
to close quarters at once lady carfield
said the actress  so i got mrs richard-
son to bring me up

  lady carfield acknowledged ellice with
an amiable smile  we have been doing
ever so much she declared eagerly
 but we do want your assistance im
so glad youve come at last

  polly fairfax took off her gloves dis-
covering pretty hands that were ringless
ellice mechanically noting this was
vaguely disturbed by tho recollection of
a newspaper paragraph some years back
mentioning miss fairfaxs marriage at
a registrars office this popular lady
was bright of face instinct with vitality
of an exceedingly shapely form and
possessed a most divine smile she was
somewhere about six-and-thirty

   now tell mo exactly she commanded
lady carfield she threw herself into
the breach like a regiment inspected the
glade and approved it suggested a few
alterations in the cast solved the ques-
tion of costume that had been so baffling
with a graceful gesture of her hand

   dont bother t can fix that bur-

bage will send me his wardrobe from the
royal it cost a mint of money i
played rosalind there you know

  of course lady carfield knew had
she not seen miss fairfax in tho part
she flew into fresh excitement discussed 
questions with zest and claspcd ellice
richardsons hand warmly in parting

  youll come to lunch and well go
into it all to-morrow ill get some of
them here she called out ecstatically

 mrs richardson bring her to lunch
never had ellice been so fluttered as
by this display of friendliness the
lunch succeeded miss fairfax remem-
bered the occasion when she bad met lord
carfield and reminded him of a wit-
ticism he had let fall his lordship
smiled and bridled he was even sub-
missive in hearing that he had been set
down for tlie duke

   ive never acted im as stiff as a
prop but if you want me-

  they did  such a lark lw polly fair-
fax confided jnnder the rose that night
to george richardson  it will be the
funniest pastoral i ever played in
heaven send us fine weather so as not
to put the comedy out theres carfield
himself a veritable duke lady carfield
as celia ye gods a colorless blonde who
would like to dare and pretends she
knows things and would shy at a mans
shadow on the foot-path there was a
girl-sir james some ones daughter-

   meleomlie suggested george

   that was it-with a walk like a milk-
maid and bony hands shes to play
phoebe and it goes to my heart i cant
east her for the wench audrey it seems
shes tho best lady rider to hounds in
these parts save my waist-line i should
think so but tho girl who takes au-
drey-it doesnt matter what her name is
-is rather pretty in a rustic way-coll
-no-cork-oh it doesnt signify

   my dear polly said the author
in a rustic way dont you know that
this young lady is probably from your
description the hon helen colelougb
of one of our oldest families and herself
an heiress of weight 

  is she said polly fairfax and
then clearly without heeding burst into
laughter oh i forgot my warm ad-
mirer captain ilassall as well leave
out ilamlet as that orlando
the fairfax comedy



 george reflected  i believe ive
heard ellice speak of him he is a
sporting man with a sporting wife

   his wife is as plain as a pikestaff
but has a wonderful figure hassalts a
beauty one of tho real lady-killers im
his new victim

  on this occasion you understand el-
lice had retired the day had been one
glow of satisfaction and she had retired
happy felix opporlunifate somni the
melcombe girls had been civil and mrs
hassall tolerant lady carfield had been
cordial meeting her as though old friends
met and miss colclougli had been ami-
able and interested she was a distinct-
ly pleasant and unaffected girl and that
had pleased ellice almost more than any-
thing she had almost forgotten such
people as major weldon and the blenkin-
sops and alas she had quite forgotten
that source and fount of her present in-
toxication mrs mowbray

 tho rehearsals in tho park were an
amazing success if the entertainment of
the performers be considered miss fair-
fax inspired them with life blew into
them the breath of enthusiasm her very
appearance on the scene infused sparkle
into it she amused herself captain
hassall trailed after her the model of
don juan under the very range of his
wifes hard eyes he cooed in corners
arranged her flounces thrilled when she
set a careless hand on his arm he
strutted like a bantam on the road to con-
quest polly fairfax was as she always
was off the stage no actress but herself
her wilful frank selfish good-natured
and unpretentious self in her dainty
forest costume at the dress rehearsal she
cannoned into the dignified sir james
melcombe and first shocked and then
charmed him by exclaiming in a merry
mood my dear man where did i hit
you let me rub the place do

  in a word polly fairfax was natural
to the top of her bent and every one
knows in these days that individuality is
the only thing that counts whether you
be criminal or apostle if your individ-
uality be invented for you by the public
press so much the more to your advan-
tage but it is only accidents of birth
wealth or favor of the gods that accom-
plish this was there ever a wiser sum-
mary of human affairs than that saying

  some men are horn great some
achieve greatness and others have great-
ness thrust upon them

  lord carfield was born great and he
played the exiled duke quite handsome-
ly for the part of jacques was found
that elegant and promising member of
parliament silvester merrill who has
written a book of essays and a book of
verses and will some day rise to the
surface of his party and be in the gov-
ernment he cut a very pretty figure
and aroused sore feeling in the heart of
orlando lord arthur vallings who
had the soul of a music - hall won
comique played touchstone with gusto
but touchstoue much edited it was
between lord arthur and miss fairfax
that the play began to  go at the
dress rehearsal everybody played up mag-
nificently ellice in a pretty summer
gown was installed among the privileged
spectators to one side of her mrs bea-
man on the other lady melcombe
george richardson who for tlie first time
visited the scene on the express invita-
tion of lady carfield wandered about
examining people and effects with a
critical eye it was he who marked the
flash in mrs hassalls eye when orlando
cried out with an overplus of emotion

   what passion hangs these weights
upon my tongue

  as a matter of fact it was just that
which stirred mrs hassalls tongue to
action she was married to a good-
looking man and had long been aware of
it if she realized that miss fairfax
found his attentions tiresome at last and
much preferred lord arthurs frank vul-
garity it made no difference she began
feminine operations at ten oclock that
night when miss fairfax and her hostess
had retreated after a merry and un-
methodical meal to the shelter of holt
place she shot her remarks with the
blunt acidity of her temperament into
the general company- firing into the
brown so to speak no men were pres-
ent the occasion being strictly feline

   i wonder what became of miss fair-
faxs last husband fs

  lady carfield stared  which  she
asked vaguely

   i dont know his number the actor
wasnt it whom she married two or three
years ago one never hears of him now


harpers monthly magazine

   perhaps hes dead suggested lady
carfield who sow no particular point of
interest in the problem the men were
playing billiards or smoking

   is the other one dead-the musician
 you know inquired mrs hassall with
 deadly equanimity

  what other one what do you
mean  retorted lady carfield

   of course colonel le maille doesnt
 count pursued mrs hassall recrossing
 her legs deliberately

   whos colonel le maille asked
lady melcombe

  probably mrs hassall welcomed a
visible target  oh the man in the
guards dont you remember she said
turning slightly toward her interlocutor
 ho was afterword concerned in that
filibustering raid

  lady melcombe was of an age to re-
member and had tolerant notions she
was the nearest approach to the grande
dame cradley could produce

   of course she assented  he was
vastly epris wasnt he

  poor mrs le maille breathed mrs
hassall

  the attention of the girls in the room
 was obvious mrs mowbray listened
 alert anxious and instant

   i believe miss fairfax was first mar-
 ried at eighteen said mrs hassall at
 field work

   yes what a shame said lady car-
field  i dont wonder poor thing-

  mrs hassall hadnt expected or want-
 ed this

   clayton was supposed to be the man
she really cared for she interrupted
 you remember claytons tragic death 

  she fastened her glance on lady car-
 field who moved uneasily

   thats all ancient history she said

  clayton was a genius remarked
lady melcombe lord winterborough
told me that estelle fairfax inspired
him with his second symphony

   she left him declared mrs nas-
sall defiantly

  my dear you cant judge people like
 that demurred lady carfield

   nothing was ever proved protested
 mrs beaman

  codes you see are different said
 lady carfield vaguely

   she goes everywhere remarked the

grande dame the girls showed increas-
ing interest and mrs mowbray looked
from one speaker to another mrs has-
salls desperate hard eye alighted on her
and invited her in

  what do you think mrs mowbray
i- she hesitated oh i think
lady carfields right of course wo are
told not to judge

  it was mrs hassalls last gamble with
the dice she had failed and recognized
it she rose the fineness of her figure
emphasizing her plain face and unsym-
pathetic eyes  i dont mind myself
im quite broad-minded said she  but
where there are young people about-
her gaze swept over the three girls and
she didnt finish in fact she went out
on that

   what on earth did she mean with
all that inquired miss colclough
wrinkling her brows in a puzzled way
 what has miss fairfax-

   oh its all rubbish said lady car-
field hastily and so the privateering
ended

  at the actual performance ellice and
george occupied seats of honor between
the meleoinbes and the beamans bob
in attendance and the old maids of the
district devoted to church and good
works sat in state in order to do honor
to shakespeare and augment the bell
fund the yiear was present officially
certifying as it were an atmosphere of
sanctity and mrs mowbray renewed the
stolen joys of liberty and worldliness

  i have enjoyed myself but its reach-
ed a limit murmured polly fairfax in
georges ear after the play  hassall has
become an emphatic nuisance he ought
to know there are hundreds of him hang-
ing about any theatre but your lord
arthurs a dear

  george disclaimed any proprietary
rights in lord arthur but she paid no
heed lord arthur called for her with
his car next morning and she departed
as informally as she had come

   hes going to drive me up to town
she imparted to george  kiss your petsy
for me she quite passes ive got to meet
rayner to-night before i go to itorn-
burg no my dear man i enjoyed it 
she took her seat just as ellice hur-
ried up and waved gayly to both lord
arthur was most friendly and the last

they saw of tho pair consisted of laugh-
ing exchanges as the ear whizzed down
the road ellice sighed as at the end
of a pleasant dream george was looking
quizzically in tlie direction in which the
ear had vanished lord arthur

  but after all he had nothing of which
to complain sir james melcombe told
his wife that stately lady that that chap
richardson was not at all a bad chap
he knew how to cast a fly with any one
miss coldougli had admired ellices
gown and said so frankly all this was
vary satisfactory but the little comedy
did not fizzle out quite so tamely we
may set its conclusion that same eve-
uing in the afternoon ellice in tailor-
made costume disappeared and returned
only an hour before dinner coming upon
her husband as he sat at work

  george isnt it great  bob beaman
is going to teach me to ride and mr
beaman is lending me a horse

 ho looked up indulgently  my dear
i knew you only had to get to quarters
with them all

 but later that night he was free to

revolve the episode in his mind and
the thought that framed itself at last
was this

   to think of polly fairfax pulling us
through the needles eye

  he giggled aloud and bis wife asked
him why he laughed

   oh said lie fumblingly  i was
thinking of something lord carfield
said

   what was that she persisted as the
maid brought in the evening post sho
opened the letters

   it was he said slowly and carefully
to the effect that in the matter of a
genius things dont count

   well of course they dont said el-
lice abstractedly as she read her letter
 george dear lady melcombe has writ-
ten asking us to dinner on the tli
we shall be able to manage that shant
we she asked calmly

   ril look up my engagements hut i
think so he said his eyes twinkling

   of course said ellice complacently
after a tiny pause country society is
more exclusive than town and smarter

          the bitter thing

       by margaret root garvin

            ts hard my heart for toiling through
            this land-of-lonelv-things

            no league were long could she be nigh

            to share thy wanderings

            yet wonldst thou have her here-footsore-
            who hath the wont of wings

             so long thy shelter was her love

             tis bleak and sore to lie
             the buffet of unkindly winds

             yet though tliey beat on thee

            give thanks my heart that sho is cloaked
            from all inclemency

            but when through fairer valley-ways
            sometimes thy paths deploy

            some rainbow eomes to span tho storm
            some sweet too rare to cloy

            then weep heart for this bitter thing-
            unshared with her thy joy

b y c a l vin johns ton

witii my arms stretched out i
was pritty near as wide as
devils lane which rail be-
tween old darrows farm and our own
and by standin in the middle of it
could have touched the rough stone walls
on both sides

  but i hadnt lost anything in such a
place where you git thistles in your feet
and burs in your hair and your dress
was tore every time you thought some-
thin was ereepin up

  id made up my mind not to tear my
dress any more that day so i walked on
top of our own rickety spite wall which
granpa had built jist to keep old dar-
row from havin tlie highest one on the
opposite side o the lane these walls
had been put up when theyd quarrelled
and gone to law over that long crooked
strip o land before i was born i spoke
politely to the old imp liidin in the
bushes for on this mornin i was goin
down to keep an inimy from passin nloug
the turnpike and needed him to back me
up then the weeds stirred so that t fell
off the wall and tore my dress anyhow

  there was no use feelin sorry when i
couldnt tell which tear it was so t went
on to tlie foot o the lane where soon i
could hear the clang of big iron hoofs
strikin the flinty places it was my
inimy coinin and he was one worth hav-
in bein always mad though whether
folks said he ate fire or only spit it i
forget now

  gallopin up to the lane he swung off
his big black charger and tlirowin the
bridle over his arm started to walk past
our place lookin neither right ner left

  stan there i said peepin through
 cranny in the wall  frien or inimy

  lie frowned and answered frien
but i knew better

   whats the byword  i asked

  he thought a minute and then seein
my tousled head over the top o the wall
said  sally moore is the word

 no my name was good only for
yistiday i told him  youre an
inimy

  he led the charger close up and lookin
down at me with his black eyes and hard
lean face laid on the wall a red apple
from his own blue-grass farm

   whats the word  he asked knowin
i wouldnt let him by till he had it

  inimies i answered you can pass
on now and callin out  inimies he
jumped on the black horse which reared
almos straight up with him then he
galloped away without another word for
he was on old harrows side o the feud
over devils lane so we couldnt talk
together and it wouldnt have been lion-
erble to take a apple from him except
as a bribe

  when i went back to tlie house munch-
in the apple i found granpa standin by
the- barn where we used to keep horses
a cow and the goat before we went
on the ragged edge then they wouldnt
keep any longer except the goat who was
waitin for somethin to turn up and was
now on the raggedest edge of any of us

  granpa stopped pickin at some old
rusty ploughs and harrows which lay on
the ground like animal skeletons with
their claws broke from tryin to scratch
in our old farm and said he must go
to court the devils lane case was
up agin

  so after while though the road was
dusty he put on his best coat instead of
the other one which would have left the
window open and i started with him to
rest my feet along the road after walkin
on our farm

  it wasnt far into town and we were
soon at the court-house where a crowd
o men were standin with their horses
hitched to the racks some of em drew
up to us and when old darrow came in-
walkin as wed done others gathered
around him and the two parties stood
eyin each other and grumblin every
enemies



once in a while then the crier opened
court and everybody pushed each oth-
er inside

  granpa stood talkin to the lawyer
who sometimes came out to the house to
see how much we had left and old dar-
row was five or six paces away i heard
their names called there was a mutter
about devils lane and then everything
was so very still that the squirrels be-
jjnn scoldin in tho trees o the court-
house yard

  all at once granpa cried out in a loud
voice to the whisperin of his lawyer
ill have my rights nothin less
have t carried this case up and down the
courts twenty years to give up to that
man now

  he took two quick steps toward har-
row draggin me after him and his
frien big major felix was bellin his
shoulder never well have justice
here he bellowed

  several men pressed up to harrow the
first one bein my inimy who raised his
hand high in the air

  youll get justice felix lie said
and he did spit fire out of his eyes
whenever you like mr danton

  my heart beat quick at their strange
loud voices and i thought how lean and
crooked and weak the two old men looked
in that ring o big fierce-eyed fellows
hut they were not in the least afraid
nnd straightened up to stare at each other

   therell be no breach in my side o
devils lane said my granfatlier  to
the last ditch against you sir

   to the grave answered old darrow
and their faded-out eyes flashed new
and bright

 i saw major felix and my inimy
danton push back the crowd their faee
changed to somethin black and wicked
and afraid of bein trampled down to the
floor i stepped into the only clear sjace
it happened to ik right between em and
both men stared at me as if surprised
then after standin silent a minute they
passed outside with their friens and soon
i could hear em all ridin their horses
t o town

  when we two walked home i thought
ttranpa stumbled a good deal and he
was tremblin too which was somethin
be never did when his inimy darrow was
i sight at home lie sat all afternoon

in the sunshine of the porch with the
dust still coverin his face till i wiped
it away with a cloth then he smiled
at me and said

   i reckon that lawyer will sell us up
now he wants me to drop the case just
because i havent any more money but
well fight  against harrow someway
wont we sally

  i nodded  to the grave i told
him  didnt you all used to be friens
i asked then

  granpa took his band off my hair and
scowled  dont ever sjieak o that
agin be said and goin down into the
field he put whatever rocks lie could lift
on top of his spite wall to make it still
higher than darrows

  that evenin after supper granpa lit
the lantern and took me to the top o
the stairs cause i might as well have
tlie compny o the light when it had
to burn anyway he sat on the top
step till i called  im almos asleep
now then he went down soft-footed
with the lantern

  but i couldnt sleep and lay listenin
to the wind whir under the old eurled-up
shingles and to granpa who sometimes
muttered down-stairs to dead and gone
folks that came back like moths to his
lantern i was thinkin of bein sold up
which hed ixplained meant that a auc-
tioneer would come to shout that our
things wasnt worth much and that
strangers would take em in and lie un-
der the curled-up shingles at night stead
o him and me

   still we got sicb a little bit we can
afford to lose at least all of it and fight
old darrow to tlie grave i thought

  tlien i got out o bed and felt my way
about touchin everything in the dark
for id leen playin with my outfit a good
while and thought id rather tell em
good-by when i couldnt look on o
course i was goin to send the things
motherd left behind to me and my own
playthings under the hammer with the
rest all we needed was money and i
knew my inimy would be glad to bid me
out of em

  nex mornin t tied up my hair with
a red ribbon which looks bright against
coal black and movin out o house
and home loaded my belongins in my
waggin once fd had all this waggin
s

harpers monthly magazine

but now there wasnt any tongue to speak
of and the wheels had to stump along
on spokes i hitched the goat to it with
strings and led him to the turnpike
when my inimy came along without
the byword i said  you cant go
chargin past here like that

   whats the word  he asked

   sold up i told him he looked sur-
prised and we spoke another word for
the first time

   where did you hear that 

  i told him and then ixplained that i
was goin to hold my auction first
 here they all are i said showin him
the things  anybody can buy em
though o course id rather see a inimy
take em away

  after a minute he raised his horse right
over our wall and looked at my outfit
then he swept his eye along devils lane
and with a sudden scowl rode quickly
half-way up the hill which rose between
us ami the house slowly he looked from
old darrows farm to ours thinkin how
pore they were liesides his own blue-grass
place up the valley and walkin his horse
back and forth

  id been so surprised at his doin this
that for a minute i couldnt move then
i ran toward him and stood in front of
the horse with my arms stretched out
its a bad sign to have a inimy nosin
around your place whether theres any-
thing there for him to find out or not

   do you dare jump your horse over
our wall this is no friens place for
you t told him

 without a word he rode down the
hill with me walkin beside him id
taken the apple hed paid to get past
but now i wouldnt keep it for hed
come into our place only because nobody
but me was there for him to ride over
i couldnt throw the apple down-he was-
nt that kind of inimy-so i put it back
on the wall

   there i went on as he didnt an-
swer you can take some other road
after this

  tie was always hard and black-lookin
but now he seemed like a picture in my
old war book with a cloud o fightin
armies and sword blades whirlin around
him he looked at me steadily  this
old quarrels lined up at last he said
as if to himself

  that hard stare made me believe he
was despisin me for my bare feet and
best dress i wasnt ashamed of em but
i remember the tears came into my eyes i
 if major felix was here you would-
nt dare come into our place i said

  he answered quickly tell him to
meet me here to-morrow mornin-you
must have two people to bid at a auc- 
tion-and tell nobody else will you
promise this

   yes i said for i could catch a ride
on a waggin up to major felixs farm
he took another sneer at my things at
the apple on the wall and then at me

   youre a good inimy like all the
moores were before you he said tlien
takin his horse over the wall he galloped
back the way hed come for id made it
plain that he couldnt go past our place
any more

  on the first waggin which went by 
rode up to major felixs and told him
where he could meet danton next day i
lie seemed puzzled for a minute and
then he asked

  did danton send you to me with j
this

  i answered that we were goin to have
a auction and that danton was cornin
to bid in the things as an inimy the
major gritted his teeth

   i heard about your misfortune to- 
day for the first time he said  and if
danton dont show more judgment than
to go there hes liable to git somethin
he dont bid for

  when i readied home i found a man
who had ridden out from town to leave
some papers after hed gone granpa
said i reckon all this will go on the
block now heres the notice but well j
have that devils lane yet or know the
reason why

  o course he and i didnt mind leavin
that old bramble patch of a farm and
we didnt hide this from each other o
bit what we did want was devils lane
and we was goin to have it but after 
while i noticed that granpa was walkin
around touchin things just as i had
done-he seemed to be doin it iu the
dark too-and cornin on me suddenly
he raised his hand and peered into n
face in a blind kind o way i was afraid
he was goin to touch me good-by and
leave me behin with the other wore-ouj
enemies

s

things but lie saw which one of em i
was in time and asked as if just re-
minded of it

   how many dresses you got sally

   the best one i answered  the good
one and the better one are wore out
i think

  is there anything you want

  i believe i had thought o some little
thing and o course i might have asked
good old granpa for anything in the
worl but i looked at him a while and
couldnt remember just what it was id
wanted at that minute

  he said youre a good frien thats
what you are and passed 

 three or four time that afternoon
i went down to look at the apple  the
wall and onee i sat down in the dust
gatherin my knees in my arms and rock-
in to and fro i happened to think too
o that red ribbon which nobody else had
done this would make anybody feel
terrible forlorn and when billy seemed
catchin it from me i drove him behind
the bam with a stick where granpa
couldnt see him

  this aint any time for your jaw
to hang i told him well git devils
tdme anyway wont we even if this old
farm does go on a block and i was
pretty near givin him somethin to look
sorry for with the kick

 then i got all my outfit around me
which i couldnt do after to-morrow any
more and when the furniture was full
 company which used to come there in
mothers old times i entertained em
as they eouldnt get out o their places
without disappearin i had to pass the
table around among em

 after i was sure the party had gone
off well enough i walked in to supper
where granpa and i didnt have much
to say for words broke in two in tlie
middle the lantern flickered in a sickly
wnv and swarms o silent inimies seemed
creepin into the house till the rickety
tairs and floors groaned under em

  i lay awake in my room after granpa
bad gone down-stairs with the light and
pondered that inimies came hauntin like
bhts and whether red did look so very
weh against coal-black hair then
though it was so dark i could see that
nan danton ridin up and down our field
 the sun and glarin across the walls

o devils lane id been in trouble over
this all afternoon in an uncertain way
but here deep in the night i began to
understan the look in his fiery spyin
eyes hed been huntin a secret

  i crept out o bed and down the stairs
to granpas room there he stopped
walkin back and forth to stare at me
and he held the lantern up close for in
that dim light i was as dingy as the
other ghosts

    if i was you i wouldnt mutter any
to-night i told him

  he leaned forward to look into my
face  what is it  he whispered as
if id come walkin in my sleep and
he was afraid of wakin me before i
could answer

   danton rode his horse up and down
our field and spied across devils lane
this mornin

  he twisted his lean hands together and
thought then foldin his arm around
my shoulder granpa led me to the sofa
and tuckin a old robe around me he
went away

  i listened to the seconds mar chin past
a the hours unwound the clock a mouse
came out to piny on the floor by himself
once hed had playmates but folks about
to be sold up couldnt support so many
and now he played alone like me a
little star shone through the glass part
of the window above the coat and as i
watched it the clock stopped tickin the
mouse listened and ran away and a heavy
stumblin shook the ground outside

  another time id have done like tlie
mouse or the clock but the dim way o
the night and granpas starin at me
once and stealinaway made me feel dif-
ferent from what i used to be by day
so i went to the window pretty soon with
the old robe wrapped around me and
peepin through the blinds saw a giant
shadow black and still in the starlight

  openin the shutters i told it  you
can come look into this house if you
want to we dont keep any secrets here

  my inimy rode the black horse slowly
to the window like a ghost cornin to
a ghost for the password down a lone-
some road

  old moore he asked in his deep
voice at last

   gone i answered

  we were still for a minute tlien the
harpers monthly magazine

horse shied so wildly that my inimy
swayed in his saddle and a man seemed
to rise from the ground between us

  this man said fiercely  do you ride
up in the night to settle quarrels through
a window it was major felix and he
held a pistol in his hand

  without a word danton swung to the
ground and let his horse stray out among
the trees then he walked across the
porch and down the hall till he came
into the room where i was and major
felix growled at his heels though hed
put the pistol away

  my inimy looked at us and his eyes
seemed glowin through a fire lie said
we would have the auction now aud takin
out the outfit id piled in the corner he
bid five hundred dollars for half of em

   i sat on tlie couch with tlie robe around
me and though nothin seemed very real
i said i guessed he could have em be-
cause i didnt want him to know how
much more i cared for em than that

  then the major cried out that this
was all trillin and i felt as if cryin in
my sleep it didnt seem trillin to me
when all the things id lieen raised a part
of bad to le sold up

    ill throw in the goat i said though
billy was so threadbare now that he
seemed almos one of us and i knew how
wounded hed feel after stiekin the way
he had

   moore wont take such money said
the major and though youd like to
have these things and tell the story on
tlie old man-

   hell take it answered my inimy
 i tell you old moore is disgraced al-
ready four hundred for the other half

  the major was so mad he forgot
himself or else lie wouldnt be outbid
by danton

   five hundred he shouted which
was just what my inimy had bid for the
other lot

   then silence said danton  and
wait thats all i ask

  they were perfcely still after that
while i could only look at my old play-
things which had gone over to the inimy

  the seconds began to march agin the
mouse eame out to listen and then some
one walked up the hall

    alls well he called  theres nobody
here and granpa came into the room

what went on from that minute is more
plain to me than anything else which
ever happened

  as granpas eyes got used to the light
a seared look came over his face and he
gave a quick gasp he turned as if to
go back into the hall but he was so un-
steady that he bad to take hold of a
chair which he sunk into inch by inch

   nobody there davvy  called a
voice then weve kep our secret till
the very end

  the man who came inside at this stag-
gered a little when he saw the dim forms
by tho candles light then his eyes be-
gan to glare and he moved along till
layin his two hands on granpas shoul-
ders he spoke in a fierce loud snarl

   well aint you satisfied yet do you
want us to kill each other at last

  it was old darrow our inimy of dev- 
ils lane

  danton rose without a word i beard
tlie arm o major felixs chair crack in
his grip as he looked on

   you-two - old-inimies-together 
lie said

  no cried danton in a threatenin
voice  two obi friens for twen-
ty years this neighborhood lias quarrelled
on one side or the other o that lawsuit
and all tho time theyve been friens in
secret each one must have been helpin
the other when the case went agin him-
there was a silence till major felix
almos whispered  prove this

   go down into moores field as i did
this raorain and look at the trail lead-
in from house to house which theyve
worn in years o secret visits i came
here to-night to face em down im glad
you followed me-	 

   my horse fell lame and i was standin
under a tree when you took the wall
ixplaincd the major  but moore this
cant le true

  yet it was true and id known a good
while what that mutterin was in gran- 
pas room at night though he pretinded
to lie talkin to himself and then i was
proud o the old man when he drew him- 
self up as straight and tall as my inimy
and answered

   that was to lie a frienly suit between 
darrow and me but  our friens j
who had grudges o their own must take
sides and pretind to quarrel on our ac 
enemies



count then to give up would disgrace
us you set frien against frien fightin
your own quarrels over our heads weve
been inimies before the worl to satisfy
you weve almos fought because our
pride wouldnt swallow anything in front
o you men-

   and now you follow it up said old
barrow  by robbin us of our secret so
that people will say we were afraid to
fight in earnest you bloodliouns ive
tried to save davvys farm but its too
late to save my own theyve both been
swallowed in that graveyard you made us
build-the devils lane

 my inimy walked out before em in a
way that everybody noticed

  you two are traitors to a hones quar-
rel he said

   im ashamed o my part in it shout-
ed major felix takin the opposite side
 why this frienship o the two old
men is the most splendid thing t ever
heard of

  well the quarrel stans you and i
urged em on and we two will fight it
out my inimy lowered his voice  i
bid in some things at o auction here to-
night ill pay and take em along

 he counted money on tlie table and
throwin his wolfs look from face to
face he took his part o my old things
and went out

 major felix ran both hands through
his hair  that mans a savage he said
yes yes the little girl played auction
i bid in five hundred worth you will
take it with dantons by heaven  wliata
the matter with danton were inimies
but to quarrel for the sake o the quar-
 he cursed you two but the auc-
tion the auction why our money will
pay costs costs in this very suit weve
urgeil along

 of a sudden he ran toward the hall
ill either find out what he means
by all this or- and then his voice
died away

  the two old men looked at each other
gteerly then granpa spoke in a gentle
toxious way

   dantons caught him up like a vise
 this generous act and made him a
partner to it hes outqnarrelled felix
-hes outfelixed him quick we must

bring sallys play game to a good end
between those two smilin at me they
went out with the lantern

  i heard em talkin outside-all but
danton-with a cheerfulness which had-
nt been in that house for a long while
eept in my play games but i stayed
behin thinkin of all my things gone
away of the men outside who would
soon be friens and me the only inimy

night

by walter prichard eaton

two small boys and a clog were hur-
rying along through the woods in
the early spring twilight tho ice
was out of the streams and tho sap was
running but there were no leaves yet
only a haze of frail green liko tlie ghost
of a veil when you looked over the trees
into the sun under the hemlocks how-
ever it was as dark as in june and with
the coming of night the trail was almost
indistinguishable tho dog smelled it
out the small boys found it by the feel
of their feet and by looking up and fol-
lowing tho thread of open sky they
kept ever closer together and spoke little
it was very dark and terrifying among
those great hemlocks the wind sighed
eternally like a human overhead things
unknown patterrd off through tlie under-
growth the hoys unconsciously broke
into a dog-trot

  then suddenly ahead they saw tho
light of the clearing beyond the swamp
tho trail grew faintly visible like a gray
ribbon it crossed the swamp brook on
a bridge and wound off through the
fringe of hard timber and over the ridge
toward home the water in the swamp
glistened like quicksilver it seemed to
hold more of the departed day than the
sky itself which was fast fading into
night out of the quicksilver tho swamp
maples and saplings reared almost in-
distinguishable trunks to the horizon line
above that they told against the pale sky
as a black tracery of intricate delicacy
and beauty and in the swamp the
pickering frogs were singing shrilly-
phee pheo phee-far up above the limits
of the human voice their cheerful
spring song and the kindly presence of
i lie clearing brought the little boys down
to a walk again they looked back into
tlie now impenetrable gloom of the hem-
locks then forward at the lovely black
tracery of twigs against the west and
the sweet influences of night brooded over
them as they went silently homeward

  it was many years later that one of
those boys read shelleys

   swiftly walk over the western wave
    spirit of niglit  

and interpreted it as we all must inter-
pret poetry and art and music in terms
of his own experience it was only when
he reached this period of shelley and self-
consciousness that lie realized how rich
his experience had been thanks to a coun-
try boyhood in those sights and sounds
of nature when she stands intimate and
revealed which are the backgrounds of
poetry and perhaps the most precious
iossessions of memory for the reader if
the mind and spirit are to give to art
an immediate and kindled response they
must possess a wealth of co-ordinate de-
tails the seed of suggestion must not fall
on barren soil there is i fancy a very
real difference in the nature and strength
of his response even to such a poem say
as arnolds scholar gypsy between the
reader who has known shy nature in-
timately in all its moods and the reader
born and reared exclusively in such a
city ns new york

 isut when the fields are still

and the tired men and dogs all gone to rest

  and only the white sheep are sometimes
      seen

  cross and recross the strips of moon-
     blanched green

come shepherd and again hegin the quest

  that phrase  the strips of rnoon-
lilancbed green lias a peculiar magic for
the reader whose memory holds similar
pictures who as a boy perhaps stole
furtively out at night over the pastures
and viewed with something akin to awe
the giant oak that guarded the first glade
of tlie forest there it stood bathed dim-
ly in the moonlight gigantic strange un-
known night and tho moon had trans-
figured it as they had transfigured the
forest heyond and the open valley behind
the fields are bathed in moonlight

what terrors lil those dark woods not
hold even for the brave boy of twelve
ami what fairy shapes toomight not glide
into the moon-blanched open even the
white nymphs one had read about and
behind how deep tlie valley lay how far
it stretched to the dim silvered hills
beyond in all the world there was not
vol cxxi -no  -

a sound save the night whisperings of the
leaves the sleepy chorus of the crickets
and the sad call of a whippoorwill
the world of day tlie people and the
cattle and the bright friendly light slept
as if they would never wake on your
feet the dew was cold and on your heart
lay the wonder and the mystery of night
harpers monthly magazine

it was one of those moments when god
trains his little children to be poets-
or at any rate future readers of poetry

  ami how much of such training is done
by night in our stupid unimaginative
grown-up way we write silly little verses
about the childs terror of the dark or

the great garden of the patient stars

draw silly little pictures of it regarding
it as a mild and amiable joke yet the
childs terror of the dark is often the
result of a far finer flight of imagination
i ban any we grown-ups indulge and night
for the child holds deep primeval mys-
ticism and poetry we admire blanco
whites sonnet to night yet it is essen-
tially a childs conception to find the dark-
ness in the light to see in imagination
the earth ball spin from the shadowed
side most of our literature about the
child just now so popular is essentially

false because it is too superficial the
shades of tlie prison-house have obliter-
ated our finer recollection and in noth-
ing is this so pronounced as in our for-
getfulness of the childs feeling for night
his unconsciously imaginative life be-
tween sunset and dawn

  when i was a lit-
tle boy night in the
mountains was for me
a perpetual joy- and
terror nor has it yet
lost the joy nor quite
all the terror a level
wall of near-by moun-
tains just before the
moon heaves up be-
hind them and tlieir
summits an silvered
w i t h a mysterious
light whilo tlie slopes
are black utter shad-
ow still seems to me
a mighty unbelievable
wave bearing down
upon me and to this
day if i am alone far
from a house i have a
sinking sensation of
terror and can with
difficulty refrain from
running away as i
did when a child
professor james might
tell me that sinking
sensation is a physical
memory of the cluld-
ish experience and in-
duces tlie mood of ter-
ror he says we are
often frightened be-
cause we run away
not the reverse put
i prefer to believe
otherwise  prefer to believe that i can
still under cover of the night see things
as they ire not

  i know at any rate that i can still
stand on a hill where a black cedar cuts
tlie sky and feel the earth swing east-
ward under the stars always as a child
i tried to realize that the earth was a ball
spinning on its axis and hurtling through
space but my mind could never quite
grasp the illusive picture then one
night  stood upon a hilltop and felt the
eastward spin it all came clear in a
xigiit

flash of revelation that first night too
the stars were not in the skv they were
lumps let down on invisible wires till
they hung just over the trees you may
see them that way any winter night in
florida but not often in the north i
watched till i almost fancied they swayed
in the wind gradually they were drawn
up an infinite distance and i felt the
earth travel beneath them i lay on my
back to obliterate everything but the sky
and the top of the cedar i felt the east-
ward spin even more clearly then ris-
ing i looked down at
the valley lamps be-
hind one of those win-
dow squares the grown-
ups were playing cards

i thought them very
silly as i stood up
there with my stars
riling the earth ball
through space a n 
night i was the
adult the poet the
philosopher t h e y
were just playing
games and yet we
patronize the child

  it was at our moun-
tain house that i used
to lio in bed at night
ami watch the men go
out to the stable with
lanterns their great
shadows danced fan-
tastically on the barn
wall and up over the
roof the legs getting
hopelessly crossed and
tangled these gro-
tesque pantomime per-
formances were an
endless delight one
night i saw a lantern
bobbing up in the or-
chard and got up my-
self to investigate as

i	entered the orchard
the light was resting
on the ground and showed me in the
midst of the inky dark the vague outlines
of a clothes-basket and some flapping
sheets on a line mrs sheldon was taking
down the wash  why t asked her

  because its going to rain she an-
swered  the mountain is talking



  she was a thin wiry woman of few
words who could smell rain a day off
and make excellent cookies i went out
of the circle of lantern-light and looked
up toward kinsman his great shaggy
sides were faintly visible looming preter-
naturallv high a blacker patch against
the black sky and the dim stars the air
was quite still there was no wind i
listened intently and presently my ear
caught a sound like the steady roar of a
far-off waterfall it was the wind rush-
ing through the forests far up on those

shaggy slopes the mountain was hold-
ing converse with the gale down here
there was no wind far aloft tho gale
was hurrying tt gave me a tremendous
sensation of space and height  fancied
mvself alone up there clinging to a dizzy
ledge while the gale howled about mo

a giant oak guards the forest glade
on the shore a path glimmers dimly

and i grew faint with my imagined ter-
ror hut j felt too a curious new friend-
ship for the mountain as for a human
tiling which could communicate news of
the weather and hid us on a perfectly
calm night take in the clothes i went
to bed with entire confidence that i
should wake up to find the mountains
buried in cloud and the brooks roaring
and it was even so my evident in-
creased admiration for airs sheldon too
brought n fresh batch of cookies i was
a gainer all around

tin midniglit on tlie mountains brown
the pale round moon shines deeply down
so sang byron and in college a pas-
sage in our rhetoric was it not quoted
from ruskin pointed out that the poet-
ry of this couplet resides in tlie adverb
 deeply i remember my efforts to ex-
plain to my roommate why it was so
perfectly apparent to me who even as a
child had seen our mountain intervale
deepen nnd grow luminously mysterious
beneath tlie magic of tlie moon and the
cleft on cannon become a bottomless pit

	is environment had been less kind to
him perhaps too his mind was less nat-
urally pictorial if i tried to explain
poetry to him he had an even harder time
trying to explain mathematics to me
but i feel sure that the poverty of his
memory in co-ordinating details so essen-
tial to the visualization of poetry was in
 small measure due to bis urban child-
hood lie had never been turned looso
on the edge of the wilderness never
pushed adventurous footsteps into the
mystery of the mountain night or brushed
the moonlit dew from the clearing

  moonlight how its soft obliterating
glory remakes tlie world and remakes it
nearer to the hearts desire george
moore called the songs of schubert and
schumann  tlie moonlit lakes ami night-
ingales of music moonlight is the il-
lumination of romance there is some-
thing lyric and lovely about it something
akin to the magic of the last act of
the merchant of venice which is sat-
urated with moonlight quaintly too the
moon symbol of tlie chaste goddess is in
the night gloom of the waters

reality the patroness of the mating pas-
sion but the child ns yet feels nothing
of that for him moonlight on familiar
fields is hut the revelation of a strange
mysterious exquisite half-world concealed
somehow in tho glare of day and made
manifest once a month for his wonder
and delight when like the good king
in the carol he looks out of the window
after tea

and the snow lien round about

      deep and crisp and even
it is a different world that he sees line
and dimly suffused with misty gold the
fence rails are reproduced on the snow
as they climb over the ridge and long
shadows creep out from the trees and
hushes like spirits as the snowy world
rolls into distance it grows dimmer more
mysterious it is very cold perhaps the
child slips out-of-doors ami stands on
tlie snow crust which squeaks faintly
under his boots there is no other sound
silently coldly beautifully the misty
golden moonlight at once floods and

obliterates his universe lie has a
strange sensation of unreality of unreal-
ity that would yet be very sweet could
it bo real is this not after all the
essence of romanticism

  once in our same mountain home we
drove down the landaff valley to see the
moon rise over the ridge of kinsman
fancy could detect a lighter space in tho
dark sky but tlint was all for several
miles the road ahead was almost in-
visible the horse a iwibbing blur pres-
ently the liirht behind the mountain be-
enme more definite the last slope was
outlined behind a golden halo then
the road plunged down between high
wooded banks into utter darkness and wo
emerged suddenly abruptly beyond tho
last ridge of the mountain into brilliant
moonlight the harness glittered long
shadows stretched westward distances be-
came luminous and distinct everything
was bright and clear-cut as by a sudden
flood of artificial light and there at
lie left just across the meadow in a gap
the swamp-brook bridge

of low hills only a few hundred yards
away hung the full moon

 we could get out and touch it
i cried

  my father smiled but he did not laugh
at me he was a wise man and never
laughed at children  if it doesnt hurry
it will pet caught in the tree tops he said

  but it escaied their entanglement and
rode higher and higher behind us all the
way home making a quiet splendor of
the night

  could the little boy who carried this
picture treasured vividly in hi memory
thereafter meet the wort moonlight
without an instant association  i it

sensible to suppose that such scenes and
experiences in childhood do not color and
enrich the whole future of tlie man
our enjoyment of most things in this
world depends largely upon our private
stock of associated ideas upon the extent
as it were to which the new stimulus can
find friends in our brain our enjoyment
of art in all its forms depends tremendous-
ly upon the images of beauty in our
memories by which we test compare and
appreciate keatss

 the moving waters at their priest-like
      tak

  of pure ablution round earths human
      shore
against the sky a delicate black tracery

is sheer magic only to the imagination
which can project itself at the stately
call of the verso into the void and see
the earth hall rolling under from the sun
while tho starlight glooms its many
waters or which can survey as from a
great cliff the dark plain of the sea and
the curl of foam along a dim shore
stretching endlessly into the night to
answer the call of keats the imagination
must have its materials of memory to
work with and only nature can have
supplied them no one i fancy who has
ot stood at night high above the seashore
will ever know the full magic of this
immortal couplet no one too whose

memory does not hold a picture of that in-
finite curve of the sea rim who has not
brooded upon the last red topsail sinking
 below the vertre will ever know the
full magic of shakespeares

              on such a night
stood dido with a willow in her hand
ipon the wild sea hanks and waved her love
to come again to carthage

the sensitive child that is permitted at
all hours and all seasons to wander by
sea margin and forest over fields and
under the moon is laying by treasures
that are not made with hands the
cruelty of keeping a child iu the city

i not alone  matter of his bodily health
and it is especially at night when the
daylight pastimes are put aside and the
child walks hand in hand with mys-
tery that bis little soul is touched his
dawning memory stocked with immor-
tal recollections

  there comes a later period of life when
night has a eenliar charm because in
some subtle way it seems to shut the
youth into a great sweet chamber of
darkness alone with his beloved she
may be far away but thoughts of her

bridge the sleeping world he may leave
her side but her presence walks with
him and he fears no prying eyes night
is sacred to lovers no less than to thieves
shall you as long as you live forget
the intrm chill of that dark pond across
which you nightly paddled while a
guiding light was set in
a wiudow behind you
sometimes the pond was
ghostly with n white mist
steaming up into the star-
light and your body was
enveloped while your head
rose above tlie vapor
now and then a lisli
j u m p e d unexpectedly
with a flash of silver and
a loud splash though
it seemed light  tho
jhind and you had tho
lamp lehind for beacon
tlie farther shore under
the woods was utter
black and you made
your landing bv some
primitive instinct glid-
ing under the shadow of
the trees where the prow
of your own canoe was
invisible and hearing at
tin expected moment tlie
friendly grate of gravel
under the keel on the
shore a path glimmered
dimly and fireflies glinted
in the grass the frogs
wore singing five miles
away you heard tlie faint
whistle of a locomotive
y o u yourself whistled

o	n e long - drawn note
which went out over the
water and the lamp
twinkling in the distant
wiudow disappeared and
appeared again three
times it was essential
you remember that you
prove you hadnt been
drowned then you felt
your way home through the dark pines
which were warm like a chamber felt
your way unerringly for in the night
old powers wake dulled by long dis-
use so accustomed are we to depend al-
most exclusively  sight we do not

know till there- is need to walk in the
darkness lor instance that the soles of
our feet have senses

  again it was night when white arms
released you reluctant to be released
and you crossed the cropped lawn which
liespoke a more urban neighborhood and
passed through deserted streets and down
a short cut over the railroad tracks by the
roundhouse the last train from the
city had come in the trainmen departed
that shocking confession you will have
to make but the locomotives bad a
little steam up and were gently panting
as though iu sleep waiting for morning
there were cracks of light about the doors
of their fire-boxes they were warm al-
most human and often you paused be-
side one patting its iron flanks as if you
greeted a comrade of the night a little
farther on your way took you past a
cemetery which by long familiarity held
no depression but once very late after
the white arms had released you with
tears for the terror that hot love has of
its own too possible brevity you saw the
moon set behind that cemetery ridge-
and you will never forget it

  there is no twilight of the moon as
it catches in the trees lief ore setting a
pallor comes over the landscape then
the moon is seen visibly to plunge down
out of sight as you may see the long hand
on a great clock jump the minutes all
the light shivers off the world and instant-
ly tin body seems to feel a chill and the
spirit a strange depression at that mo-
ment when tlie moon vanished behind the
desolate graveyard ridge you knew a
despair such as you pray you may never
know again the reaction from a perhaps
too romantic passion was violent and
abrupt you felt chilly and grown old
you knew you should never love in tlie
future with tlie old ardent heart of youth
that was forever behind you what a
pity too your poor heart held for itself
could there be any morning for this black
world almost you hoped that tlie re was
not and in this new utter dork of the
spirit you found a strange new thrill ah
happy youth-too happy happy youth-
it is not till later that the moon sets for
our ardent passions and our hearts of hot
romance and generally we are aled
soundly sleeping and do not know that
anything ot all has happened

  the beauty and charm of the outdoor
stage which is slowly gaining favor iu
america are immeasurably enhanced by
night inder the kindly cover of the
dark obliterating fences telegraph poles
and the neighbors house almost any
garden grove may become a forest of
arden or titanias abode effects of il-
lusion are possible unknown to tlie stage
of sharp wing pieces and definite pro-
scenium  once saw a performance of
the old vyv tale in the orchard back
of the raddiffo college dormitory where
the calcium illuminated a spot between
two apple trees and tho characters came
and went by a process of drifting into tho
light or melting back into the dark at
first we heard the lost shepherds hallooing
in the distance -and caught the crunch
of their feet liefore they drifted bewil-
dered into the illumination wliat a
magic of mystery is here what a fairy
atmosphere what a fluent ethereal plas-
ticity is possible when no character is
lit suddenly and sharply off by a wing
piece or a door but all melt away or
prow into being like the figures in a
dream and yet we sit eternally for our
dramatic entertainment in on artificial
theatre and let this magic border-land
of drama lie unexplored only the
young people iu our colleges know bet-
tor they are still fwets and lovers of
the night

  yet none of us is ever quite so far
from childhood perhaps that the night
has wholly lost for him its charm and its
mystery still it must remain at least
the symbol of the eternal mystery which
is why possibly we grow with advancing
years less eager to contemplate it but
there is no man who does not now and
then walk by night on the edge of the
woods where the trail is a dim gray rib-
lion and in the moon-deepened shadows
see the white nymphs of the hearts de-
sire there is no man who on a summer
night does not now and then pause to
listen for the myriad tiny sleigh-bells of
the crickets chimes of elf-land faintly
ringing which fall into one chord at
regular intervals and bring to the heart
an inexpressible calm to the turbid spirit
a sleepy hush of peace there is no man

own garden or just on the deserted pave

of a city street-does not watch the moon
obliterate the ugliness of the world with
a soft suffusion of its golden light and
does not hear for an instant the whisper
of the old romance perhaps there is
no man when the insect cares of life
annoy and the pilgrims pack is galling
and heavy who does not one night throw
open his window and gaze into the im-
mensity of silent space into the great
garden of the patient stars the man
meditates in silence carried out of him-

large how petty his selfish interests
nnd worries in the face of this infinity
of worlds how large his soul which
can roam the interstellar spaces new
strength pours in upon him from tlie
deeps of heaven the insect cares have
ceased to sting the heavy burden is for-
gotten he is one with the brooding
mystery of the night he has joined orion

to-night there has been a thaw i
stepped out on tlie city square before my

dwelling the slushy snow fouled al-
most beyond recognition by human traffic
lay in tho gutters and in patches on the
grass the air was warm almost like 
spring but there was no spring smell iu
it instead there was a heavy stale 
dead odor at best as of a world warmed
over but i looked up against the misty
silver of the arc-lamps the trees threw
a delicate tracery of black as lovely as
those swamp maples against the twilight
when i was a little boy still higher
the electric cross on the church tower
blazed upon the sky like a constellation
the stars were overhead it was late
and the citys roar was stilled a far-
off bell flung a chime to me over the
housetops it seemed as if the cows were
calling from the upland pastures the
mind takes wings under the silent dome
of night sleep is but the lesser part
of our sunless hours and day itself
perhaps the lesser part of what in

the judgment tree

by antoinette a bassett

two souls stood up before tho lord
as we must do

 israfil what dost thou record
         against these two

the little blossoms shone like gold
        upon the tree-

the- angel read the book that told
        of destiny

 the first-o lord-achieved success
        but bore it ill

and tlie last failed but through distress
        perceived thy will

the little leaves of heaven shook fast
        upon the tree

love

  by norman duncan

it was snowing tlie flakes wore
shaken to the wind from a thick
sky to which the moon save a nar-
rowing circle of misty light the gale
came from the farther northwest it
ran over the pines broken free of the
mountains and careering unaware tum-
bled headlong into the little clearing at
kettle camp of the cant-book cutting
where it swirled bewildered and angry
having rattled the windows of the btink-
housos in a flush of indignation-and
having shaken the floors in complaint-
and having beaten the roofs in a vicious
prank of the night-and having poked
cold and searching fingers with impudent
curiosity into every smallest crevice of
these low log habitations-and having
howled in the lustiest fashion through
all the agitated experience-it rushed
away to the big woods whisking off the
smoke of the cabin fires and their short-
lived sparks the smoke found good
company and an engaging adventure
with the roistering wind it seemed but
tho aspiring little sparks flashing gladly
in the free winds wake died of frosty
hardship in the first eager flight it was
sunday night an idle time-with cold
weather and a blinding gale to keep men
close to encouraging company and to the
fires bowl the scaler weathered to the
knot and grain of his tall nature by forty
years of forest labor nnd grown vastly
sentimental in the selfsame silence and
isolation and forming companionship
kicked open the door of the super-
intendents stove and hung in more wood
growling contemptuously in answer to the
winds big roaring his broad face scowl-
ing and red in the furnace glow

   the trouble with you bowl said
the young superintendent blandly is
that youve been in the woods all your
life you see-

  rut rowl interrupted indignantly
  it aint  trouble t me im satisfied
   what  mean the superintendent

patiently explained  is that you dont
know nothing about the great big world
which doesnt know nothing about you-
nor cares a water-soaked hoot about you
nor about me nor none of the boys just
so long as the big sticks gets in the
river and down to the mill you see
he added with an indulgent little laugh
 you dont know the world

   t know my world rowl answered
in a flash

  yes-s the superintendent drawled
 but there aint much in your world
just me and the woods said rowl
just me and the woods he repeated
in a muse  and-

    suppose said the superintendent
interpreting the pause  that you mean
gawd

   i dont mean what you mean rowl
replied  but only what you say i mean
god but what that means t me he
added without intention to wound
 doesnt mean nothin much of the same
simple every-day common-sense sort o
thing t you

  theres a lumber-jack or two the
superintendent inquired

  oh aye rowl answered theres
a lumber-jack or two as you say in my
world and im reminded by that that
theres also just one parson

  we could in politeness make  answer
to all this sentimentality

   now said rowl warming to the
eloquence by which he was occasionally
distinguished he had in these years been
a great reader of grave books  its all
very well for you young lusty bucks t
squat here at this fire on a windy night
an guess about men an women tts
all very well for you t warm your shanks
an toast your soles an gab an declare
about men an women its all very well
for you t take a childs chart o the
world in your hands an discover the worth
of a man to a woman an the service she
owes him its all very well for you

was more of melancholy than of laughter
 an no discredit t the reputation of its
maker as i do grant an believe ive
been a lover o books in my time though
no great reader o the hearts o livin men
but tis doubtless true o cities as tis
the almighty truth o these woods that
a mans soul gives him small bother til
lies strangled it tis right there on the
job mindin its own business workin
overtime with as little fuss as may be an
no thanks at all t turn out courage an
hope an kindness fresh for the days
need but in all the world tis god help
a man once lies seen his soul lyin dead
at his feet theres always a land left
no doubt where the law cant find a
man a new place on the face o the
earth t hide from what cant follow
but theres no new land for the man whos

once clapped eyes  his own dead soul
an twas so with poor gingerbread
jenkins he come blithe from the north
coast by way o the maine woods t
log on bottle river out here in the west
n lad as clean as morning with a taste
for stars an trees an the habit o
chuckles an with the same word for all
women as for the mother hed write to
every sunday night by the light of a
lantern in his bunk but twas  great
tale o years as the years fall upon care-
ful men before pale peters whiskey an
the lights o thirty drinks had turned
him into a gray - headed shrivelled
frowsy mouthy little grouch of a swamper
in the meanest camps o the state

    good god theyd say that knew
him once is that young gingerbread
jenkins

  jus tlie lcavins says i that
used t be gingerbread jenkins the
devils picked him t the bones

  quick work says they

    the devil feeds fast on a good man
says t  when not interrupted

   but gingerbread didnt know

	rowl hed whine when hed como
crawlin back t camp from thirty drinks
all a-jump an coughin  ive had my
fling now an im through i know
when i got enough

    huh says i

youre through all right til you
make another stake says i  an get the
stomach t hold it just where youll
put it

    im gettin too old t travel with the
boys says he  im tired too rowl
an i want t get somebody t take care
o me

  who might that lie says i

    well says he  a woman

    its been done before says i

  jus about time i married says he
 an settled down

    its been done before says i  by
men like you

  yes says he thats the way it
goes as a usual thing you see rowl
its natural when a man gets t my
age lies pretty much always had his fill
 then he just naturally marries an
settles down

    what you gettin married for
says i
i know my world rowl answered in a flash
harpers monthly magazine

     well says he  nothin like a good
woman t steady a man you lake a good
woman rowl an if shes been well
fetched up an careful of herself shell
be clever at that as well as useful in
other ways thats the business o
women a good woman rowl-a sweet
little womanly sort o girl whos lived all
her life in her own home an not seen
too much o the world-is jus the sort
o wife a man whos lived too free will
get for himself if he knows what hes
about an a man whos lived too free
isnt the sort to be fooled in a little mat-
ter like that i know you rowl says he

 an  know youre no hand for matri-
mony  but youre makin a big mistake
there aint nothin in the world like a
good woman t take care of a man an
steady him when lies had his fill i been
thinkin y says he that if i went slow
an picked em over on chose with my
eyes open i might get the rijrht sort t
look after me id be a sight better off
says he  with a little homestead out here
an a wife t keep it than i am sleepin
in a bunk-house an pushin my stake
over the bars o thirty drinks an any-
how says he  im tired o liquor

  you got a little woman handy
says i

  not handy says he but back
where i come from rowl theres a little
girl tlmt used t be wonderful fond o me
shes a comfortable little thing too
rowl an might answer very well if i
cive her a fair show in the beginning
a man ought t give a little girl like that
a chance t get the hang o things before
he passes judgment on whether shes goin
t do or not theres many a man that
doesnt but as for me im not o that
kind-i got feelins t been thinkin o
the little thing back home says he but
i havent quite made up my mind

    how long is it since youve saw
her says i

     shes not overly old yet says he

     what i meant t say says i  is how
long is it since shes saw you

    a man says he  dont change
much in fifteen year

  thats all ripht says i but the
tliinp for you t do jus now ginger-
bread is t report t the office an go
swampin the new road t the landin 
round island lake

  swampin says lie me-swamp-
in again you jus wait til i get mar-
ried rowl an ill show you what a man
like me can do

  nothin like a little swampin says
i  t show a man jus what he really
can do

   well rowl went   gingerbread
jenkins went home after the drive o
that year t fetch a wife t keep the home-
stead of his poor mean dream

     ill be back in the fall boys says
he  with a comfortable little wife t make
home attractive an keep me straight
ive had my fill says he an im goin
t settle down im wise says he  t
whats good for me

  god help him thinks i lies a
harsh lesson t learn at the hand o the
almightys law an may take unkindly
t the teach in

  what the little pirl that used t love
the young eyes an soul of him said god
knows but im thinkin she blushed
ashamed when the leavins o young
gingerbread jenkins croaked o love an
that she was frightened too an sick at
heart an that she prayed with tears
that night in her white little bed be-
cause the almighty had piven her new
an sadder knowledge o the mystery o
men there was never a word of her
from gingerbread jenkins when lie
turned up alone at the big chance camps
in the fall o the year nor lias there been
since shes back there now im think-
in with the grief an loneliness that
come t women who love an are ill-
taught about love by the men they glorify
as for gingerbread jenkins hed been
back home not only t old places but
to other years an memory had taught
him the change in his own soul an lie
was broken down when lie come again t
the woods

  i been back home rowl says he
 but t didnt stay overlong

    you stopped at thirty drinks any-
how says i   the way back

  tus for a little liquor says he
 you see rowl liquors like medicine to
a man like me

     yes  says i

  i dont care nothin about it no
more says he it aint a beverage its
jus medicine-for a man like me
with that measure of love

   tis a poor euro says i for a
mans soul

   well rowl says he  i got a good
deal t forget

    see tlie folks v says i

  spent most o my time says he

	with a little hoy

    thats queer says i

    no says he  it aint queer at all
never knew says i that you was
much of a hand for children

    well says he  i used t know this
little feller real well

    your nephew says 

   no says lie  not my nephew hut
 used t know him says lie  real well
 a ol chums kid says i

  no rowl says he no-not a ol
chums kid jus a little feller t used
t know

  tis a wonder ho knew you says i
  well says lie  he had some doubts
 he must be growed up by this time
says i

    well no says he  ho wasnt growed
at all somehow or other says lie  ho
was jus the same jolly little feller i used
t know-real well

    thats queer says i

    you see rowl says he  all my
folks is dead an the folks that used t
know jimmie jenkins ant be real fond
of him too has boon so busy the last
fifteen years that they couldnt quite
lake t gingerbread jenkins after t
made a little call on-on-well on a old
friend o mine-i passed a good deal o
time alone an one day when i was pass-
in the oandy-shop i found this little
feller-this same little feller i used t
know-lookin in the window the little
monkey there he was rowl lookin in
the window o the oandy-shop an pickin
an choosin like mad the little tyke
i used t know him real well a nice lit-
tle feller rowl-jus a real nice little
boy i used t know-with blue eyes an
freckles-an a little grin rowl an a
little laugh an a little head full o the
nicest kind o mischief ho didnt know
 wickedness rowl an he didnt know
no trouble an everybody loved him too
you bet so after that me an him passed
a good deal o time together we went t
the woods rowl an t sunday-school
n t the circus lot an down the river
an over t the ball-gronnds an up t the

gingerbread jenkins

school-yard when the boys was in an
jus everywhere else where the boys used
t go when i was a boy like him an
then rowl it struck me that he was a
bit too young an nice t be loafin around
with a man like me seemed t mo some-
how that i might spoil him i wanted
 keep him friendly and good an so i
thought id better ooirte back t the woods
where gingerbread jenkins was bom

    seems t me says i  that i too
used t kiow that little feller

    you did says he  but he was a bit
older then

  he was a niee clean boy says i
 when i first knowed him


harpers monthly magazine

    was he  says he  really mean
it rowl

  a good boy says i

    rowl savs he  ive lost my soul

    it may be lyin around somewheres
handy says i  i wouldnt worry

    ive lost it says he

    well says i  when a man once
misses his soul an wants it back again
he can usually find it if ho takes the
trouble t look for it right away

    ill never find mine says he

    not says i  if you carry your can-
dle in a bottle 

  rowl paused to sigh

   they care no more for a mans soul
in the shanty saloons of a western lumber
town the scaler continued presently
 than for a sour tin can they toss em
into the garbage-pail or throw em into
the back yard with the same wish t- keep
their barrooms ready for business in
pale peters place at thirty drinks an
in every other ramshackle squattin
packin-box-an-tar-paper dive o the town
from llio cafe of egyptian de-lights t
the lnmber-jacks rest they never give
gingerbread jenkins a show when
thirty drinks goes west-bv-north on the
trail o the lumber-camps im tliinkin
therell lie a marvellous heap o castaway
souls left with tho tin cans an ol shoes
on the site of it gingerbread jenkins
worked at the big chance camps that
winter an wasted in the saloons o
thirty drinks you see rowl says he
i got a good ileal t forget twas a
weeks harsh labor to his middle in snow
for a nights waste lined up at pale
peters bar with a drove o squealin
swine  you see rowl ive lost my soul
says he  an i jus got t forget it a
wonderful fuss he made about that soul
when well gone in liquor there was
never a man so drunk-none so foul-
that he wouldnt buttonhole an bore him
with a whimperin tale of his state an
condition an what he used t be but
that was gingerbread jenkins twas
spree in town t forget the shivers in
camp that was gingerbread jenkins
before the reverend john fairmeadow
followed him out t the middle o no
mans lake an opened his bottle in a
blizzard o wind an snow

   i mind i encountered gingerbread

jenkins shakin with the liquor o three
days gone an drunk with the days
drinks leaniu over pale peters bar that
night a mad night too christmas
week-with the crews from kettle an
big bend paid off an upendin an an
irish outfit from the yellow tree works

 charlie boy says he in a whisper
hardly able t talk on account of his cold
 pass the bottle tm athirst an parched
with that measure of love

for rum look here boys says he when
hed swallowed his whiskey  therell be
pome o you get t hell before i do if

    i reckon says pale peters wee lit-
tle boy who was sittin on the bar at my
elbow  that gingerbread jenkins would
never get in if i kep hell

  well well rowl laughed in a larjn
and hearty way  the boys howled with
delight an bought gingerbread jenkins
another drink he sighed  god help

n hell an damnation between coughs
in that roarin barroom t get even with
be devil while time was left hed
struck bottom all right-an struck hard
too tlu little jimmie jenkins that
cingerbread jenkins used t know an
still loved

   voi cxxi-no m-

   it vwfc- snowin too hard for me t
take -tlie-fig chance trail that night
thys yat a big gale blowin down-a
thick fiorwester at thirty below- lord i
but twas a nasty cold night in the open
id small stomach for the tote-load from
grass landin through the blasted c-ednr
muskeg id none at all for the frost an
the sweep o the wind on no mans lake
so i sat in the window o pale peters
place--im no hand with a bottle-an
vatched the snow drive through the light
that fell warm an yellow from the office

i	thoupht a deal about gingerbread jen-
kins-perhaps overmuch an softly for
the harsh kind o man i am i rcmein-
bered the day t luit cpine t the bottle
river camp irrememljefed tlie clean live
young look of him an fhe hope he had
an tin- morning song on his lips an the
love o life in his heart an the unspoiled
soul that was his well well lie was a
good boy was gingerbread jenkins in
them days-a boy with a straight back
an free shoulders an a head held up
an eyes that never shifted an a laugh
that wasnt afraid of itself im older
than him an i used t think i remcm-
ber that t bottle river at last had come
a boy they couldnt spoil of bis youth
an his wages i was young then after
all i was only a poor damned fool i
didnt know as i know now that never
a boy was bom they wouldnt ruin on
bottle river ruin ay never a boy
they wouldnt ruin for the sheer sport
an i kep right on believin in young
gingerbread jenkins in them old days
when lie was a boy until one satur-
day night he went out t thirty drinks
with ol bum lush an billy the beast
t learn about life

  t learn jus a little says he

	about life

     jus once says he

 they fetched him back on monday
harpers monthly magazine

hi- went out to learn about llff

morn in rowl sighed  pretty well in-
formed after thut he added repeating
tlie sigh  he was what you might call
a fairly inquirin student an thats
the way it goes he declared scowling
with all the boys that come loggin t
these woods

  it was still blowing high the fire in
the superintendents office had burned to
expiring coals no comfortable glow of
light-no red warmth- genial sparkle
and crackling-proceeded from it the
room was cold and now the frosty gale
intruded upon us who had forgotten it
and it was blowing a blizzard outside
all the world of the woods was hitter
with cold and wind and driven snow-

   inimical with night
   tho superintendent
   coaxed the fire to a
   blaze and heaped it
   with dry wood and
   while it sputtered
   and roared with tho
   lusty intention of
   recovering itself we
   waited for tlie senti-
   mental old scaler to
   resume the tue
   of gingerbread jen-
   kins

     t h e reverend
john fairmeadow
he went   tracked gingerbread jen-
kins from pale peters place t the middle
o xo mans lake that night i told you
of an fetched him home on his back and
within five days from that time ginger-
bread jenkins was converted

 was what said the superintendent
converted tis the only word i know
for the thing

who

gingerbread jenkins im fellin
you

the superintendent laughed

you may call it what you like
rowl replied in a growl  an you may
lauph to suit the won but you dont
prove nothin t me i know that john
fairmeadow tracked gingerbread jen-
kins t the middle o no mans lake that
night in a gale that chased me indoors
an you wouldnt face t save life an that
john fairmeadow found him then- half
crazy with what hed had tryin t open
a bottle o whiskey with frozen bands
an that he carried him home on his own
back god knows how what john
fairmeadow done t gingerbread jen-
kins when he got him home i dont
know no moren you do but i do know
that he kep gingerbread jenkins in his
own room over one-eyed mags for five
lays an that at the end o that time
gingerbread jenkins was converted for
john fairmeadow tol me so an ginger-
bread jenkins didnt deny it an t
know too rowl went  his voice
rising that gingerbread jenkins would-
nt stir out-o-doors without havin mag
little angel by the hand an that not a
man o thirty drinks would ask ginger-
bread jenkins t take a dram when little
with that measure of love

angel was along an i know more-
over he concluded that in four weeks
gingerbread jenkins was himself again
-that he come back t the bin chance
camp-that in three months he was rosy
an clean an strong an happy an no
more afraid-that lie was a boss on tho
big river drive o that spring-an
that in the fall o the year he was of-
fered a superintendents job by  hat
walhveathcr o the yellow forks lum-
ber company

   thats a good deal t know said tho
superintendent

   no it aint snapped rowl

   its a good deal t know

   its the kind o thing that any fool
can find out an know that wants to
well drawled the superintendent
i aint much up  miracles

   its nothin t know at all said
rowl  but its a devil of a lot to ex-
plain

  the superintendent laughed

 the reverend john fairmeadow
howl resumed  is the parson that
preaches in the bunk-houses o these
woods god knows where he come from
weve no notion hereabouts but you can
bet your life the devil is aware that he is
on the spot john fairmeadows  the
job my boy from lie big river to the
camps o the logosli reservation there
isnt a barroom in four hundred square
miles where he cant call the bartender
johnnie nor a bunk-house where he isnt
at home hes a big man i mean it
lies a great big man-a man of our kind
and big by our scale it took a man big
in body an heart an faith-a bigger man
than me in the ways that we know as
bigness-t put gingerbread jenkins 
his back in tlie middle o no mans lake
un fetch him t thirty drinks through
the wind an snow an frost o that night
an it takes a bigger man than any other
big man i ever knew t operate in a
religious fashion without cant an all
manner o foolishness in the bunk-
houses an bars an dives o these woods
im no judge o christians havin han-
dled none in my business an ive beard
ill tales o their state in these days but
i know that an ounce o john fair-
meadow t the gallon o this generations
christianity would cure the wrongs o



the world in a day-an i draw my own
conclusions tis said by the boys from
the east that men dout go t church
no more i dont know maybe not i
dont care anyhow john fairmeadows
a minister for men hes no little sister
o the rich

 at this time he had headquarters
with one-eyed mag which kept the
mother-used-t-make-it restaurant near
tin depot at thirty drinks a large an
flabby lady not open t suspicion a per-
fectly respectable person poor soul 
account o one eye an various other
varieties o looks-these same head-
quarters bein a home-made institution o
one room with a barred window for the
confinement an cure o the snakes
there was a bit of a mystery at mags
too with which the parson had nothin
to do twas in the shape of a wee small
girl-a pretty little rogue called angel-
which mag foster-mothered like a lonely
hen an twas this child that had led
gingerbread jenkins around by the
hand at thirty drinks while the wish
for liquor was yet on him twas a mys-
tery flint couldnt be accounted for by
 guessin the boys o thirty drinks
was able for twas said that a lady
from big hapids come t see the child
when nobody was lookin-a real lady o
fashion with reasons of her own-an im
able t say as it turned out that a lady
from nearer than big hapids would often
slip in at the kitchen door of a dark night
t see little angel put t bed but it wasnt
no lady o fashion

    im a converted man parson says
gingerbread jenkins one day in the fall
 but im jus as much ashamed o my-
self ns t used t lie seems t me says
he  that a converted man ought t lie
doin somethin

  youre workin gingerbread says
the parson

   oh shucks says gingerbread  any
fool can work i mean somethin big
an real

    for example what  says the parson

    well says gingerbread jenkins
 takin care o somebody

    for example who v says the parson

  well says gingerbread somebody

 but whof

    well says gingerbread  a woman
ft

harpers monthly magazine

eye for a long time so says he

    yes says gingerbread  seems t
mo that every decent man ought t be
rnkin care of a woman whether lies a
converted christian man or not whats

body says the parson

he the better id like it you see says
he  thats a mans business

bread jenkins  im not give t talkin

ter measure an see

   the parson walked the floor in a deal
o trouble by an by he come up t
gingerbread jenkins again an looked
him right in the eye it was then toward
the evenin john fairmeadow says an
john fairmeadow turned gingerbread
jenkinss face t the window an looked
into his eyes an tried t search the last
places of his soul gingerbread jenkins
says that he couldnt stand it  longer
by an by an that he looked away from
john fairineadows eyes t the sunset
clouds beyond the pines an that he was
afraid but didnt quite know why

    jimmie says john fairmeadow
 listen t me well im goin t measure

 i believe you i believe in

your humility an in your love o the
world for loves sake i dont misunder-
stand  i know love healed you whether
you know it or not in these words an
now tis in your heart t love that some
other one may be healed by love also
i believe that you want a woman t take
care of-t guard an cherish from the ills
o life-because you believe it t be tlie
duty o men t care for women listen
t me well jimmie jenkins im goin
t measure you now you may do if
you will what no other christian man
i know or ever knew-not i most of all
god help me-not i-would do for loves
sake stand up jimmie jenkins says he
 an be measured by the measure o love
gingerbread jenkins was frightened
 whats all this parson  says he  what
you mean 

    i know a woman

    a needy woman with a heart turned
toward n love just like this

kins

gingerbread jenkins  the mother o

parson  is no lady

while portrait-painters portray things seen in
every work of the highest rank the element of
individuality the subconscious self of the sitter
rises above external likeness and awakens a lasting in-
terest portraits in which this quality is vividly brought
out will interest beholders years hence to whom the sitter
is wholly unknown great portrait-painters always reveal
deep consciousness of the personality of their sitters
hinting at things thought felt and dreamed about
knowing such portraits one never confuses them they
stand forth as distinct revelations showing the painters
gifts of perception and power to lift his work upon a
plane beyond the ability of common mortals and to send
forth some message that will meet the needs of the soul
from this point of view it will be seen that it is not the
subject but the artist and what he contributes which
gives the abiding interest to a portrait

  the range of mr chases achievements is remarkably
varied in bis portraits which are now under con-
sideration his expression has striven to meet the demands
made by the individuality of his subject his visual
perception is extraordinary hut with all he may do of
set purpose in recording what his eye sees more is accom-
plished by the eliminating aud harmonizing process of the
unconscious mind in its effort to express the hidden im-
port of character hut fashions in feeling and in the
way of seeing men and things change with the ages
that is why the art of to-day is unlike the art of the
eighteenth or the sixteenth century the glory of chase
or sargent differs from the glory of gainsborough or
van dyck or titian the taste of to-day demands of
the painter truth and vigor rather than courtly elegance
hence from chase or sargent we never look for the grace-
ful flattering portrait of those earlier times but we
do expect a likeness marked by vitality showing the
artists individual gifts of perception but without arti-
ficial embellishment or idealization

the microbe as social reformer

            by robert w bruere

    general agent of the new york association for improving the condition of the poor

ix the sumraei of  the startling
news hashm across the world that
tho hosts of cholera had risen up in
persia that they had inarched through
russia and western europe destroying
thousands that hamburg was under
siege and that the scourge was about to
invade america on the st of au-
gust the cholera-ridden steamship mo-
ravia was reported at quarantine in new
york with the normannia itugia
scandia heligoland bothnia all from
hamburg following in close order

  had the pied piper threatened the de-
faulting burghers of hamelin with a re-
turn of all the rats he had piped into the
river weser with all the rats of hanover
eity besides those over-thrifty bruns-
wickers could not have matched the terror
of new york-and for that matter of
the entire menaced nation-seventeen
years ago yet strangely enough it
was this very intensity of the popular
fear that was destined to make tlie
cholera of  remarkable for its be-
neficent consequences

  for fully a decade the officers of the
new york health department instruct-
ed by the discoveries of such scientists
as pasteur and koch had asked in vain
for a bacteriological laboratory as a base
from which to make thoroughgoing war
not only upon epidemics such as cholera
and yellow fever but also upon all forms
of endemic contagion-diphtheria tuber-
culosis and the like but in those days
even the medical profession were disposed
o ridicule the idea that myriads of little
bugs  could flourish upon the minute
corpuscles of the blood to our bodily de-
duction and ns for the people at large
who were in the last analysis respon-
sible for the denial by the stolid financial
nuthorities of the health departments
request-their state of mind was pre-
cisely like that of the dwellers in the
nneient turkish city of van of whom
mr f i greene then a missionary of

the american board tells me the follow-
ing story

  a caravan had brought cholera into
the city over the route travelled centuries
before by xenophon and his ten thou-
sand the disease spread rapidly for its
progress was greatly facilitated by tlie
water-supply that came from a near-
by mountain and ran through the streets
in open ducts

  the population of the eity was equally
divided between mohammedans and ar-
menian christians the missionaries
knew that cholera entered the body only
through the mouth and that the microbes
might be destroyed by high temperature
they determined accordingly to persuade
the people to boil their food and drink
ami sterilize their cooking utensils the
mohammedans were impervious to ad-
vice they declared that inasmuch as
allah had written upon every mans fore-
head the precise moment and manner of
his death it was both useless and blas-
phemous to try to thwart his will by
infidel precautions the armenians
while not equally fatalistic showed like
their contemporaries in new york the
indifference born of ignorance it was
only when people began to die by the
hundred that the fear of death stirred
their lethargy then they turned to their
priest hovsep vartabed for help

  now when the missionaries had asked
hovsep v art a lied to explain to his congre-
gation the nature of cholera he had re-
plied that the lives of the people were
in the hands of the women who prepared
the food and that they were too ignorant
to comprehend the difference between a
germ and a mountain-lion but the in-
genious priest had resources of his own
he gathered his flock into the great arme-
nian church and when they were packed
as close as they could sit upon the floor he
put on his flowing clerical robes mounted
the pulpit and shaking his long bony fin-
ger began to harangue them as follows
harpers monthly magazine

 

   have  not told you miserable sin-
ners that unless you repented and were
more zealous in your religious duties
god would surely punish youbehold
he has permitted the water to swarm
with little snakes so that the people per-
ish whence came these snakes  verily
i say unto you that they are nought but
devils that god has unloosed from hell
to chasten you sinners disguised as lit-
tle snakes they hove fled to the water
to cool off woe unto them that drink
tho cup of satan or cook in unhallowed
water for them the devils will surely
seize and destroy there is only one way of
escape make the water so hot that the
imps will be glad to run back to gehen-
na whence they came when the water
boils you may know that every bursting
bubble is a devil that leaps from the pot

  this announcement was received with
cries of alarm and moans of repentance
the women did not wait for the benedic-
tion they arose like startled pigeons
rushed home and began boiling busily
and it was fully two months after the
last case of cholera was reported that the
kettles of van cooled down

  the new-yorkers of s were quite
as benighted in respect to public health
as these armenian christians only they
were far less religious so that when the
cholera-ridden ships ot their gates ter-
rified them with the fear of death they
turned to the health deportment as
the people of van turned to their priest
for protection

  the department did not answer with
a fable its officers simply renewed their
request for a bacteriological laboratory
they explained again that cholera was
nothing but a microbe or rather swarm-
ing myriads of microbes as destructive
to man as the seventeen-year locusts to
the plants of the field but so infinitesi-
mally small that they might easily elude
the utmost vigilance unless the depart-
ment were equipped with the powerful
lenses essential to microscopic research
and this announcement too was received
with expressions of alarm and repent-
ance-and the hoard of estimate and
apportionment voted the requisite funds

  thus it was that the cholera of 
caused the establishment of the first
municipal bacteriological laboratory in
the world and not only inaugurated a

new era in governmental methods of con-
serving public health but also gave a
fresh impulse to the revolution that
science had already initiated in the
popular fatalistic conception of disease
and death to-day the scouts of tlie
laboratory keep sharp watch not only of
the ships entering the port but also over
the milk and water supply the oyster beds
the meat and vegetable markets and all
the various channels within and without
the city through which destructive mi-
crobes can enter

  already the results have been inspiring
and justify the department in adopting
the motto of pasteur that it is within
their power to rid the city of every para-
sitic disease hardly excepting old age
itself there is a certain dramatic in-
terest in the mere recital of some of the
tacts of achievement

  in november  tlie packet-ship
new york arrived from havre with
cholera on board during the remainder
of that and the following year  peo-
ple died in a population of  in
november  the steamship atlanta
also from havre arrived with cholera on
board during the remainder of that and
the following year  people died in
a population of  in  the
date of the bacteriological laboratory
only nine people died in a population of
 and what is of special sig-
nificance the disease was not only re-
stricted to a few coses but to quote the
con temporary report of the health de-
partment each case was confined prac-
tically to the room in which it occurred 
showing that epidemics can be prevent-
ed by isolation scientific care and dis-
infection when the microscope definitely
reveals the whereabouts of the disease-
hrecding germs

  since  cholera has been unknown
in new york moreover typhus fever
that before  took many lives each
year has entirely disappeared typhoid
though its annual toll is still high owing
to its ability to steal into the city in
milk on fruit on the legs of the common
house-fly and especially in the bodies of
so-called  typhoid - carriers  - bakers
dairymen and others who once having
had the disease retain it in their systems
after recovery and spread it through the
food and drink they touch-is no longer
tie microbe as social reformer



nn epidemic disease when it pulls off
an outbreak an the health depart-
ment calls its sporadic appearance it is
swiftly localized thanks to the micro-
scope and usually as swiftly suppressed

  in  diphtheria destroyed in what
is now greater new york  lives and
 in  then in  the bacteri-
ological laboratory reinforced its micro-
scopic work with the manufacture of
diphtheria antitoxin the deaths from
the disease immediately diminished until
in  they had dropped to  al-
though the city had added a million to

its population

  in brief the microbe by appearing as
the true cause of pathological conditions
has shown how disease may he conquered
in new york as elsewhere when similar
methods have been adopted the general
death rate has splendidly fallen-only
from  in the thousand iu ii to
 in  but then to  iu 
when the laboratory began its work to
 in  nnd to  in  if
the death rate of  prevailed to-day
the citys annual mortality would be in-
creased by  souls

  surely this is an inspiring record
and yet since  the general death rate
has again become almost stationary what
is the trouble there has been no slack-
ness iu the administration of the health
department but an examination of tlie
departmental records reveals a curious
faet the diseases that are stationary or
whom destructiveness is actually grow-
ing nre the diseases of poverty pneu-
monia that preys upon the fatigued ami
those whose resistant vitality is low
tuberculosis that haunts the huddled tene-
ments and those diseases of infancy that
multiply where mothers are frail or over-
worked or cannot for various reasons
nurse their children-diarrhea and so-
called  congenital debility

  with these and especially with tuber-
culosis and the aforenamed diseases of
infancy sanitary science alone has seem-
ed unable to cope accordingly as pecul-
iarly the diseases of poverty they have
opened the doors of the health depart-
ment to  social  workers-that is to tlie
servants of organized charity the mod-
ern samaritan

  soon after the establishment of tlie
municipal bacteriological laboratory a
vol cxxi -no tu-

change took place in the theory of phi-
lanthropy no less radical than that in-
augurated iu the popular theory of dis-
ease by the cholera microbe itself the
paid social workers who had begun to
be entrusted with the administration of
the great charities were abandoning the
idea of poverty as the heaven-inflicted
penalty of moral turpitude the perpetual
harvest of eves great transgoession
under the influence of social economic
thinkers they were shifting the respon-
sibility for human waste as poverty was
coming to be called to social environ-
ment aud adverse economic conditions
moreover they held the doctrine of
surplus wealth based upon the knowl-
edge that industry directed by science
was producing more of the necessaries
than tho race required for its vigorous
and healthful sustenance if some part
of this surplus wealth could lie applied
to the wretched environment of the poor
poverty these social workers had begun
to believe would iro the way of epi-
demic disease

  an analysis of the records of the great
charities shows that disease is a serious
disabling factor in fully three-fifths of
their eases of dependency the records of
the health department show that fully
three-fourths of the cases of tuberculosis
and infant mortality are related to pov-
erty clearly there was need for an al-
liance between these two divisions of the
citys human repair-shop

  the samaritan took the initiative and
brought to the problem a point of view
somewhat different from that of tlie of-
ficers of the health department the
health officers with their bacteriological
laboratory were primarily interested in
the detection and annihilation of rui-
c robes the philanthropists were con-
cerned with improving environmental
conditions and with lightening tlie load
of the poor so as to increase their fund
of vital resistance in  the charity
organization society created a special
committee to look into the  social as dis-
tinct from the medical aspects of tuber-
culosis and to study the relation between
this disease and overcrowding infected
tenements and unhealthful occupations
it was soon found that tuberculosis
flourished most rankly where rooms were
overcrowded budgets were small and


harpers monthly magazine

people were ignorant of the laws of
hygiene bail housing and ignorance
were set down as the chief social causes
of the disease the charity organiza-
tion society had been largely responsible
for the creation of the new tenement
house department and for the new tene-
ment law tliat was intended to put an
end to dark unsanitary dwellings what
seemed now most needed was a campaign
of education especially among the poor

  accordingly there began a shower of
tracts and pamphlets that for number
were like the sands of the sirocco cir-
culars were issued by the hundreds of
thousands the public bill-boards became
familiar standards of the double red cross
lectures were delivered and handbills
distributed in schools and settlements in
churches and vacant stores-even the
street-car transfers bore mottoes of advice
and warning which were thus published
to the number of fifty millions in a single
year people were told not to spit to
keep themselves and their homes clean
to eat good food and enough of it to
ventilate their bedchambers thoroughly
and in case they themselves were already
infected to move from dark rooms to
rooms that were bright and sunny to
sleep in the open air when possible and
if their disease were for advanced to
leave their occupations betimes and to
seek a cure in a sanatorium public or
private the gospel of the anti-
tuberculosis campaign- tuberculosis is
curable communicable preventable-
was carried into tho tenements for the
inspiration of the prior by the visitors
of a hundred charities it was repeated to
them at the public dispensaries and
preached to them from the pulpits

  but iu spite of so much admirable
effort at the end of seven years the com-
mittee on the prevention of tuberculosis
issued a booklet in which it declared
that  contrary to the popular impression
the tuberculosis death rate has not mate-
rially decreased during the last seven
years    the problem is quite beyond
the grasp of private philanthropy and
can be properly dealt with only by the
forces of government

  now why this remarkable admission 
the part of the modern scientific sa-
maritan because charity however ex-
cellent its resources can only deal with

those who voluntarily turn to it for aid
whereas the microbe has taught us that
disease is war anil can only be fought
successfully by an organization that is
permanently  a war footing with
the growth in the public knowledge of
contagious disease the police powers of
the health department have been stead-
ily strengthened both by law and by pub-
lic opinion the health department can
compel physicians to report every case
of contagion from leprosy and smallpox
to tuberculosis and measles it has au-
thority to enter the homes of the infected
it can take sputum and specimens of
blood for examination at the bacteriolog-
ical laboratory it can compel disinfection
and cleanliness and in extreme cases
where the patient is a menace to the
health of his neighbors it can remove him
forcibly to an appropriate hospital if
disease is to be conquered charity has
concluded it must be by the will of the
people working through government

  it is impossible to exaggerate the im-
portance of these official prerogatives
rut heretofore they have been largely
ineffective because the health depart-
ment has not been granted sufficient
funds the facts in tho case are aston-
ishing the records of the department
show that there are at least  con-
sumptives in the city that of this number
only  are in the care either of
private practitioners or of physicians at
public dispensaries and that even the
whereabouts of  are entirely un-
known it is as if the enemy had stolen
through the pickets at night and there
were no police or soldiers to follow them
the tuberculosis bacilli swarm through
the city  silent wings grimly laugh-
ing at pamphlets and lectures anil scat-
tered deeds of charity which they find it
so easy to elude

  accordingly last year the committee
on the prevention of tuberculosis con-
centrated its energy and that of the al-
lied samaritans upon the city budget
with the result that the yearly ap-
propriation for the war on tuberculosis
was increased by a quarter of a million
making the total of approximately -

	available for the tuberculosis work
alone the division of commuhieable
diseases in addition to reinforcing the
bacteriological laboratory will have
tiie microbe as social reformer



twenty-five disinfectors thirty-six med-
ical inspectors fifty-five attending phy-
sicians and the imposing number of one
hundred and fifty-nine trained nurses

  tho city has been thoroughly dis-
tricted each one of the  new
cases of tuberculosis that are reported
yearly will be visited by a nurse the
diagnosis will be confirmed by the labora-
tory when tuberculosis exists the pa-
tient will be urged to put himself under
medical care and if this is financially
impossible to attend one of the clinics
of the department his children will lie
examined by the physicians of the de-
partment incipient cases will he taught
how to prepare their food how to dress
how to ventilate how to devise inexpen-
sive outdoor dormitories for many of
i hose in the first stages of the disease
provision is being made at the magnif-
icent sanatorium maintained by the city
in the hills of otisville those who are
a public menace will be removed to the
departments isolation hospital on north
brother island or otherwise provided
for never was there such an army for
i he building up of health put in the field
by a municipality except once

  for many years the diseases of infancy
have lieen even more destructive of hu-
man life than tuberculosis in new
york for all its high rank among health-
ful cities approximately	infants
die annually ninety per cent of them
ii is estimated from preventable causes
in  the new york association for
improving the condition of the poor
inaugurated a campaign against infant
mortality whose contributory results
quite parallel those of the anti-tuber-
culosis campaign

  tlie roots of the campaign against in-
fant mortality strike back to that earlier
time when compassion and chivalry
rather than vital economy were the domi-
nant motives in charitable practice in
 the association secured a beautiful
seaside property named sea breeze on
the south lieach of coney island to which
parties of women and children shop-girls
and occasional work-worn men were in-
vited for a days outing the legend is
that these  ocean parties were sug-
gested by the gracious practice of the
european landed nobility who like sir
walter vivian in the princess are ac-

customed once a year to give their
 broad lawns all a summers day up to
the people in the morning the parties
gathered at the hudson piers and were
taken by steamer down the majestic bay
an hours journey to tho beach where
on open pavilions and beneath a cluster
of ailantus trees food was set before
them in the afternoon they went in
swimming splashed along the beach as
the waves dashed in or lay in the warm
sand blissfully watching the sails go
eastward toward four oclock having
received further refreshment they took
the boat again for the noise and worry
of their tenement homes reluctant and
yet happy like pippa at the end of her
new-year day and grateful to those
who enjoying the higher lot had shared
it for a few hours with them to give
these mothers one happy day and then
when necessary to pay the funeral ex-
penses of their children seemed in those
days to satisfy the good samaritans
spirit of mercy

 then came that revolution in the
philanthropic point of view to which re-
peated reference has already been made
the paid social workers discounting a
multitude of frailties imputed to the poor
and holding that if their environment
were changed and they were relieved of
the terror of want they would prove
themselves made of tlie universal day
converted sea breeze into an experiment
station to illustrate the truth of their
theory the picnic parties of a day were
supplemented by stay parties mothers
with little children were invited for two
days four days and finally a week or
more thus it became possible to show
that tlie poorest mothers when relieved
of the oppression of a sordid environ-
ment had in them the divine breath
that they were both eager and able to
learn that when given even a brief oppor-
tunity they quickly took a fresh hold
upon life classes were organized in in-
fant and personal hygiene cooking and
domestic economy the experiment grew
like rich fields well sown until the sum-
mer of  when in addition to 
day guests sea breeze entertained 
mothers with little children for periods
varying from one week to six of the
 mothers and children seven hun-
dred women and  runabouts as those


harpers monthly magazine

who can walk are called required special
convalescent care and five hundred and
ninety-nine infants were more or less
dangerously sick what simply a change
of environment and relief from hunger
can do is indicated by the fact that all
of the mothers and runabouts rapidly
recovered and ninety-nine per cent of
the babies got well

  but the accommodations of sea breeze
are at most those of a picnic-ground and
summer experiment station the wait-
ing list grew year by year until it at
times reached twenty thousand this
circumstance and the associations de-
termination to bring home to the public
the enormity of the human waste in-
volved in tho yearly holocaust of seven-
teen thousand infants to ignorance and
poverty prompted a further experiment
to test tho methods of sea breeze within
the tenements themselves

  from a base on a el ill overlooking
the tide-washed east river where six
 shacks  were opened for the hospital
care of sick babies and where classes for
mothers were regularly held a corps of
trained nurses was sent from tenement
door to tenement door in quest of all
children under two not with the pur-
pose of herods men but to win the con-
fidence of the mothers to educate them
in the elements of infant hygiene to
bring such of them as were in obvious
need to the attention of relief agencies
and especially to see to it that sick babies
received proper medical or hospital care
before their illness became acute in the
summer of  these junior sea breeze
nurses visited one hundred and two thou-
sand tenement families found thirty-five
thousand five hundred and seventeen
babies under two years of age and in-
structed their mothers in cooking infant
bathing and dressing household sanita-
tion and ventilation and kindred subjects

  and that summer while the infant
death rate in the city at large increased
the deaths in the ward where the nurses
worked fell off eleven per cent

  the demonstration was accepted on all
hands as conclusive and had as its major
result the concentration of philanthropic
interest upon the health departments
request for funds to establish a compre-
hensive child-saving service in  the
department taking advantage of the

growing public realization of the menace
of contagious disease had secured the
appointment of one hundred and fifty
medical inspectors to examine suspected
cases of contagion in tho schools owing
largely to the opposition of private prac-
titioners who disliked seeing the public
service encroaching upon the field of
medicine the appropriation allowed only
thirty dollars a month for these first
school physicians in  however
their salaries were increased to one hun-
dred dollars and they were required not
only to examine children in school but
to visit absentees in their homes the
same year a small group of nurses was
added to aid in the war on the microbe

  then in  largely as the effect
of the junior sea breeze experiment on
tho public mind the department secured
approximately  for the creation
of a bureau of child hygiene to this
division there are now attached 
nurses and  physicians again the
city has been thoroughly districted the
childrens corps examines every school
child not only for symptoms of con-
tagion but also for every possible physical
defect and a system lias been devised
by which the department can see to it
that all diseases are treated and all phys-
ical defects corrected or removed in
addition to the school children it is the
plan to have this staff of civil servants
attend to the babies within their re-
spective districts last april they began
to visit all infants whose births were
reported by midwives tlie law compels
the reporting of all birt hs nndcr penalty
and whose addresses made it doubtful
whether their parents could afford proper
medical attendance at present the
school children are monopolizing the
strength of the division of child hygiene
during the school term but the plan pro-
vides that in time no child shall be born
to the city whose mother may not com-
mand expert nursing and medical counsel

  a far cry this from the priest in van
working on the superstitious fears of his
congregation more than six hundred
men and women devoting their lives to
a municipal campaign for human con-
servation  and in a very immediate sense
it all grew out of the cholera invasion of
 surely the microbe deserves to
rank well among social reformers
the way to the wedding

by margaret cameron

it was tlie wednesday after easter
the year being unimportant need
not lie specified suffice it to say that
although the subway had ceased to be a
novelty in new york it had not yet been
extended to long island and brooklyn
bridge was still the greatest thoroughfare
across the east river

  ned mcewen strolling along the sec-
ond level of the great bridge on his
way to that part of the borough of brook-
lyn known as bay ridge where he was
going to see howard forbes married
caught sight of a large bulletin an-
nouncing the train he sought and near it
an ascending stair toward which he turn-
ed a moment later his attention was
attracted and held by a young woman who
stood just beyond the ticket kiosk first
because hers was the fine free uncon-
scious type of beauty of which he had
dreamed much during his long absence
from his native land and later because
she seemed although in evening dress
to lc alone and watching for some one

  as he approached and her scrutinizing
glance passed from other faces to his she
started stared for an incredulous moment
and moved swiftly toward him smiling
and holding out her hand

  ned mcewen of all men she re-
joiced  cant be mistaken you are
ned mcewen 

   i never doubted it before he warmly
assured her and there was nothing in his
manner to indicate even to a keen ob-
server that he had not the faintest idea
who she was or where they had met  but
ts so long since anything as delightful
as this has happened to me that it makes
ine question my own identity

  oh yes she nodded laughing and
withdrawing her hand from his youre
manifestly ned mcewen and neither
tune nor tide has changed you a bit

   nor you said he

  tiis congenital inability to remember

faces was a failing concerning which
mcewen was extremely sensitive and so
cleverly had he learned to conceal it so
expert had he becomo in tracing connec-
tions during an apparently casual con-
versation that only his closest friends
realized how often he was at a disadvan-
tage it was instantly apparent to him
from this girls manner that he had at
some time known her rather well and he
hoped by dissembling his perplexity and
by careful probing to discover her identi-
ty without betraying his own weakness
so he smiled cordially down at her re-
peating  nor you

   of course youre going to the wed-
ding she affirmed rather than ques-
tioned and here he congratulated him-
self was his first clew since he hod
never met florence keeler the bride of
the evening this ready inference as to
his destination argued that he was in-
timately connected in his companions
mind with howard forbes straightway
ho began calling to mind girls whom both
he and forbes had known and they were
many but into none of those memories
could he fit this woman meanwhile
ho responded

   of course t am and you

   naturally but what i want to know
is how you happen to be here i thought
you abode in some outlandish tropical
clime cuba was it or-somewhere in
central america

   neither i live in mexico i hope
you know the difference he whimsically
commented  few people do i find

   i think ive heard that cuba is
bounded by san juan hill and havana
harbor was the dry retort but as to
just where mexico leaves off and central
america begins-frankly i shouldnt care
to lie asked your home is still in mex-
ico then

   my work is still in mexico he dis-
criminated  home i have none except
 ned mcbwen of all men l

in the broad sense perhaps one has to
live some time in foreign countries to
realize that  home in the last analysis
really means almost anywhere within the
boundaries of ones own country

   yes i know said she and imme-
diately set hi in wondering whether she
had lived abroad  then you dont
like mexico

   on the contrary t like it very much
he declared conscious that she was learn-
ing a pood deal about him and telling
nothing of herself  tts the most pic-

turesque-and in many ways the most
interesting-country in this hemisphere
but im an american and this is  home
and i hadnt been here in so long that
the social side of me was getting atro-
phied so when i received howards letter
urging me to come to the wedding and
meet some of the old crowd again i de-
cided that the moment was auspicious-
and here i am now thats enough about
me tell me of yourself

 oh theres nothing about me that you
dont already know from howard and the
the way to the wedding

rest she carelessly returned  when did
you arrive

   this afternoon

 then you havent seen howardi

   i havent seen anybody but you and
i dont think you realize what abomi-
nable correspondents howard and tho
rest  are

 oh - really havent they told you
anything about me a flicker of amuse-
ment came into the womans eyes and
she looked at him so quizzically that he
quaked lest he had made a false step
her next words relieved him  youre
sure the fault wasnt with the postal
service because i seein to remember
hearing rumors from time to time that
you must be either dead or paralyzed-
or married

   well-guilty he confessed and they
both laughed  i like to get letters-
and i always intend to answer them
virtuous person thats so enlight-
ening to your friends still-good in-
tentions are said to make excellent pave-
ment by the way were going to a wed-
ding and inasmuch as tempus has prob-
ably not abated his usual pace dont you
think we should be fugitting ourselves
 by all means but-are you alone
i thought-you seemed to le waiting for
some one

   i half promised to meet the taylors
here-you dont know them i think-but
as theyre always late i warned them that
i should go on with any acquaintance
who come along-and yon came she
shot a roguish glance at him to which
lie promptly replied

  then lets go quickly lest they arrive
aud smil my tete-a-tete with you

 do you know that this is the way
she demurred as he turned again toward
the near-by stair  would it be better
to ask and make sure

   oh no this is all right asserted
meewen

   youve been over to the keelers be-
fore then

  never but howard sent me most
explicit directions this is right he
began to realize that lie had entered upon
a path beset with dangers unforeseen and
that if lie was to be alone with this girl
all the way to bay ridge be must cither
hud out quickly who she was or be igno-
niiniously detected therefore as they

climbed together to the upper platform
he hazarded  from your unfamiliarity
with brooklyn trains i take it you have-
nt seen a great deal of miss keeler

   no-not a great deal she admitted
and again her amused speculative glance
disquieted him  to be sure  called
upon her-this was apparently a casual
afterthought-but that time i drove
over with bobbie and some other people
so  learned nothing about trains-except
that its wiser to take one she chuc-
kled reminiscently our driver didnt
know brooklyn-aud of course none of
us diil wo got lost and drove all over
the place and were disgracefully late
when we finally arrived at the keelers
 i begin to understand why howard
wrote me that i could drive if i wished
but that he strongly advised the train
said meewen laughing at the time
this conversation took place it will be
remembered taxicabs were unknown in
new york and automobiles were com-
paratively few

   did he good for howard ill tell
bobbie that bobbie was furious-indeed
we all but came to blows-because i
simply would not have a carriage to-
night having had one experience in
driving from new york to bay ridge i
knew id have to start liefore dark with
my dinner in a basket and a map of
brooklyn in my hand or else risk miss-
ing the ceremony and t much preferred
to come this way-especially as i ex-
pected to meet the taylors here by the
way bobbies sick to-night thats the
reason im alone

  oh then  shall not sec him at the
wedding he regretted racking his brain
for memory of anybody named robert
among forbess friends then to explain
what must seem to her an unpardonable
oversight  i-i hoped he might be com-
ing over later

  oh you remember about bobbie
then you waited a long time before
mentioning it

   ive been far too busy thinking about
you to waste any time on  bobbie  he
avowed truthfully enough was the man
her brother her cousin then for the
first time it occurred to him that sin
might be married could this bobbie
be her husband a line of cars wound
toward them around the loop and he

added  were in luck here comes our
particular serpent

  are you sure she queried there
are so many of these trains woiddnt it
be well to ask some one about it 

   it isnt necessary this is the one
he affirmed   fifth avenue -you see
the sign on the front thats the train
howard told me to take from this plat-
form its all right

   brooklyn bridge always was n mystic
maze to me said she preceding him into
the ear  i have never crossed it with-
out asking directions of every uniform in
sight men never do that do they but
then slyly  there are so many things
we women dont know that it doesnt
mortify us particularly to acknowledge
our ignorance of one more at this
mcewen turned a penetrating glance
upon her but she smiled back at him
with such frank amusement that he de-
cided it must have been a random shot

   now he enjoined as they found seats
and settled down for a long chat tell
me all about yourself

   what do you want to know

   everything

   thats rather a large order ned she
parried laughing  shall i begin with
my name age color and previous condi-
tion of servitude

  do he lightly recommended de-
voutly hoping that she would and at the
same time wondering uneasily how well
this smiling woman had known him and
liis weaknesses  why not lie thorough 
why lie obvious she tossed back
 my name you know my age-you should
be able to approximate my color speaks
for itself and my servitude past and
present i prefer to forget-when i can
still i was prepared to offer them all up
in identification when i saw you coming
why he boldly challenged did
you think my memory so much less trust-
worthy than yours

   everybodys memory is treacherous
sometimes isnt it she submitted sim-
ply  i know mine is and it wasnt to
be expected that you should recognize
me so promptly

   again why he was watching her
narrowly suspecting mockery but al-
though she was laughing a little her eyes
and lips seemed guileless

  oh-because its so many years-

 j ust how many  do you remember
he interrupted grasping at this opportu-
nity  i confess to being a little shaky
 its tactful of you to forget some
tilings she commended

   it isnt tact its fact im afraid
ive really forgotten do you know just
how long it i since we last met

   yes i remember exactly-but its
more years than you should ask me to
count to be sure they havent made
much outward and visible impression upon
you but people say im changed you
dont find mo so she looked at him
with a doubtful half-smile and he felt
that perhaps he had entangled himself in
this web quite needlessly apparently
she had not expected him to recognize
her however nothing remained to him
now but to persevere in tlie course he
bad chosen so he stoutly declared

  not a bit you look just as you
always did or else its your voice-or
possibly your smile there arc so many
characteristics by which one may rec-
ognize a friend that its a little diffi-
cult sometimes to decide which is the
most potent

  indeed he was honestly puzzling over
just that point something about her
a smile an inflection a trick of the eye
lie could not quite make out what it was-
tormented him by its elusive familiarity
but when lie thought ho had captured it
and fitted it to a memory it was gone
having failed to elicit from the lady any
direct information about herself he now
determined to try negative methods if
ho could not learn who she was he would
endeavor to find out who she was not
and thus by a process of elimination
possibly solve the riddle meanwhile
though she would not talk about herself
there might be other bait which would
tempt her to disclosures

   you said  bobbie  was ill he re-
minded her positive that he had never
called any man by that name but un-
certain whether he had ever known this
one well enough to allude to him a-s bob
 i hope its not serious-but of course
if it were you wouldnt be here

   oh no it isnt serious-only uncom-
fortable its lumbago  offered to stay
home from the wedding but bobbie
wouldnt listen to it so i said id come
with the taylors my conscience hurts
the way to the wedding

ri

though lumbagos such a wicked thing
to he left alone with

   salvo your conscience then by tell-
ing mo all about  bobbie  lie suggested
smiling again over the name  remem-
ber how long ive been away and how i
hunger and thirst for news of people
begin with him wont you

   oh it wouldnt be modest for me to
talk about bobbie she laughingly pro-
tested  bobbies mine you know and
it isnt pretty to brag ask somebody
rise no really replying to a gesture
 i couldnt trust myself to talk about
bobbie it would be all in superlatives
mcewen was beginning to have an un-
comfortable conviction that his companion
was perfectly aware of his embarrassment
ami that he was being skilfully baited
and he resolved that if this were true
he would heat her at her own game dis-
cover her identity by hook or by crook
and never admit that he had been puz-
zled but to accomplish this he must
walk warily

  very well said he proceeding 
the theory that she might be marion
dcering whom he rememberer as a par-
ticularly attractive girl with a facile wit
although his mind retained no more im-
pression of her physical appearance than
as if it had been a schoolboys slate
washed clean if you wont talk about
 bobbie perhaps youll consent to tell
me about tom-who by the way is even
a worse correspondent than  am

   tom j she questioned her head tipped
to one side like a birds

   yes tom

  tom-i tom dcering

  precisely tom dcering through
half-closed laughing eyes he watched her

  he bought a fruit ranch in california
several years ago and has lived on it
ver since she glibly told him  lies
married you know

 yes i know when did you see
him last 

 i oh-i havent seen him for-
for a long time

  no he felt that he was closing in
pon her

   no

  i thought lie came east every lit-
tle while

  so he does but it happens that ive
never been here when he was

  vo cxxt-no

 no

   no by the way marion-of course
you remember his sister marion 

   rather

   shes in california now visiting
tom she informed him in a casual tone
 i had a letter from her yesterday bit-
terly lamenting that she was not to he
with us to-night and sending her love to
any of tin- old set who appeared i suj-
poso that includes you

   thanks mcewen gave no sign of
defeat  im sorry she isnt here but
hrhaps shell return before  go away
she was a good sort in the old days
another girl whom he remembered as
possessed of sense sympathy and humor
was ethel knapp who had latterly de-
voted herself lie had been told to work
in one of the social settlements ac-
cordingly he turned the conversation to-
ward philanthropy and found his friend
so responsive that he was confident he
had her accounted for at last but when
he left the field of ibstract discussion
and asked a question touching specific
details she shook her head

   i dont know anything about that
she declared  ask ethel knapp she
lives iu one of the settlement-houses you
know and can probably give you all the
statistics you want i think shes to be
at the wedding

  foiled again thought mcewen
amused despite the awkwardness of his
predicament all he said however was
good i always liked ethel apparent-
ly there are others going to the wedding
also he added as a party of young peo-
ple boarded the train and were hailed
by friends at the other end of the ear
with joyful cries above the confusion
of which detached phrases concerning
bridesmaids old slippers and rice were
distinctly audible

  twice again he cautiously felt his way
toward sirls whom he and forbes had
known and each time just as she seemed
within grasping distance his companion
swung away from him and out of the
haze surrounding her came that tantaliz-
ing familiar call from the past whether
accent or inflection or smile he could not
yet determine he was desperately east-
ing about for memory of another girl
who could possibly have grown into this
woman rejeetinir this one as too literal
harpers monthly magazine

 

and that one as too insipid when the lady
asked somewhat uneasily

  arent wo going a long way do you
know where we should get off 

   we go to sixty-fifth street the end
of the road he told her  it will be a
case of all out there so we cant miss
it then we take a trolley-car for a few
blocks and walk a block dont worry
ill get you there all right

   will you  she let him see a droll
twinkle  do you remember the night
you undertook to pilot a sleighing party
from yonkers to white plains then
they laughed together

   well-we got there anyway he re-
minded her

   yes but think of all the other places
you meandered into first she riposted

   oh not so many he defended think-
ing fast of whom had that party con-
sisted jack alden who was the host
and probably tom peering as the two
were chums lacks mother had chaper-
oned them he remembered and the
girls-  not so many-considering

    considering i suppose that being
a perfectly normal man you preferred to
wander all over the countryside rather
than ask directions she teased

   whats the use of depending upon
somebody else to tell you what you can
find out for yourself he demanded his
mind far away on that road from yonkers
to white plains marion he now re-
membered had been of the party and-
dolly bain the third girl eluded him
 wo found that road finally didnt we
 yes but not by the socratic method
she laughed no it sounds nice and
superior and masculine your reasoning
does but im afraid its superficial
either you havent gone to the bottom of
the matter and analyzed it or youre
dodging the issue--and of course you
wouldnt do that she regarded him
with mocking gravity

  never

    what never   she quoted

   by george exploded meewen  do
you remember that amateur pinafore we
gave deerine was raekstraw and dolly
bain did the soprano-whats her name
i was dick deadeye and buttercup-
he stopped short staring at her

   polly lancaster was buttercup she
supplied dont you remember polly

   remember he ejaculated if he had
not known that polly lancaster was some-
where in the orient slaking her thirst
for travel as the secretary and companion
of a wealthy and peripatetic spinster with
literary aspirations he would have sworn
that she was here beside him going to a
wedding in brooklyn she had spent only
one winter in new york visiting her
friend frances king-and in a flash ac-
companying that memory came the con-
viction that the puzzle was solved this
must be frances king but it was pollys
voice and pollys laughter and pollys
lilting personality that she recalled to
him which was not surprising inasmuch
as polly had engaged his attention to the
exclusion of pretty much everything else i
except study that winter lie had fre-
quently assured himself that he was not
in love with her but neither had lie been
in love with any one else since and he
now realized that in all these years he had
never thought of frances king except as
a sort of inoffensive and colorless ap-
panage of polly even now when he met
her face to face and found her anything
but colorless it was still polly whom he
remembered  when i forget polly lan-
caster ill be dead he found himself
saying boyishly  that was a great
winter wasnt it

   it was the jolliest winter i ever
spent she assented a trifle wistfully

   and polly was the life and soul of
it i wonder where she is now

   shes been travelling in the orient j
for three or four years with miss-with
a literary woman

   yes of course i knov that but 
mean to-night i wonder where she is
to-night 

  i heard howard say a day or two ago
that he had had a letter from her re-
cently congratulating him and so on
and saying that they were just leaving
for central india	i

    yes he told me that in his last letter
oh did he her eyes were hidden
behind drooping lids and a fleeting sinile
played around her lips

   but doesnt she ever say anythin
about coming home he demanded

   not a word

   i suppose she likes it she always 
wanted to travel i wish she woidd con
home id go a long way to see polly
the way to the wedding

 all the way from mexico here

  by george i just about would 
really i think that would inter-
est polly

 do you why i

   oh-just because few people are so
well remembered through time and ab-
-iice she gave him a glimpse of laugh-
ing eyes

  all right ill write to her and tell
her so whats her address he felt
for his note-book

  -i dont think i can give you her
address-offhand this way ill send it
 will you please thanks then it
occurred to him that as had always been
the ease he was allowing polly lancaster
to obliterate frances king in his con-
sciousness which was hardly civil under
the circumstances except for his in-
ability to remember faces mcewen had
au uncommonly retentive memory and
now that it had a clew to work from it
quickly reproduced for him tho frag-
mentary gossip about frances that hail
reached him from time to time she bad
broken her engagement to jack alden-
whereupon be remembered clinching his
certainty of her identity that sho had
been the other girl of that sleighing party
-had married an englishman whom be
hail never met probably  bobbie and
had spent at least the first year or two
of her marriage somewhere out of new
york more than this he had not heard
or if he had had forgotten

  youve been away from new york
a good deal too since the old days
he suggested

 oh then howard and the rest
did tell you something about me after
all again the quizzical amused little
smile but this time it did not fright-
en him

  indeed they did he hastened to
claim  but not as much as they should
and id like to know the rest

   oh well-if youll tell me what you
already know about me ill try to fill in
the gaps

   im afraid i dont know much aliout
you since your marriage lie confessed
eag r to show that he really had recog-
nized her  they wrote me about the
wedding and that you had gone away
and after that i rather lost track of you
i didnt even know you were back

 but isnt that quite as it should be
dont all good stories end with a wed-
ding and  they lived happily ever after 
 i hope youve lived happily ever
after he ventured

  oh quite and she looked as if
sho had

   but where have you lived

   does that matter isnt how one lives
the inqiortant thing

   now see here frances he remon-
strated stop your dodging and answer
questions for a minute

  with pleasure said she will you
first permit me to remark that its very
interesting to learn that you have at last
found out who  am

 what on earth do you mean by that 
 fess up ned fess up she urged
 first you tried marion and then you
hinted at ethel and then you wriggled
carefully toward grace-

  suffering mike he scoffed cant a
returned prodigal ask a lady about a few
other ladies without being accused by the
lady of not knowing any lady from any
other lady youll be telling somebody
next that i took you for polly lancaster
just because i mentioned her name

   no i wont t acquit you of that
she declared laughing  so you still
say that you knew me from the first

   look here frances are you serious
he grew suddenly grave himself  i
wouldnt like to have you think id for-
get an old friend now bow can i prove
to you-why theres bobbie didnt
i rememler all about him at this a
delighted little gurgle of laughter broke
from her  is there any  bobbie  con-
nected with any of those other girls

   not one she assured him  i have
the ouly bobbie there is and you did
remember him didnt you id forgotten
that for the moment ill forgive you
mui-h for that

   well are you satisfied now he de-
manded

   perfectly perfectly ned youre
adorable such a proper upstanding
man-ny sort of man

   thank you kindly now go on tell
me all about yourself since i lost sight
of you

   well-you beard about the wedding
for a year or two we travelled then
mr chichester-

     boblie 

  who else she smiled happily
lie is os you may know an english-
man nnd he became enamored of austra-
lia so he bought a big place there and
settled down to farming on a large scale
the deuce you dont look like a
farmers wife she wrinkled her nose
at him saucily do you like it

  didnt i tell you in the beginning
that i preferred to forget my servitude
why force me to talk about it

   then you dont like it

   i like-bobbie

   lucky beggar so youve settled
down in australia how long have you
been here 

   only a few days

   when did you see polly last youve
 idea how you remind me of her

   polly and i havent met in-long-
er than youd believe why do you
keep insisting  dates theyre so un-
pleasant 

   well lets talk about happy things
then do you remember-

  they drifted into reminiscences over
which they were still laughing when the
train stopped and the guard called all
out on the platform they found sev-
eral surface ears waiting and toward one
of them mcewen guided his old friend

   ned would it ik of the slightest use
to ask you to inquire about this ear and
be sure its the one we want  she plain-
tively questioned

   not a bit said he with amusement
 you havent any faith at all in me have
you do you see the illuminated sign
this car flaunts that same legend is
writ out clear and fair in the directions
howard sent me moreover do you lie-
bold all these other festive wedding-
guests piling in ahead of us

  they entered the ear and dropped again
into their reminiscent chat presently
she asked if they were not going too far
and he replied easily that it was  all
right a moment later tho ear stopped
and they left it immediately behind the
younger party whom they had noticed on
the train and whom they now followed
to a large gaylv lighted house in the
next street

  as they passed under the carriage awn-
ing mcewen felt his companion hesitate
and he asked looking down at her

   whats the matter 

  nothing - much she replied and
moved on toward the steps

  they had almost reached the top of the
stairs leading to the dressing-rooms when
some one above them exclaimed

  oh do hurry its almost time for
the ceremony now

   hear that whispered mcewen
can you go down at once

   dont wait for me she hastily
returned no-i insist somebody
stepped on my gown as we came in and it
may have to be fixed but thats no reason
why you should miss the ceremony go
down immediately-you can find me later
please nodding brightly she disap-
peared in the ladies dressing-room

  mcewen found  one whom he knew
in the mens cloak-room which was not
surprising but he was a little puzzled
when on descending to the main floor
he met  one who knew him one or
two faces among the men looked vaguely
familiar but as his half-smile won no
response he was afraid to trust his un-
certain memory and did not venture to
claim acquaintance he bowed over the
hand of the woman receiving and mur-
mured his name but others pressed close
behind him and there was time for noth-
ing more he drifted with the current
through the rooms feeling a little lonely
nnd dreary watching in each face he met
for signs of recognition and at the same
time assuring himself that one never
does know any of the people one meets
at weddings

  presently there was a stir and a whis-
per the eople crowded back toward the
walls the first strains of lohengrin came
from the hall and the ushers marched iu
two by two carrying ribbons a white-
cassocked clergyman appeared near the
altar but among the men about hint
mcewen looked in vain for a familiar
face a pink mist of bridesmaids floated
past him and the bride a very young
girl with starry eyes fixed on a youth
who presently received her from her
fathers arm

  it was all rhythmical and measured
but to mcewen it seemed a riotous jiiiii-
ble with the unreality and inconsequence
of a dream and before his dazed wit
cleared enough to show him that he bad
followed the party of young people to the
she said yed be racin up here

wrong house nnd was attending tlie wed-
ding of people he had never seen before
the music had ceased and the priest had
begun to speak

  meewen gave one desperate hunted
glance around him but he was hemmed in
rn all sides every one else was intent on
the ceremony and to force his way out
then would lie but to increase the offence
f which he was guilty there was noth-
ing for it but to remain until these pretty

children were married and then to get
away as quickly as possible he tried to
see frances chichester in the crowd near
the door hoping she had not come down
in time to make her way into the rooms
but lie failed to descry her

  it seemed to him that of nil the in-
terminable marriage ceremonies to which
he had ever listened this was the longest
but in time it was over and he struggled
ngaiust the chattering congratulatory

tide to the hall whence he despatched
a servant to find the host while he busied
himself vainly trying to discover the
woman who had come there with him

  mr denslow whose house it was ar-
rived duly and to him meewen presented
his card bis explanation and his apolo-
gies after which he hurried up-stairs
at tho door of the ladies cloak-room he
was met by a smiling maid who asked

   arre you mr mcewn 

   i am yes is there a lady-

   no sor shes gon

   gone

   yis sor but she lift this fr ye
sor she said yed be racin up here di-
rectly twas over

  meewen opened the note merely a half-
sheet of paper folded and read

   dkau ned-ive gone to howards
wedding the man at the door will tell
you the way-if youll ask him

   i low long has she been gone ho
demanded

   oh she niver tuk her tings off at all
at all she said she forgot somethin an
i was to give you this an off she wint
almost runnin

  see thank you he gave the
girl a coin thrust himself into his hat
and coat and tied at the outer door
he paused to ask of a man in livery

  can you tell me where mr keeler
lives

   yes sir four blocks down to the
left and one to the right sir

  four blocks to the left and one to the
right meewen went and there he eanu
to another gavlv lighted house with awn-
ings and carriages and sounds of mirth
and music lie slipped in quietly and
managed to get up-stairs unobserved by
any but the servants but as soon as he
showed himself again in the lower hall n
man started out of a group crying

  as i live theres ned meewen

   say you fellows has anybody seen
frances come in demanded the new-
comer as soon as he eoubl make himself
heard over the babel of welcome

 frances the other men looked
blankly at one another whos

with me but we-we got separated and
if she isnt here ive got to find her
waiting for no further argument ho
strode into tho drawing-room two or
three of his old comrades wondering at
his heels as they approached the thicker
crowd about tlie newly married pair
meewen paused

 there

with him  theres frances king talk-
ing to that young woman in yellow
frances king your grandmother
thats polly lancaster

  meewen gave the speaker one stricken
look and marched straight to judgment j
 we had all our plans made to gfl
into central india she was saying aw
be paused behind her  but then the cable
came saying miss robertsons play w
to be put into rehearsal at once so
hurried home immediately

 theyre all saying that its really
your play said tlx woman in yellow

  it isnt my play at all indignantly
disclaimed polly  i never created any-
thing in my life-except a playwright
and im very proud of her she was try-
ing to write a poor novel and i mad
her see that it was a good play that
all  had to do with it

   well polly lancaster  said mceweo

   oli said she calmly turning toward
him  are you quite sure of me tliia

labor calls no mow

sit and watch the crimson turn to gray
sweet upon the car
iu the quiet clear
falls the thrushs farewell to the day

rest is earned at last

        feel how space grows vast

in th eternal depths a star leaps bright
        faithful sentinel

all is well-is well-

naught we fear the coming of the night

       now regrets but seem
       fancies of a dream

shapes of mist that fret us not nor grieve
        through the tranquil sky
        homing pigeon fly

hopes that strayed at morn return at eve

dim the landscape grows

like a mantle close
veiling all we knew and loved before

all the voices cease

       darkness falls and peace-

and the dial points to time no rnftre
a september day on the shore

by howard

no other season by the sea is com-
parable to the late summer when
the warmer months slowly almost
imperceptibly merpe through days of a
nameless tranquillity into the more seri-
ous period of autumn yet before this
transition really begins most summer
visitors desert the shore leaving the
world of sand and wide-spread oeean to
its season of inviolable solitude indeed
if nature were conscious of this with-
drawal and now more openly and un-
reservedly informed t lit- visible creation
she could not disclose a pri nter splendor-
such a deep and quiet splendor as mid-
summer days have only suggested or par-
tially and intermittently revealed nor
is it necessary to look out upon the
royally carpeted marshes whose hitherto
unbroken summer emerald now quietly
plows with orange and saffron russet and
golden-green nor need we explore the
flowering hedgerows along the creeks-the
unfenced nature-sown gardens of rose-
blossomed mallows and yellow star-flowers
-to realize that this is the crowning
season for as i traverse the inter-
vening strip of sand push a way through
dried shrubs and through goldenrod
stalks whose filmy seeds shaken free by
my passage lightly float away upon the
soft breeze--as i pass through this tide-
made gateway in the wall of the dunes
and come out under the broad light of
the beach the wide aspects of the ocean -
shorc itself are seen to have experienced
a preat transforming change

   owing to the suns lower position in
the southern heavens its reflection even
at midday shines more broadly over the
waters and farther out to sea spreading
fields of glimmering radiance even to
the horizon then too slow flocks of
cirrus clouds drift upward from the west
over the suns otherwise intolerable rays
softening and veilinp their keen intensity
and luminously diffnsing the light so
that the deep amethystine blue of the
vol cxxi-no vu -

j shannon

upper heaven is irradiate-even the
zenith is flooded with lipht as the lower
shining reflection silvers the blue sea
and there lives along the shore on
this september day a subdued and splen-
did radiance

  how far one can see in this clarified
and crystal-clear atmosphere how more
penetrative and comprehensive the vision
has become over other times and seasons
usually the mainland is invisible or its
presence guessed rather than certainly
discerned in the quiverinp heat-baze of
summer but to-day it lies clear and dis-
tinct a low waved line of blue along the
western rim of the sea fishinp-boats in
the offing seem closer inshore than they
really arc even the far blue shades of
square-rigged sails that poise for a time
above the dim horizonhave a realized form
more distinct than previous months would
show and beyond them all farther still
trails a misty ribbon of pray the after-
math of some ocean steamers passage
golden-green sedges such as rustle above
my head and clothe the dune-slopes
about me also crown the higher sand-
hills down the shore except where the
steeper sides of shining white face sea-
ward bayherry shrubs at the bae of the
bills spread patches and irregular dark
clumps of russet-olive foliage against
pale reaches of finer grasses which clothe
the low mounds far away upon them
and over all this withdrawn realm the
low sun sheds a quiet radiance that
like some rare supernal solvent seems
to remove all harsh obtrusive appear-
ances from tlie natural world reveal-
ing its purest self perfect in its in-
trinsic excellence

  and the sea how tempered and yet
deeply expressive sound its rhythmic
thunders perhaps it is only the after-
effect of yesterdays storm which so strong-
ly swells beneath this heaving labor-
ing surf that landward rolls but an
almost conscious power seems to initiate
a subdued and splendid radiancb lives aiono the shore

the rising water-walls that advance and
with earnest intention slowly plunge to
their thundering fall as if the great ele-
ment like nn errant unwieldy instru-
ment were ot last attuned to and unmis-
takably informed with the overmastering
concord of the hour

  to-day there is little disposition to
explore the shore or to search along the
water-line for tide-cast curious forms
it is enough to look about and to breathe
this salt-tinctured atmosphere it is
enough just to rest here within the
shadow of the dunes between these two

great tranquillities that lie all aliout me
upon either hand-tlie wide-spread world
of sleeping marsh whose winding creeks
show never a soil and this other world
of the wide-spread sea whose surface
waves move over motionless depths-and
listen to tlie faint and far-called cries of
their respective inhabitants softened by
distance come the faintly audible musical
callings of gulls which are gatliercil iu
great flocks upon on offshore island at
intervals they disturbedly fly upward
from some momentary alarm then again

oil

toppingly rise in more wildly disordered
companies that take multitudinous flight
for narrow sand-spits which tlie receding
tide exposes over against my hiding-
place here they settle down and quietly
iced henceforth disturbing clamors only
occasionally rise

  meanwhile from the landward side
from sedges which border the marsh are
faint twittered songs begun-and re-
peated then quickly suppressed as if
their authors were conscious of un-
familiar even unfriendly fields and of
the mysterious forces which have brought
them here and will continue to urge
them until they set forth upon their
long southward journey for
these are well-known birds-
robins sparrows and meadow
larks - already gathering to
their autumnal migration but
these hesitating notes hardly
suggest tlieir usual confident
souks-they seem hardly more
than a memory of some long-
distant and half - forgotten
spring except for this there
is no sound no not one for
i am now so far removed from
the shore that even the muffled
crescendos of the surf heard
but a moment ago have grad-
ually become fainter nnd faint-
er until they have ceased alto-
gether there falls a sense of
pause a great silence such
stillness supernal in a hushed
universe always wins from the
thoughtful mind its deepest
response for this withdrawn
shore however solitary this
water-immensity so slowly
majestically moving in its
eternal round and this late
summer sun although it is
indeed the very apotheosis
of serenity - all these could
not alone and of themselves
apprise one in this place of
absence of a presence rather
and one not far removed in
unseen worlds the tidal seas
of peace are rising ami are
overflowing their bounds benef-
icences too vast to be con-
tained there instill their es-
sence into our world

  after a time one desires to explore the
beach for last nights storm may have
east curious soa-creatures there perhaps
some of those notable ones in harmony
with the day and with our mood-those
most beautiful members of all the oceans
progeny which september gab so often
bear to the land it seems curious that
tlie ctenophores the animal forms  have
in mind should have been mentioned
o rarely in general literature and ex-
cept to the scientist are so little known

agassiz are interspersed with expressions
of wonder and admiration awakened by
the study of our living ctenophores lie

more sudden changes and presenting more
diversified and beautiful images tho ac-
tion meanwhile being produced in such a
way as hardly to be understood what
is true of this variety respecting its
curious ami beautiful activity is true
of all

  although extremely tenuous the eten-
ophores are readily visible to an eye
focussed to discern the delicate bodies as
they float in the ripples of the receding
tide lie half submerged upon the beach

or swim about in such basined hollows as
often appear along the pliable shore

  here is such a hollow filled with
limpid water i bend down to scrutinize
the clear depths and see among drifting
seaweed particles the glinting shimmer-
ing globes of almost impalpable form-
tho plcurohrorhina irideseing quivering
-plicres several half-inch globes are
idly floating near the surface as if in
temporary lassitude others glittering
with the spectrum colors which break in
brilliant waves along tlieir moving sun-
lit sides are playfully diving as if intent

and again as they move along
are jerkily retractivelv drawing
inward the two streaming pink-
fringed tentacles that soon again
unfurl to trail gracefully back-

their own

stiffly bend in curious angular

often the globe widely swings in con-
centric orbits then turns upon itself
and travels toward the bottom to
plunge against the sand with vis-
ible impact and elastic rebound it
becomes entangled with others resting
there and one expects dismemberment
and injury but in unbroken integrity
every detail id drapery is elastically with-
drawn and streamingly follows whither
the parent body leads hardly has the
mounting liell released the drooping
tissues till they deviously float below be-
fore it withdraws them unto itself par-
tially staying its course meanwhile then
again the linked cords are unloosed to
plumb the depths while tlie glittering
sphere with renewed energy and with
swimming systems beating in unison
 ictoriously rises toward the surface of
the water and the light

  as i observe pleitrobrachin circling
alxuit or diving far below or steadily
ascending through the employment of
most individual powers i almost fancy
that i am witness of some initial attempt
in adventurous flitrht and am pleased by
it- successful consummation perhaps
the emotion awakened is due in part to
the creatures comparative unfamiliarity

nevertheless no other frame in the lower
creation prompts in its contemplation a
greater feel in it of wonder and of rever-
ence a more immediate impulse to
earnest apostrophe

  hoping to discover a- larger species
for the swimming parts are very small in
these specimens i travel farther flown

basined hollows containing the small
rainbow-hued inhabitants soon many
familiar translucent bodies are seen half
stranded along the shore but although
several inches in length they are so
tenuous as to dismember if removed from
their element so  hollow away the

flowing water floats it free a jar is
brought beneath and water and all

ordinated motion watch the bell which
has again drifted to the bottom and now
reposes there in uneven balance quiver-
ing movements are visibly passing along
filaments or tule-like channels in the

with the vital processes it is upon tho
surface of the bell that our attention
really centres for along eight band-like
structures which sweep from the  hills

tion are shimmering and shining
in tlie sun and are iridescing
as continual motile waves sweep
over the minute lunged plates
that overlap in a multiplied
series down these wonderful
borders now along tho under-
most systems do the flooding
ripples more vigorously and un-
restrainedly pour until the
bodys almost imponderable
inertia is overcome when it
tilt upward nearly perpendic-
ular then all eight systems
more vividly waken and pour
their down-trending showers of
propulsive intention in waver-
ing rainbow-cascades that break
in prismatic flashes and in
scintillating gleams until all
radiant and ablaze with brilliant
iridescence the body floats light-
ly aloft we are told of the im-
pulses that pass like messages
along sensitive nerve-traets and
it almost seems as if here we

power which brought tlie visible
world into eing bad reviewed

forms of snow crystals the
transparent plates of mica which
flake from the insensate rock
and the rose-liued and purple-
dyed tissues of flowers and then

  what degree of sentiency informs these
creatures microscopic examinationwill
disclose certain structures of special sense
whose office has been ascertained a
small glittering grain or pellet is sit-
uated ot the base of a pit in the bells
depressed summit this is the cten-
ophores so-called eye or more properly
organ of direction the minute cal-
careous grain is delicately supported upon
four spring-like arms which equally hear
its weight a ciliated groove proceeds
outward from the base of each support
and separates into two divisions which
extend to the swimming-plates of the
respective sides of the bell as a slight
lilting of the bell one way or the other
causes the pellet to press with greater
force upon the spring-like arm of the
lilted side the impulse so generated is
carried along the ciliated groove to the
corresponding swimming system which
quickens to increased activity and the
animals equilibrium is restored

  before being cast on shore the eten-
ophores usually liberate their eggs which
develop through the late summer and au-
tumn then the young bells probably sink
to the deeper ocean beyond the reach of
wintry gales very little is known of
this winter history science cannot tell
in what abysses of the dark ocean they
are harbored

  but let imagination in place of cer-
titude and of observation be our guide
and we will see these creatures drifting
through the dusk of the dctep with the
curious animals of that place obscure
in cold under-sea currents that move in
undefined channels over the atlantic
ooze one hardly knows how to conceive
of these creatures wandering among the
lower life-forms of our globe so great
a contrast do they present to their com-
panions but this sojourn is only transi-
tory por when the seasons in their
revolution bring us to spring again when
the upper world universally responds
then do the ctenophores also quicken
with new life as if they realize their
pale wandering season over from the
informing spirit of the bell impulsive
waves of motion more vigorously run
from the unseen vitol centre eight crystal-
pure rivulets as of a great- and a visible
gladness well up and rise to the summit
of the bell and overflow pouring down its

veiled and globed sides a glistening suc-
cession as of tremulous and half-spent
desires wave upon wave floods down
those gleaming borders and wave upon
wave succeeds until through this in-
spired power as of an inexhaustible emo-
tion-through its ineffable impulsion the
ctenophore slowly ascends

a magnified portion of a swimming system

the minute glassy plates of plnltobrachia arc
liintiwl at the base ami fringed at their outer
extremity each plate partly overlaps the one
beneath producing a scries which sucxcsts over-
lying plates of prismatic mica

  wo trace its course through the
oceans depths peopled with strange in-
habitants that dully moving through the
ooze are ready to devour and destroy
would this winged creature only pause
in its flight and grow still but guided
by the sense that distinguishes the height
from the depth the above from the below
-guided by this one faithful sense alone
the ctenophore steadily rises through
zone after zone of ocean each concerned
with its own commerce of life and of
death until the region of the upper sea
is reached where the denizens that we
know ore fore-gathering to the spring-
and with soft contractions and with quiet
expansions as of inbreathings the veiled
body rises still only when the sunlight
shines across the green water only when
those eight quivering systems of material-
ized light are struck across by the greater
radiance to break into rainbowed irides-
cences of crimson and of purple fire only

in the sense of this great and glorious
transfiguration do tho veiled and con-
volved wings grow still anil fold them-
selves in enee and repose

  still other eteuophores drift ashore
sometimes in such numbers as to clog
tlie nets of fishermen the balloon-
sbaped body of

delicately flushed
with pale crimson
owing to the mul-
tiplied veinings of
minute canals
which branch out

ming systems and

fade for with the close confinement
the body processes wane now only
pale rainbow tints waveringly waken
over transparent plates that rise and
sink in feeble rippling motions then
feebly quiver and cease the wonderful
structures are still last crimson and
lilac gleams blanch and fade from the

visionary celestial colors as the return-

 by fannie stearns davis

  the city cries to me all day
  and cries to me all night

  i do not put its voice away
    wien i put out the light

  with stars and frost and windy things
    eternal things and still

  the city laughs and sobs and sings
    across my window-sill

  	shy of stars how wide you are

  how swept with light you lie

  yet never any leaning star
  can heed the citys cry

  	lay awake when past the roofs
    the planets all were strange

  i heard the citys wheels and hoofs
    the citys shift and change

  the planets all were greater far
  than when i went to sleep

  and one long splendor of a star
  across the dark did leap

  but oh for all they were so proud
    i heard the city cry

  and in my dreams i saw a crowd
   of wan folk herded by

  o	sky of stars though you arc great
    though dreams are heaven-high

  monotonous and -old as fate
    i hear the city cry

by olivia howard dunbar

it was already after ten although no
one had remarked it but mrs archi-
bald who always impatiently lived a
day ahead and who even in this curious-
ly intimate atmosphere could not en-
tirely surrender herself to tho moment
to any one watching us it would have
seemed as if this group of men and
women talking not in the least lightly
of other men and women of the  ad-
venture of life and of the essential ad-
venture of love-it would have seemed as
if we were gathered about some common
vessel perhaps some invisible loving-cup
from which each eagerly drank and which
each in his turn as eagerly replenished
for it wasnt merely that by such par-
ticipation thirst was stimulated rather
than assuaged-the desire with each of
us to distil and pour within the cup
the pungent liquid of his own experience
was no less obviously feverish there
was not one of us of course who did
not suppose that he had effectually dis-
guised his contributed essence yet it
was almost like eavesdropping i remem-
ber to listen to the transparent general-
izations of young reese who had been
married only a year-and who until the
last absorbing hour had found us rather
an indifferent solace for his temporary
bachelorhood and once or twice i
could see that discreet mrs seaburys
whole being was wrenched with the effort
to translate an apposite bit of auto-
biography into something decently cloaked
and impersonal oneill who was the
only professional dinner-guest among us
did as usual a good share of the talking
but even he had yielded to the spell of
veiled confession and had laid aside his
anecdotal habit a remarkable and con-
tagious intoxication prevails at such mo-
ments one knows that he must speak
but does not ask himself why and is far
from considering what

 that merely illustrates mrs sea-
bury had offered in her spirited way in

comment upon a story of oneills  that
our best energy goes to verify platitudes
were all rebels when were twenty our
lives arent going to swing tamely around
the same old tethering-stake that kept
our ancestors in that tiresome circular
groove of theirs but by the time were
thirty we see that our most profound ex-
periences have had what result why
merely that of making some drab old com-
monplace stand out in letters of fire
its so humiliating to have to rank one-
self among the spiritual bourgeois
thats why the mpst ravaging experience
is less painful than the sober sensible
conclusion it drives one to she looked
about her in whimsical defiance

  dwight the widower who was the only
stranger among us gave his hostess an
understanding glance  but thats not
the whole story mrs seabury he re-
minded her half lightly  you know
of course that theres an endless succes-
sion of such phases-rebellion and assent
rebellion and assent

   oh but i knew i hod some advan-
tage over you people who stop to think
chattered mrs archibald within whose
extravagant comments lay usually what
to me was a quite fascinating kernel of
truth it had often been observed that
ideas seemed constantly to be scampering
through this vivacious ladys head like
mice through an empty room but she
had no contrivance for detaining them
so she had to talk very fast and fever-
ishly or the notion she pursued would
escape her altogether i never think
ond so instead of having your morbid
experiences i have always the sensation
of being original and unfettered re-
flection is the most unsalutary practice
 if we had all reached ninety sidney
reese gently ventured  i suppose we
couldnt disagree about these things we
couldnt even discuss them having bad
the same emotions and experiences and
reached the same conclusions-we should
the eclectic



tuerelv sit nodding in the sun and assent-
ing to one anothers tritenesses

   there arent many of us that es-
cape oneill pursued  and yet there
are instances for example i know of
a man who thought all this over when
he was very young and thereupon chose
to discard all the notions that the rest
of us shape our lives by-chose indeed
to discard life itself as we live it and to
frame another that might or might not
be superior interesting experiment

  there were encouraging murmurs from
most of us but from dwight who until
this moment had given an impression
almost of languor the challenge shot with
a painful directness  do you mean that
you knew rendell 

  knew him  why no drawled
oneill evidently veiling astonishment
at the manner of the question which
immediately had altered and sharpened
the quality of our atmosphere  he was
a princeton man i remember somewhat
before my day and i knew several fel-
lows who used to talk about him but
i never saw him and havent heard of
him for years ive often wondered if
he arrived at anything can you
tell us

   i knew him was all that dwight
conceded his swarthy haggard face un-
heeding our curious glances

   a sane man who refused life mrs
seabury smoothly summed up i think
we shall have to hear about him that
is-was he sane mr dwight

   entirely so dwight answered with
a certain grimness  that after all was
what differentiated him the rest of us
of course are mostly delusion-fed

  its not a quality that recommends
him mrs archibald decisively ob-
served  i never like a man whom
other men praise for his sanity as for
women-but who ever describes a wom-
an as sane

  with this she rose to leave but her
hostess insisted that she stay-that she
spend the night indeed inasmuch as our
conclave seemed scarcely to have begun
and the rest of us were briskly informed
that we might leave only when the story
was finished at which we all turned
thirstily toward dwight but it proved
not so easy to induce him to begin
from the start it had of course been

evident that the subject was far from
agreeable to him-but the man had an
odd sort of literalness that made him
helpless before our persistence i am sure
that if he could have thought of an
excuse for declining which would have
been both honest and sufficient we should
never have heard the story but we were
i patient and mrs seabury wasco-
gently persuasive and at last our
friend yielded

  i knew julian rendell at college
he began in a voice that had a sugges-
tion of harshness and then paused
 if i told you about him as he was
then you would think him a prig but
he was very far from that i was one
however and that was why i preferred
sitting in rendclls room listening to
his talk to playing football with fellows
who were more of my own calibre i
supplied the only need he had at that
time which was that of an audience
and he expounded as boys do upon
pretty nearly every subject in the uni-
verse from what i can recall of his
talk i can see very plainly that this
idea of bis that oneill has mentioned
and that was to dominate his life arose
from  chance whim it represented an
essential part of his nature not that he
was jerverse-nor was lie a natural
ascetic but be was extravagantly
fastidious incredibly eclectic-i think
that best expresses him

   of course a lad of that sort didnt
take college seriously he was too ma-
ture and too positive and yet he was
more reluctant to leave it than i who
thought it a very heaven when i first
knew him i used to protest after the
manner of boys that i was tired of
lecture-rooms and that i longed to go
away and lire-and i remember how he
used to smile it interested and aston-
ished him he -iaid to observe that other
people desired  life for him the reason
for tolerating college was that it wasnt
life-that it eliminated so many gross
and painful features of life its restric-
tion and artificiality were what he com-
mended in it it hadnt any misery or
vulgarity or garishness-he would point
out to me-or social puerilities or do-
mestic dulness and these lacks lie in-
tensely valued i believed such an at-
titude to be highly admirable and though

at the time it was beyond iny reach i
hoped some day to imitate it i believe
even now that reudell really was an
astonishingly developed youth for his
years and he must have found the cub-
bishness of even the most precocious of
us hard to boar

   one day i remember that i was still
artless enough to breathe to him the
word adventure it was a noun for
which i had great awe

    do you know what people mean by
adventure  he demanded  they mean
an opportunity of violently hating a man
or violently loving a woman if possible
a tangle of both

	 i digested this respectfully as usual
i could understand that my enlightened
young preceptor was not interested in the
emotion of hate it was far too rudi-
mentary-

  nor in love innocently questioned
sidney reese

  yes he admitted love said
dwight slowly  but tlie notion he
had then was scarcely an idealistic one

   oh rendell had everything wonder-
fully settled he hadnt an uncertainty
in the world

  though rendells was always a
tutelary attitude toward me we were re-
markably close together as long as we
were in college i became very dependent
 him and i believe lie was fond of me
but after our commencement when we
all disappeared like so many drops of
water spilled from a jug i didnt see
or hear from him for two years nat-
urally there was  activity he could
logically engage in he belonged to a
brilliant and rather conspicuous family
if he had been the usual sort they would
have  arranged a diplomatic career for
him but of course with julian- in
my own case and in that of most of the
other men there wasnt much question
as to what we should do with ourselves
we simply settled down to our cut-and-
dried professions i went in witha firm
of architects and at the end of two
years felt myself a middle-aged citizen
meanwhile i had heard that julian was
in egypt but he never confirmed this-
and to this day i dont know where he
spent those years

   as soon as i heard that he was back
i hunted him up withotit delay my af-

fectionate awe of him was as strong as
ever besides i hadnt gotten that no-
tion of the importance of life out of
my head and i was eager to know if
he with his magnificent free opportunity
hadnt seen the shining light or felt the
great emotion  had  doubt as to the
experiences that would have befallen me
had i been at large for two years-my
idealism was incurable but rendell as-
sured me with a smile for my imma-
turity that he had found nothing of
the sort and indeed he bore no be-
traying signs of it if he had changed
it was merely that he had found more
things to dislike the usual pursuits of
civilized men-society sport theatres
clubs-he regarded with contempt he
scorned the professions and he recog-
nized that he had no supreme vocation
for any of the arts as a matter of fact
lie seemed to me to have an extraordinary
gift both for music and for letters but
he thought it futile to be less than
the greatest i suggested to him at this
time that he devote himself to making
books of his philosophizings but he main-
tained in a spirit that was very far from
modesty that no work of his could be of
permanent significance nothing that he
could do seemed worth while because lie
saw beyond everything that was his
curse i think an unclouded vision is
rather more than any of us can bear

   it was never until this time that
he had put into so many words in speak-
ing to me his intention to decline  life
dwight paused a little here and spoke
these sentences with a slow irony  it
seemed to me a sublime course julian
himself i regarded as an anointed being
my own content with an ordinary exist-
ence appeared nothing short of despicable

   nor did it ever occur to me that he
might weaken that was the sort he
was he compelled belief so i was not
surprised when shortly afterward he
told me that lie had bought a place down

	the maryland shore where he intended
to live alone indefinitely and to me and
to several other men he said quite casual-
ly that if we cared to see him be should
be glad to have us hunt him up but
that he should never invite us

   the following summer i took him at
his word his place wasnt easy to find
and staying with him wasnt much like
the eclectic



the usual visit he didnt of course go
in for horses dogs sport fancy garden-
ing or any of the customary  country
gentleman  pastimes no newspapers or
magazines ever came there in fact he
had no post-office address i must re-
peat however that he had no ascetic
ideal he merely chose to withdraw
himself from the vulgar the trivial the
irrational and in his view most ele-
ments in the lives of the rest of us fell
under those categories he was by no
means without his luxuries in that
hermitage of his but they were of the
most delicate and sublimated character
two japanese servants took care of the
whole establishment my host and i
didnt eat together i remember for
julian regarded that as a barbarous
custom when one of us was hungry
he merely helped himself from stores that
included the choicest fruits the most
delicate wines-

   when the invader came coolly de-
manded mrs archibald as though there
had been some transition  did she ac-
cept all this fantastic arrangement or did
she disturb it

   the invasion dwight answered
slowly  was too brief to allow of
any-rearrangement the invader was
cast out

   but so very many ladies must have
been supplicants for his hand suggested
oneil no longer able to suppress his
habitual flippancy

   this lady was not dwight grimly
stated without looking up

   i see how it was-he was in love
with her announced mrs seabury

   i have every reason to believe that
he was dwight seemed to measure his
syllables

  we all waited

    but his scheme had not in-
cluded the indulgence of that emotion
so he-declined her with the rest of life
he was a fanatic of course said
sidney reese

   no he was not but he was so con-
stituted that in the most blinding of hu-
man crises he still retained the power
of choice

  and she asked mrs seabury soft-
ly  youll have to tell us i think
dwight now looked as though he had
been swept so far backward by his remi-

niscence that he was scarcely longer con-
scious of the listeners who groped after
him nor did his narrative from this
point cost him further effort it was
rather the easier course i surmised for
him to continue and we all forbore
further interruption for in some way i
am sure we all knew that he was tell-
ing us something that he had never
told before

   the one pastime that rendell counte-
nanced dwight resumed  his thread
again was sailing the seas it had
for him none of the childishness or bar-
barity of other forms of sport indeed
in his attitude toward the sea he was
something more i used to think than
coolly reasonable it brought out a
kind of mystical fervor in him that noth-
ing else in the world elicited and al-
though he would never leave his place
for any other purpose he was not un-
willing to board a comfortable deck so
one summer a year or so after my visit
to him a friend of his and of mine took
us both cruising on a yacht there were
only a dozen of us on board and one
was a young woman who-

   oh well its not necessary for me
to describe her but any match-maker
would have delighted in bringing this
girl and julian rendell together any-
body could see what obvious complements
they were however no manipulation
was necessary in their extraordinary
ease they discovered each other within
an hour after sailing and from that
time on though without any suggestion
of coquetry on her part or mere dal-
liance on his they spent all their time
together the other people on board
leered amiably with an assumption of
understanding but those two noticed
nothing they were too desperately
serious i was the only one i think
who understood how serious they were
i knew that they were having their
supreme adventure but it didnt in-
spirit me i knew julian too well i
had too well-founded a fear of the out-
come    we were on the yacht two
weeks and when at the end we came
ashore and exchanged our cheerful com-
monplace farewells julian and-julian
and the girl smiled and shook hands   
they never saw each other again

  i think perhaps i may be pre-
harpers monthly magazine



senting his case too gently when i say
that he declined her as a matter of
fact he did nothing of the sort he
accepted her he accepted her radiant
and measureless love but he made his
own use of it

   you see it was the girls miserable
fate not to offend him iu any particular
-and nothing less than what he consid-
ered consummate perfection could do
that there wasnt a point in which
she didnt -satisfy his cruelly exigent
taste nor was his the only judgment
that found in her every imaginable grace
-of body of mind of spirit it would
have been very well if he had been con-
tent with approving but he chose to
love her and he intended that his love
-the astonished rapture that is of those
weeks on board the yacht-should not
wane he intended to preserve the lu-
minous thing forever in the crystal of
his imagination-and her presence near
him was by no means a necessary adjunct
to that feat it was something he was
quite capable of doing he knew his
powers all the poetry of love he made
his he merely rejected the prose

   we all know that the prose is less
desirable-

  dwight looked at the faces about him
-at the gallant mask that was mrs sea-
burys the anxious triviality of mrs
archibalds the smooth hard disillusion-
ment of oneills the sudden dismay in
reeses    oh it was quite plain that
his audience understood

   -the barrenness of conversation five
or ten years afterward he went on
 the tiresome inelastic matters that mar-
ried people are foroed to have in com-
mon the sometimes sordid familiarity-
we all know this but we dont speak
of it much we dont constantly face
it we dont above all things throw it
in the scales together with tlie one price-
less experience of life but rendell did
he wouldnt have the woman he loved
on those terms for him it was infinite-
ly easier to lose her her side of it of
course he didnt dream of considering
so they shook hands as i say and ren-
dell went back to his place and read
plato and took sea-baths and-well at all
events he kept himself quite free from
the disturbing or the commonplace his
existence remained entirely undefiled

  i suppose she went into settlement
work mrs archibald unemotionally
interposed

   she-married another man dwight
corrected very slowly  you see-she
was a woman of great kindness and
there was an unfortunate chap hanging
about who had also been hanging about
a good while previously and with whose
sentiments toward herself she was entire-
ly familiar so when she caught her
breath after the cruel thing rendell did
she was so thoroughly a woman she had
such a passion for conferring happiness
that she chose to confer it on the one who
seemed to her most to need it

   oh but thats so comforting mrs
seabury smiled  i was afraid you were
going to tell us something much worse

   it couldnt have been worse i menu
she couldnt have made a more serious
mistake there was no high and just
appropriateness in the marriage she made
as there would have been had she mar-
ried rendell she was too superior n
creature she had always to stoop-oh
i dont mean that it wasnt always in
the most beautiful way-but nevertheless
she stooped but of course that wasnt
the greatest difficulty

   the reason the thing was so horribly
wrong was that she was still of course
in love with rendell and there he was
in the same world with her still alive
still as she well knew loving lier at
every moment of her life she was con-
scious of the man to whom in imagina-
tion she belonged yet who had denied
her who had shut her out and that was
no fault of hers it was inevitable she
and rendell did belong to each other   
and under those circumstances you can
see that it wasnt much solace for her
to have always a secondary sort of chap
at hand as for the chap himself   

  dwight had filled the loving-cup to
overflowing now silently we sham in
the draught i fancied i detected the
others striving as i strove not to be-
tray how deeply the mans singular rev-
elations had moved us and an hour
lefore i had thought him an agreeable
but slightly arid companion

   it was an odd sort of invertd
jealousy that afflicted him i do not be-
lieve there was anything base in the emo-
tion tf jealousy was ever justified his
song



must have been he had of course mar-
ried the woman he loved your common-
place observer would tell you that should
have satisfied him-that his own attitude
was fantastic in not surrendering himself
to happiness but the wisest of you will
understand the wretched falseness of his
position you will see that his torment
-though having as he did her com-
panionship nnd the privilege of constant-
ly beholding her loveliness accepting her
acts of kindness-was undoubtedly far
greater than that of -rendell who never
raw her yet who effortlessly controlled
her life and thought oh rendell knew
jts absurd to imagine ho didnt know-
as she knew-as her husband knew but
not a word of it could bo spoken they
spent their lives in a dusk of silence-a
dusk so deep that it seemed at times they
eould scarcely see each other

   oh well i neednt go any further
i have told enough to show you how
wrongly it all turned out three lives
and not unimportant lives were utterly
wrong and all through the whimsies of
a fellow who thought too much we
muss life so terribly - the important

things at least-when we think too much
about it we ought to approach them
simply-accept them naturally perhaps
rendell knows this now perhaps it all
seemed different to him when she died
i dont know how that may have been
but he can never know how wrong he
was only one man knows that nor
would there be any virtue in his knowing
now that it is irremediable he may still
be comparing selecting declining   
at all events -dwight looked at mrs
seabury with clear candor- ive told
you all i know of him you may form
your own opinions of his theory-and of
his applications

   theres more than one deduction to
ije drawn from that story remarked
oneill trying to restore a natural tone
to our atmosphere

   only one important one said sid-
ney reese with conviction

   sidney youre all youthful aggressive-
ness began mrs archibald in a fa-
miliar manner and ended surprisingly
 if you were older youd understand-
oh well youd understand that there isnt
one of us that doesnt agree with you

song

by richard le gallienne

     all the words in all tlie world
     cannot tell you how i love you
     all the little stars that shine-

to make a silver crown above you

      all the flowers cannot weave
      a garland worthy of your hair

      and not a bird in the four winds
      can sing of you that is so fair

     only the spheres can sing of you

      some planet in celestial space
      hallowed and lonely in the dawn
      shall sing the poem of your face
the woman who was ashamed

 by margarita spalding gerry

tiie house stood out among its
weather - beaten neighbors strung
along the shady road tliat for al-
most a hundred years had been for the
village the highway of life and death
during tlie years the journeying of many
feet had left traces in tlie deep grooves
of stone door-steps while the ebbing life-
flood of the countryside had left its tide-
mark of an occasional windowless door-
less tenement the shell of a dead family
flung high by a grassy wayside

  but this house was newly painted
glaringly cheerfully bright with its reds
and yellows beside the soft melancholy
of weather-tinted shingles the walk that
led to the door was dazzlingly white with
powdered clam-shells through the wood-
shed door there was a glimpse of the
winters thrifty store of wood already
piled high although the flowers of the
brief summer were in their glory beside
the road back of tho house was the
orchard the trees heavy with still green
fruit stunted domestic familiar trees
they were that seemed to hump gnarled
shoulders and stretch limbs distorted
bearing fruit for man-longing for the
careless caress that should be the reward
of their service the only disorderly
region of the whole snug domain was
where the old stone wall that formed its
boundary from the road was buried under
the load of eager summer life that had
flung itself forward in search of a foot-
hold where it could bloom and bloom and
bloom its unthrifty prodigal joy into
thrifty brownness and seed

  but seed-time was far distant on the
morning when it caught my vagrant eye
and there was no trail of brown in all
the sweet tangle of wild-rose and morning-
glory and blacklerry vine it was the
wild roses that held me the glory and
the pathos of the northern summer-un-
matched ineffable in their morning blush
and melting curves-and to bj shattered
at the violence of another day

  as i wondered at them a little gray
figure like a shadow was visible for an
instant between the house and the wood-
shed then disappeared but in that in-
stant i caught sight of a spiall peering
face in the aperture left by a close-
clutched shawl and was gripped by the
drowning eagerness of the eyes

  i waited with an odd sense of obliga-
tion to remain-my eyes for the pink and
green of the rose hedge my nostrils full
of the delicious compound of salt and
balsam and faint sun-distilled flower-
perfumes my ears busy with the melody
wrought by the chorus of small chirping
voices and the deep organ-song of the
telegraph wires overhead chanting of the
eager work of the hurrying growing
world but my mind was concerned with
the human life that had somehow sent
me its appeal

  as the minutes passed with no return
of the small gray figure tho uneasy sense
grew that eyes were on me from behind
the closed shutters i began to cast
around for some plausible reason for
knocking at the door i was not con-
victed in my own mind of curiosity it
was merely that i knew it was meant
i should enter when one has been
friendly with elemental things for long
vacation-weeks impulse grows to have
the authority it was intended to have

  fortunately lacking noon as it was
a woman came from her door across the
road put a huge coneh-sbell to her lips-
for which bit of the old time i secretly
blessed her-and called for the midday
meal then the reason came to me-that
hunger which we at the camp so care-
fully cultivated and concerning which
we exchanged exultant meal-time notes

  i reconnoitred there was a milk-pan
sunning on a bench by the side door and
n half-submerged pail in a tiny spring-
house by the side of the brook the house
looked neat and trim and prosperous-

i would ask for a glass of milk
drawn by j a williams	half-tone plate engraved by p a pettit

         the door opened almost at the instant of my knock

the woman wiio was ashamed



  the door opened almost at the instant
of my knock-it must then have been
her eyes that i had felt watching me
and yet when i entered she blotted her-
self against the wall with her shawl still
protecting her in the attitude of one
who persuades herself she is concealed

  f i wonder if you could spare me a
glass of milk  have been walking-
i had said so much when i was halted
by the amazing effect of my words her
breath came in short frightened gasps
her wondering wide-opened eyes were on
my face what had there been so ex-
traordinary in my request was she in-
sane but i had heard nothing of any
madwoman in the locality and there is
usually not much concerning one an-
others deficiencies that neighbors arc not
willing to impart

  if you have none that you can
spare- i was turning to go when a
small claw of a hand was darted out it
seized my sleeve feverishly

 just come in-and wait-in-in the
palor she gasped her voice had the
creak and rasp of the door she threw open

  the damp earthy air of the closed and
shuttered room enfolded me as i groped
around in the dim light for a seat i
found it in a stiff horsehair-covered
chair beside the centre-table in the
gloom i dimly saw three other chairs
and a small sofa against the wall framed
photographs a crayon of a larger size a
picture of a large ship under much mathe-
matically exact sail the oval frame and
glass that sheltered a stiff wreath of
funeral flowers big shells were sta-
tioned at either end of the empty hearth
and a china dog and a small spangled fig-
ure bearing a basket were placed mathe-
matically distant from a fan-like spray
of coral  the centre of the mantel-
shelf there were in fact all of the
objects absolutely necessary to proclaim
to the world respectability-and the cheer-
less order of non-use

  before the chill had had time to pene-
trate my hostess was back one hand held
out the brimming glass of milk the other
hitched closer to her haad the shawl
i could see even in the dark that made
of her form a black instead of a gray
shadow that she watched me while i
drank it with an anxiety that had in it
something feverish and even tragic the
vot cxxi -no  - 

chilling presentiment of the abnormal
that pervaded me did not keep me from
realizing that the milk was delicious rich
creamy and that when we summer peo-
ple who scoured the country for milk and
cream were becoming accustomed to the
dismal blue that must servo for all but
the babies

   thank you so much i said as i put
the glass back in her hand  its evident
the drought hasnt affected your cows
there was a pause before she responded
to my trivial remark-a pause that car-
ried with it something of the awkward
effect of unused machinery and some-
thing of what would have seemed to
me had it not been so evident that there
was nothing in the situation to justify
it panic

   i-havent any cow she said final-
ly as if a confession had been wrung
from her

   that saves you trouble i was fum-
bling with the clasp of my chatelaine
bag-surely i had placed some small
change there

  again there was the pause that seemed
more freighted with meaning than com-
mon sense could justify and again the
unwilling speech

   havent any menfolks to do stable
chores and since the rheumatiz got
to my hands- a glance at the small
knotted hand that still held the shawl
together completed her sentence

   but how lucky you are to be able to
get such good milk from your neighbors
there is a human instinct that makes
one cram a cheerful truism down the
most unwilling throat  i wish you
would let me know who furnishes it
maybe we can beg some from him at the
camp- how much i was wondering
should i offer it seemed to bo as heinous
to give too much to our business-like
country hosts as to give too little

   most of the cows are drying up she
said her eyes uneasily on my hand and
the chatelaine bag ifits lecn awful dry
-and then the pasturage s eriving out
most everywhere about here

   but they let you have it-

  there was a long pause

   yes theyre-kind-i suppose youd
call it but then -was there a touch
of defiance in her tone - i dont use
much

   had found tho coin i sought and had
risen with my hand outstretched when
for the first time she raised her eyes and
met mine fairly small eyes hers were
twinkling warily far back in their nest
of wrinkles and they held roe while i
was made to know that a sick soul waited
fearing hoping some decision of my own
what was it why was she so furtive
so strange so hidden away yet so wist-
ful the instinct that sometimes saves
us from cruel blunders made me finger
undecidedly the coin that in every other
house of the whole region would have
been accepted without question and i
pot it away

 a sigh escaped her and her face
quivered for an instant into satisfaction
she turned and eagerly beckoned me into
the room across the entry it was a
homely worn place kitchen and living-
room together there was a small round
table covered with a red cotton cloth a
painted pine sideboard with a few pieces of
glassware on it a tarnished old  castor 
with its vinegar cruet and salt and pep-
per a flaring glass cake-dish on a long
standard a tumbler or two in the built-
in cupboard were a few coarse plates and
cups and saucers and drawn up to the
table was a cane-bottomed chair while
a black-painted rocker with a cushion of
cotton patchwork was under the window
-geraniums blooming cheerfully in old
tomato-cans poor as it was the room
was cheerful with the noontide snn
flooding it

  wont you-sit down there was
a new decisiveness in my hostesss man-
ner while she pulled the rocking-chair
invitingly forward her shawl fell to the
floor and she picked it up with a
gesture of finality and hung it on a
nail behind tlie door i glanced at the
small drab calico-gowned figure with still
growing curiosity her head was erect
and her eyes were bright and excited

   wont you-sit a while and take a
dish of tea with me her breath came
fast in an anxiety i could not disappoint
but the sense of bewilderment deepened
as i assented trying to let none of the
effort with which i spoke creep into
my voice

  then she began to bnstle feverishly
about there was at first uncertainty
in tho movements with which she raised

a leaf of the table set on it a cracked
sugar-bowl with one handle gone two
horn-handled knives and plates but
confidence had come when she paused and
looked undecidedly from me to the lowest
shelf of the corner cupboard there was
a dawning cliild-pleasure in her look
struggling with secretive cunning

   i most believe- sho paused and
drew a long breath  but there aint
anybody about here that knows she
looked at me dubiously  but -with a
sudden dash of desperate resolution-

 ill get it out 

  there was an interval of rummaging
from which she emerged holding an ex-
quisite royal canton cup and saucer deli-
cately between the thumb and finger of
either hand she set them down on tho
table before me

   there i had the whole tea-set once
my grantlier brought it to me when lie
came home from his china vvage the
year after i was married he was a sea-
captain and he owned the best ship in
the lmbor and the china trip was the
biggest thing any one about here callated
to do then

   was your husband a sea-captain too
and is that the picture of his ship
in the parlor i was admiring tlie
rich yet delicate coloring of the deco-
ration and the warm transparent tone
of tlie china

  yes but it was all tle coast trade
when he went to sea but thats played
out now-for any but the big companies
-was before he died- she caught her-
self up with a frightened glance at me

   and the china  i prompted her
gently was there then some disgrace
of the husband  i seemed to be merely
repeating lines in a play the outcome 
of which i knew but had mysterious-
ly forgotten

   well-i sold most of it not that
there was anybody would give me any-
thing like what it was worth there
aint anybody here that has the money
to- a queer gleam of malicious pleas-
ure shot across her face  my granther
could have bought and sold any of-
them in his day but i kept this one
and hid it so-they wouldnt know i
had it

    they   i had suggested the ques-
tion before i had realized how imperti
the woman who was asiiamei



ncnt it was she gave me another of her
quick dubious glances

   any of the neighbors children they
might break it its so thin she ex-
plained breathlessly  sometimes they
come in to pile vfp the wood or bring it
in for mp

   thats kind- i had legun when
i saw her wince

   they havent any call to do it-un-
less they want to she said sullenly
 and i eallnte to pay their mothers-
someway i darn their stockings some-
times or sew buttons on for them-that
is i used to but now-my hands-
slie gave an angry look at the knotted
little fingers  its because of my hands-
they- she checked herself again and
wiped the cup and saucer daintily be-
fore she put it down before me then
she went to rummaging again until she
brought out a tiny canister of tea with
a strange sprawl of chinese characters
upon it

   what tea is that t i asked  i never
saw that before

   nor ever will she amended with an
attitude of growing dignity  thats
some ive had put a way for years and it
isnt the kind that loses its strength when
its properly wrapped up either you
neednt mind drinking that it was
given to me before- she caught the
look of wonder that must have been on
my face and stopped herself with a sharp
note of impatience in her voice  ill
go out and get a stick of wood she said
dryly and went out of the room

  but she tiptoed back again in a mo-
ment to ask me with an elaborate care-
lessness that i have seen equalled only
when my little daughter prepares for me
some gigantic sprise 

   i suppose you havent seen any straw-
berries up here since you came

   no i answered taking the cue with
the ease that comes of long practice
 they were all gone i believe when
we got here

   too bad isnt it she said and
ive heard the rusticators mainly like the
flavor of the wild strawberries too well
ill set the kettle to draw in a minute
now i heard her chuckle slyly as she
dipped back again

  when she came back to place before
tee a plate of ginger cookies and a tiny

jug of cream the excited color had risen
to her face but although her voice
shook with nervousness there was a sweet
dignity in her manner as she said

   will you draw up your chair please 
wc were seated she bent her head
to pour out my cup of fragrant tea  i
will take as many cups as i can swallow
i vowed to myself as i saw her face no
little girl at her first tea-party with a
new set of christmas dishes could pos-
sibly have been more rapt

  tt was a real party as we sipped our tea
together-it actually was the most deli-
cious brew i have tasted for many a day
but she directed sly glances toward a
mysterious covered dish she had slipped
on the table at her side the first
instant when  had stopped dilating
on the tea she whisked off the cover
there was a dish of fresb strawberries
red against a wreath of their own
green leaves

   how lovely i cried out with pleas-
ure-it really wasnt any effort at all to
play my part-the sprise was un-
doubtedly charming

   they grow right back here in capn
beasleys wood-lot she beamed  yoi
neednt mind about eating them at all
theyre anybodys for the picking and
ive had so many of them im tired
naturally it was my role to linger over
each berry expatiating over its perfection
the exaefc difference in flavor between it
and the cultivated varieties the reasons
for the difference with the last berry
however i found it necessary to change
the topic

   these are delicious cookies i said
but there evidently was a false step a
pall fell over the party she hurried in
her explanation

   mrs adams-across the road-sent
them to me she baked this morning
i dont cook myself-anything fancy i
never was much of a hand to eat-and
its little i need-now just bread and
butter and tea and a mite of fish or pork
now and then she seemed trying to
justify herself in my eyes

  what kind neighbors you have i
said

   yes theyre-kind she replied

 and then it dawned on me that
i had before insisted on the  kind -
ness of her neighbors and that she bin

answered me with th same half-sullen
half-ironical intonation

  hunting around for another topic my
eyes fell on the neat and plentiful wood-
piles that i could see as i sat facing the
window so i was eloquent concerning
the pleasure of the big wood-fires at the
camp and wondered who would bring
us more bard wood that made her
wince again

   i dont know-id ruther not say-i-
get mine from capn beasley but he
dont oallate to-sell-to every one

  i realized at last that my mission in
her house for some mysterious reason
was merely to eat-that what she wanted
was to feast her eyes upon a guest at her
table so while she herself merely pre-
tended to be eating i dallied over every
ginger cookie and ruthlessly ate up
every one of them and i drank three
cups of tea with each mouthful that i
ate-nnd with each word that i didnt
say-the little woman opposite me seemed
to grow in stature and dignity i could
see her shoulders straighten before my
eyes hollows in her cheeks were filled
out the dend gray of her skin took on
a living tone her eyes came out of their
ambush and were gentle and benignant
as nature must once have intended them
to be she seemed to look at me with
affection the scant gray hair shone with
a silver lustre-the recollection came to
me of the last sunset i had saei when
the stark rocks of the island opposite had
been wrought into softened splendor by
the passing miracle of the afterglow

  at last when it seemed to me that
there was no possible reason for not go-
ing i rose to take my leave the old
woman put out her hand to detain me
she withdrew it in an instant but the
motion had made its record it was the
despairing clutch on companionship of a
desolate soul so i paused again at tho
threshold in view of the living beauty
of the outside world the jewel-studded
green the romping waves the skys in-
nocent blue she would not follow me
farther than to the door and cowered
into the shadow of its side she cast
an uneasy glance up and down tho road
muttering to herself

   if-tliey should see her the sin-
ister shadow that had been dispelled while
we sat at table fell again why was it

that she so clung to mo and of what
was she afraid

   a charming site you have here
i said

   my husband set store by it she said
dully  but i never could abide the
water when i was young

  he made you care for it i scent-
ed romance

   oh i suppose i turned fool like all
the rest when my time came i used to
go for a sail with him sometimes when id
let my scholars out and he was home from
a cruise youd think he would have had
enough of the water being first offcer
on the bo-ut he bought the next year
i mind how the girls used to plague me
with having a beau that didnt know any
better way of keeping compny than tliat
but he never yould buy a proper buggy
and he never had any eye for a horse
the sting of the ancient disappointment
was in her voice

   was he lost at sea 

   no bert died in his bed at last-and
after a good long spell of sickness that
used up everything we had been able to
put away was she really callous or
was it that feeling had been for a long
time dead but little bert want a
mite like him he was afraid of the sea
-like id been i guess but then he was
never quite right-

  i gasped with horror  oh-wasnt
that worse than-death

  she looked at me curiously i dont
know he was a great one to work it
was kind of queer too lie would work
and work and the only way you knew he
want just like other boys was that you
had to tell him when to stop hed keep
right on till he dropped

  and he died too i asked a great
pity for the desolate mother flooding
my heart

  yes- there was a fall when the
mortgage fell due-wed had to put it
back on after his father died so little
bert knew in his way that i needed
money and lie had a job of clam-digging
that paid him real well he worked awful
hard early and late one day-i was
away quilting comforts down the road
a spell  told mis allen who lived
next door to look after little bert but she
forgot so there want any one to tell
him when to stop and lie worked straight
tie woman who was ashamed

through the night and part of the nest
day when mis allen found him he
was beat out he had fallen down in a
heap he never seemed to get over it

   poor little bert- i was wondering
how mothers bear such things

   my boy was a good boy if he xvant
just right she said dully  and he
was a great one to work if lie had
lived- theres mis adams across the
road-for all she puts on so much-send-
ing me ginger cookies-all shes got ex-
cept her farm-and that isnt dear-and
her two pair of hands is that boy of hers
if she should lose him i eallate shed
be on the town fast enough

  where is your poorliouse i asked
to change her thought-the expression on
her face was not pleasant

  she drew herself up proudly   poor-
house we never had to have a poor-
house everybody here has all he wants
and money in the bank why our town
has money at interest they may liave
to have places like that far south-or
where there are a lot of shiftless for-
eigners but here we eallate to take care
of ourselves the stern independence of
her bearing was inspiring harsh as it
was  no we have never had any one
on the town since- she stopped abrupt-
ly then took up her story again hurriedly
 even after little bert died i used to
make as much as the best of them dig-
ging clams before the rheumatiz wont to
mv hands i had the mortgage most
paid off they pay two dollars a barrel
for clams at the factory

  i looked for a moment at the slight
figure the bands and turned away my
head

   it used to be real handy she reflect-
ed  theres a fine clam-bed down there
just under the bank and i was real
thankful bert had built the house here

  a gay little sloop lilted into view
around the curve of the clam-bed she
pointed out it was the zephyr and i
knew the party would be on board that
i had refused to make one of saying i
must work as it swept past lee scup-
pers properly under water sails bellying
some one eausrht sight of me on the door-
step above them and waved me an ironical
salute then the whole party stood tip
and groaned in chorus expressing sym-
pathy with the slave i had represented

myself to be marion went through a
vigorous pantomime of toil at a wash-
tub which would have been more success-
ful had she the slightest idea of the
process tom parker thumped at an im-
aginary typewriter louise gave a real-
istic touch by dusting violently the deck
cushions perry turned himself into a
street laborer breaking stones billy
sands-always the monkey of them all-
ground oxit a concert on a street-piano
they were still careening around in cyn-
ical joy when the sail disappeared around
the headland my hostess looked at them
with unnoting eyes if it want for
the rheumatiz-and if little bert had
lived-they would have had to leave me
alone i could have managed a bo-ut as
well as any man and they pay well for
fish at the factory theres mis adams
looking at us i suppose shes wondering
what im doing with a visitor and if
she knew youd been to eat with me
her face wrinkled into a thousand lines
of malice-and alarm

   thank you so much for the deli-
cious tea i said awkwardly  i feel
so much refreshed

  she bent her head with the ghost of
her gracious manner it was a real
pleasure

  again i tried to resist her unspoken
appeal and go sle shook hands with me
i went reluctantly down the two steps
that led to the dazzlingly white walk
then i turned she was still peering at
me-a drowning look

   tell me i had said before i knew
i was going to speak

  she shrank deeper into her corner
with a look of scared wonder upon her
face i climbed the steps again and was
at her side

   indeed it will do you good i said
taking the little knotted hand in mine
you need to talk to some one

  an ugly suspicion came into her face
what have yon heart who has been
talking to you  she whispered

   i have never heard your name i
looked earnestly at her to make sure
she would believe  but i have felt
every moment as if there were something
you wanted to say to me

  she made a pitiful effort at indigna-
tion  i dont know what you mean
coming here like this i dont need any
harpers monthly magazine

one to talk to-i have all i want just
because youre a rusticator- she
jerked her hand away

   smiled at her while i was waiting
to think what would move her then
an inspiration came to me that went to
tho root of the matter

   in a few days i am going away i
shall probably never be here again you
need never see me face to face another
time and even if i wished to speak
there is no one of your neighbors with
whom i have ever exchanged a word if
you like ill give you my promise-

  she shook her head-but i felt her
wavering

   there are times when it is safer to tell
some one i spoke as gently as i cotdd
 i know-because i have felt it-

   come in she said drawing me to-
ward her with feverish impatience
 come in where-they cant see us
she pulled me into the cold and dark
parlor and thrust me into a corner of
the slippery sofa she herself leaned for-
ward from the chair opposite there was
just light enough for me to see tho
desperate purpose animating the mea-
gre shadow

    i lied to you slie wrung her hands
until i winced i lied to you because
i was ashamed and i will be scourged
with nis wrath-if theres anything left
for him to do the sterile despair that
is tho dregs of the bitter draught of
puritanism was in her face

  t tried to pull her hands apart dont
feel this way t said in distress you
had a perfect right to keep anything that
pains you to tell from a stranger like
me im sorry i spoke i have been
impertinent-intruding

  she disregarded mo entirely  i lied
to you she repeated  wait-ill tell
you

   dont say anything unless it will
do you good to talk im afraid fve
been wrong-

  no i guess its meant i should tell
you-youre right-ivo got to talk to
some one if i dont- pve gone
around nil locked up lying to myself
and every one else since-it happened
i hate every one-and i dont believe i
used to t think it over and over
why should-they look at me that way
you will-when you know

   oh no no how could any one pos-
sibly feel anything but-liking see how
kind you were to me-how sweet i
was tired and faint and you took me in
and made me welcome at your table
a stranger-

   thats just it she whispered hoarse-
ly  you could come bccause you didnt
-know but perhaps i dont look at
things right-i cant it has hurt me
so here she struck her narrow chest
so cruelly that i wondered she did not
cry out with the pain i tried to keep
her hands in mine she let them stay
a minute

   for a little while site moved her
hands restlessly it seemed as it used
to do when i could give things and not
feel that-they were looking at me-
wondering you see you didnt think
you had to pay me for the milk i had
to-right or no right and then the tea
was a present to me years ago and the
berries id picked there was only the
sugar and the cream-but you didnt
take that-and the cookies-

  i was trying to follow her and try-
ing so hard to understand she must
have seen-

   just let me tell you in my own way
she said with some calmness  perhaps
i can make you understand i was the
kind of a girl that had to earn my own
money as soons i had finished my school-
ing even though my father was a sea-
captain that owned his ship and had
money in the bank most of the girls
around here are like that-or used to be
i dont know much about them-now
and it never comes amiss to have a little
more coming into a house-or even to
just have the expense of board and keep
taken out why t wouldnt even let
them give me my setting-out but earned
enough to furnish my house myself linen
and everything this palor set i bought
with my school money two years before
we were ninrried and that china dog-
i mind now what a good time bert and
i had the day i bought that there was
a fair over to rockport and he did
tease me so about getting even the orna-
ments for my mantel-shelf her tone
was merely reminiscent there were no
tears in her eyes although foolishly
enough there were in mine

   so bert and i were real forehanded
drawn by j a willuims

                     i havent but one feeling in me its-shame i

tiie woman wiio was ashamed



and paid off tlie mortgage on this house
and had money in the bank the day
little bert was born bert put twenty-five
dollars in the bank to begin saving for
him to go to college the baby was never
real strong-i guess i didnt rest enough
before he came-i never could do much
resting and of course we wanted our
boy to have it easier than we had had it
then bert was sick and tlie savings were
used up- and then bert died and i had
to put a mortgage on the house again
then i knew little bert want just right
and then he died-just as i told you

   but i got along all right until last
winter when the rlieumatiz went to my
hands even then i had everything i
wanted-i was never one to spend much
for foodstuffs anyway but-one day-
amanda adams-i used to go to school
with her-and she and i always used to
run each other to stay at the top and i
most always won-came in to visit i
was just a mite tired and had lain down
on my bed but she said-i-was-
hungry she could go no further t
wouldnt of course look at her but i
felt that even in the darkness her face
was darkly flushed

   it want so at all but amanda al-
ways was one to pry and of course it
made her feel good to pretend she thought
so-when i had always beaten her before
-and bert had used to go with her once
-before we sung together in the choir
and he began to keep compny with me
she brought something in-her bread is
always sour too-and made me eat when
t hadnt any appetite at all then she
went and spread it everywhere and they
called a meeting of the selecmen and
they voted to take up the mortgage on
my house there never was a poorhonse
here that was true i told you but if
there had been one i suppose-theyd
have sent me there

  for the first time she faltered-and i
could do nothing but take the poor
clutching hands and hold them softly at
last she went on-her voice gathering in
tragic intensity with her story

   they portioned me out i can see
the words of the letter they wrote they
dance before my eyes sometimes as if
they were written in running fire the
community will assume responsibility for
your support and they had written

down what each one would do-how mis
adams would send me something of every
baking and capn beasley give me wood
and send his boys to pile it up and mrs
sawyer send me in all the milk i need
and ed wells down at the store let me
get sugar and calico and shoes without
paying for them and deacon williams
paint my house and fix up my walk and
doctor ford-he used to want to keep
compny with me before bert did-he
would furnish  medical attendance
but -she raised her head proudly- if
t do have to eat i dont have to get sick
-or let any one know of it if i do so
t dont ever have a call to go to him to
ask-charity

  but surely i said gently they
are kind

 she turned on me in fury  sod
i be kind if it was for me to give instead
of being give to i used to do a sight
of sitting up with the sick-before-
now i wont stir to go in one of their
houses-nor they wouldnt want me to
kind she choked for a minute be-
fore she could find words  theyre pry-
ing and spying every day to see what
im doing and what i have they feel
as if they owned me do you suppose
i buy a calieo-dress pattern at the store
that every woman hero aint looking at
it and wondering if i couldnt have made
out with one yard less tliey ask to look
at my account at the store-i dont need
to see them to know they do it and ed
wells lets them-i know he does-ami
shakes his head at his own  kindness 
in letting me have white sugar as well
as brown they come nnd look at my
wood-pile when they think im asleep
many a night ive waked up at two
oclock in the morning and heard noises
and known just as well as if id got up
and looked out of the window that it
was-them it makes them all feel rich
to think theyve contributed to my sup-
port  capn beasley aint painted his
own house for fifteen years-but he conies
nnd gives mine a coat of paint this spring
when it looked five times as well as his-
and such colors too and mis adams
forgets she has to get up at four in the
morning to wash for the summer people
when she sends me over a batch of bread
im better than bank stock or pnid doc-
tors bills to them nil they look at me

and feel rich when they know there is
one person in the world theyre giving
charity to im their luxury and then
im expected to how down to amanda
adams and capll beasley and thank
them for being  kind  to me now im
on the town yes thats it thats
where i lied to you im on the town
-her voice failed her but her gray
lips worked and something in me rose
to feel at that moment not grief but
exultation for the tempest of righteous
pride that tore her

  still it seemed to me tliat the room
rang with my baffled silence  are you
sure that this is as you say isnt it
really a gentle kindness that has moved
them to do this for you  dont you
think they are trying to do what they
can in the way they think will bo easiest
for you 

  her lips quivered and she passed her
hands uncertainly over her face  i-
dont know-maybe it aint so-but thats
the way it seems to me-most times but
somehow it aint right for me-living so
queer things come into my mind being
alone so much with every one i cared
for once gone-that is i know i must
have cared for them once-but it seems
a long time since-there hasnt been any-
thing but-this i try sometimes to
think different-but somehow i cant
think anything else i guess its dif-
ferent from most anything else-to be-
on the town there aint any other
trouble you cant share with other people
i remember when my husband died-i
must have felt awful bad-for amanda
adams just came and stayed with me
for weeks and took care of me like a baby
and i let her and when she left we
kissed each other and cried but-this
eats every other feeling out and makes
you hate everybody and theres noth-
ing either you can look forward to-
for its the one thing people never forget
its worse than stealing or killing people
i guess-for at least theres always some
one who believes that you havent really
done anything wrong-your mother or

your child perhaps but every one knows
-this theres no way of getting over
it except by dying and that seems to
take an awful long time i had feelings
once-i remember them but since it
happened-i havent had but one feeling
in ine and its tlie mother of every
wicked and low thought in the whole
world its-shame

  she stood blazing wrath a small
slight figure stooped and knotted but
the fire that filled her invested her with
the power of one of the ancient hebrew
prophets when he stood he alone a frail
bulwark against a rising tide

  one moment i halted searching for the
word at the end of that moment the
whole figure lessened sank into im-
potence i tried to grasp her-she eluded
my touch-she was crouching back in the
shadow seeking to blot herself against
the wall she spoke once

   when you go pretend youre picking
flowers-lots of the summer people do that
dont tell-them you were here-to eat

  i tried to answer but she was looking
at me sullenly out of eyes of mean sus-
picion alas and alas the moment
had passed tn the instant of doing the
only sendee i could perform for her i
had lost the power to help i had become
one of them i knew

  as i went down the dazzlingly white
walk of clam-shells the little gray figure
crept away from the door to watch me
lehind the shutters i felt her there
at the rose hedge i paused marvelling
at the green-massed rose-flecked beauty
with the vital blue of speeding waves le-
neatli it and the innocent blue of the
sky overhead as i picked the wild roses

i	wondered at the joyousness with which
the earth mother sent them forth un-
mindful that her other children were
starving at her failing breast and the
full summer chorus of small chirping
voices swelled out jubilantly sustaining
the deep organ tones of the telegraph
wires as they chanted the exultant tri-
umph of tho growing world
  wiiat did you mean we asked
of our july familiar by
saying the other month when
you were talking of the pair whom you
saw walking hand in hand in the park
that the girls brother was not a bos-
tonian if the girl was

   ah that was very curious wasnt
it our friend returned it was ap-
parently a contradiction in terms but
it was really only a paradox

   would a paradox he so verv much
bettor

   im not saying it would be im
stating a fact not arguing a point
what i wish to convey by the fact is
that the male bostonian seems to want
the witchery often so immanent in the
female lie is very well he has done
most of the right and high and clear
thinking which has got the country for-
ward he has always been unscrupulous-
ly brave with often a tender conscience
against fighting and he is apt to bo
patrician if not aristocratic while all
his convictions are for democracy he
is not winning bis cold snubbing man-
ner fails to make you instantly at homo
with him or even to desire his further
acquaintance if you wish to know more
of him it is at the distance which he
seems instinctively to have put between
you in other words and fewer of them
he wants charm

  well

   well and this young fellow this
putative brother of that most charming
half of the unmistakable pair of lovers
did have charm

   oh now we see

  our friend did not amplify on the
point lie accepted our acquiescence
without comment  he was so intel-
ligible his position was so clear that i
gavo him rather more of my heart than

	gave the lovers in fact why arent
the immediate witnesses of any love-
affair the next of kin to it actually
more interesting than the lovers them-

selves the lover themselves are the
mere exponents of an iustinct apart
from it and from each other they may
have every claim upon your respect ad-
miration and affection but together they
do not move either in you and they do
not need cither they have got as much
from each other as their lives can hold

  oh come we revolted this
wont do you have said this girl was
charming that she was bostonian and
you have made out tlint her lover was
either as a practically romantic south-
erner or an idealistic westerner capable
equally of great success and entirely
worthy of her you pretend to have
been enamoured of their amour impas-
sioned of their passion in such meas-
ure that it was an intolerable hurt
to you when they dropped each others
hands indignantly resentful of your
stare and passed separately out of your
sight and knowledge

   yes all that is true but i have
since realized that i could not have bomo
their rapture a moment longer at the
same time i could have dwelt forever
with hungry pity in an endless famine
of sympathy upon that lwred brothers
countenance liis weary brow bared with
its beads of perspiration to the after-
noon air his tired eyes spent with
the tense avoidance of the mawkish
spectacle in his reluctant yet conscien-
tious charge he was such a good broth-
er so magnanimous so superlatively
patient since t told you about him

i	have been imagining such heart-
breaking martvry of him in what detail
you never can know i dont believe
the brothers of girls in love have ever
lieen truly appreciated in life or in lit-
erature the passive part assigned to
them is supposed so easy so simple
but is their part necessarily passive
if objectively passive isnt it often
subjectively active suppose the brother
and sister arc good comrades as they
frequently are and they have comc to
harpers monthly magazine

know each others characters as lovers
never can he has learned to know in her
the noble qualities which many women so
successfully conceal throughout married
life her beautiful unselfishness her wise
prudence her exquisite judgment her
knowledge of people her studied behavior
her inspired discretion her flashing wit
her saving humor and suddenly he sees
such a sister as this gone silly silly
about a man and silly about a man who
con never be known to her as he is known
to her brother do you call that a simple
part a part easy to play in the tremen-
dous drama suddenly staged in his life

  no it isut simple it isnt easy it
has its difficulties go on but dont
exaggerate its difficulties we said
catching our breath in unexpected in-
terest

   what good would it do to go  in
a world so besotted that it  loves a lover
as it loves children geuerically in the
lump our friend returned what i
want is a novel a truthful righteous
epic which shall take the fact that there
is a love-affair and leave it centrical and
motionlesswhile all the family motives
wheel round it like planets in an orrery
father mother sisters brothers grand-
fathers and grandmothers if surviving
auuts uncles and cousins these are the
people sensibly affected these are the
prime parties in interest and yet how
our purblind fiction blinks them glances
at them casually over its shoulder as
it were while it follows the fortunes of
the infatuate pair who have no sense of
things beyond themselves is love so im-
portant that it must be treated to the
exclusion or the subordination of all
the other affections parental anxiety
sisterly interest brotherly companion-
ship cousinly criticism the family
the family is the supreme expression of
humanity the latin civilizations em-
body that notion in them the youthful
pair are strictly secondary wholly a
minor consideration

  and yet we thoughtfully suggested
 without the youthful pair there could
be no family the greeks had the in-
stinct of this their very language em-
bodied it in that dual number interposed
in its accidence between the singular
and plural

   you are wandering not to say

maundering the greeks are too far off
to be taken into account the family as
we have had it began with the romans
and the family as we are getting to have
it ended with them monogamy flow-
ered with them and it faded in facile
divorce just as it is practically doing
with us but as we have agreed the
pair i saw holding hands were not di-
vorced people they were to be sure
rather mature young persons bringing
to their second or third love the ripened
but not over-ripened experience of their
first or-such things may happen at
their age-they were really in their first
love how would you like the brother
and sister to have come by the midnight
train in the kind fiction that she wished
to do some of that spring shopping in
new york which ive heard some bos-
ton women do not find their city quite
equal to

   we see no objection to that we
replied  unless the fact is going to
take you too far afield and tempt you
to spend your fancy on the girls be-
wilderment among the flowers of our
spring openings

   tliere is no danger of that our
friend explained if the fact is not a
fact but a fiction accepted by both
the brother and the sister and duly
authorized by the father and mother
who are so well affected toward tlie young
man that they see no harm in her com-
ing for a few days to the city where be
has suggested that he will be at complete
leisure for as much of the may-time as
she likes the may-time in new york
you know is something very different
from the may-time in boston tho east
wind which is a blessing here is a bane
there the family consider her perfectly
ehaperoned and neither she nor her
brotlier objects to adding a few galleries
and theatres to the shops the boston
galleries and theatres are not so satisfy-
ing or not so permanently satisfying-

   you neednt go into the reasons for
a merely supposed case like that we
put in

   ah our friend sighed  i was be-
ginning to believe in it but if as you
say it is only a supposed case what is
the matter with having the young man
come in gayly and with the air of being
altogether unexpected by the brother and
editors easy chair



sister at the breakfast which they are
having a little late after repairing the
ravages of a night on the sleeping-car in
a toilette involuntarily elaborated to the
imagined metropolitan standard their
own standard is very good from their
english experience and authority but
new york-something in the air-
tempts a blossom here and there in
places where life would not flower in
the boston may her costume lias ad-
vanced the season by slight touches im-
perceptible to the young mans senses
but not his soul a fortnight and an inner
sunshine bursts out of him and irradiates
him from head to foot

   if you go on at that rate you will
never reach the climax and when you
do it will be through the consciousness
of the lovers and not of the brother
so we declared and our friend assented

  youre right we will drop them
from this point spoiled children of fic-
tion as they arc they shall not be flat-
tered in this study of the affair we will
leave them at the table and go out with
the brother for a paper which implies
a cigar when the cigar has been
smoked we go back with him and find
the young people still at the breakfast
table and we learn that it has been ar-
ranged that they shall all go for the
morning to tho metropolitan museum
the girl asks what time it is and it
seems that brothers watch can lcst re-
ply then everybody but he is surprised
to find how late it is the girl goes up
to her room to add some further petals
to her efflorescence-a strictly tempered
bostonian efflorescence-and the young
man and the brother find themselves
wonderfully short of conversation in her
absence they like each other well
enough but neither has any use for the
other when the girl comes down the
youngman eagerly possesses himself of
her umbrella her purse her catalogue-
which a friend has lent her and she lias
brought on from boston with her he
wishes to take her gloves but she is put-
ting them on-

   stop stop we cried indignantly
 there you go again devoting yourself
in spite of all your own theories and
principles to the lovers and leaving the
brother out altogether really really

   but its tho last touch im putting

  on them dont you see it completes
the brothers elimination and now we
follow him gladly into his exile its no
longer a party of three but one party
of two and another party of one from
this on our business is with the party
of one we make him our battle-ground
where the emotions are fought out our
theatre where the drama is played our
friend paused and then he resumed with
a dreamy air it is very curious about
brothers take one of them take the
most liberal-minded of them the wisest
and be cannot put himself in his sisters
place when she is in love it is entirely
conceivable and it is beautifully right
and fit that some other brothers sister
should be in love with him he finds in
her tender affinitions toward him whether
obviously combated or openly but un-
consciously indulged a charm which is
altogether wanting in his own sisters
attitude he feels in that a foible a
want of dignity a derogation of char-
acter a disappointment of the ideal
which all ends in making him sick as
tlie day wore on say in this instance the
brother became worse and worse at the
museum his experience was very re-
laxing he went about with the lovers
through the wonderful collections-for
they are wonderful pictorial sculptural
architectural numismatic arehteologieal
-and if you havent been there lately-
 we go there constantly we replied
with perhaps more enthusiasm than
veracity  and only yesterday we went to
see the whistlers before we got to
them we stopped to look at so many
tliings that we felt the old familiar back-
ache and neckache of european galleries
and perceived that here in powerful con-
centration though perhaps in tabloid
form we had the effect of the national
oallery tho louvre the pitti and tho
vatican and the whistlers when we
came to them how they took the marrow
out of our spine as if they had been so
many tiepolos velasquezes van dykes
reynoldses yes it is a marvellous
place but we are not getting 
where is that brother that man and
brother you put yourself in charge of
 abandoned on any chair or bench
that ho could find from time to time ho
followed hard upon the lovers steps and
then again he lost them and when be
harpers monthly magazine

  hunted them up he found them rapt
before some miracle of art but really
looking at each other and held in breath-
less wonder at such reciprocal miracles
of nature the brother hardly knew liis
sister in these transports-the keen-
witted humorous satirical girl the stu-
dent of human nature the observer of
character the somewhat haughty specta-
tor of life lapsed to the level of a
debutante and wreaking her delight like
a village person flirting at a church fair
or a summer silly at a picnic or in a
moonlight shadow on the veranda of a
seaside hotel he was not only sick he
was ashamed he wanted to go away
and leave them to their fate but that
would not do and the forenoon dragged
along with him through sloughs of ex-
haustion in which the pair seemed mo-
mently to renew their strength and youth
they talked gayly and incessantly they
whispered they cried out they laughed
to the brother it was simply loathsome
and he could scarcely keep his patience
when at the end of the long morning
hours he came up with them after a vain
search and she suddenly asked what time
was it and being told it was one oclock
declared she was hungry as a bear and
the young man fixing her with a look of
adoration as if she had declared a
supernal merit said they would go to
the casino for lunch

   look out now we warned the nar-
rator youre getting back to forbidden
ground the lovers you know have
nothing to do with your story

   dont be afraid my story has noth-
ing to do with them except pivotally
the brother is always the hero of my
tale he noted that though as hungry
as a bear she ate no more than a bird
but chattered throughout the long lunch
like an anthropoidal ancestress but he
himself ate for the pair and he was pi ad
the young man had ordered the lunch
so ridiculously long and large lie en-
joyed eating in the open as they were
doing on that pleasant northward ter-
race and he didnt mind the company
being rather common and tacitly dubious
in some groups or couples it was often
so in paris and it was not lurid as he

  knew it was apt to be in that place at din-
ner it was saved to his respect by the
harmless parental presences with children
rejoicing in a holiday and going and
coming with their mothers leaves the
conversation of the lovers did not embrace
him except by compulsory fits and starts
and after catching himself in a doze he
said if they did not mind he would go
off for a stroll in the mall if they
minded they did not say so they did
not say anything and he went off to the
mall where he found a shady seat and
watched the children roller-skating and
shouting and shrieking up and down the
stretch of asphalt and the nurses with
their go-carts pushing their babies back
and forth from the benches and the goat-
carriages making tours of the mall with
proud little boys and girls bound to the
seats it was not quiet but it was peace-
ful and the brother slumbered again
when he woke he walked back to the
terrace but the pair looked as if they
had not moved and he instructively felt
that he had not been missed he went
for a stroll in the ramble and found the
warm day friendlier to sitting than walk-
ing he wished he had a newspaper
or even a book but he managed to drowse
again without one he did not think
he was very well used but on the whole
he decided not to go back at once when
he woke from one of these generous
oblivions he found it was four oclock
and he hurried back to the casino for
now surely they must have talked out
and become aware that they had been
talking solely to each other when lie
saw them last they were talking very
seriously he seemed to be laying down
the law and she taking it for gospel
her brother disliked the bird-like gaping
of her attentive mouth but now he saw
them very gay they had long ago had
demi-tasses and apparently had lingered
over them till it was time for afternoon
tea they had ordered tea and they
hailed him hilariously and said he was
wonderfully opportune but as they had
to make the waiter bring another cup they
were apparently not expecting him and he
unmolestedly figured up the tip that the
young man would have to give that waiter
 almost we might say that the

  la writing of fiction is properly a

    	feminine rather than a masculine
accomplishment the great story-tellers
in prose and verse where invention and
a broad range of the constructive faculty
are necessary to the entertainment have
always been men but fiction as we mod-
ems understand it is a more delicate
and intimate portraiture of real life quite
alien to the story-telling art and more
native to women it began in the kind
of letters women wrote naturally pic-
turingly no stray thought interfering
with direct embodiment

  in the play the story is removed by the
dramatic art from the plane of ordinary
life and by the distinctive requirements
of that art-elaboration of plan concen-
tration of action and variety and detail
of characterization-from the straight-
forward method of the story-teller an
illusion is to be created and maintained
involving the acceptance of the play-
wrights premises by the audience near-
ly all of the successful plays have been
written by men

  the earliest fiction-all before the
middle of the eighteenth century-was
written by men but it was not fiction in
the modern sense it did not attempt real
social or individual portraiture no
woman would ever have been tempted to
undertake what was so magnificently
done by apuleius or rabelais or cer-
vantes or lesage or by john lyly and
robert greene in the elizabethan era or
by defoe and swift in the early eight-
eenth century even steeles and ad-
disons character-sketches were as much
beyond her natural inclination as all
their essays were tlieir essays were
social as distinguished from those of
a more speculative order in the preceding
century-such as cowleys bacons and
sir thomas brownes-they dealt with
ulanners and so inclined to the concrete
presentment of types of human character
preparing the way for the social novel

  isaac bickerstaffe  is even concerned
with affecting domestic scenes feelingly
portrayed but always with the distinctly
masculine detachment which is still more
evident in the portraits of sir roger
de coverley and will honeycomb the
humorous whimsicalities so characteristic
of addison in sketches of this sort and
perpetuated later with variations due to
individual temperament by fielding
sterne lamb and thackeray have never
been adopted by women in essay or fic-
tion the few women who wrote essays
in the eighteenth century even after the
essay had become more picturesque and
concrete were more formal and didactic
and far less entertaining than men in
our own day vernon lee-not to mention
other women who have won distinction
in this field-has written essays which in
matter and manner have not been sur-
passed by her masculine contemporaries

  it must be conceded that as a rule
women since their advent into literature
have shown an aversion to essay-writing-
at least to that kind which gains a per-
manent place in literature it is a fact
significant of disinclination rather than
of disability women have chosen to leap
directly from letter-writing to fiction
finding no compelling allurement in the
intermediate field of the essay

  fiction as we of to-day understand
it is an entirely new art of expression
meeting a new need and what is new in
it has been creatively developed chiefly
by women we do not mean that they
initiated this new art or each new note
marking the points of departure from an
cider style of fiction on the contrary
we think that such initiative must be
conceded to men in the generic sense
men are more original than women even
determining feminine fashions it is the
originality of the master and in the arts
men have been the masters-in this new
art of fiction as in all others in the
representative arts including the drama
this mastery was essential to the supreme
harpers monthly magazine

effect it was equally effective in story-
telling for the simple purpose of enter-
tainment but in tlie representation of
life by creative embodiment of its reality
-by creative realism for it comes to just
that-this mastery was in the way not
because of it but in spite of it have men
been creative realists in fietion

  when women began to write fiction
they portrayed life as they saw it and felt
it they were quickly and keenly ob-
servant and had deep sensibility they
cherished intimacies with living things-
brooding intimacies-and were naively
creative of situation and character they
were not so much inclined as their brotlier
novelists to freedom of adventure to
loose invention of incident to elabora-
tion of plot or to the masterful exploita-
tion of human passions they were
womanly but they were eighteenth-
century womanly and we cannot say that
they initiated or illustrated creative
realism or indeed that their work fur-
nished convincing proof that fiction was
distinctively a feminine accomplishment
though it strongly suggested womans
peculiar fitness for the deft vivid and
truthful portrayal of social life

  men had undertaken the novel of so-
ciety and were followed by women who
in so far as they had any conscious aim
meant to follow in the path of richard-
son they were as much under the in-
tellectual influences of their time as the
men were quite as sophisticated within
their range of thought and not less the
victims of the tyranny of abstractions
they were more formal moralists and
thus excluded from their fietion a wide
range of vital human experience they
easily assumed the masculine detachment
from the material they wrought with-
though it was something less remote than
the masculine-because the entanglements
and involvements they bound and loosed
were superficial pertaining to social
types in a rigidly classified order and
only lightly touching any adventure of
the individual soul

  woman had never got so far away from
primitive naturalism as in that eighteenth
century step by step she had been
wrenched nway from it by mans pro-
gressive civilization until now she was
stranded in the dry air of a common sense
world which had accepted pope as the

greatest of poets and was now yielding
to the literary dictatorship of doctor
johnson in such an atmosphere her
fiction gave  clear prophetic intimation
of a new naturalism to come

  but even out of this dry ground the
fruit of womans imagination yielded
native flavors woman in any age if
she creates at all must confess to her
peculiar natural bond whatever may be
her conscious aim or her environment
including the stimulus of masculine fel-
lowship and inspiration she has as we
have said a brooding intimacy with liv-
ing things she has always had it else
there would never have leeu possible the
domestication of animals it may be
that in the mysterious course of heredity
only a small proportion of women have
it growing perhaps less with every gen-
eration but at least those women who
create in life or literature must have it
and with it the sense begotten of it
which invests the commonest thing that
life has dwelt in or has touched with the
sacredness of an ancient familiarity

  in woman this heritage is one of feel-
ing and in her creative work is shown
in close and natural intimacies vivid
description and portraiture of what is
nearly seen and felt fancies bred in the
heart and an almost physiological archi-
tectonic her lightest gossip is born of
vital sympathy all this along with
animatelv natural graces and humors i
apparent in her eighteenth-century fic-
tion mingled with an intolerable deni
of sophistry for which she was not ac-
countable she dealt with life directly
though externally and in typical repre-
sentation and we have therefore a feel-
ing of reality in the portraiture with no
dramatic exaggeration  caricature or
distortion or grotesque whimsicality of
any sort if she did not disclose a new-
art of fiction slie made it seem new by
bringing to it fresh resources from her
own nature and through the development
of these resources she made a distinct
departure from the methods employed by
her masculine contemporaries in the de-
piction of social life she did not revolt
against the old devices and herself
abounding in artifices she consciously
reinforced rather than resisted the arti-
ficial in literature so that her every
departure from it was inevitable rather
editors study

than contemplated-a fresh path that sho
must take because she could take no
other this necessity proved to be a
blessed limitation a diviue opportunity
the condition of a peculiar and sur-
passing excellence

  it might reasonably have been expected
that the protest against the formal
civilization of the eighteenth century
would have come from woman but it
was rousseau who sounded the note of
revolt and the new romanticism was
initiated and developed by men and
readied its high tide in the first quarter
of the nineteenth century with but a
slight and passive response from women
except as its mystical side appealed to a
few of them notably to mrs radclitte
it was just this side of the movement-
its reversion to medievalism-which re-
pelled jane austen the finest and sanest
artist in pre-waverley fiction who gave
the old type of social portraiture its ut-
most naturalness and charm

  romanticism helped to give fiction its
modern subjectiveness it laid stress
upon individualism and it developed in
philosophy poetry and criticism sur-
prising variations of individual genius
contrasting with the manifest uni-
formities of eighteenth-century literature
in these fields conventions were relaxed
religious and political movements among
the people showed new impulses at work
subversive of long - established forms
poetry and philosophy were transformed
but fiction as a portraiture of contem-
iorary social life was violently arrested
the story-teller reasserted his claim he
does so in every age but here the story-
teller was sir walter scott a master-
magician for entertainment who for many
years had the monopoly of this ancient
art generous as scott was in the con-
fession of his limitations as compared
with jane austen modestly as he pro-
fessed to follow miss edgeworth in an
attempt to do for scotland what she had
done for ireland gladly as lie hailed
miss ferrier as a sister artist in the
scottish field-yet he drove every woman
novelist to cover until tlie gentle emer-
gence of miss mitford with our village
in  and after that there was no
woman of distinction in english fiction
before the middle of the century

  scott by virtue of his genius deserved

to hold tlie field which be so splendidly
enriched and glorified for the moment
he paralyzed novel-writing of tho field-
ing and even of the jane austen sort-
the sort which concerns itself with con-
temporary manners with the comedy
sense of life-he turned to the past and
told stories and there had been no such
masterly creation not only of a story
but of the living men and women enact-
ing it between his historical romances
ami shakespeares historical plays

  he was followed not by women but
by men who also were story-tellers rather
than novelists in our modern sense of
the novel-men like ainsworth and lever
g p r james and marryat the novel
proper was continued by bulwer dick-
ens and thackeray all of whom entered
the field at tho beginning of the vic-
torian era-none of them prophetic of
the creative realism of the next genera-
tion though widely differing from the
eighteenth-eentury society novelists to
whom they were the legitimate suc-
cessors they met the needs emotional
and intellectual of a vastly more re-
lined society profoundly changed by the
ferment of revived romanticism but
while they were less superficial than
fielding and smollett they indulged in
no subtle analysis of character and aimed
at no intimate psychical disclosures the
fact that the dramatic and melodramatic
dickens was tlie dominant personality in
the world of fiction as scott bad been
before him shows how nearly allied the
novel as written by men was to tlie
older forms of masterly entertainment

  so too when we advance another step
to a wholly new order of creative work iu
george merediths fiction while we feel
ourselves lifted into a psychical world
where the comedy of life is heightened
by poetry and illuminated by philosophy
and tlie whole entertainment is trans-
formed still under these so novel con-
ditions we note not merely the old mas-
tery which counted for greatness iu
masculine achievement since art was
born but the consciously brilliant trick
of it he penetrated to tlie minds of his
men aud women as no other novelist be-
fore him had bnt often his philosophy
obscured rather than illuminated proving
a will-o-the wisp to his own imagination
and to bis readers thomas hardy in
harpers monthly magazine

liis more gigantic and naturalistic dra-
matic mastery was if more modest quite
as wilful

  wo ask ourselves then if there can
be a new art of fiction quite free from
the devices which men have used with
more or less of magic since they liegan
to give creative imagination embodiment
in the set forms of human speech and for
the purposes of human entertainment
is creative realism pure and simple pos-
sible can there be a representation of
life which does not lift it by dramatic
or poetic tension or picturesque enhance-
ment out of what we deprecat ingly call
its commonness-a representation of life
creatively embodying its inherent charm
its native beauty humor bounty and
pathos in all its commonness ami need-
ing no didactic purpose no speculative in-
tention for its justification that would
indeed be creative realism but so remote
from all which we have been accustomed
to call art that we must refer it to the
esthetic of a new naturalism

  every step in the advance of fiction
since tho middle of the nineteenth cen-
tury has been toward this new natural-
ism-toward the representation of life
in the light of its native unfolding just
as during the same period every advance
in science has been toward the disclosure
not of wonders attributable to nature
but of those which natively belong to her
and which she herself reveals to mans
waiting vision meredith and hardy
were in different ways the prophets of
this ultra-modem fiction and tho dis-
ciples of meredith or at least his natural
successors in the lines of his prophecy-
such men as conrad and hewlett and
henry james-have been masterly crea-
tors and interpreters but the real de-
velopment in this new field has been due
mainly to women because of their more
intimate sense of life iu its near and
common aspects and in its natural be-
comings and because that kind of mas-
tery which made the old art did not come
in the way of their progress toward the
new naturalism they have given us
therefore more examples of unadulterated
realism since their fresh advent into
fiction-after a considerable interval-
at about the same time that meredith
appeared with his whimsical bravura the
shaving of shagpat

  we need not point to tho work done
by mrs gaskell george eliot and mrs
oliphant dealing directly with con-
temporary common life within closely
parochial limits or show how natively
real it was as compared with the ex-
amples furnished by anthony trollope
and other men portraying life within such
limitations george eliots fiction so far
as realism is concerned went to pieces
when she wrote lomola following the
masculine fashion of art the majority
of women novelists since her time have
attempted the same fashion with less
admirable results having little perception
of what is distinctively the office of mod-
em fiction-the disclosure of life as it is
in its own natural procedure and not as
wo would sentimentally or with specula-
tive ingenuity refashion it perhaps a
true knowledge of heredity would show
that most women are not born distinctive-
ly women-that is as having the intimate
sense of things in a creative way-and
are to be regarded as a social class rather
than as a sex it being indifferent what
place they take either in literature or in
tlie worlds business

  it seems almost paradoxical that in
our own generation when there seems
to be an increasing number of women
belonging to this indifferent class there
are more genuine examples of creative
realism in womens fiction than ever be-
fore this realism in its simplest terms
has been exemplified chiefly in short
stories because tlie elaboration of the
novel usually leads to the adoption of the
old contrivances necessary to a  plot
these stories have shown what a range
of variations is possible in the reaction
of the creative imagination upon tho
common material of every-day life tho
creations of miss wilkins miss jewett
mrs deland edith wharton mary
austin and georg sebock stand out
vividly in the american field there aw
fewer in the english but the work of
mrs dudeney most instantly recurs to
our mind if in some of these women
stories it is the native quality which im-
presses us we feel that is bom of life
and if in those of others it is a dramatic
or poetic tension which heightens the
charm for us we feel that it is lifes o
tension we nro removed as far as pos-
sible from the old story-tellers art
beverlys benevolent hairpin
reclamation society

by thomas  janvier

a ll that you have urged bishop in
 regard to infusing practicality into
philanthropy said the colonel
 would have been listened to with
a warm interest by my friend mr beverly
 unless beverly d gone to sleep at the
bishops  fourthly same as i did put in
the doctor stretching himself and yawning

   practicality continued the colonel ig-
noring the doctors interpellation  was
mr beverlys dominant characteristic just
as it was the essence of his many curious
and useful mechanical inventions so was it
the essence of his many humane projects
for the amelioration of the
condition of his fellow men

his benevolent hairpin recla-
mation society for instance-

 lardon me my dear col-
onel interrupted the bishop

 before we go farther i must
beg that you will favor us
with at least a partial expla-
nation of the eccentric i may
even say the incongruous name
of mr beverlys society

frankly i do not see how a
hairpin can be benevolent

true continued the bishop
musingly  we still find-
lingering in obscure nooks and
corners of the world-survivals
of the medieval custom of en-
dowing inanimate objects with
vital characteristics equally
a like disposition is found
everywhere among children

a child for example will as-
sail with angry objurgation
the knife with which it has
cut its own fingers precisely
as though-

  you neednt snip down
that medieval survival to only
children bish interposed the
doctor  i guess its in the
bed-rock of the race you just
ought to have heard me swear-
ing away last night at a chair
i banged into in the dark

  i am very well pleased
sir replied the bishop stiffly

 that i was not in a position
to overhear those regrettable
vol cxxt-no tit -

lapses of speech on your part which could
not but have been most offensive to one of
my cloth i will admit however that your
unhappy outburst of profanity directed
at an inanimate object does illustrate the
curious ethnological reversionary trait now
under discussion

    beg your pardon bishop said the
colonel coldly  i am under the impression
that the matter now under discussion-at
least of elucidation-is the philanthropic
project of my friend mr beverly i even
venture to remind you that your request for
an explanation of the name given by mr

useful employment was provided for a neglected
class of in digests 


iiakpers monthly magazine

beverly to his society remains unanswered-
awaiting the termination of your own and
the doctors rambles in the mazes of your
respective verbosities

   my dear colonel replied the bishop
with ii genial courtesy  we offer you our
sincere apologies tell us  beg of you
about mr beverlys benevolent hairpins
and why and how they were reclaimed

   subject of course to further irrelevant
interruptions said the colonel his tone
still chilly  shall endeavor to continue
my little story i must premise that in
naming his society mr beverly sought to
exhibit its broad purpose in the fewest pos-
sible words the outcome was a slight
sacrifice of clarity to brevity he did not
mean of course that hairpins were benev-
olent but that through the ogency of a
society organized on philanthropic lines
their reclamation led directly to benevo-
lent results

   in effect these results were dual first
useful employment was provided for a
neglected class of indigents second from
such employment a liberal fund was created
by the indigents themselves for their own
moral and material betterment mr bever-
lys plan in brief was that the hundreds
of homeless little waifs unhappily existing
in every great city should be drilled and
organized under the societys officers to
rotluim-that is to collect and to place in

the societys depositories whence they would
be withdrawn refoundcd into merchantable
pig-iron nnd sold for the societys benefit-
the hairpins which are dropped in the streets
of every great city and there go to waste
obviously this project-being as were all
of mr beverlyb projects strictly practical
-gave assured promise of benevolent results
which fully justified the societys name

   about how many waifs did beverly
mean to keep on one hairpin asked the
doctor i reckon three waifs putting in
all their time at it might find as much
as one hairpin a day

   your trivial question sir replied the
colonel  would be passed unnoticed did it
not indicate a lack of observation on your
part that living common to minds of the
medium order must be reckoned with in
properly presenting mr beverlys scheme
few people will observe the general preva-
lence of hairpins in the streets until they le-
gin consciously to look for them and even
then no considerable numbers of hairpins will
be noted until tin- eyes of tlie observer have
been educated to the search this secondary
fact is in accordance with the law in optica
that requires the eye to be taught when
search is made for small objects of an
unusual sort to convey notice of what it
sees to the brain xot until the education
of the eye has been perfected will physical
sight aiid mental perception go hand in
hand to be quit frank i
will admit that  myself did
not perceive that the streets
of new york literally are
cluttered up with hairpins
until under my friends guid-
ance i came to look for them
with a trained eye

   believe me mr beverlys
benevolent hairpin reclama-
tion society was not a chimer-
ical project sprung from
fancies for which support had
to be created by a quibbling
array of perverted facts on
the contrary it was the -an
outgrowth of substantial fact
acutely observed and then-
in the crucible of his extraor-
dinary mind - resolved into

fossibilities of benevolent usc-
ii i ness in other words his
carefully cultivated habit of
minute observation having led
him to note the hairpin-
encumbered condition of the
streets of this city his nat-
ural detestation of waste in-
stantly prompted him to
search for some practical
plan by which so consider-
able an annual loss of valu-
able metal might bo
ed then in one of the
hashes of his inventive gciiiu-
came the thought of setting
the waifs-he was deeply

raising the funds necessary
for the accomplishment of
that benevolent purpose-to
reclaiming themselves

   rashness however had no
part in mr beverlys composi-
tion his conservative and
cautious nature ever withheld
him from essaying any venture
until lie imd submitted its
possibilities to the severest
practical tests while himself
satisfied that his philo-
economic hairpin-waif-redemp-
tion project rested on a secure
foundation he recognized the
necessity of obtaining irre-
futable dnta which would en-
able him to present it con-
vincingly to minds of the aver-
age mediocre order-and so to
win for it a generous financial
support to this end-pain-
fully laboriously through
many successive weeks-he
counted all the hairpins that
he saw in the course of liis
walks about the city and in
keeping with his cautious
habit so arranged his walks
as to time and locality and
weather conditions-this last
wing a most important factor
because of the increased
droppings of hairpins on windy
days-as to make the details
and the sum of his findings
broadly exemplary

   the data thus secured
abundantly justified his intuitively per-
ceived conclusion incidentally it brought
out a mass of curious and important facts
previously unknown to ethnological statis-
ticians in regard to the distribution of liair-

sin waste in new york fifth avenue he
ound yielded incomparably the richest
harvest-so extraordinarily rich in the
gusty neighborhood of the flatiron build-
ing that mr beverly decided to station a
waif at that point permanently-but the
hairpins observed on that fashionable
thoroughfare and throughout the fashion-
able portions of the city generally for the
mu-t part were of a delicate thinness and
small on the east side the findings rela-
tively were few-xsaibly due to the frugal
old world habit of picking up dropped hair-
pins and using them over again-but the
pins were of so massive a make being
adapted to the heavy hair of the foreign
population there resident that the scanty
pickings to lie had in that region fully
equalled in weight the numerically far
larger pickings to le had in the more ele-
gant portions of the town the region be-
low the city hall he found practically was
negligible it yielded almost nothing-
implying a business-like tenacity in hair-
pin sticking on the part of ladv typists that
was

in commendable contrast with the care-

   the total of  hairpins observed on
this occasion must not is- regarded as
exemplary it was much in excess of the
eventually determined daily average in-
deed in the beginning-interestingly illus-
trating the law of psycho physics in regard
to the untrained eye to which i have made
reference-mr beverly almost was led to
abandon his admirable project because of
the smallness of the returns xot until he
had carried his daily countings through a
lunar month-he adopted the lunar month
as his statistical unit because of its ready
divisibility into weeks-did he feel assured
that the working basis of his scheme was
sound with his customary precise busi-
ness methods he tabulated his returns in
such a way as to show the total findings

totals      

   as in the case of tlie single days count
 that i have cited in illustration of the
important matter of hairpin distribution
even the highest of the weekly totals here
noted frequently was exceeded in the course
of mr beverlys wearily continued months
of exact enumeration but-induced by his
habitual conservatism to reduce his basic
figures to the most cautious minimum-he
accepted the result of his first four weeks
as determinative and thence drew the
ultra-prudent conclusion based on a simple
arithmetical calculation - x 
that each waif would find for cautions
sake he ignored the appreciable decimal
not less than  hairpins a day

   as conservatively planned by mr bever-
ly the benevolent hairpin reclamation so-
ciety would pive employment to not less
than  waifs whence it followed as the
result of a simple arithmetical calculation
 x x  that the net
lunar monthly total of hairpins reclaimed
by waifs again for cautions sake he ig-
nored the now very considerably increased

decimal actually would exceed three-
quarters of a million adverting from the
lunar monthly to an annual reckoning ad-
mitting the previously ignored decimal now
so greatly augmented as no longer to be
negligible and allowing for the quadrennial
increase  incident to an extra days
collection mr beverly arrived by a simple
arithmetical calculation x x 
 at the overwlielm-
ly convincing result that the  waifs on
an average would reclaim-for conversion
into merchantable iron to be sold and the
proceeds benevolently applied to the amelio-
ration of their unhappy condition-not less
in round numbers than ten millions of hair-
pins a year

  pausing for a moment impressively the
colonel added these amazing figures
gentlemen-easily verified by any observant
person who will devote a few days to hair-
pin counting-are a sufficient answer to the
doctors characteristically coarse pleasantry
as to one hairpin affording support for three
waifs i trust indeed before i go farther
that you doctor will admit-and that you
bishop sympathetically will approve-and
that you judge from the standpoint of
your exact legal training will admire-the
sane soundness the severely uncompromis-
ing practicality of mr beverlys benevo-
lent scheme

  but the colonel did not go farther re-
ceiving no response to his several appeals
he regarded bis companions attentively-
and perceived that collectively they were
sound asleep this fact also explained why
no irrelevant interruptions-to his anticipa-
tion of which he had made caustic reference
-had punctuated the latter portion of his

the old marine

 by burges johnson

 	 were once a marine said he

   an a most remarkable one

 an youve little idee from the looks of me
 of the bravery deeds i done

  but i stirred up sort of a jealous rage
 in the buzzums of all the rest

 till i had ter resign fer the good of the
      line

 as the admiral thought were best

  but it isnt an admirals job said i

 to tell a marine to skid

 he started slightly and answered politely
  this kind of an admiral did

  and youve no idee of the things he
      said

  i seen in my long campaign

 from mindaneeo to chiny and kio

 and all through the swamps of spain

  there aint anv swamps in spain said i

 he answered in tone serene

  hev i got ter explain theres tnorn one
      spain

 an theres swamps in the one i mean

  but speakin o swamps-in the philippines
 the mud it eomes down in showers

 and youd certainly laugh ter see the
      giratte

  rode fer his wadin powers

 s bird an the rest-my

 giraffes in the philippines i cried-
 perhaps i was too abrupt

 for he sorrowfully sighed and at length re-
      plied

  a gent doesnt interrupt

  but speakin of beasts-in the strailian
 bush

 is a thing called a pattyplus

 one-half of iti
 word-

 looks terrible much like us

  it can throw a stick called a rangaboom
 with secli a peeculiar swing
 that the thing it hits has curious fits
 and runs around in a ring

  but speakin of runnin around said he

  when you come to the isle of guam

 the women you meet aint got any feet

 and yet they is brave an calm

  an my huzum bleeds fer their helpless
      state

 fer none of em ever begs

 so i asks jour aid fer a fund ive made
 fer buyin em wooden legs

  but i am a native of guam i said

 and he growled as he shuflled by

  ive wasted enough of expensive guff
 on such a cheap sort of a guy

men no longer wait on the slow process of
time this advertisement speaks to other
millions while you are reading it

  ten years ago a man who imported much
fine foreign furniture for his fellow americans
decided to make american furniture the
standard of the world

  this man has doubled his facilities over and
over again until he now has the largest and
most perfect workshops of their kind in the
world - making cowan cabinet
work-and yet he is not supplying one-
tenth of the demand which will arise when all
the people know about cowan furniture

  he is planning to double his workshops

pianola piano

hundreds of people will return from the
country this year with the intention of
buying a pianola piano

  in the home of some neighbor or friend
they have been greatly entertained by
hearing one of these instruments-per-
haps even played one themselves

  they have listened to people who
literally knew nothing whatever of music
play the pianola piano with a beauty-an
expressiveness-a brilliancy of execution
only surpassed by the greatest pianists

     discernment necessary

  but not all these people will exercise
the care they should when they come to
make their purchase

  some of them may fail to realize until
after they buy-that all player-pianos are
not pianola pianos

   too late they will learn that the musical
results accomplished with the pianola
piano are possible on no other piano-
player whatsoever

  that only on the pianola are those
wonderful features the aferostye-

         pianola pianos cos from  upwards they may y
         will be mailed free upon request together with

which shows in ever piece the mood of
the composer and how to interpret it
the them odist-which brings the melody
or  theme  clearly out above the accom-
paniment the graduated accompaniment
the sustaining pedal device etc

pianola pianos radically different
from player-pianos

  a player-piano is any piano with any
player in it

  a pianola piano is either a steinway
a weber a steck a wheelock or a stuy-
vesant piano containing the world famous
pianola itself

  practically all piano manufacturers
now have instruments on the market for
which they claim results similar to the
pianola piano

  the fact is that not one of these
instruments approaches the pianola piano
either in the artistic nature of its perform-
ance-the simple yet complete control
it offers the performer or in the expe-
rience and skill which shows in its
construction

                                                               be purchasedon monthly payments illustrated catalog q

the problem of time

  an advertisement by elbert hubbard

iime has always been a strange and baffling puzzle to philoso-
phers they could never explain or account or trace its
beginning and end while we can calculate the end of
worlds and of solar systems time stretches away illimitable
unfettered and uncontrolled  the principal thing that
differentiates man from the animals is his cognizance of time
animals know when they are hungry but they never look at
the sun or make any sign which shows that they are speculating about time
we divide life up into periods of time and thus make it endurable you lend
a man money and in a year he pays you back with something additional-or
he doesnt anyway ne should where did the extra money come from 
time produced it how can time cease by no leap of mind can one
imagine but all the time that the individual can call his own is while he lives

    when will fate with her scissors clip the thread of time for you  you
do not know and this very uncertainty should make you prize time and work
while it is called the day to limit the shock of your passing and to ease
your affairs over the shallows when your hand and brain can no longer guide
them life insurance comes in death for most comes without warning by
life insurance those dependent upon us are cared for and the result of our
foresight and prudence is the possession of those we love after we are gone
 life insurance is not a duty it is more than that-it is a privilege life
insurance does not actually insure you against death but it insures your loved
ones against want when you are no longer here that very fact gives peace

oise and power to the man who is insured it makes for length of days
fe insurance is an extension on time and being wise we provide
through the equitable life against the time when time shall be no longer ours

one telephone
dumb
five million eloquent

  if there were only one telephone
in the world it would be exhibited
in a glass case as a curiosity

  even in its simplest form tele-
phone talk requires a second instru-
ment with connecting wires and
other accessories

  for real useful telephone service
there must be a comprehensive
system of lines exchanges switch-
boards and auxiliary equipment
with an army of attendants always
on duty

  connected with such a system a
telephone instrument ceases to be a
curiosity but becomes part of the

great mechanism of universal com-
munication

  to meet the manifold needs of
telephone users the bell system has
been built and today enables twenty-
five million people to talk with one
another from five million telephones

  such service cannot be rendered
by any system which does not cover
with its exchanges and connecting
lines the whole country

  the bell system meets the needs
of the whole public for a telephone
service that is united direct and
universal

 cents a day is all it costs
most people to run this car

 there are  hupmobile owners in america

 the great majority iceep their cars at home and run
 them for about c a day

 that means everything - oil gasoline repairs -
 everything

 you may moralize all vou like about the expense
 of keeping automobiles-but youll not find a
 hupmobile owner who will admit that his car is
 an expense at all

 at c a day he maintains that his hupmobile is
 cheaper than street cars-infinitely less expensive
 than a horse

 cheaper because it covers so much more ground

 an economy because it enables the owner to do two
 or three times as much work and still have leisure

the hupmobile is just the right size to save
  money in first cost and it saves money because
  it is just the right size on tires gasoline and
  repairs

and isnt it the handsomest smallest car of its type
   in the market 

at least  more people can afford to own 
  hupmobile-in the sense that it would prove
  itself an actual investment in lime saved and the
  pleasure it would bring

it is estimated that one man in ten still wears

it is a fact that not one man in ten thousand
has his shoes made to order

      the average man you meet is wearing today a better look-

      worn by the millionaire of yesterday just one thing has
      made this possible

goodyear welts

      here is a picture of the shoemaker of your youth you have seen
him at work with almost precisely the same tools that were used at the
time the pyramids were built

      but within your memory he has vanished into history his place has
been taken by a system of almost human
machinery the making of shoes has
been revolutionized in the past ten
years by the marvelous development
and the general use of the goodyear
welt system of shoe machinery which
results in

satisfaction to the wearer

better business for the dealer 

i  prosperity for the manufacturer

improved conditions of tabor

      no matter where sold or under what name all really good welt
shoes today are made by this process-ask the salesman next time
if the welt shoes he offers you are  goodyear welts -refuse them
if they are not you want the best-get it

right light

 there is a good
deal in this lighting
question - whether
it be for a hotel
a barn a store a

  a light isnt a good
light until it has the
right glass

 the glass makes
or mars the light a bare light dazzles
with the proper glass it is changed
to soft agreeable artistic illumination

for every kind of light-electric gas
and oil i make over three thousand
styles of electric lighting glass in all
shapes and colors and in silk satin
and velvet finishes this is exclusive
of my globes for gas and my lamp-
chimneys

  my latest invention is alba glass
it is particularly adapted to outdoor
lighting and large spaces it refines
the brilliancy and gives perfect dif-
fusion

 every lighting glass i make is
perfect in its place and each proves
that the glass is as important as the
light itself

    you can have an object lesson in the use of the
    gillette on any sleeping car in america

     most men who shave on the train use the gillette
     they can shave quickly-with no stropping no hon-
     ing-shave smoothly and clean up all the corners with
     no danger from the lurch or motion of the car

       a bridegroom on the canadian pacific acquired a
    three-days growth of beard despair was written on
    his face a kindly old gentleman loaned him a gillette
    -and received the united thanks of two fond hearts

       men who travel much become very practical they
    go in for efficiency-get down to necessities
