an efficiency man said to me once only
when a method is right can you chart it

three million men know that a mennen
shave is right chart or no chart

mennens gives the same amazing results
with any kind of water hot or cold hard
or soft a small amount of cream will hold
such an enormous amount of water that its
economical

dermutation-the scientific way to mas-
ter a beard softens it so that it yields to the
razor without a twitch

 then the tingling peppy zip of skin balm cooling
 refreshing wonderfully good for the skin

and finally a velvety film of talcum for men that
is antiseptic protecting to sensitive skin and doesnt
show because it is skin color

all this co-ordinated shaving efficiency concen-
trated in just a few minutes of absolutely satisfying
convincing operationtry the j

the devil s caldron

by don mcgrew

author of devil jordans treasure

buried treasure to the far south seas it lured the adventurous company of the anthony wayne
where with pirates mutineers and cannibals there soon was brewing a fiery mess fit for the devils caldron

chapter i

roaring bill donovan

he event which ul-
timately led to our
adventures on that
weird island the
devils caldron -
so called by the
buccaneers who first
set foot upon it-
took place on a warm day in july
 when my uncles schooner a
three-master named anthony wayne
was bound southward from portland
to savannah it was on that day that
our lookout sighted the little gig with
the spritsail and roaring bill dono-
van the only man aboard her stepped
upon our deck

  i was then in my twentieth year
and on my first sea voyage and from
the moment we sighted him i was filled
with curiosity what circumstances
had brought him to such a pass a
giant in size he was bandaged in a
half dozen places his gray eyebrows
were twisted upward like a devils
horns and lie had an air about him of
a man who could rip an oak tree up by
the roots with his massive craggy
features his fierce beak of a nose a
grim slash for a mouth above his heavy

jaw and skin on his cheeks like folds
of leather he seemed possessed of all
the violent potentialities which break
out like the eruption of a volcano in
the breasts of men when boarding a
vessel with cutlases between their
teeth

  a pirate perhaps i whispered
eagerly to captain van tassel

  jess the fat skipper murmured in-
dulgently veil maybe yet if you
vas at sea in a shmall poat like hims
for a vile you vould like a birate look
yourselluf qioost vait und ve see

  meanwhile the giant in the gig con-
tinued to look at us closely as we
hove-to near him he had made no
signal for help indeed i well re-
member afterward that he regarded
us with a mixture of relief and appre-
hension  and his first words coming
from a man who was about to be res-
cued from a perilous position were
odd in themselves

  where bound  said he in a boom-
ing bass voice husky with thirst and
fever

  hrrrummph snorted captain van
tassel vor zavannah-jess but
maybe he added ironically you vant
i should put abouit und dake you py
london-jess 

  a change came over the man in the

gig he seemed quite relieved and
he lifted his hand and smiled rather
wanly

  no offense he said quickly
skipper myself-or was till a week
ago if youll take me aboard by the
flying dutchman the ports  odds
and ill do a trick to earn my pas-
sage

  veil den our skipper returned-
and donovan was brought aboard
with his gig an acquisition which the
thrifty van tassell was not inclined
to overlook

hen he had been
given a drink of
hot coffee and rum
the big seaman
smacked his lips ap-
preciatively and
looked from the
skipper to me with
another smile his gray eyes had been
shrewd and keen in their first appraisal
of s they were eyes that seemed to
take in everything at a glance and bore
straight through you yet when he
smiled when the crows feet at the
edges were accentuated and his firm
white teeth were disclosed i warmed
to him immediately

  ah lie exclaimed holding out his


the frontier

reat right hand with the cup in it to
be cabin-boy for another draught
thats fine by the flying dutchman
nd many thanks to you sir he
idded to captain van tassel lifting
he refilled cup by way of salute then
ifter taking another drink he contin-
ued and i hopes you dont have
he same luck twas just a week ago
-though it seems more like a year-
 was a-sittin in my own cabin a-
irinkin of my own rum on the cor-
noran when i was laid aboard by pi-
ates burn em and here i am

  so was the skippers only com-
nent he puffed at his long-stemmed
ipe eyeing donovan stolidly through
he curling wreaths of smoke

 yes donovan returned not
far out of salem too-and they killed
ill but three of fourteen hands i had
iboard them three they set adrift
with me but they died o wounds
they took my old cormoran-fore
nd aft rigged same as this here craft
-and what theyll do wlh her i dont
now so here i am past fifty no
hip and no billet but no tears to spill
nd now sir when ive had a square
neal and a sleep and these here cuts
dressed a bit ill show you im good
for a trick

  the skipper nodded slowly as was
bis wont he had only a question or
two more to ask the man but i be-
ing afire with excitement pressed him
for further details donovan how-
ever seemed loth to discuss the piracy
and beyond saying that the pirate ship
bore the freshly painted name nancy
simmons and was a square-rigger with
twelve guns he added little more to
the brief account

  he had sailed out of halifax he
said and had but two guns aboard
his rudder had been shot away at the
first fire and at least thirty men had
boarded him

  and that he said was about all
there was to it my son he shook
his head gloomily adding if its just
the same to you son id rather talk
about wirlimigigs or a tot o rum or
flyin fishes-anything at all least-
ways cept losin all i had so heres
mud in your eye and a fair wind

  but though he fought shy of dis-
cussing those details of the fight for
which i thirsted like any youth roar-
ing bill donovan soon proved to be a
cheerful and entertaining companion
aboard ship sometimes he was mo-
rose and brooding sometimes he
seemed to want to be alone but after
his cutlas wounds began to heal and
he had been given a berth aft was

shaved and rested he was for the
most part the sunniest man aboard

  he could imitate a dozen and one
birds and animals he was an excellent
spinner of thrilling yarns woven
about adventures he had experienced
in all parts of the globe and scarce a
day passed in which he failed to trans-
port me on the wings of his fancy to
the tortugas or the african gold
coast or to isles where he swore the
sands were thick with the bones of
pirates who had died fighting over
buried treasure furthermore he had
a melodious voice and it was a treat
to see him striding back and forth
across the poop stepping as lightly as
a youth for all his years and tremend-
ous size roaring out a -chanty which
ran

  oh quarter oh quarter cried the
    jolly pirate then

  blow high blow low and what care
    we

  but the quarter that we gave them
  was to sink them in the sea
  sailing down the coast o the high
  barbaree

  a man after my own heart our
young first mate jenkins said one day
when donovan had been aboard a mat-
ter of three weeks i hope mr bel-
lew has a billet for him when we get
to savannah

  the skipper removed his pipe and
blew a mouthful of fragrant smoke
into the air he too was a large man
though not so tall as donovan he
appeared in fact to be overly fat
phlegmatic and even stupid at times
yet many a man had been fooled to
his sorrow by that mild blue eye those
flaccid jowls that shuffling rolling
spraddling gait and his habit of
dreamily puffing his pipe as though
half asleep underneath those layers
of fat were muscles of steel and un-
derneath that sleepy mien was a mind
that functioned like a keen rapier go-
ing straight to the point i had seen
him leap across the deck like a cata-
mount and knock the heads of three
mutinous seamen together with little
apparent effort now he eyed dono-
van and pursed his lips

  he iss a goot navigator-none pet-
ter he said dot much i know
und so i shall rebort

  and so matters were standing when
having been blown from our course by
adverse winds we sighted a low-lying
three-master displaying signals of dis-
tress

chapter ii

a battered ship 

ummph grunted
captain van tas-
sel lifting his
glass vot now
donovan and i
were standing be-
side him on the
poop and we fol-
lowed his example studying the stran-
ger through long brass telescopes

  the sun was shining very brightly
that morning and the long vessel-a
ship of six hundred tons burden-was
clearly outlined on the waters she was
flying british colors and bore the name
retriever a square-rigged ship her
sails had been taken in save for a reef
or two and i saw at a glance that
something was wrong with her steer-
ing gear for she was broadside on to
the wind and wallowing lazily in the
troughs of the long easy swells she
had a list to starboard and was lying
so low that her scuppers dipped now
and again and as we came closer we
could hear the steady clank-dank of
pumps working in her hold in addi-
tion to this her bowsprit had gone by
the board and there were several gap-
ing holes in her bulwarks

roundshot donovan grunted

  this was more and more obvious as
we drew nearer she had been badly
worsted in one of those grim sea bat-
tles which were but incidental in that
belligerent and unsettled period one
shot had passed through the upper
focsle another had smashed in the
corner of the cabin and her gigs were
in splinters only a half dozen men
were in sight on her decks

  but what struck me most forcibly
was this though she was a merchant-
man by design i counted as many as
a dozen guns aboard her these with
the exception of two which had been
dismounted were jacketed but i
judged them to be nine and twelve
pounders

  a privateer or a pirate i ex-
claimed excitedly

  roaring bill lowered his glass and
glanced at me in a sidelong fashion
without turning his head his eyes
were twinkling

  not much difference cept that one
has a letter and the other hasnt he
observed dryly then he turned to
the skipper by your leave sir he
said but was you intendin to take
them swabs aboard

  his maimer in addressing the cap-
tain was deferential-a habit he had
the devils caldron



maintained ever since coming aboard
in my opinion he was in truth a shade
the better navigator of the two and
there had been times when i sensed
that he was fairly itching to crowd on
canvas when the skipper was taking
in sail but he never put forward an
opinion in opposition to van tassels
views from the very first he had
taken his trick as a sort of extra mate
ever being ready with a cheery ay
ay sir when the skipper gave an
order so now captain van tassel
lowered his own telescope and an-
swered pleasantly

  veil sir he said i subbose i
have to but i dont choost like it
the looks from her

  and right you were sir roaring
bill exclaimed nodding emphatically
i was going to say i had heard some-
at about that craft i cant rightly re-
member what nor where-but it
wasnt good and anyway youre right
not to like the looks of any britisher
these days

  captain van tassel nodded on his
own account but he pointed out com-
mon humanity bade him to give the
retrievers crew the benefit of the
doubt if they were pirates and look-
ing for another ship it was patent that
they were in no position to fire upon
the anthony wayne since their ship
was unmanageable and plainly sink-
ing

  as for being boarded at the last
minute the skipper said that he would
take steps to forestall this forthwith
all hands were piped on deck pistols
and cutlases were handed out the
jackets were removed from our long
nines which were four in number
and the brass guns were then loaded
with double shot and slugs not until
then did van tassel give orders to
bear down  the retriever where-
upon donovan entered the cabin

  veil the captain shouted when
we were hove-to close to the sinking
vessel vot do you vant

  the retrievers skipper who was
standing on his quarter deck eyed our
captain for a moment with open
mouth he was a tall spare man with
wide bony shoulders a flat sallow
face and long drooping yellow mus-
tachios around his head he wore a
blood-stained blue scarf while two
heavy silver-mounted pistols were
thrust into a yellow silk sash which
he had bound round his waist he
was far from prepossessing in appear-
ance nor were the half dozen men
near him of pleasing aspect they
were a brandy-faced lot of muscular

weather-beaten old tars some with
their whiskers curled in tight little
ringlets some with brass rings hang-
ing from their ear lobes and all bear-
ing a scar or two and giving the im-
pression that their calloused hands
were fully as used to the heft of a
cutlas as the feel of a rope

  veil captain van tassel re-
peated i say it again vot do you
vant 

  want cried the retrievers skip-
per then why what but to come
aboard youve an eye in your head
i reckon this craft is slated for davy
jones locker and that before sun-
down met up with a couple of
frenchies and they shot me full o
holes

  vot i meant vas diss captain
van tassel went on imperturbably
you have it a loat left maybe
all stove in was the reply

  veil den how many vas you 
for the answer the retrievers cap-
tain stepped to a hatchway and said
something which we could not hear
in a trice the sound of the pumps
ceased and four men came tumbling
up on deck

  there you sees em said he with
the yellow sash eleven with me
then he looked us over and smiled
to their eleven all apparently un-
armed save the captain we presented
a front numbering seventeen men
armed to the teeth saw you load-
ing them guns the stranger went on
well now if youre on that lay
theres plenty cargo yet that aint hurt
by water-enough anyway to pay you
for the trouble of layin alongside
as for us-why we havent much
choice we aint all we asks is quar-
ter and a foot ashore any place us
and four wounded

  ve aint birates grunted captain
can tassel choost the same dough
ve lay alongside und dakes vot dere is
for zalvage-und for bassage monies
jess but see here youre sure dots
all the men vot you have eh
certainly growled the stranger
rest of my crew scuttled

  all right our skipper returned
only remember-vun false moof
und it iss hell for you and he gave
orders to lay alongside

  while this maneuver was being ex-
ecuted i stepped down from the poop
it appeared that my chances for en-
gaging in a sea fight were gone glim-
mering and i found myself torn be-
tween relief and a sense of disap-
pointment then while i was pacing

about and gripping my cutlas nerv-
ously i looked into the cabin and saw
roaring bill donovan coming up from
the lazarette in his hands he carried
a keg of powder

  instantly curious i ran into the
cabin donovan had placed the keg
on the deck and was busy with a
brace and bit boring a small hole
through the top

 what are you going to do i
asked

  watch he said removing a bit
of fuse from his pocket he inserted it
in the hole leaving a bare inch pro-
truding this he secured with a bit
of wax snatched from a candleholder
next he produced a bit of tarry rope
which he ignited with flint and tin-
der

  now he said blowing on the
glowing coal at the end of his im-
provised torch i dont know as id
ve dealt with them swabs same as the
skippers doing but nemmind that
hes skipper and a good one just the
same i dont trust them swabs and
by the flying dutchman if they
makes a crooked move youll see
something

  but arent you apt to blow your-
self and the lot of us up before you
can get that away i cried looking
askance at that short fuse

  donovan looked at me once more in
a sidelong fashion

  son dont you go to frettin about
old bill he said dryly i knows
what im about

  for a second i considered speaking
to the captain but in the next breath
i thought better of it for one thing
the mans very assurance inspired con-
fidence for another i too was skep-
tical about the actual number of men
still aboard the retriever we had
had no opportunity of looking into
her hold so as donovan stepped to
the cabin door and halted there wait-
ing i went out on deck and paused
nearby

  then everything seemed to happen
in the space of a few heartbeats

e had barely come
alongside the re-
triever when her
captain raised a
whistle to his lips
and blew a sharp
blast the men on
his deck stooped
swiftly and came up with cutlases and
pistols which they had hidden at their
feet close against the bulwarks mean-
time a swarm of men came roaring out


the frontier

of the after cabin the focsle and the
open hatchway they were armed
with cutlases and they made for the
bulwarks with a yell that fairly split
my eardrums

  out the swabs-all hands all
hands roared their skipper leaping
to the bulwarks and firing both pistols
into the knot of men at our after port
gun

  in that horrible moment our fate
seemed certain in reality there were
forty men pouring out to attack us
but at first glance there seemed to be
a hundred and though captain van
tassel fired on the instant and others
followed suit dropping a man here
and there the most of our crew were
thrown into a panic i for one yelled
excitedly and fired my pistol with only
a hasty aim in the next second i
found myself facing a burly ruffian
who came charging at me with his cut-
las swinging high above his head

  but even before his blade fell dono-
van had acted and the tide was turned

  from the tail of my eye i saw him
clamp the glowing end of the tarry
rope to the fuse it sputtered with
an upward sweep of his arms he raised
the heavy keg over his head then
with a mighty heave the giant threw
his terrible bomb toward the retriev-
ers deck it struck the pirates leader
fairly in the breast as he balanced upon
the bulwarks he was knocked back-
ward to his own deck the keg of pow-
der tumbling with him and immedi-
ately afterward there followed a tre-
mendous explosion

  i was knocked to the deck by the
force of it the man who aimed to
cut me down pitched over me as
though shot from a gun sprawling on
his face in the scuppers a dozen
more including our own men and
those who had gained our deck were
knocked into a cocked hat as the say-
ing goes sprawling here and there in
every imaginable attitude while others
were brought up standing with silly
shocked expressions on their faces

  on our deck the majority had been
protected from serious wounds by the
intervening bulwarks of the two ves-
sels but the execution on the deck of
the retriever was frightful fully
two-thirds of their men had yet to gain
the bulwarks when the spark struck
the powder in that keg others were
still poised at the rail ready to leap
across to our planks of these some
were blown across our decks and into
the sea some were knocked down un-
conscious into the midst of our men
and others were killed by flying splin-

ters but those remaining on their
own deck suffered most terribly they
were blown in every direction three
being lifted to the yardarms where
they hung dangling and one being
thrown tumbling end over end to
land in the sea astern

  donovan had thrown himself prone
after casting the bomb now we
scrambled up together snatching up
a cutlas from a fallen men he glanced
toward the poop saw that captain van
tassel was down-shot through the

lie thrust it quickly into his shirt bosom

calf of his right leg as we learned
later-and then rallied our men with
a stentorian roar before the smoke
of the explosion had drifted away we
were following him about the deck
cutting down those who had gained a
footing among us some fought des-
perately some cried for quarter and
others attempted to jump back aboard
their own vessel we in the meantime
under donovans leadership kept
some degree of organization so that
isolated men were quickly borne down
by a concerted rush and our deck was
quickly cleared then pausing a mo-
ment for breath the giant brought us
round him again with another roar

  a round dozen of us yet  he cried
well then by the flying dutchman
well do the boarding now

  he leaped to the bulwarks and
pointed his bloody cutlas at the decks
of the relriver still enveloped with
drifting whisps of smoke

  at em my hearties he bellowed
follow me all hands

  we were over and into them on the
instant aflame with the joy of victory
on our own deck and eager to be at
them before they could recover fully

from the shock of that explosion we
were confronted by fairly equal num-
bers but some of these were still
dazed and went down at the first on-
slaught thereupon the crews split
into entangled groups which milled
here and there about the deck step-
ping over screaming wounded men and
hacking at one another in a bedlam of
cries and curses

  for my own part i was close be-
hind donovan when he struck the re-
trievers deck a pirate lunged at me
and in dodging his cut i almost fell
into a gaping hole in the planks don-
ovan split the man to the chin with a
whistling stroke and went on then
mother pirate came at me and i found
myself battling desperately to save my
life

  how long we cut and slashed at each
other i do not know to me it seemed
a century the man fought with the
fury of despair and he cut at me so
rapidly that i had hard shift to ward
off the blows he had a brutish pock-
marked face and a patch over one eye
which i saw later in my dreams but
when my lungs seemed to be bursting
and the perspiration was pouring into
my eyes he stumbled and my blade
found his neck he went down with a
choked sob

  the force of my blow had almost
swung me from my feet so that i
stumbled over him and leaned panting
heavily against the cabin companion-
way thus my attention was called
to a scuffle in the pirate captains quar-
ters turning i saw donovan with
his back toward me he had just cut
down one of the buccaneers and was
in the act of jerking something from
the fallen mans hand what it was i
could not see for he thrust it quickly
into his shirt bosom before turning
about

  afterward i remembered that he
started a little then quickly recovered
himself at the time i gave it little
thought he came rushing out at once
and paused abruptly to scan the shat-
tered bloody deck

  got your man i see he panted
bully for you jack and he clap-
ped me heartily on the shoulder with
his left hand well our two was the
last he went on pointing with his
cutlas see there jack theyre
done

  i looked and saw that he spoke
truth only a bare half dozen pirates
remained untouched and these had
thrown down their arms and were
begging for qrarter the fight was
over
the devil s caldron



chapter iii

jerry blunts doubloons

s i looked about the
blood-smeared deck
a reaction set in
the planks were
strewn with dead
and wounded the
dead lay in grotes-
que distorted atti-
tudes  some with the teeth showing in
ghastly grins through pallid lips some
with their pale stiff fingers hooked
talon-wise as though reaching out for
the last desperate hold on life three
sailors from the anthony wayne had
been killed outright five more had
been wounded and the retrievers
dead numbered fourteen including the
captain and the mate of the re-
mainder four had received mortal
wounds and only six had escaped un-
hurt when i noted the unwholesome
pallor of the dead and listened to the
cries and groans of the injured i was
filled with pity and nausea

  but i was given little time to indulge
in morbid fancies despite his
wounded leg captain van tassel had
drawn himself up beside the bulwarks
standing on his uninjured leg and
gripping the rail tightly he snapped
out an order that brought our excited
crew to heel in a jiffy there was
much to do before the sinking pirate
vessel was abandoned and so young
mr jenkins our mate was set busy
at once putting prisoners below at the
pumps detailing others to remove their
seriously injured comrades to the
anthony wayne and setting our own
crew to stripping the retriever of
everything transportable in the way of
valuables and gear

  und gif a close look aft for a
strong room mr jenkins the cap-
tain added

  the poor skipper was very pale and
grim as he stood there fighting down
his pain he was nursing bitter
thoughts he knew and the men knew
that his blunder in going alongside the
retriever to facilitate the removal of
salvage had come within an ace of
costing the lives of all of us dono-
van on the other hand undoubtedly
had saved the day as we paused a
moment for a drink of brandy before
plunging into our search he was the
receiver of many gruff words of heart-
felt praise from our sweating hands
and if he had been popular lefore it
was plain that he was almost an idol
now

ah by gum one said admiringly

to a shipmate that was the prime
dodge and no mistake he have a
head atop his shoulders and fight
shiver my timbers twas like follying
a bull in a tea shop you had only to
pick up the pieces

  to all this donovan waved a de-
precating hand captain van tassels
name had not been mentioned of
course but donovan knew very well
what the men were thinking so as
he confessed to me later not desiring
to fall foul of the skippers hawse
any more than could be helped he
made as light of the incident as pos-
sible

   twas only as i has a natural tend-
ency to be ready for such sculch he
said tossing off his brandy its all
due to what others of the same kind
did to me dysee and now mr
jenkins he went on briskly and
cheerily whats the lay for me sir

  the young mate was hesitant for a
second-for he too admired donovan
immensely and he was diffident about
giving orders to a master mariner so
many years his senior indeed his
order was made in the form of a re-
quest but donovan with the cheeri-
est ay ay sir hurried at once with
me into the cabin

  that swab he said indicating the
dead seaman on the floor was the
mate name of cutshaw thought
i was sure of him minute i spotted
him

 where did you know him  i
asked

  why donovan returned easily
met him in boston once i knows
this hooker now if i aint mistaken
shes the old muscovy renamed that
dead skipper out there-him with the
yellow sash-why hes brazil-slim
brazil youve heard of him

  why yes i cried hes been
posted

  right you are said donovan busy
turning out drawers i got a look at
his mug once in boston afore he was
losted for the gallows at that
though i wasnt sure of myself until

i	seen him blow his whistle and jump
on the bulwarks

  it was on the tip of my tongue then
to ask him about the object which
bulged in his shirt front but he had
not seen fit to mention it to me and i
was held back by two considerations
whatever it was he had come upon it
first and he had saved my life so i
kept silence then as a seaman came
in with an ax we fell to upon the
locked hatch over the strong room
and the discovery we made there

drove donovans find from my mind
for the time lieing

 in four brass-bound chests we
found an assortment of coins amount-
ing in all to over twenty thousand
pounds

  the coins came from the mints of
many countries with english guineas
double guineas pieces of eight and
french louis making up two-thirds of
the total with them were moidores
pieces from the orient bored through
the middle sequins piasters crowns
and gold silver and copper coins bear-
ing the bas-relief portraits of nearly
all the european monarchs since the
middle ages

  in addition to this we found rubies
pearls diamonds and emeralds which
with other precious stones were val-
ued at some four thousand pounds
and from the hold we retrieved a
large number of salable articles these
included lxiles of silk rolls of brocade
boxes of shoes kegs of liquor one
hundred new fowling pieces forty
clocks a lot of pewter ware seven
sets of handsome silver-mounted
dueling pistols a box of polished silver
candle-sticks as many as fifty powder
kegs and a dozen and one other items
furthermore we stripped the retriev-
er of all her rations charts sails
blocks and small arms before we left
her the brass cannons were left on
her deck these being too cumbersome
to sling aboard at the last then
when the retriever had settled to a
dangerous point despite the pumps
we cleared away leaving her to sink
in unison with the blazing sun on the
western horizon

he finding of the
treasure w a s
greeted with a yell
of delight by the
crew for my uncle
was above all a
just and generous
m an and they
knew they were due to share it also
lessened the tension captain van
tassel i knew was promptly forgiven
by the men while donovans popular-
ity was increased the more as fur
the skipper lie became markedly less
grim even smiling when donovan
came aboard and owning up to his
fault handsomely

  i dought i vas gareful he said
but not quite enough danks to you
ve haf our lifes-und plunder und
zo i shall rebort to mr bellew jess

  why cried donovan heartily
thats handsome of you sir and uo
the frontier

mistake but you made no error-

  i could haf made em gome aboart
in my gigs a few at von time the
skipper interrupted zay no more
id iss so i shall rebort

  donovan waved his hands resign-
edly but immediately straightened and
rubbed his hands briskly

  well sir he said heres one
thing youre going to let me do right
now thats to fix a bandage on that
leg of yours

  and securing the medical kit that
remarkable giant with his tremendous
hands shortly displayed a deftness in
surgery that might well have won the
praise of any surgeon nor did he
stop with the captain whistling cheer-
fully he labored far on into the night
treating our men and the wounded
buccaneers as well extracting bullets
and stitching up wounds with a skill
that was admirable to behold

  what i says exclaimed mr jen-
kins is this theres as handy an all-
around man as ive seen afloat

  in the meantime all the uninjured
buccaneers had been closely guarded
and clapped in irons the instant they
came on board most of them had
little to say like their wounded they
were pale depressed and for the most
part sullen and brooding occasion-
ally one tried to rally his fellows one
or two attempted bravado but the ma-
jority responded to this with grins
that were all too feeble a moment
later they relapsed once more sunk
in their contemplation of the fate
which awaited them now one licked
his dry lips now one shivered appre-
hensively for they had been taken
red-handed and the shadow of the im-
pending gallows lay over them all

  among them was a black-browed
giant called beef mccallum by his
shipmates he had been quartermaster
aboard the retriever a fearful cut
on the left side of his head had cost
him an ear and had also knocked him
unconscious so that he lay breathing
stertorously for two days and more
without speaking we thought at first
that the mans skull had been frac-
tured and that he would undoubtedly
die but on the third day he rallied
and within an hour or two was sit-
ting up

  going about with donovan on his
rounds-for he had continued to act
as the doctor-i came upon the man
seated on a pallet on the focsle deck
under a tarpaulin along with other
wounded buccaneers

  ha said donovan so you dont
cheat the gallows after all my hearty

  the buccaneer winced a little and
scowled at us

  thats as may be he growled
then with a look from the tail of his
eye at his comrades he spoke bluntly
but with an appeal in his bloodshot
eyes that belied his gruffness

  could i have a word with you
sir he asked

  glancing at donovan i caught a
strange flicker in his narrowed eyes
but almost at once he spoke up

  no harm in that i suppose said
he come

  we gave the man a hand up and in
a moment had helped him tottering
with weakness to a point amidships
out of earshot of his comrades there
we three paused mccallum leaning
against the bulwarks for support he
was no longer gruff but stared at don-
ovan beseechingly stark fear was
staring from his eyes

 i aint no coward he began
hoarsely but the gallows-ill say
ive the horrors for thought of em
well now what i want to ask is this
if so be it i could tell you where jerry
blunts cache lay would i get off
all the geniality had flown from
donovans features he eyed the
quartermaster grimly his mouth a
compressed slit

  so you know where it is do you
he grunted

  mccallum changed countenance a
little

 i does-that is i knows-

  come donovan interrupted if
you knows spit it out

  the man searched donovans fea-
tures closely before answering

  ah he groaned then i dont
have no luck you must have found
the chart

  donovan looked round about quickly
no one was within earshot

  grant that i have he said well
now you want your life theres a
chance for you if you open hatches
how many doubloons is in that cache
nigh onto a million pounds id
figger mccallum answered

y	eyes were fairly
popping by now i
can assure you the
name of jerry
blunt was one to
conjure with at sea
he had sailed as a
privateer during
the war he had been posted for piracy
later and he was supposed to have
taken no less than two hundred ships
it required little stretching of the im-

agination to credit him with a cache
of that size and it was plain that don-
ovan believed the assertion for he
drew in a whistling breath with his
eyes afire

  and do you know where its bur-
ied he exclaimed

  mccallum changed countenance

  yes-and no he said ruefully
its on a island out over the rim in
the south pacific-a place jerry blunt
named the devils caldron its a main
spot for cannibals thereabouts though
that island aint inhabited along of
sperrits or somethin atop the plateau
thats what jerry says after one pal-
aver anyway well i figgered if you
hadnt got the chart id name the
island anyway and maybe get a
chance to give you the slip when we
landed and he shuddered id
ruther be marooned or risk cannibals
than swing and sun-dry he added

  here said donovan producing a
flask try a tot o this and then tell
me what you know

  thankee said the pirate smack-
ing his lips over the potion well
then he continued in stronger tones
this were the way of it slim were
mate blunts first mate some three
years back i was bosn wed made
good hauls and the sea lion was fair
wallowing with pieces of eight and
plunder but one or two had got
away and we was posted and the
ripple widening so jerry-did you
ever meet up with jerry

  no said donovan though i just
missed him once

  ah said mccallum he were the
queer coot were jerry blunt that
cross-eyed he could stand on the fo-
csle deck facin the sprit and catch
you filchin a pannikin o rum from the
after cabin when he were a-thinkin
things out there hed squat cross-
legged like a turk under a tarpaulin
on the poop and a-playin of a piccolo
bowline haul is wot hed play till it
fair got on your nerves now hed
point the piccolo forard now hed
point it aft then hed point it towards
the cross-trees-but pipin away all
the time with the two eyes of him
looking straight in towards his nose
never a smile on his mug all the time
dymind only now and again hed
stop for a swig from a jug which hed
sling over his elbow pickle em in
brine hed say then theyll keep
better till judgment day which
were a sayin he had when we makes
em walk the plank

  yes yes said donovan impa-
tiently but dont hang so long in
the devils caldron



stays man what about the blunt 

  im a-comin to that said mc-
callum one fine day after such a
session jerry pipes all hands

   well take a vacation he says
well sail for the isles where the coo-
coo smiles he says well let em
forget us a while and load up with
pearls in the meantime thats what
he says so we stands for the horn
and off into the big pacific a-sailin
and a-sailin from one island to an-
other a-trading junk for pearls bar-
ring the horn it was like a picnic
with the sea so smooth as the palm o
your hand and a new drink to sample
in every island

  but a man gets tired of anything
in time and we was all for turning
back gibbet or no gibbet wed got
our shares all fair and square and we
said wed go back with them but
jerry was afraid for his own hed
keep enough to outfit a ship sometime
he said then lay low somewhere till
the noise blew over and come back
later failin that he had a niece he
wanted to get the blunt in case he was
caught and swung

   theyve got this ship spotted he
says and wherell your blunt be if
they get us on the way back

   well risk it we says but jerry
was still o the same mind so one
day when some forty niggers was
aboard us tradin what does he do but
have us slough em in irons and off
we sails for the devils caldron
there he goes ashore-him and the
forty niggers still in chains and a-
luggin o the chests with jerrys
share

  mccallum paused and spat

  well he continued not a man of
us was with em and where he took
em we never knew they was ashore
a matter o several days hid in the
jungles though he come back once
with some o them for axes and blocks
and falls meantime were layin to 
in the anchorage which he names
drakes bay but finally here he
comes-him and the forty niggers i
suppose says he you figger youll
teach these niggers how to talk eng-
lish but if you do says he itll be
on the judgment day pickle em in
brine he says and theyll keep better
till gabriel toots his horn and with
that he has us make em walk the
plank right there in the anchorage

  he werent no fool donovan com-
mented and how did brazil get the
chart 

why we got rid o the old sea lion
in rio dysee and separated but

slim he went on his own and some of
us joined him well about a month
ago in baltimore slim ran across
jerry-under another name of course
what took place i cant say-slim was
that close-mouthed knifed old jerry
like as not anyway he come aboard
and told me and the mate he has the
chart and we was a-sailin for the
devils caldron unbeknownst to the
men when we fell in with those
frenchies

  and you never saw the chart
said donovan

  not opened up no

  donovan thought a minute

  well he said presently you keep
mum and ill parley with you again
and as soon as the man was back
with his fellows jack donovan
said to me with a shrewd look youve
guessed that chart were what i took
from that mate but its placed now
where itll be hard to find dont ask
me to show it to you till we gets in
but pve a proposition to make this
being your uncles ship and i needing
one to get this blunt ill dicker with

where we took em we never knew

him when we gets in it hell outfit
us hes to have-well say seventy per-
cent above expenses for his risk
what could i answer he had the
chart hidden and possession is even
better than nine points besides lie
had saved the ship and my life as well

  all right i said but id like to
see the chart

  no said he someone might
stumble on us while im a-showing it
-and ive seen mutinies and knives
going for far less by the flying
dutchman well keep mum thats
our cue and well go straight to your
uncle when we land

  very well then i said and we
shook hands upon it

chapter iv

my uncle agrees

n the night we
sighted land dono-
van managed mc-
callums escape
the captain was
below the mate
jenkins was on
the poop by pre-
arrangement with donovan mccallum
asked permission to speak to the skip-
per only his wrists were ironed and
as donovan led him back along the
dark deck he quickly unlocked the pi-
rates fetters lie went overboard
with a leap donovan dropping the
irons with him there was no moon
he was out of sight at once and with
less than a quarter of a mile to swim
and a quiet sea his chances for reach-
ing shore were excellent

  probably preferred that way of
ending it to being swung and sun-
dried was donovans imperturbable
explanation to the skipper

 veil van tassel commented
stroking his blond chin tuft and pull-
ing at his pipe ids a small matter

  i was glad that the skipper was not
looking at me at the time my face i
know was as red as fire but a diver-
sion sent him out on deck before he
noted it

  the diversion was created by one
barnaby horn a hand before the
mast barring the calculations in-
volved in setting a course there was
no one aboard who knew more about
ships than this wily old seaman it
was a treat to see him scamper aloft
when a rope had fouled and he was
the lest helmsman aboard

  but barnaby had one great failing
he would find rum in the sahara
given time and no camel ever boasted
a greater capacity yet when he was
sober he was often to be seen under
an awning on the focsle deck with
a bible on his knees a pair of horn-
rimmed glasses down at the tip of his
red nose and his leathery deeply-
creased features painfully wrinkled as
his horny finger moved laboriously
from word to word and now hear-
ing a yell on deck the skipper went
out to find barnaby aglow with the
contents of a stolen bottle so i was
enabled to straighten my features

  that night we lay to in the roads
and made anchorage the next day
and as the anchor plunged out came


the frontier

my uncle george bellew and his al-
most  inseparable companion judge
pemberton riding in a small boat

  that your uncle with the white
hair asked donovan who was stand-
ing beside me on the poop

  he was nodding at the judge a man
six feet in height with very round
red cheeks a pair of black eyebrows
as black as coal and a great upstand-
ing mop of white hair which he wore
in a queue in lieu of a wig he was
a very quiet man as a rule but keenly
observant of everything around him
usually preferring to move his eyes
rather than his head when glancing
about these eyes were black and
brilliant making a sharp contrast with
his red cheeks and white hair and his
double chin was drawn back somewhat
into the folds of his stock while his
tightly compressed lips dropped sharp-
ly at the corners giving one the im-
pression that here was a very stern
and stately man indeed as usual he
was sitting very erect with his square
hands folded over a gold-headed cane

  no i replied to donovan the
others my uncle

  immediately donovan chuckled for
my uncle though nearly as old as the
judge-who approached forty-five-
had caught sight cf me and was wav-
ing and shouting like any lad he too
was a large broad-shouldered man
but though lie was one of the wealth-
iest shippers in savannah he was de-
scribed by his associates as an over-
grown boisterous boy he was ever
ready to shake your hand or fight you
for the sport of it he would wager on
any contest from a cock fight to a
horse race and nothing i do believe
would have suited him better than to
put to sea under the jolly roger for
the sheer sport of the thing aunt
martha who occasionally called him
vesuvius and described her life with
him as a career may in all likeli-
hood be given credit for keeping him
from an inglorious end on the gallows

   think hell go said donovan as
i shouted back to uncle george

  still shouting salutations uncle
george came closer in and looked up
at us with his handsome dark face
wreathed in smiles he had flashing
white teeth snapping brown eyes and
clear-skinned aquiline features which
might well have templed a sculptor

  well old sober-sides he yelled
at captain van tassel what has the
dutchman brought home this time

  the skipper who had been walking
a day or more smiled and removed his
pipe

  blunder he replied und bi-
rates und a shot in mine leg

  what cried uncle george-and
in a moment he was coming aboard
us wildly excited

  captain van tassel told the story
briefly in a characteristic monotone
uncle george hung on every word his
eyes dilated and every now and then
breaking in with a delighted exclama-
tion even the judge forgot to look
so terribly formidable and bent for-
ward with eager interest

  when the skipper touched on dono-
vans exploit he spared himself not a
whit uncle george i saw at once
had taken an instant liking to dono-
van  and now as that worthy stood
quietly by looking very modest indeed
my impetuous relative seized him by
the hand and wrung it heartily but
immediately afterward he clapped the
skipper a resounding blow on the back

  not a word of blame to you he
cried with a deep affection ringing in
his voice i would probably have
done the same identical thing alls
well that ends well-and if you hadnt
heaved alongside captain donovan
couldnt have thrown the keg and they
might have tripped you up later tut
tut not a word as for the men they
shall have two hundred pounds apiece
by the lord i iarry ill take care of
you skipper and you captain dono-
van never fear and you- he
wheeled and threw an affectionate arm
around my shoulder-so youve won
your spurs with a cutlas eh bless
my soul id ve given much to have
been there and watched you do it my
boy

  now to tell the truth i had suf-
fered several twinges of conscience
when thinking about the chart for i
felt somehow that i should have
taken captain van tassel into my con-
fidence my uncles display of affec-
tion for his trusted henchman stirred
my conscience anew so when he and
the judge and the skipper retired to
the cabin to go over the log and mani-
fests i spoke of my feelings to don-
ovan

  well he said turning out his
palms and raising his eyebrows and
shoulders how was i to know how
they stood but here ill explain
that to your uncle soon as hes free

  when the skipper came out i told
uncle george we had something more
of importance to tell him and don-
ovan and i were admitted at once
uncle george looked from one to the
other of us inquiringly

  not more surprises he cried

jovially cant stand too much all in
one morning you know

  well sir said donovan extract-
ing a rectangular packet from his shirt
itll be a surprise i shouldnt wonder
this heres the key to something like
a million pounds



y	uncles mouth
flew open the
judge dropped his
cane

  buried t r e a s-
ure  my uncle
cried

 yes - jerry
blunts donovan replied

  uncle george stared at him for sev-
eral seconds

  well he said then go on
speaking easily the giant told how
he had come upon the chart seeing a
man dodge into the cabin during the
fight he said he had rushed in upon
him the man was jerking the packet
from a locker having cut him down
donovan said he had thrust the thing
into his shirt

  i half suspected what it was at the
time he said anyway it was some-
thing that male wanted desperate bad
like as not he figgered to buy his life
with it

  having examined it later he went
 he had at first decided to say noth-
ing about it until he reached savannah
and had an audience with the ships
owner then he told of mccallums
proposal in my presence and of our
subsequent compact

  at this my uncle frowned and
hanged his fist on the table

  you both did very wrong he
cried i mean sir in not telling cap-
tain van tassel i trust him he is
myself in fact when at sea so far
as anything happening on board is con-
cerned

  donovan shrugged placatingly
how was i to know all that he
cried point is this though here
i be talking with a man able to outfit
an expedition i take it and the man
entitled to a chance at it seein as how
it was his ship picked me up and all

that now-

  george the judge cut in dont
be so confounded ethical the man
saved your ship he found the chart
and now lies here with it

  very well said my uncle smiling
once more but if i agree to finance
it captain van tassel is to sail the
ship and share

  fair enough donovan cried in-
stantly his face beaming
the devil s caldron



  then jack said uncle george
call the captain in at once

  captain van tassel received the
news with one of his few signs of emo-
tion he puffed a little harder at his
pipe as for donovans semi-apolo-
getic explanation of his silence he
waved this aside

  you had it a right to look oudt
for yourselluf he grunted

  and now sir the chart cried my
uncle

  donovan handed the packet to
uncle george whose fingers trembled
as he slipped off the canvas covering
inside this was an oilskin casing and
within that the chart drawn out in ink
upon heavy white parchment

  spread out upon the table there was
revealed the outline of an island it
was over twelve miles in length over
all and about ten in width three
prominent peninsulas projected from
it one running down along the east-
ern coast and shaped so that the pirates
had dubbed it blackbeards boot an-
other one with a hill at the southern
end projected just below it and
roughly resembled a human wrist and
clenched fist this was called kidds
mauley between the two was the en-
trance to drakes bay a long inlet
over a mile in width and running
northward for a distance of four
miles or so with blackbeards boot on
one side and the mainland on the other
to the mouth of a river the river
flowed from a lake which lay in the
center of a high oblong plateau-this
plateau being about four miles in
width and running almost the length
of the island along its middle line
the southern end of the plateau was
marked by a high hill called execu-
tion knob and the northern end by
another peak dubbed london tower
a waterfall was shown at the point
where the river plunged downward
from the plateau called the bosns
roar while the lake which fed the
stream was named the devils caldron

  but what drew all eyes at once was
the word cache over a black cross
this was marked on the plateau to the
southward of the lake and at the apex
of an equilateral triangle which had
been drawn on the chart the base of
the triangle had been formed by a line
running due north from a cave on the
northern footslopes of execution
knob and passing through a spot

  this was followed by the notation

  that was his name cried uncle
george looking up why i talked
to the man once as smooth as smooth
-and an eye in his head man i
see here said the judge it
looks as thought the bottom of this
chart had been cut off

  so exclaimed my uncle looking
at it more closely and he glanced up
at donovan

  its just as it was when i got it
said that worthy easily probably
the sheet was cut from a roll
probably very probably said my
uncle then he looked all round from
one to the other his eyes shining like
lamps by gad he cried slam-
ming his fist on the table well
sail for this devils caldron as soon
as we can rig over this ship

chapter v

equipped and manned

y	uncles deci-
sion filled me with
glee and donovan
was fairly beaming
with delight judge
pemberton at first
tried to dissuade
his crony but when
uncle george with a volley of tremen-
dous round oaths declared that he
would have that treasure or die try-
ing the judge gave in and smiled

  it isnt so much the treasure he
said as it is the adventure of the
thing thats what is pulling at you
george

  and you too damn it cried my
uncle youre going along and in-
tended to from the first

  well youll need watching said
his boon companion

  captain van tassel at first said
nothing whatever his features were
enigmatical

  veil going around dot horn aind
like picking flowers he remarked
when urged for his opinion und rnit
cannibals und typhoons maype ve

aind like to have a picnic all der vay
dots my thought but vere you say
sail i sail

  poof well take every precau-
tion uncle george laughed and
clapped him on the back and he
laughed aloud as excited over the pros-
pect as any boy who is assured of his
first peck over the horizon

  nor was he to be dissuaded by aunt
marthas exclamation of dismay when
he reached home she-the dear soul
-adored the man and aside from that
little ejaculation she had only one
question to ask

  do you know much about this
captain donovan she said

  why little enough he admitted
however that little is good but even
supposing i am wrong alxut the man
captain van tassel sails the ship and
we pick the crew what could he do

  nothing i suppose she said
well i suppose ill have to let you
go or youll explode

  there was much to do before we
could up-anchor uncle george had
decided to use the anthony wayne
she being the fastest and the roomiest
vessel in his fleet but before she could
put to sea again she had to be careened
scraped and repainted we also
shipped four more long nines and
strengthened the bulwarks too
there was the forecastle to be en-
larged as we wanted between twenty-
five and thirty men forward to deal
with strange natives if needs be and
since it was decided that the after
party would include the skipper the
mate my uncle the judge captain
donovan myself three negro servants
and johannsen our quartermaster
preparations had to be made for their
housing and there were also sup-
plies to be shipped for a voyage of
many months

  added to this was captain van tas-
sels problem in shipping his crew
the horn is enough to cause the
staunchest sailor a qualm or two and
of our old hands only johannsen the
quartermaster odonnel the bosn
anthony buzzel the coxswain and
walter killifer able seaman signified
intention of signing on like barnaby
horn the others took their share of
the loot from the retriever and were
off for a wild fling barnaby it is
true spent his share in less than two
weeks and was begging for a berth
soon after but the others had disap
peared

  however our mission was well ad-
vertised along the water front and i
suppose the time will never comt when

equipped


the frontier

hardy souls cannot be found to brave
the horn or any other danger for the
sake of sharing in buried treasure so
it came about that van tassel re-
ceived more applications than he
needed and was picking and choosing
to suit himself

  so as the men were taken on from
time to time he gathered a sturdy crew
about him-a hoarse-spoken weather-
beaten scarred and tarry lot with the
marks of many a barroom brawl upon
them but capable handy seamen

onovan in the
meantime took lit-
tle part in the re-
conditioning of the
ship for once he
was to sail as a
passenger he told
m e that captain
van tassel might possibly feci a bit
miffed under his skin and it was just
as well to stay clear of him for the
time being

  like any old skipper he said
smiling i might forget myself and
make suggestions and he wouldnt
like that it aint in human nature

  he even carried this attitude to the
point of refusing to recommend sea-
men to van tassel

  i was seated with him one fine sun-
shiny afternoon on the veranda of his
inn-the george washington where
few sea captains ever went-when
three husky tars came rolling up the
walk and paused deferentially near the
veranda rail one was a smiling
young irishman another was a huge
man with queer albino eyes and the
third a hairy compact fellow with
jowls like a gorilla and a swarthy
dished-in broad-nosed face

  could i have a word with you
capn donovan  said the latter
worthy taking a pace forward and
pulling awkwardly at his forelock

 captain donovan eyed the man
rather sternly he had been given a
thousand pounds for his share of the
spoils and lie was now rigged out like
an admiral

 and what may you want my
man said he to me in an aside
he added one of my old hands

  why sir we hears youre a-sail-
ing for treasure somewheres the man
replied were wanting to ship
dysee

  well it aint me as is a-sailin this
trip donovan replied its this gen-
tlemans uncle as is fitting out the ship
and her capns name is van tassel

now lessee-your names martin
aint it 

  ay sir i was afore the mast un-
der you on the old weymouth years
ago

  i remember said donovan well
now martin youll have to pass in-
spection afore capn van tassel on
your own account hes bein careful
about who he takes aboard he is

  but i thought sir as a word from
you-

  not a word unless he asks it
snapped donovan you go to him
if you wants and if he takes you on
your own say so well and good if
he wants a word about you why ill
give it but only in case you mind

  the man saluted and the three
rolled away

  good men all three said dono-
van then martin looks rough but
hes an honest man and there aint no
better seaman dumphe and fallons
good hands too-fallons the one
with the gold in his teeth and the
smile

  why not take them to the skip-
per then  i said

  well now donovan returned
looking at me sideways with a shrewd
smile lighting his big eloquent fea-
tures if skipper is miffed would he
be like to take them men on my direct
put-in not him they need the
duff i shouldnt wonder so im not
for spoilin their chances

  just then young jenkins came up
the walk met the three sailors and
stopped to chat with them shortly
afterward lie joined us at donovans
cheery hail i could hardly hide my
amusement when i noted jenkins
radiant smile for lie was such an ad-
mirer of donovans that he almost
ran to us like a dog to the whistle
his adoration was written all over his
smooth virile features he had come
to the point where all unconsciously
he was imitating the giants very tones
and every now and then was wont to
cry ay by the flying dutchman
in laying stress to his remarks

  so you knows them swabs eh
said donovan as they disappeared into
a sailors grog shop farther down and
on the opposite side of the street

  why yes said jenkins quickly

the key to one million pounds
the devil s caldron



that is i know theyre good seamen
and honest sailed with them before
i got my ticket they asked me just
now if i knew anything about this
treasure trip and when i told them
im mate aboard they asked for a bil-
let im going to give em a recom-
mend to the skipper this afternoon
well thats fine commented don-
ovan next day when we noted the
three men working aboard the anthony
wayne let me out of it slick too
meanwhile i spent the greater part
of my time aboard the anthony
wayne counting the days until we
were ready to go and intensely inter-
ested in everything that was going on
aboard her at last the supplies were
stowed away the vessel was ready and
we were summoned to go on board
thirty-six men all told i remember
well how i thrilled when the great
white sails were broken out and the
anchor came up and we stood on the
clean white deck to wave good-by to
the crowds on shore we were oft to
our great adventure at last

chapter vi

we sight the island

hat a journey that
was from the
very first it ap-
peared that fortune
intended to smile
on our venture for
we enjoyed the
steadiest of re-
freshing breezes throughout accom-
panied with the balmiest of weather
save when rounding the horn

  everyone was comfortable aboard
the enlarging of the after cabin made
room for the construction of six snug
staterooms three on each side leaving
the middle space clear for use as a din-
ing and lounging room there was
ample room for a broad oaken table
several comfortable chairs and a cush-
ioned settee under the stern ports in
the space aft of the lower companion-
way and there was also a lazaret
where sam my uncles body servant
was wont to display his skill at mixing
toddies and a little chart-room on the
port side forward built especially for
the skipper the whole had been
tinted in green and white and was
very cheerful in aspect and the men
forward were enjoying far greater
space than might have een allotted
them on an ordinary voyage

  though my uncle was aloard there
was but one captain he-my uncle
that is-never so much as gave an

order from the time we brought up
the anchor to the day we dropped it
again in drakes bay dirk van tas-
sel was supreme on his own quarter-
deck and he maintained discipline as
strict as that on a man-o-war woe
to the shirker who tried to take ad-
vantage of the fact that there were
double the men ordinarily employed
aboard the brass work might have
been used for mirrors by a primping
belle the decks were holystoned until
they were as clean as driven snow
there was seldom a minute when those
on watch were not kept busy

  on those who disagreed with this
program the captains hand fell heav-
ily but on the whole there were
very few incidents of this sort this
i think was due to the example of the
man fallon he appeared to be a
jewel with his black impish celtic
features his merry blue eyes and his
flashing golden smile he was very
popular with the men and he was ever
ready to spring forward to the head of
the line when a haul on a rope was
needed and forever breaking out into
a cheery rollicking chanty as for his
chum martin that worthy remained
the same gruff lowering gorilla of my
first encounter but he too was
prompt and willing and quickly proved
that he knew his work from stem to
stern

  i should think you might have rec-
ommended them i remarked one day
to donovan there are no more able
seamen aboard

  right you are donovan declared
and have you noted dumphey 

  i nodded for the mans peculiar ap-
pearance would have attracted atten-
tion anywhere he was a blond giant
with a great round moon-like face
flat and sallow he had scarcely any
brows over his slanting albino eyes
and his features in repose had some-
thing about them that suggested the
mongolian yet when you spoke to
him he was smiling on the instant
and he performed his duties with ex-
ceptional skill

  a good man i said and later i
heard captain van tassel speaking of
them to the mate

  bedder as some i bicked mine-
selluf he grunted

  in the after cabin the feeling was
excellent-with the possible exception
of that between donovan and the
skipper this never cropped above
the surface but was manifested al-
most imperceptibly if donovan spoke
to him the captain always replied very
courteously-a little too courteously if

anything he was impersonal in his
expression when looking at donovan
-so impersonal in fact that i sensed
a marked animosity which he was hold-
ing in check for the sake of pcace in
the party

  donovan did not allow this to ruffle
his good spirits in the least he had
an inimitable way of telling a story
with eloquent grimaces and a slap of
his knee at the climax which set my
uncle roaring with laughter and the
judge to chuckling till his fat stomach
shook it was something to see the
three of them sitting at the table with
the brass lamp swinging and the moon
shining oti the ships rippling wake
and my uucle holding his toddy sus-
pended when donovan approached a
side-splitting end to his yarn even
the skipper would forget to smoke on
these occasions as he sat back listen-
ing he would hold his pipe in one
hand leaning a bit forward and
watching donovan intently and then
when the laugh was at its height and
he thought no one was watching him
he would clap his pipe back in his
mouth and eye donovan through the
drifting smoke with a puzzled little
frown

  hes the best companion ive had
on a voyage my uncle exclaimed
one day even including yourself
judge and the judge chuckled add-
ing a word of praise for the man on
his own account

  of course uncle george went
on i dont know the man from a ton
of coal but i cant see but what lies
trustworthy all through and he
shook his head i sense he contin-
ued that van tassel doesnt like the
man though he never says a word
however thats to be expected i sup-
pose he rather-he he-took the
feathers out of poor old dirks cap on
his own quarter-deck and that would
stick even in my crop ill admit

  in truth i believed on my own ac-
count that the skipper was being
rather small in the matter and that his
attitude toward donovan was absurd
and even childish the giant never so
much as stepped forward of the waist
nor did lie speak to any member of
the crew that i could see save in the
presence of one of us and then only
casually in answering a question now
and again he would go on the poop
when the mate was on watch but none
of us thought anything of this at the
time for jenkins admiration for the
man was so manifest that all noted it

  a good boy said my uncle and
has been in my sendee-lets see now


the frontier

-yes three years another three
years or so and he shall have a ship
glad he likes donovan-he can learn
something from him i have no doubt
meantime the anthony wayne sailed
like a witch answering the helm like
a mettlesome horse responding to the
spur and at last after a long voyage
in which nothing untoward occurred
we were brought out on deck one clear
sunny day by the cheery cry from the
lookout aloft land ho

s we came in
closer from north-
ward and the sun-
kissed hills rose
above the horizon
we were given a
rather unfavorable
impression of the
island london tower the highest
hill with kidds mauley the next
highest were first to be sighted lon-
don tower rose clear above the trees
upon its lower slopes a great spire of
jagged naked white and yellow rock
kidds mauley seemed to have no veg-
etation whatever save in isolated
patches around the base and was an
ugly mass of corrugated granite slabs
resembling a clenchcd fist holding aloft
the broken blade of a dagger but
execution knob binnacle hill and
bowsprit bluff were surmounted with
tall stately pines and when we came
closer still and steered a course which
took us past dead mans locker and
down the eastern coast of the penin-
sula blackbeards boot we were
transported with delight

  never have i looked on a more en-
trancing terrain the broad low
gently-sloping sandy beach beyond the
white coral reefs looked like a boule-
vard paved with gold millions of
highly-colored sea-shells lay in a long
sinuous ridge at the last high-tide
mark and the smooth wet strip be-
tween this ridge and the water was
peppered with them long-legged
cranes with bright green feathers
and great red bills hopped here and
there looking at us curiously or un-
concernedly digging for clams while
at other places we saw great mons-
trous turtles waddling awkwardly
down to the sea at the inner edge of
the beach there rose a fringe of coco-
nut palms sometimes thinning out to
a single row sometimes thickening into
compact groves interstudded with
them were mango trees and short
dwarfed gnarled yellow oaks and be-
hind them on the footslopes were
thick growths of palms mahogany

ebony and other trees with thick moss
hanging from them and a profligate
growth of foliage displaying every
color in the rainbow

   i had never seen such brilliant reds
such flashing tints of green such glar-
ing patches of yellow nor such deep
shades of purple kissed by the golden
sunlight the whole shore line made a
delightful picture for men long at sea
to look upon while the high undulat-
ing ridge behind this wondrous growth
was thickly overgrown with stately
pines

  the devils caldron cried my
uncle why had those pirates none
but sinister thought on all occasions
the place might well have been called
paradise island

  old barnaby who overheard this
cackled hoarsely he had only rec-
ently emerged from the brig after
draining the alcohol from some shel-
lac

  ill tell better after im ashore
he remarked sotto voce if the saps
runnin good in them coconut trees
i knows a way to get good liquor you
cuts the shoots hangs a bucket under
and lets the sap ferment three days

chapter vii

unburied bones

he light breeze
holding we rounded
the southern end of
blackbeards boot
and stood in be-
tween it and kidds
mauley for the an-
chorage to north-
ward everywhere we found the chart
to be accurate though for that mat-
ter there was scarce need for the lead
it was like sailing on air the water
was so smooth and transparent and
though the bottom lay at over twenty-
five fathoms in many places we could
always see it as clearly as though
looking down at it through a clean
skylight

  the anchorage was even more
charming than the country on the east-
ern slopes of blackbeards boot there
were broad gently sloping strips of
sand on either side with an even more
abundant growth of beautiful palms
and foliage beyond them and all tinted
with gaudy colors the western slope
of blackbeards boot was more preci-
pitate than that on the opposite side
but save for one knoll the mainland
skirting drakes bay rose very grad-
ually to the foot of the big plateau
there were many open places in the

terrain in that part of the island
some resembled the green meadows of
the colonies while others were covered
with a thick growth of tough yellow
grass but the growth of trees pre-
dominated here as it did on the steep
slopes of the plateau

  the air was filled with the fragrant
odors from the foliage and though it
was after four oclock or eight bells
when we dropped anchor my uncle
delighted me by announcing that he
would take the cabin party ashore to
stretch a leg as he put it then as
he saw the men looking longingly
shoreward he looked appealingly at
captain van tassel

  we cant start out ship-shape for
the treasure until tomorrow morning
-or at any rate theres no need to
said uncle george so if it wont
interfere with discipline-

  ve let em go ashore to sphend the
night vot said the captain grinning
a little all say but maype two vor
a vatch

  right said my uncle let em
have three kegs of ale and a lunch

  the men were piped up at once and
they received the news with a cheer
it required no prodding to set them
bustling in preparation for the picnic

  meantime as our own gig was low-
ered away i caught a glimpse of the
mate jenkins he was looking rather
pale and worried

  whats the matter are you sick
i asked

  he seemed to start a little as i spoke
and avoided my eyes but at once he
pointed down over the rail into the
water following his pointing finger
i saw a great green shark swimming
lazily within a few feet of the sur-
face smaller fishes were scurrying
away from him but farther down
where long seaweeds with fat yellow
circular stems and bulbs like gourds
on the end were wafting about on the
bottom i saw an octopus and near
him i discerned three skeletons

  human said jenkins they give
me a kind of a turn

  the niggers i exclaimed-and
called my uncles attention to them

  now at the time i thought little of
jenkins statement since many a more
hardened man than he has been af-
fected by similar sights it was only
later that i remembered a little look
that donovan gave him my uncle tak-
ing donovans arm and beckoning me
to follow i forgot about the matter al-
most at once

  you are coming with us arent
you captain said my uncle
the devils caldron



  no sir the skipper replied i
half some vork-also i safe mineselluf
for der climb tomorrow and he
nodded at the steep sides of the distant
plateau mr jenkins he added
you vill half to shtay abort tomorrow
so you go now

  jenkins seemed to hesitate a little
before answering but remembering
himself he said very well sir and
moved to join us

e were no sooner
ashore than dono-
van gave a cry and
pointed down the
beach there lay
another skeleton
approaching it we
saw rotten bits of
rope still fastened about the wrist
bones which had been drawn behind
the back

  one of them niggers that walked
the plank said donovan washed
up by the tide and left for the birds
by the flying dutchman

  poor devil said uncle george
well well bury him anyway
forthwith we kicked sand over the
partially covered bones and went 
jenkins and donovan paired off
shortly as did the judge and my uncle
while i busied myself digging for tur-
tles eggs examining the quaint shells
and climbing mango trees for some of
the luscious fruit and so being pre-
occupied the time slipped by rapidly
and finally after pausing to pelt rocks
at a great crocodile  a rotting log i
rounded a spit not far to southward
of the rivers mouth just as it was
growing dusk there i came upon a
gruesome sight which brought me up
short

  high up in the sands and in a sort
of circular pit lay the blackened em-
bers of a great fire how recent it had
been i could not tell but there were
hundreds of blurred footprints about
with one great beaten path running in
a circle around the pit-a trough one
might say churned out by stamping
feet in a horrid dance a broken war-
club with ugly knobs lay close by
while not far from it were a long flint
spearhead and a cracked bow with
them scattered carelessly about the
place were at least four human skulls
and a litter of human bones

  my shout brought my uncle up  a
dog trot the judge following at a more
sedate pace donovan and young jen-
kins halting in the distance began to
retrace their steps while three of the
seamen nearby also moved to join us

  cannibals said my uncle at once
with a shudder of revulsion

  might be slaughter for some sort
of weird ceremony the judge com-
mented then as donovan came up
he asked what do you make of it
captain donovan

  why said the giant with a wry
grimace it looks to me as though
theres some as has stronger stomachs
than mine by the flying dutchman
cannibals my uncle repeated
looking round about him curiously
he added im fairly sure though the
island isnt inhabited

  the three seamen coming up just
then they paused with an appearance
of nausea and horror and as dono-
van replied why that swab mccal-
lum said there werent sign  life
here the men looked round about ap-
prehensively

  begging your pardon sir said
one-a man named ayotte-but wed
be in a tight hole im thinking if
there was such swabs loose around
here

  tush cried my uncle at once
seeing where the wind lay theyd
probably run from firearms like sheep
anyway we didnt see a sign of life
all the way down the east coast and
i dont believe there are any savages
here its my opinion they bring their
prisoners from some other island for
these-er-ceremonies

  of course none of the seamen openly
contradicted my uncle but as others
of the crew came trooping up it was
plain to be seen that they were strong-
ly affected then to add to the de-
pression one of them cried out ex-
citedly and pointed upward we had
all been standing with our eyes held
on the horror as though by some
devilish magnet but now looking up
we all exclaimed simultaneausly

swarm - an
army - a veritable
host of huge bats
was circling over
our heads liter-
al  y millions of
them filled the air
flying no more
than three or four feet apart and as
far as we could see to north and south
the sky was dark with them flying
slothfully down from the plateau and
the towering peaks their bodies
were as large as that of a small dog
the wingspread was that of an eagle
and as they flew just over the tree-
tops we could see their heads shaped
somewhat like that of a calf and their

rows of sharp little white teeth as they
looked down at us and bared their
gums

  its a judgment wailed harry
newell one of the young hands
aboard flinging himself prone its
come upon us for seekin money
touched with blood

  some of the others were visibly
shaken they huddled closer together
pale and nervous

  ay horn echoed newell its
the end of us and  mistake

  poof snorted the judge contempt-
uously theyre nothing but big bats
as harmless as the smaller breed if let
alone doubtless they burrow in the
cliffs up there by day and come down
at night to feed on tender shoots
along the coast

  right you are donovan boomed
out with a hearty chuckle get back
to your pins there my lad he said
to newell what kind of seamanly
behavior is that well now men
you see what it is to be cddicated but
ive seen the same thing myself in the
tropics theyre  more harm than
fleas-at least out here

  beggin your pardon sir but id
ruther have the fleas said fallon
with a lugubrious grin

  this provoked a little laugh but it
was short-lived though some of the
older hands said they had seen bats of
this size before now and the repulsive
animals settled quietly in the treetops
with  effort to attack us most of the
men were still uneasy those grin-
ning teeth suggested the larger molars
which the men believed had stripped
the human bones at their feet and
the whole took a morbid grip on their
imaginations

  think youd better order them back
aboard the judge suggested draw-
ing my uncle aside

  no said uncle george i dont
believe there are any natives living
here if i order the men aboard why
theyll only be that much more afraid
of tackling the interior and i tell you
im going to have that treasure can-
nibals or no cannibals come hell or
high water

  forthwith he told mr jenkins to
pipe up three of the men to get shovels
and bury the bones

  thatll help to quiet the supersti-
tious who believe all unburied dead
walk he said in an aside to me

  then as darkness swooped down
upon us he moved back with the men
to the fire which their comrades had
kindled thereupon he explained that
a lookout of two armed men would lie


the frontier

rowed back to kidds mauley with
orders to fire from the peak as a warn-
ing if any canoes were sighted and
pointing out that there was no reason
to believe that the island was inhab-
ited not a sign of smoke or movement
haring been seen when we approached
it he advised them to enjoy their out-
ing without fear

  ill send out muskets for two to
stand guard if you like he said
and the rest of you have pistols
this cheered the men visibly with
but five exceptions all elected to re-
main ashore and what rather amazed
me fallon martin and dumphey were
among these five-young newell and
a youth named johnston making up the
remaining two

  if its the same to you sir ill go
aboard said fallon them bats i
think it were has turned me stomach
i couldnt even drink ale with tlte
thought of them bones said dum-
phey

  here too growled martin

  their departure was greeted with
jeers by the others as might have been
expected so much more ale though
for the rest of us one shouted but
fallon the glib-tongued celt for once
had no response

  why i whispered to donovan
id never have picked those three to
be squeamish

 ah said donovan thats a
funny thing now maybe you wouldnt
leicve it but i tell you if one of them
bats lew down and touched me even
id be heaving jonah for a week

chapter viii

donovan stays aboard

everal events
occurrcd that night
which we had cause
to remember later
but which did not
-with but one ex-
ception and this
for a short time
only-appear of any great importance
at the time

  it was a little after five bells-half-
past ten-and uncle george the judge
the skipper donovan and i were sit-
ting on the poop talking over the mor-
rows trip when suddenly there was
a thunderous report ashore and the
figures round the red blaze broke off
in their singing and leaped to their
feet for a moment pandemonium
held sway some running to the boats
others discharging their pistols into
the brush and all yelling excitedly

  cannibals i gasped my heart
sinking into my boots so to speak

 my god uncle george cried
what a fool i was

  vun minute snorted captain van
tassel he strode to the rail lifted
his voice and bellowed sing oudt
you lubbers vot in hell is der mad-
der

  something in the brush sir a
voice answered coming clearly across
the still water

  just then another voice in the brush
rose above all the rest stop that

some held the snake aloft

shooting- you lubbers ive killed it
its a snake

  the captain sat down chuckling
the cries ashore changed to shouts of
laughter then as men ran into the
brush with torches from the fire the
laughter changed to cries of amaze-
ment a few minutes later one came
running down to the shore to shout
that they had killed a snake fifty feet
long

  veil roared the captain enuff is
enuff you best bring him aboard be-
fore you shooit der island full of
holes

  the gigs came alongside not long
afterward with some of the men hold-
ing the dead snake aloft for our in-
spection in the torch light it appeared
truly monstrous by actual measure-
ment it was twenty-seven feet in
length and weighed two hundred and
eight pounds when cut open it dis-
gorged a partially digested wild pig

  i were on guard sir a seaman
named nutter explained getting
tired i moved about a little and what
did i step on behind a bush but this
all coiled up snoozing away he were
and digesting this here pig-though
wot he liad in his belly i didnt stop
to think at the time not me and

lucky for me the moon was up any-
way i just up and lets him have it
through the head

   and lucky for you that type does-
nt uncoil rapidly once asleep said
the judge its a constrictor-a rock
python id say

  this exciting and unusual adven-
ture not only brought all but the sen-
tries on kidds mauley aboard but
kept us up for another two hours dis-
cussing snakes while the men finished
their ale on the focsle deck but
finally i turned in and then an hour
or so later being unable to sleep for
the maudlin singing going on forward
i got up and took a turn about in the
waist dumphey and martin were
seated on a crate beside the bulwarks
drinking from a pannikin

   ay and we might as well have had
a real bellyful of this dumphey not
hearing me growled to martin as i
approached

   but martin seeing me made a lit-
tle clucking noise with his tongue and
they were silent until i returned to the
poop

-	donovau was still there and talk-
ing to the mate as i came up the
giant rose yawned and bade us good
night a moment later we heard a
crash in the companionway and
running down we found donovau
sitting upon the cabin floor lie was
nursing his right ankle in his hand and
swearing frightfully under his breath

  stumbled on the companion he
growled its that there weak ankle
of mine flop one once and theres
alius trouble with it

   we assisted him to his feet and into
his little stateroom he winced a lit-
tle with every step but when uncle
george thrust his head out and was
told of the fall donovau waved of-
fers of further assistance aside

  tush - im not a baby lie
growled if you mr jenkins would
just get me a little liniment and a rag
ill be right as rain come morning
expressing a hope that he would
find the sprain only a minor one my
uncle and i then retired leaving jen-
kins to minister to him but when we
arose in the morning donovau hob-
bled out with his ankle heavily band-
aged and announced ruefully that we
must go treasure-hunting without him

   i rate a nurse he growled dis-
gustedly

  of course we commiserated with
him but there was nothing to do but
leave him aboard ship so we went on
with our preparations

   uncle george and the captain hold-
the devils caldron



nig a council immediately after our
early breakfast it was decided to
leave at least ten men aboard ship as
a precaution in case war canoes ap-
peared at the mouth of the bay with
two sentries to be maintained on
kidds mauley from which peak they
could look far to seaward it was
thought that we had taken ample
measures for protection even if war
canoes could paddle up the bay before
the land party returned the ten men
left aboard we were sure could hold
the ship in the interim the long nines
loaded with a double charge of round
shot and slugs would sink any canoe
ever built and with but a single shot

  johannsen the quartermaster le
blanc the cook young mcnulty
cookee byther the carpenter and
dumphey sailmaker were told off by
captain van tassel as part of the
crew to remain aboard jenkins was
then instructed to pick the others from
his own watch he named fallon and
martin for the first two and took
killifer and gunderson to make up
the list

  thatll be ten with myself sir
he said and two on kidds mauley
is twelve

i hold on said donovan with a
queer grin with me thats thir-
teen

  veil den said captain van tas-
sel with a little smile you pick vun
more mr jenkins

  young newell looking at jenkins be-
seechingly at the moment the mate
smiled and nodded at him thus we
set out with a party of twenty-two

 rowing straight ashore we left the
gigs to be returned to the ship and
proceeded straight inland this we
reasoned would save time inasmuch
as the cache lay south of west from
our anchorage and rowing up the river
would have taken us to the northwest
with a forced stop below the waterfall
and a long march to follow

e walked at a
leisurely pace for
arms had been
served out a  d
each man carried a
musket two pis-
tols a cutlas and
powder horn and
shot every member of the party was
also burdened with a small haversack
in which had been placed three days
rations-cheese raisins ships biscuit
jerked beef and salt fish-while the
men from the crew carried shovels and
picks besides

  and what a wonder trip that was
not a man seemed to mind his bur-
den though the sun rose higher and
hotter with each passing minute not
a man but found something new to ex-
claim over and marvel at with every
step great lizards scampered away
from underfoot twice we sighted
crocodiles sunning themselves at the
edge of the little swamps monkeys
chattered at us from every treetop
and great birds some with red and
some with green bills screamed at us
with raucous ear-splitting cries once
a long way off we sighted a small
deer much smaller than our own
american species while on another
occasion a drove of wild hogs with
long curved tusks charged out of a
growth of thick yellow grass and gal-
loped away into the jungle then
too we saw black beetles as long as a
mans hand and paused once to watch
a terrific battle between an army of
black ants and a fierce horde of their
red species the latter though much
the smaller seemed to be forging to-
ward victory as they fought in groups
with every appearance of organization

  the nature of the country however
amazed us more than the animals and
birds upon it for example the green
patches we had stipixxsed to be mea-
dows turned out to be bodies of limpid
water with green reeds thrusting up
above the surface the water could
not be seen through the thick growth
until one approached close up also
as uncle george led us forward with
chart and compass we were forced to
cut our way through or turn aside
from growths of heavy vines-some
as thick as a mans arm and some
when cut through spouting a thick
stream of cool clear water

  nature providing water for these
trees explained the judge it prob-
ably doesnt rain here for six months
at a stretch note how these water
vines trend upward toward the river
above the falls or the lake

  there was not a sign of any path
nor any other trace of human habita-
tion in fact as we pressed westward
the growth of vines became thicker
near the bay where the soil was
sandy we had found many open
spaces on the rising ground near the
foot of the plateau the soil was darker
and much more fertile the foliage
of the trees was so thick overhead here
that we worked under a canopy in a
cool twilight

  and now as we began to mount the
steep sides of the plateau we noted
other odd freaks of nature the great

tableland seemed to be formed for
the most part from a volcanic up-
heaval of coral rock and the black
soil lay only in patches and was not
over a foot in depth at any place yet
trees one hundred feet in height were
reared on this surface they main-
tained their precarious grip and bal-
ance by spreading out their roots flat-
wise along the surface in radial pro-
jections  nor did they pause with this
their limbs reached out to take grips
on other trees or turning downward
spread out roots of their own on the
ground to aid the mother tree and
many of the gigantic trunks had no
outshoots whatever for a full seventy-
five feet above ground many of these
bare trunks had no bark and were so
badly worm-eaten they reminded me
of the egyptian obelisks illustrated in
my schoolbooks but like all the others
their limbs shot out in all directions
from the top and were so thick with
green foliage that we could not see the
sun

  weve gained one thing anyway
my uncle said once with a laugh

  and whats that the judge
panted mopping his red face

  why when we get home and tell
what weve seen well be rated the
biggest liars in the country and
thats worth something even if we
dont find a dollar

  the ascent was difficult in many
places where we had to scramble for
footholds so we made frequent pauses
to rest our hands odonnell the
grizzled bosn spoke up at one of
these rest periods declaring that he
had come to the point where the felt
sorry for the negro slaves who had
lugged the treasure to the top

  why thats funny now old
barnaby horn commented if they
went aloft here they must a cut a
path somewheres

  grown over in a month in the
tropics said the judge

  by the time we reached the top our
shirts were stained with white salt
patches from the perspiration it was
then after six bells or eleven oclock
a stately group of pines with moss
and needles under them offered a
shady spot for the wearied hands and
we stopped for lunch

  it was an enchanting spot in which
we sprawled a cool refreshing
breeze stirred the treetops and from
where we lay we could see the surf
beating on the coral reefs at the outer
edges of morgans bay and through
gaps in the treetops the tall masts of
the anthony wayne lying far below


the frontier

us in our immediate foreground was
a rolling terrain covered with patches
of yellow grass jutting outcrops of
coral and occasional gnarled shrubs
this stretched to the trees surrounding
the rim of the devils caldron over a
mile from us while beyond it to
northward there rose the jagged
heights of london tower execution
knob rose just to the west of us less
than a half mile distant

  among other things we had been
remarking the ease with which sound
carried on the island and suddenly
we were given further proof of it
all heard the faint report of a gun
from the direction of drakes bay
followed by a second and third shot
almost immediately after

  everyone jumped to his feet

  kidds mauley cried the judge

  no said captain van tassel
raising his glass and leveling it toward
the peak in question no smoke
dere anyway see for yourselhtf
deres no canoes in sight he handed
the glass to one of the men then get
aloft in dot pine he said und see
vot you see

  the nimble sailor made the climb
in a brace of shakes

  boat cornin ashore sir he sang
out a moment later looks to be
three or four in it cant tell who
they is

  any mofement abort cried the
captain

  cant see anything unusual sir
looks like theres some standing at
the bulwarks thats all

  no canoes being reported in sight
and no further shots sounding it was
decided that some of the men might
have been sent ashore to try a shot at
a deer or wild hog the sailor aloft
said that the boat disappeared behind
a spit whereupon the captain ordered
him to come down and shortly after-
ward we took up the march for the
cache

chapter ix

bearings

t was i who first
sighted the cave
exactly as it was
marked on the
chart there it lay
in between two out-
jutting spurs in the
footslopes on the
northern side of execution knob in
the distance its black open mouth
looked like the hollow eye of a skull

  well cried my uncle excitedly

false

when we had hurried to it now for
the compass and the bald rock

  bald rock cried the judge
why look-theres four of them i
can see at least between here and the
lake

  we waited impatiently for the
needle to stop swinging when it
paused at last my uncle dropped to the
ground behind it the better to take his
bearing

  hell he exclaimed in an irri-
tated tone too much grass ahead
of me anyway it doesnt point to
any of the rocks i see

  the northeast corner of the cave
said the judge reading from the chart
youre in the right position

  one minute said uncle george
stand back men maybe theres too
much iron near the needle

  the needle did swing a point when
we moved back he declared but still
no one of the rocks was in line nor
did the compass vary when we made a
pile of haversacks to raise the instru-
ment and make more accurate sight-
ing possible

  the nearest bald rock is five points
off uncle george declared perplex-
edly

  veil the skipper suggested quietly
maype his gompass vas off a leedle-
cherry plunts i mean

  thats possible too uncle george
responded hopefully well now
well try that rock

  forthwith a seaman was sent out to
act as marker and uncle george took
bearing to place him on a line running
due northwest from the northeastern
corner of the cavern captain van
tassel and the judge meantime pro-
ceeded to the bald rock with another
compass

  the rock lay about four hundred
yards from the cave to westward
and running from north to south was
a ridge of coral rock bare of vegeta-
tion this appeared to be equi-distant
from the cave and the rock and it was
at least seventy-five yards wide

  uncle george looked at it dubi-
ously watching the man move back
on the line in answer to the skippers
calls his face fell

  why he exclaimed its going to
bring him smack on that ridge

  and so it proved sight as they
would the intersection of the lines
placed the marker on the ridge and
far back from its eastern edge nor
were the results any better with the
next nearest rock-which was fully
ten points off the magnetic north line
mentioned on the chart

  gloomily we trooped over the ridge
no one seemed to want to speak the
thoughts in his mind one swung a
pick and struck the surface of the
rough ridge-a surface which seemed
to be made up of white granules glued
together by some cement unknown to
man one might as well have picked
at a granite slab

  presently my uncle coughed and
cleared his throat his shoulders went
back and he cast a fiery glance in the
direction of the ship

  well men he said ive been
had no fool would bury treasure
there even with nigger labor-it
would have taken weeks with picks
and lord knows how much drilling
and powder besides theres not a
sign of a loose rock here to show a
filled-in hole

  i said the lower part of that paper
had been cut away said the judge
nodding at the chart

  easy enough to say i told you
so  uncle george growled theres
treasure here though i believe and
that man donovan knows where it is
here he looked quizzically at the skip-
per with a half angry half apologetic
light in his eyes come on now
have your say captain did you sus-
pect something like this

  veil said the skipper slowly eye-
ing the pipe which he was filling if
you ask me do i exspecgt somedings
wrong jess somehow i feel it
only i haf no broof und so be-
sites if i say somedings eferyone
tinks im sore

  very true uncle george admit-
ted well sir youre captain what
now 

  back said the skipper nodding
toward drakes bay den ve see
we made the trip back to the bot-
tom of the plateau in far less time than
we had consumed mounting it and
at the base we met the quartermaster
johannsen with the seamen killifer
and gunderson they had had little
trouble in following our broad trail

he quartermasters
broad leathery fea-
tures were aflame
with indignation
a viking in size
he raised a tat-
tooed forearm as
thick as the limb
of an oak and shook his great fist in
the direction of the anthony wayne

  all i ask he bellowed for a be-
ginning is one swipe at them swabs
so help me davy jones
the devils caldron



  come said the skipper vot iss
it yet

  why roared the quartermaster
they took the ship donovan i
mean and that jenkins and the
others

  the story was soon told the mate
had placed johannsen in charge of
filling the ships water casks from the
river-a clear sparkling stream above
the mouth-and he with killifer
gunderson and young newell had
been rowing back and forth in one of
the gigs throughout the greater part
of the morning

  on our last trip johannsen con-
tinued just as they slung up the last
keg why this donovan whips out a
pistol leans down over the bulwarks
and shoots young newell through the
head just to show you we mean
business-thats what he says at
the same time theres jenkins fallon
dumphey and martin a-leanin over
with pistols too one move says
donovan cool as ice and your goose
is cooked what could we do but sit
there like so many fish well just
then the cookee mcnulty he slings
a knife but fallon gives him both bar-
rels thats two dead says donovan
never battin an eye either and the
cook dymind came runnin on deck
but when they sees the lay of the land
they stops dead and then donovan
tells us wots wot

  veil prompted the skipper his
facc grim and pale

  why said johannsen heres
what he says come aboard he says
and join us as has the food the ship
and knows where the treasure is or
else he says you can go ashore and
give my compliments he says to that
there square-head your capling and
tell him whats what and thats this
he says all hands what want to join
capn donovan is free to do so and
share food and treasure them that
wont can eat coconuts as for the

treasure ill talk to your capting soon
as he shows a flag o truce 

  then explained johannsen they
had been allowed to row ashore with
the warning that they would be given
but one minute to get out of gunshot
after they had beached fallon and
martin came with them keeping them
covered with pistols and returned to
the ship later with the gig

  i put you in der log for tree honest
men cried van tassel with un-
wonted warmth

  and i wont forget it if we get out
of this uncle george declared shak-
ing each man by the hand now by
the lord harry lets see what he has
to propose

fudging onward
again toward
drakes bay with
the men growling
behind us we re-
viewed the situa-
tion it was now
plain that donovan
had withheld the chart from me in the
first place to obtain an opportunity to
insert his own markings after cutting
off the original notations by jerry
blunt at the outset we reasoned he
may merely have intended to safeguard
his own interests in bargaining for a
ship but later having sounded out
the impressionable jenkins thoroughly
he had worked out a bolder scheme
we knew now that the mate had suc-
ceeded in getting at least three accom-
plices aboard-fallon dumphey and
martin-and had but to wait for a
favorable opportunity to seize the ship

  why they would probably have
taken her last night while wc slept if
the men hadnt come aboard said
the judge

  uncle george spat vindictively

  doubtless he acknowledged oh
im not so surprised now at donovan
when i think it all over he contin-

ued though ill admit he took me
in all over but that mate-that jen-
kins- he choked and sputtered
to think i planned to give him a
ship

  glancing at the captain just then i
saw tears rolling down his cheeks

  dot poy he muttered wiping the
tears away hastily with a shamefaced
air i-vy i treat him like a son

  coming out on the sandy beach at
last we saw that the anthony wayne
now lay broadside on to the shore
she had been anchored forward as
well as aft and her starboard guns
were uncovered with her graceful
lines and her white hull with its streak
of red and all reflected in the clear
water beneath her she was a picture
to thrill the heart of any sailor but
now instead of our own colors an
improvised jolly roger was floating
from her peak

  a drunken chanty came to us across
the waters and as we drew nearer fal-
lon leaned over the bulwarks and
tossed a bottle into the bay

  howd you like a mouthful o that
honest men he shouted derisively

  no one answered him but cap-
tain van tassel after a word or two
with my uncle fastened a handker-
chief on a cutlas and waved it

  the signal was answered promptly
by donovan who had been sitting with
jenkins under an awning  the poop
moving like a trained athlete-for of
course he had not injured his ankle in
the least-he ran down the gangplank
followed by fallon and bitlier and
put off in a gig

  veil said the skipper when the
buccaneers had come within a few
yards of shore vot do you brobose 

  donovan the scoundrel eyed us
with an insolent smile he had
wrapped a gaudy polka-dotted scarf
around his head a yellow sash with
two silver-mounted pistols thrust in
it girdled his waist and if ever there

donovan the scoundrel eyed us with an insolent smile


the frontier

lived a man better suited for his role
i have yet to encounter him the
giant was in his element he appeared
as happy as an actor who has taken
the center of the stage he seemed
fairly to glow as with a light from
some powerful inner lamp

  propose he cried well now
johannsen told you i suppose

  he dit the skipper grunted

  then ill repeat it just to be sure
all hands got the word said dono-
van all them as is in the crew is
free for to jine with capn gentry-
which is me and not donovan as ive
been callcd free to jine and share
by the flying dutchman i knows
where the treasure is as for the
cabin party you can all come aboard
unarmed you can and ill put you
ashore on the coast of brazil if you
dont-why you can live like robin-
son crusoe

  und subbose no more of der hants
vill choine

 why donovan-or gentry-re-
turned easily we aint in no terrible
hurry we aint well leavem to
think it over we aint for killin
moren we have to you saw how we
let them three go free point is we
need more hands meantime us as
has the ship the supplies and plenty
water and liquor aboard-why well
stand by a while

  und how long

  not too long by the flying dutch-
man said gentry if no one wants
to jine why of course we couldnt get
the treasure aboard come such a
case im off to the new colony in bot-
any bay ill get hands and you may
lay to it when we comes back and
the cannibals aint got you then you
look out not a manll get quarter
captain van tassel removed his
pipe from his mouth and held it grip-
ped in his right fist

  veil now he said shpeaking for
der cabin party you can go to hell
me too roared johannsen

  and me cried killifer

  several others growled low in their
throats and crowded nearer to the
skipper some of the rest moved
more slowly but at the time no one of
them declared his intention of accept-
ing gentrys offer

  ah well said gentry well see
what well sec them as changes their
mind can work round to the other side
of this here bay and ill send a boat
ashore theres a ford further up the
river youll find then waving his
hand at us he ordered his men to pull
back to the ship

chapter x

gentrys strength grows

y	remaining
doubts about the
seriousness of our
position were now
swept away we
had no boats re-
taking the ship
therefore seemed
to be an impossibility even a strongly
barricaded raft was out of the ques-
tion we had brought only two axes
ashore with us and could not have
constructed anything suitable even
though we spent a week at it for the
guns would have swept our deck clean
before we had fairly left the shore

  meantime there was the problem of
defence as well as that of existence to
solve-with one meal gone from our
three-days supply of accustomed diet
and the prospect of subsisting there-
after on coconuts mangoes wild hog
and deer too we had a doubtful
crew one glance at the unsmiling
features about us assured me that
many of them would ultimately prefer
the far-off risk of swinging from a
gibbet to sharing our dubious lot

  we held a brief council while the
men moved apart and muttered in
guarded talk

  ids der loss of tobacco and der
tought of dem cannibals more as any-
thing we haf to fear about der men
said the skipper

  thereupon he declared that we must
at once find a position where water
was obtainable and which would com-
bine some degree of comfort as well
as the means of defense pointing
southward he announced that he had
noted a cave when entering the bay
which might suit our purpose admir-
ably

  i saw a prook running down
trough mine glasses he said

  forthwith he gave orders to move
and within a half hour we had reached
it

  it needed but a glance to assure us
that we could have found no better
place for our immediate needs the
cavern was located in the face of a
bluff or promontory about one hun-
dred feet above the level of the bay
and midway between the river mouth
and the footslopes of kidds mauley
from its mouth one could obtain a
fair view of the bay to northward as
well as the entrance through which
canoes might come the approach to
it was steep and clear of trees for a
hundred yards or more and the in-

terior was large enough to house a
regiment in comfort with a clean
sandy floor a bubbling spring with a
brook running from it and better still
a natural opening nearby in the roof
to allow for the passage of smoke

  once within the skipper took im-
mediate steps for the prevention of
men deserting with their arms the
muskets pistols and powder horns as
well as the cutlases were placed in
charge of johannsen who arranged
them in neat rows the men were
given to understand that arms would
be issued only to hunters or in case of
attack the rations were also pooled
and turned over to our three negro
servants who were to act as cooks
while my uncle and the judge were
immediately despatched to try their
luck in bagging a wild hog or deer
another detail meantime was sent out
to cut firewood and fell logs for a bar-
ricade while the rest were sent out to
make what progress they could before
sundown in gathering mangoes and
coconuts and digging clams

  but even this activity did not serve
to keep many of the men from brood-
ing when right fell four of them
failed to return the acquisition of
gunderson johannsen and killifer
had raised our numbers to twenty-five
leaving seven on board ship and two
on kidds mauley now we were
twenty-one to the buccaneers thirteen
when a man was sent to hail the sen-
tries on kidds mauley he was greeted
with a musket shot whereupon he
promptly deserted us raising the pi-
rates crew to fourteen and reducing
ours to twenty nor were the minor
events of the evening designed to make
our men happier

  we had brought but one large coffee
pot ashore with two frying pans and
the pot proved to be leaky uncle
george and the judge also returned
without any game they had not
sighted a deer while the wild hogs
scampered so swiftly they said that
it was useless to fire they declared
that these hogs like our domestic
porkers loved mud and sought dense
patches of grass which shielded the
oozy bottom from the sun they fur-
ther pointed out that it would be quite
possible to bag them by stationing the
hunters at one end of a glade with
perhaps two others to charge in and
rout the hogs out at a given signal
but this optimistic conjecture failed to
arouse any enthusiasm the men were
in the dumps they muttered and
frowned and were surly in their an-
swers and shortly after supper when
the devils caldron



the men were split up into little groups
outside the cavern talking matters
over two more slipped away into the
darkness

  eighteen said my uncle when in-
formed of this that gives them
fifteen well captain i dont sup-
pose it will do to make the doubtful
ones prisoners

  no how could ve tell vich is vich
-safe maype johannsen und killifer
even gunderson look like a tunder-
cloud if ve make de rest prissoners
veil dots so many more enemies und
some might be frients und shtay oder-
wise

  this seemed reasonable for none
could be expected to look cheerful
under the conditions and it was im-
possible to foretell the ultimate actions
of each individual hence uncle
george had all hands piped up before
him and made them a brief speech

  ill admit our chances look bad
he said we can live i am sure
but when a ship will put in here i cant
say if worse comes to worse we
may be here a year or- he
shrugged our best chance he went
on is to waylay them and cut them
off when they come ashore for that
treasure they will come in time i
am sure i think gentrys talk of go-
ing to botany bay was sheer bluff
and ill say this now were in this
hole all those who stay with us will
receive treble the shares promised
them providing we recover the ship
and treasure

  ah but thats like promising the
moon horn spoke up

  granted returned my uncle its
for you to decide

  of the whole crew only one had the
courage and manhood to state his in-
tentions openly this was gunder-
son he rose frowning and said that
for his part he intended to join gen-
try

  it aint like mutiny he cried
hoarsely i wouldnt go agin my
dooty not me not with half a chance
to live but this is different this is
spoken like a man cried my
uncle ill not try to hold you you
have one minute to get out of gun-
shot then as gunderson wheeled
and hurried out of the cavern uncle
george looked round about eyeing one
man after another any more he
cried lets clear the air here de-
cide now once and for all

  not a man answered not a man
stirred

  then i take it youre all to stay
said uncle george come now

thats not so bad seventeen to their
seventeen if we hang out long
enough theyre bound to try for that
treasure-and then is our chance if
youve a mind to well do them yet
this seemed to buoy up the men for
the time being and on top of this
judge pemberton revealed a side of
his nature which i for one had never
suspected talking to the cabin party
presumably as we lay on the sand at
on side of the fire his slow drawling
tones had soon caught the attention of
all the man must have been aching
in every joint the climb to the plateau
had all but finished him i thought
yet here he was recounting droll negro
stories as though safe at home in his
library till the cavern rang with shouts
of laughter

  it was a revelation i have never for-
gotten for i saw clearly then the vast
difference there is between true brav-
ery and courage born of brute strength
and good physical condition it is
even greater than the difference be-
tween steel and iron it was only
later when i was standing a turn on
guard and most of the crew were
snoring heavily that i heard him sup-
press a groan as he tried to adjust his
soft strained muscles to his hard bed

  no desertions occurring during the
night and the men expressing nervous-
ness over snakes and other animals
that might be prowling about captain
van tassel decided to issue pistols
and cutlases once more to all hands
the powder horns muskets and shot
however were retained under guard
each man having only the two rounds
in his pistol

ll during the
morning the men
seemed more cheer-
ful than they had
when first brood-
ing over their situ-
ation clay was
found to patch the
coffee pot a big haul of clams was
made on the nearby beach uncle
george shot a wild hog and another
man killed a big turtle meantime the
work on the barricade went on stead-
ily so that with logs and earth we had
erected a bullet-proof wall across the
mouth of the cavern before noon ob-
servation there were no loop-holes
but it was breast high and afforded
ample protection for all but the head
and shoulders when aiming

  but we were still handicapped for
means with which to cook our food
properly and our first attempts at

moulding clay utensils proving fail-
ures yens eriskson the bosns mate
disappeared that afternoon he was
seen running along the beach toward
the rivers mouth by johannsen who
fired a shot at him but missed this
reduced our party to sixteen then
at supper time another accident oc-
curred which had its effect in causing
further gloom anthony buzzel the
coxswain having professed a knowl-
edge of baking clay fashioned a huge
pot and glazed it over the fire when
it had cooled it appeared quite hard
and buzzel stood back surveying it
with a proud smirk thereupon the
negro cooks set out to make a sort of
potage with water wild hog meat and
ships biscuit but when the mess was
bubbling merrily the pot suddenly dis-
integrated and all was lost the re-
maining pieces of the hog were
scorched in the hurried efforts of the
cooks to broil them spitted on long
sticks and after gnawing at them
buzzel and barnaby horn seized the
first opportunity immediately after
dark to slip away

  fourteen and they are now
twenty said my uncle frowning i
this keeps up gentryll have enough
by tomorrow night to wipe us out any
time he sees fit

  we had posted a sentry with a glass
above the cavern to watch the ship
and this man had reported gigs going
ashore now and again during the day
but with only a few men aboard an-
other had gone down the bay toward
kidds mauley and returned doubt-
less carrying a relief for the lookouts
there and now we saw the glow of
a great fire on the beach directly in-
shore from the ship

  spending a night ashore perhaps
said my uncle but wed best be sure
what it means eh captain

  captain van tassel nodding i vol-
unteered to do a bit of scouting kill-
ifer also spoke up and armed with
muskets and pistols we set out

  the moon had not yet appeared so
we had little difficulty in working our
way through the palms without de-
tection to a point within earshot of
the buccaneers

  for quite a period we could hear
nothing of any consequence as there
were a round dozen in the circle
around the fire and all shouting or
singing at once in a merry bedlam a
keg of brandy had been broached and
pannikins were being passed from
hand to hand gentry sat to one side
on a log with jenkins beside him

  all were heavily armed discovery


the frontier

meant almost certain death for us yet
there were several points which almost
made me laugh aloud every man
there including the recent deserter
erickson aped his new commander
their heads were wrapped with col-
ored scarfs bright sashes adorned
their waists and they wore their head-
dress cock-a-pie over one eye as
gentry did and even attempted to im-
itate him in the way he had of turning
his remarkably shrewd eyes aside
without turning his head when they
arose and moved about they swag-
gered like a bucko mate ashore at a
longshoremens picnic when they
spoke they used tones at least an
octave below those i had heard when
they were honest hands aboardship
they used the most dreadful oaths
each seeming to vie with the others in
coining new expletives but whenever
gentry spoke or reached out with his
pannikin it was laughable to see them
fall silent instantly or stumble over
one another in an effort to serve him
first

  ah he would say sitting there
with his air of superb assurance
thankee for that bill heres
luck or having downed a potion
he would cry well now you tell me
this does this sort of life beat being
hazed afore the mast with a few dol-
lars when port is reached-or doesnt
it whereupon they would howl
and pound one another on the back in
glee

  heres the way it is with me he
said once im capn and him as for-
gets it will know about it by the fly-
ing dutchman but you see how i
am i aint so high and mighty i cant
take a drink with them as is brave
enough to sail under the jolly roger
dooty must le done to be sure ships
cant be sailed nohow without it but
once theres no dooty to worry about
we live ah but you made no mistake
in jining capn gentry once we has
the treasure aboard why well be roll-
ing in money-rolling in it i tell you
like drunken lords

  ah capn cried one and when
do we go after it 

  why a day or too more at this
rate and well have enough to laugh
at em gentry replied

  but where is the treasure capn 
erickson asked

  where is it gentry returned in
his easy deep tones well now
men ill tell you it aint far from the
waterfall that much ill tell you
best to play safe whenever possible-
so i wont tell you exactly where till

scatter and find them men

we gets there but in the meantime
mind-in the meantime-if anything
should happen to me its sewed up
here in my shirt the directions i
mean

  fair enough said erickson and
the buccaneers chorused an agreement

  as gentry turned once more to
young jenkins and the men fell to
singing killifer suggested going we
had at least learned one point the ap-
proximate location of the treasure
but i insisted on remaining in the
hopes of learning more about their
plans

  it was well that we did a half
hour passed i was beginning to itch
all over and aching to ease myself
when suddenly a shot sounded from
the direction of the cavern followed
by three more in rapid succession

  the buccaneers were on their feet
on the instant

  that wouldnt be allen and
thompson on kidds mauley would
it cried jenkins

  dont think so said gentry its
nearer no its near that cave
and suddenly he grinned now
what would you say if it was more
mates a-breakin away for to jine us

  his guess proved correct within
a half hour we heard voices on the
beach and the buccaneers who had
resumed their places about the fire
leaped up once more muskets in hand

  who goes roared gentry

  five more to ship with capn
gentry sir came the voice of a sea-
man named latham from the dark-
ness

  come up then one at a time
said gentry

  the five were shortly standing be-
fore him three white sailors and two
of the negro servants

  well said gentry what hap-
pened ah nero to one of the ne-
groes i see youre wounded in the
arm here there erickson you take
four hands and go aboard ship for that
medical kit cant let a new messmate
suffer

  its like this sir said latham
when erickson and his crew departed
that damned hazer of a dutchman
sends out the five of us under the
bosn odonnell to cut more firewood
so i put it up to him odonnell i
mean to go well he wouldnt be
said and with that larry here hit him
a clip with the butt of his pistol he
went down and we started but he
got two shots at us one getting nero
we fired back but dont know whether
we hit him or not

  anyway you are here said
gentry ha he paused to reckon
why that makes us twenty-five now
and them-lets see-only nine left
men well start for the treasure first
thing tomorrow morning get round
now and welcome your new mess-
mates

  the men came crowding round
they pounded the new buccaneers lust-
ily on the back thrusting pannikins at
them besides and lathan was just
about to down his drink after salut-
ing gentry when he paused suddenly
and held up his left hand

  i almost forgot he cried that
young bellew and killifer are here
somewhere spying on you

  what roared gentry scatter
and find em men lively all hands
but before one could move killifer
thrust his musket forward and fired
the shot struck latham in the fore-
head and he pitched backward into the
fire my own musket thundered a
second later but though i had aimed
at gentry he seemed to leap aside as
if warned by instinct and someone
behind him cried out in pain then
killifer and i were off running for
our lives

chapter xi

ambuscade

he pursuit was in
full cry on the in-
stant musket balls
whipped through
the thickets about
us pistols cracked
behind us and as
we burst out of the
brush and made for the beach where
there was no danger of being tripped
by vines the buccaneers came thunder-
the devils caldron



ing after us like so many enraged
wolves in sight of quarry

  twice i paused to wheel and fire
my double-barreled pistols killifer
also fired but for all we could tell in
the darkness our shots did not take ef-
fect on the contrary the flashes of
our pistols seemed only to serve in lo-
cating us more nearly so that the an-
swering shots whistled perilously close
twice i was showered with sand from
hits close to my heels

  we had of course the advantage of
a fair start yet we had run but a
short distance southward along the
hard-packed sand below the high-tide
mark when i heard one runner pound-
ing along behind me and gaining with
every step he had an obstruction in
one nostril which caused a shrill
whistling sound whenever he breathed
rapidly and i knew him for the man
martin

  all in vain were my efforts to leave
him behind he came up on me like
an antelope overhauling me so to
speak hand over hand i had not a
shot left at any minute i expected a
pistol ball in the back but he also
had discharged his pistols it appeared
for as he came up close behind me he
aimed a cut at me with his heavy cut-
las

  he panted as he struck and the
blade sung as it sliced through the
air i lunged forward barely in time
the point nicked my right shoulder
and slashed a rent in the back of my
shirt

  the cut must have thrown him off
his stride an instant for he lost a bit
of ground but he soon regained it
and again he cut at me with all his
strength the blade fairly whistling in
its vicious downward whip i avoided
it only by a desperate leap aside and
the point seemed to miss my neck by
a bare inch

  killifer meantime was a good ten
feet in the lead it was useless to
call on him for assistance we could
not stop to engage the man for long
for his comrades were not far behind
so realizing that another cut might
reach the mark i gained several steps
by a terrific burst of speed this lit-
tle gain enabled me to grasp the muzzle
of my musket in both hands then
as martin closed in once more with
his cutlas raised aloft i wheeled and
swung the gun with all my strength

  stock and cutlas met with a ringing
crash the hanger was knocked from
his hand and went sailing toward the
treetops and as his impetus carried

him forward i raised my right foot
and planted it savagely full in the
stomach he staggered backward
bent over and gasped in agony i
gave him no chance to recover whip-
ping the musket aloft i brought every
thew into play as i brought it down
the stock beat down his upflung arms
caught him fair with a sickening
crunch on the side of the head and
broke off short martin struck the
sands with a plop like that of a heavy-
laden sack

  a hoarse yell not twenty feet away
followed by another pistol shot now
lent me wings and i flew along the
sands once more after killifer throw-
ing aside the useless barrel as i went
none of the remaining buccaneers
overtook us after a half dozen more
futile shots they gave over the pur-
suit and at last panting and sobbing
for breath we reached the cavern in
safety

  god cried uncle george throw-
ing his arms around me god  he
seemed unable to find any other word
to express his thankfulness for my
escape and nearly choked me in his
embrace

  once we had regained our breath
our story was soon told thereupon
the captain ordered immediate steps
taken for defence against a possible
attack angered by the death of mar-
tin and latham and excited with
brandy it seemed altogether likely
that they would be upon us as soon as
the moon had risen so all muskets
were loaded cutlases and pistols laid
ready to hand and six of us posted at
the barricade odonnell who had
suffered a deep gash on the head and
the negro sam were told off to aid
the skipper in reloading

  how anxiously we peered into the
darkness you may well imagine the
two deaths had left gentry with
twenty-three men he was more than
likely to use eighteen or twenty in the
attack and we were now nine in num-
ber the list included johannsen
killifer the judge my uncle the skip-
per the negro slave odonnell a sea-
man named suggs and me

  vun ting said the captain ve

can now count on all here iff dey

gome aim goot und i know ve lick

f - tf

em

  to prevent being silhouetted against
the firelight the skipper had reduced
the embers to a few coals but when
the moon came up and bathed the slope
before us in a sheen of beautiful sil-
ver we saw no sign of movement

nor were we disturbed during the next
two weary hours

  i guess id iss he figgers to get der
dreasure abort first said the captain
then forthwith the fire was rekind-
led and we were divided into two
watches-johannsen killifer sam
and i in the one and the judge uncle
george suggs and odonnell in the
other my uncles watch was left 
guard with one sentry posted and we
lay down to sleep

  about four in the morning the cap-
tain roused all hands

  surbrise iss der ting he declared
and outlined briefly a daring plan
the mutineers he reasoned would do
one of two things-attack us or go
for the treasure in either case he
proposed to get in the first telling
blow to do this he now ordered us
to take two muskets and two pistols
apiece and follow him

  we were soon trooping after him
munching a breakfast of raisins and
chcese as we marched

  the sky overhead was still dark as
pitch but in the western fringe of that
black bowd hung the morning moon of
the tropics a great round yellow disk
resembling a lighted port-hole in a
solid wall of ebony it gave light
enough for us to pick our way rapidly
through the palms above the tide
mark and within a half hour we had
found a position in the thickets over-
looking the anchorage and the rivers
mouth we did not sight a single pi-
rate on the wray for only the smoul-
dering embers of their fire remained
and apparently all had gone aboard
ship

  not a man shall fire till i gifs der
vord said the captain if dey pulls
in for der shore dot means dey vill
attack if dey pulls py der river dot
means treasure vateffer der case ve
haf plendy time to fire und get back
py der cavern

e had not long to
wait soon the first
flaming rays of the
sun shot up like a
great forest blaze
high into the west-
ern sky behind us
soon the mists of
the bay were rising and floating over
the ridge on blackbeards boot and
soon the beautiful white ship was re-
vealed on the smooth clear water a
whistle blew aboard her men were
seen moving about her deck and be-
fore another half hour had passed by


the frontier

we could see them trooping toward
the gangplank

  see der shoffels  said the captain
dot means dreasure

 we made out fifteen men going
aboard two gigs with them were
gentry and his mate all were heav-
ily armed and they stored a heavy
load of shovels picks axes and ropes
with other supplies aboard the gigs
before shoving off

  oh tunder the captain muttered
then chentrys boat pulls avay first
steady now men dey vill be sep-
arated-ve fire on dot poat only no
misses now mr pellew and i vill
take chentry johannsen fallon sam
und der chudge erickson odon-
nell und suggs dumphey killifer
und jack take dot man buzzle dots
for der first shot der next-vots
left

  all of us i think were fairly
steady at least all nodded to signify
that they understood only the roll-
ing whites of sams eyes revealed the
owners excitement each man was
well concealed with an opening in the
ground palms and vines before him
ready for the insertion of his musket
and beside him lay the second piece
ready primed and loaded

  pulling steadily gentrys boat was
two-thirds of the way toward the
rivers mouth before jenkins followed
him with the other gig eight men
were with gentry five with jenkins

  a few more strokes and they were
within fifty yards of us it seemed to
me that i could hear my own heart
beating as i waited for the word and
i can never forget the picture made by
that motley crew-gentry in the stern
puffing tranquilly at a pipe and the
others with their sleeves rolled high
swaying back and forth on the oars to
fallons steady chant i particularly
remember the red silk handkerchief in
the breast pocket of buzzels gray
shirt revealed each time as he pulled
back on his oar

  dake aim said the captain then

  i for one aimed as steadily as i
could fair at buzzels shoulder

  fire cried the skipper

  the muskets roared in a volley that
smote the air like a clap of thunder

  erickson pitched forward fallon
flopped head down over the side of
the gig the man beside dumphey
sprang up with a scream and fell into
the water where he sank in a foam of
blood buzzell yelled in agony grasp-
ing his hairy forearm while gentry
whirling on his seat showed a cheek
flooding blood

  all this i saw as i picked up the
other musket and leaped up for a
second shot this time i aimed at
gentry but as quick as winking he
had scooped up the dead man fallon
holding him with his left arm before
his breast my bullet struck fallon
in the back as for the others shots
at least three took effect buzzel being
killed outright and two others being
wounded dumphey saved himself by
following gentrys example

  back to der cavern my lats
shouted the captain for the men
aboard ship cursing like madmen
were uncovering a long nine

  there was an uproar in the second
gig as we ran they gave over rowing
and fired a few ragged shots at us
but their aim was hurried and none of
us was hit

  steady now men the skipper
panted when we had run some dis-
tance slow down to a valk see
der odders row to chentrys poat

  we were glad enough of the respite
for all were puffing heavily and as
we walked on at a good pace to be
sure we gleefully checked up obser-
vations most of us were agreed-
and this turned out to be correct-
that dumphey was the only man to
escape injury we were sure that at
least four were dead and that four
more including gentry had been
more or less seriously wounded we
reasoned that seven at least were no
longer to be counted as fit combatants
and this reduced their numbers to six-
teen effectives

  we were counting them over and
more than elated over the success of
the skippers move when suddenly a
long nine roared on board ship at
the same time the trees and leaves
about us were spattered with a shower
of leaden slugs it might never have
happened again indeed it was an ap-
parently silly shot fired in our general
direction in a fit of rage but xor
sam the negro slave was struck fair
in the middle of the back he fell to
the ground and expired without a
sound

  ah by the gods id sooner it had
been me cried my uncle in a broken
voice

  veil said the skipper ids too
padt but some losses haf to be ve
must hurry along und brebare for
boarters

  my uncle slung his musket behind
him and picked up his dead servant
and then quite sobered by this loss
we went on toward the cave

chapter xii

the mutineers attack

iving poor sam a
hasty burial on the
sandy slope near
the cave we re-
entered our fort-
ress and after
drinking deep of
the cool refreshing
spring water reloaded all muskets in
preparation for an attack

  hundred to vun he gomes now
said the skipper anyvay ve iss
ready und if he makes it oudt to dry
for der dreasure anyhow ve go oudt
und maype surbrise him some more

  he then gave orders for all of us to
lie down and snatch what rest we
could while he kept watch at the bar-
ricade

  what with the chuckling bubble of
the spring and the reaction from the
mornings excitement i was soon fast
asleep nor did i arouse until at about
eight bells a thunderous report
brought me to my feet the echoes
were still rolling back and forth be-
tween the hills and the birds were
screaming raucously when i rushed
to join the others at the barricade

  all was clear at a glance the steep
fan-shaped clearing on the approach
to our cave ran down almost to shore
and only a thin fringe of palm trees
just above high-tide mark intervened
between us and drakes bay when
looking direct to eastward these
were so widely separated that the view
was unobstructed for all practical
purposes and there anchored broad-
side on to shore lay the anthony
wayne gentry had brought her
down to a position opposite the cave
the approach from the shore was lit-
tle over one hundred yards long and
as she was anchored at a similar dis-
tance from the beach her starboard
guns were now trained on us at a
range of some two hundred yards

  back roared the skipper dot
vun vas short but der next one may-

  it was well we dodged back behind
the thick rock walls at either side of
the opening for the next shot came
shrieking through the mouth of the
cave barely clearing the barricade and
smashed against the rocks in the rear
then a musket ball spatted viciously
into the logs close by the skippers
head

plaze avay grunted the skipper
a miss is chust so goot as a mile
the devil s caldron



  let me relieve you there cried
my uncle its only fair we should
all take a turn at watching

  not till i say de vord sir said
the skipper with simple dignity i
am captain i keep de vatch

  more musket shots struck the bar-
ricade or whistled through the open-
ing and johannsen explained the sit-
uation to me the buccaneers had
landed a party somewhere to north-
ward of the open space and these men
were now firing from the woods flush-
ing the northern side of the slope

  they cant get atop this here hill
and come down on us sudden he said
account of that there bluff face
raises fifty feet or more right above
the mouth what they hopes to do is
bash in that there barricade then i
take it theyll board

  the captain who was evidently
watching the match flare dodged aside
and another report sounded aboard
ship while a great shower of dirt was
thrown up over the barricade

  a leedle closer the skipper com-
mented veil now he gets a hit
pretty soon dots sure den ve see if
der barricade holds

  according to his estimate there
were not over a dozen buccaneers in
the land party as he had counted but
four men firing the gun  board

dey tink ve still half nine he
said und dey vont gome up der slope
unless dey knock ofer der prestvorks
ah croaked the seaman suggs
if she holds

  the man was plainly fearful of
those screaming projectiles and i
must confess that i too was keyed to
a high pitch by now nor was i
suggs only companion in this not a
man was smiling even uncle george
was gripping the stock of his musket
till liis knuckles gleamed white
odonnell was spitting nervously and
muttering under his breath

  ill stake my reputation she holds
declared the judge at this juncture
thereupon he launched into a dis-
course on ballistics angles of fire foot-
poundage-at-impact errors in depth
and dispersion airing a knowledge of
artillery fire which he had gained while
serving as an officer during the revo-
lution he had given many helpful
suggestions while we were building the
barricade so that we had thrown up
four layers of logs with a cushion of
dirt between each layer or wall and
another thick cushion of earth against
the outer side he contended that the
chances for direct hits were hardly

one in five since the ship would rock
a little with the recoil and there was
also an angle of elevation to take into
account and he declared that the shots
would penetrate the stiff brittle sides
of a ship more easily than this cush-
ioned breastwork

  now he was saying we must
remember that an unsettled gun-

  but just here the long nine roared
again and the roundshot with a ter-
rifying screech landed with a terrific
crush fair in the center of the barri-
cade 

  for one horrible instant i thought
that at least half my friends had been

the round shot landed lair

killed all the front of the cavern
was choked with a cloud of dust
cries and confusion reigned within
and simultaneously the buccaneers be-
low us yelled in triumph and a half
dozen musketballs came singing
through the opening then to add to
our temporary panic the three remain-
ing guns on the starboard side were
touched off one after the other one
shot struck the bluff overhead bring-
ing down a shower of rock the second
threw up a cloud of sand from the
slope into our very faces and the
third struck a top log and ricochetted
against the roof thence down again
into the brook where it sizzled and
steamed like an angry devil

  on top of all this there came a sud-
den command from the skipper he
had been fanning the dust away with
his hat and peering sharply over one
end of the breastwork now he ordered
all of us into position

  but with heads down he stipu-
lated i tell you ven to get up

ad we obeyed him
to the letter things
might have gone
differently but in
the excitement
most of us thrust
up out heads and
fanned frantically
at the dust with our hats for all heard
another wild hurrah from the buccan-
eers on shore through the dust cloud
i saw gentry with his cheek covercd
with court-plaster come running out
of the woods at the head of a dozen
pirates others caught sight of them at
the same time and though the captain
roared like an angry bull suggs thrust
his musket forward and fired this
was like setting a torch to a magazine
on the instant all of us were firing-
not merely the one musket but all the
others as fast as we could pick them
up till the whole cavern mouth and
our front as well was filled with acrid
smoke

  cutlases you fools roared the
captain then

  most of us scrambled to obey the
order

  theyve turned tail the swabs
johannsen yelled

  back we plunged to the breastwork
fanning at the smoke for a better
view then all yelled triumphantly
as we verified johannsens report
the buccaneers were running back
into the trees leaving one man prone
on the ground

 back und loat dem muskets
roared the skipper his voice fairly
shook with rage and we hurried to
obey him

  when the smoke cleared away he
stood looking at us his large fat face
a fiery red all of us-even my uncle
-avoided his glaring eye

  you know vot you done it he ex-
ploded at last dem swabs vas
fooled py dot hit dey tinks maype
half is gone here but do you shtay
down like vot i tolt you  no und
do you vait till i gifs de vort und
knock em ofer like pitchins close in
neiti nacherally so soon he sees
vot he haf to oxpect chentry orters
dem back und you shoots avay all
dot powder und bag yoost vun man-
yoost vun

  not a man answered him not a man
raised his head

  veil now he went on when we
had finished reloading the guns you
see how it is the chudge vas right
only vun log displaced a little und
der center buckled dey cant get hits
so fast ve cant fix im between times


the frontier

ttnd now i pet you dey dont attack
as time wore on the captains guess
proved to be right as soon as the
four men aboard ship had finished re-
loading they resumed their cannon-
ading but we no longer minded this
most of the shots were over or under
the target and the direct hits did not
penetrate nor did the buccaneers
leave the woods again they waited
now for the flying dust to clear after
each direct hit and seeing the barrier
still standing and having had ample
proof that we were taking advantage
of the cover to either side of the open-
ing they contented themselves with
sniping at us whenever a head ap-
peared over the top finally near
noon the cannonading ceased

etween shots we
managed to move
our meager supplies
and our fire out of
line with the door
we were naturally
heartened by the
failure of gentrys
guns but as the sniping from the
woods continued we realized that the
pirate had decided on another plan
this was to keep up bottled up and
starve us into submission

  with the rations we had pooled and
the results of our recent foraging we
estimated that we might hold out a
week at most

  worsen that well be out of to-
bacco afore that time odonnell
grumbled

  veil now said the skipper i
dont intend ve should shtay here al-
ways like rats in a trap vun day
maype-den if dey dont go avay und
gif us a chance to hunt i tink ve take
a hand attacking oursellufs better
die fighting as starving-its easier
right you are sir growled to-
hannsen im for a go at em any
time you say the word

  by this time the captain had been
relieved from sentry duty and shortly
afterward i was called on to relieve
killifer it was then about two bells
or one oclock

  it was now the hottest part of the
day and the yellow slope before me
was baking in the sun a swarm of
flies was buzzing about the dead man
in the grass while beyond them were
the mutineers laughing and talking in
the outer edge of the trees no shots
having been fired from our cave in
answer to their sniping-the skipper
wanting to save ammunition-these
buccaneers had grown bolder and

bolder and i could see several of them
plainly as soon as i raised my head

  keep it down or ill take it off
yelled dumphey he raised his gun
and fired with the words the bullet
clipping the top of the barricade as
i dodged back the marksmans mates
laughed derisively

  a half hour or more passed in this
fashion with an occasional shot whip-
ping close and the buccaneers taunting
me when i noted a boat pulling out
from behind the trees and heading to-
ward the anthony wayne in it sat
gentry with two men at the oars

  i reported this at once to the skip-
per

  zo  he cried a blue flame blazed
in his eyes ve act at vunce den
he continued jumping up vere
efen now almost und dere is anod-
der gig behint dose trees im sure

  what do you propose cried
uncle george

  kill em dots vot said the skip-
per scatter em capture a gig
lay em abort

  in the face of them guns  odon-
nell exclaimed dubiously

  in der face of all hell cried the
skipper all hants now-pistols und
cutlases only rememper der romans
und der short sworts ve half to into
dem go-like dis and he made a
vicious upward jab into the air with
his cutlas as though disembowling an
enemy

  bravo cried my uncle grabbing
up a cutlas

  all of us save perhaps odonnell
echoed this cry the skippers spirit
had set us afire we were sickened of
being sniped at with no return and
the maddest of ventures seemed pref-
erable to remaining inactive so we
were ready for the word in a trice

  now cried the skipper line
up

  we obeyed him at once standing
abreast some distance back of the bar-
ricade and all breathing like horses
ready for the word at a race

  ve take it on der run the skip-
per declared efery man must go
like der devil yoost keep vun tought
-get into em ids dot or death you
vas reaty

  we tightened up our belts spit on
our hands and nodded grimly one
after the other

  all right den cried the skipper
go

  he should have said come for
with all his fat he took that barricade
in a bound

  but we were right behind him over

the barricade we went yelling like
fiends and charged after him

  my memory of that charge is some-
what blurred we ran i know that
we ran like winged devils down that
hill one second saw us going over
the barricade the next-or so it
seemed to me at the time-we were
crashing into them

  of course they fired and of course
it must have taken us a good quarter
of a minute to reach the woods yet
i heard the reports saw the smoke
and felt the wind of the whistling bul-
lets as in a dream then i saw a form
before me-that of the mate jenkins
-and ran at him with my cutlas raised
on high

  he screamed in terror his pistol
was discharged full in my face yet in
the same heart-beat he had gone down
with a great gash in the neck he had
paid the highest price for his treach-
ery being dead before he struck the
ground

s he fell the air
round me was rent
with shots the
clashing of steel
savage shouts and
howls of p a i n
eight pirates had
been left ashore
one had run when we were half-way
down the slope now barnaby threw
down his musket and fled for his life
as i noted this from the tail of my
eye i heard a bloodthirsty roar and
wheeled just in time to see the cook
leblanc come rushing at me with his
musket clubbed and raised high over
his head but the blow never fell
uncle george discharged his pistol
and even as i dodged aside and stum-
bled over jenkins dead body leblanc
screamed dropped his gun clutched
at his side and pitched to the ground

  killifer meantime leaped over him
and cut down the buccaneer behind
him with a single blow and as i leaped
to my feet the skipper shot down
gunderson the big albino dum-
phey and the man beside him then
turned and whipped into the thickets
with the judge and odonnell in close
pursuit only a tree saved dum-
pheys worthless life for the judge
aimed a cut at him which would have
split him in half had the blade not
struck the trunk as it was dum-
pheys shirt was soaked with blood
from wounds received a moment be-
fore

 to the beach to the beach
panted the skipper
the devils caldron



  we had only a few steps to take
but when we arrived there our hearts
fell there was no gig in sight

  back den cried the skipper
see-der gun

  we dodged back among the trees as
a gun roared on board ship scatter-
ing slugs through the foliage all
around us but all had taken cover
and no one was hit

  hurriedly then we took stock of
the situation johannsen was hob-
bling painfuly down the slope with a
bullet in the calf of his right leg
suggs had been killed by dumpheys
cutlas the judge had been shot
through the flesh over his ribs on the
left side my own face was blackened
with powder and the lobe of my right
ear had been shot off while killifer
had a deep cut in the thigh uncle
george also displayed a bleeding scalp
wound and a dented belt buckle where
a bullet had struck and glanced

  the death of suggs and johannsens
leg wound left us with only six men
who could be counted on as able to
bear muskets and some of these were
doubtful if fever set in but the
buccaneers on the other hand had
suffered much more heavily the
dead man on the slope killed earlier
in the day and the three who had just
died cut their number to fifteen of
these fifteen we saw at a glance that
gunderson would never aid them
again even if he were lucky enough
to survive for he had been shot
through the body and was now groan-
ing in dire pain two others we knew
had been severely wounded prior to
this so that we had now but a dozen
able men to cope with

  one thing gave us immediate aid
and this was the finding of three bot-
tles of brandy it strengthened our
wounded wonderfully we also listed
in our loot four tobacco pouches four
pipes a flint and tinder four sailors
clasp knives six muskets three cut-
lases five pistols four powder horns
four shot pouches and a large sack
of provisions which they had brought
ashore

  then after staunching the wounds
of our enemy gunderson as best we
could and performing a like service
for ourselves captain van tassel and
odonnell took position with two mus-
kets apiece near the shore firing from
behind tree trunks they kept the buc-
caneers aboard ship dodging behind
the bulwarks while we removed our
loot and assisted killifer and johann-
sen up the slope to the cavern

chapter xiii

tiie caldron seethes

e reached the cave
 without further cas-
 ualties the very
 daring of our sud-
 den savage attack
 had dumbfounded
 the buccaneers we
 heard gentry roar-
 ing like a lion on board the ship but
 he could not force his men to stand at
 an open gun port and such musket
 shots as were fired at us while odon-
 nell and the captain reloaded were hur-
 ried and badly aimed finally when
 the last pair of us was over the breast-
 works the pirates ceased firing alto-
 gether and kept out of sight behind
 the bulwarks

   we were glad enough of the re-
 spite for killifer and the judge were
 bleeding profusely and johannsen
 was suffering intensely with the ball
 in his leg we managed to staunch the
 wounds of the first two with cool
 water from the spring while uncle
 george gritting his teeth made shift
 to extract the bullet from the quarter-
 masters calf with our only surgical
 instrument - a sailors clasp-knife
 strong as johannsen was he fainted
 dead away when the ball came out at
 last and uncle george was little bet-
 ter but a drink of brandy brought
 them round again and at last we were
 able to stretch out on the sand for a
 much needed rest

   i suppose said the judge that
 were cocks of the walk now on shore
 at any rate and gentry wont make
 another attempt to get the treasure
 in fact i wouldnt le surprised if he
 sailed away to get hands with better
 stomach for his work

   we all agreed that this seemed
 likely and that night when the skip-
 per and odonnell had returned and
 we heard the men on board singing at
 the capstan bars we listened with a
 mixture of relief and despair they
 were raising the anchor we thought
 to sail away and though this meant a
 cessation of fighting with buccaneers
 we still had the possibility of cannibals
 to think of and a dreary battle for
 mere existence as well

   even when we heard the plunge of
 the anchor later on we were not much
 heartened it meant that gentry had
 moved out of gunshot from the shore
 but might only be waiting until morn-
 ing to sail away no one said any-
 thing about surrender but even the in-
  domitable skipper could offer no plan

to better our situation we fell asleep
at last in anything but an optimistic
frame of mind

  losing sleep through a trick at sen-
try go as well as my smarting ear i
was awakened from a dead stupor
some time after daybreak by a cry
from odonnell a signal was being
flashed from kidds mauley he said
and all of us rushed to the barricade

  a thin morning mist still hung over
the bay and around the base of kidds
mauley but not so thick that we could
not see the hazy outlines of the ship
it lay at anchor in the middle of the
bay almost directly to eastward of us
and there on the northern side of the
peak to southward and at a point near
the top was a buccaneer holding aloft
the burnished bottom of a pannikin

  this he moved back and forth now
exposing it to the sun now swinging
it to his side

  a ship-or canoes said uncle
george see there hes down be-
hind that shoulder so they cant see
him signal from seaward

  ve see said the captain jack
up aloft mit a telescope

  i was not long in gaining the top
of the bluff from which i commanded
a good view of morgans bay and i
had no sooner looked than my blood
seemed to freeze within my veins
there rounding bowsprit bluff be-
tween the reefs and shore were nine
big canoes

  they were equipped with outriggers
and a sail each forward and there
were between six and eight savages in
each craft most of them swinging
long paddles they were heading al-
most directly toward me on a course
which i judged would bring them to
the beach in cannibal cove an inden-
tation in the coast-line between kidds
mauley and middle point

  i ran to the edge of the bluff and
shouted my news to the captain he
stood there a moment below me look-
ing up as though momentarily stunned
but in a trice he had jerked himself to-
gether

  see vere dey lant und dont let
em see you he ordered i pring
up your breaksfast

  a gig was now racing from the ship
down drakes bay toward kidds
mauley with six men at the oars be-
fore my breakfast reached me this
gig had picked up the two sentries and
was pulling back to the anthony
wayne while the savages without
changing their course headed directly
toward cannibal cove

  my unde the captain and odon-


the frontier

nell came up together as i munched
at ships biscuit and jerked beef they
passed the glass from hand to hand
all for a time were grim and silent

  if they stay around that cove
said my uncle presently were safe
enough id think but if they come

round kidds mauley-

  chentry gets dem first the skip-
per cut in with a little grin ve see
first if dey lants dere

  within the hour the savages were in-
side the cove and shortly afterward
they had run their canoes on shore
and were swarming out upon the
beach here we could no longer ob-
tain a clear view of them for the in-
tervening trees at the shore line but
as they moved in out of our sight we
estimated that at least sixty warriors
comprised the party and from one
canoe we saw them remove three
bound prisoners while from another
we watched them carry something
which we took to be a wooden idol

  vun ting said the skipper lower-
ing the glass i cant make out a sign
of a gun among em bows und spears
und a kind of swort jess but no guns
did you see any

  we shook our heads

  veil dats good van tassel
grunted he looked toward drakes
bay where the gig was again leaving
the ship and heading toward kidds
mauley gone for annoder look
he commented guess hes like me-
dont know yet oxactly vot is best
first time ive seen you hesitate
uncle george cried but see here
what do you think of trying for a
canoe 

  the skippers face beamed ecstatic-
ally he thrust out his hand and
caught that of uncle george in a
crushing grip

  i alvays vas glat to sail vor you
he cried now i could kiss you py
both cheeks yoost like a frenchman
hitnmel ve do it

aiting only until
we saw smoke com-
ing up above the
intervening trees-
the men in the an-
thony wayne in
meantime breaking
out sail and drift-
ing down toward kidds mauley-we
scrambled down to the bluff the
judge killifer and johannsen were
then left in the cave while the skip-
per uncle george odonnell and i
with two pistols two muskets and a
cutlas apiece set out across the north-

ern end of the peninsula toward can-
nibal cove

  taking advantage of every dip for
cover we soon came within hearing
distance of the savages for they were
shouting and hallooing to one another
like children on a picnic and making
no effort to concealment thereafter
however we proceeded cautiously and
it was over an hour before we had
worked our way to some thickets on
a promontory overlooking their fire

  i could not forget the sight we

we could see them clearly

looked upon then they were not over
fifty yards away and we could see
them clearly some were squatting
about a great fire some were dancing
and gamboling up and down the beach
and some were busy with great kettles
and sacks of provender mixing up a
stew two of them came lugging a
goatskin gourd of water from a nearby
spring and still another pair were im-
paling a great turtle with their spears
they were physical giants like all the
rest indeed there was not a man
among them under six feet in height

  as we had estimated there were
over sixty at the least counting-sixty
great bronzed warriors naked save
for a fringed girdle of monkey skin
worn round the waist with one ex-
ception they were almost identical in
dress save for him whom we soon
perceived to be the chief each man
wore a shining band of yellow metal
which we took at first to be brass
around his right ankle another was
fastened around the left wrist all
the heads were shaved or plucked
bald save for a two-inch ridge running
from the brow to a point at the back
of the head and just below the ears
this ridge of stiffened hair rose like
the tuft on a roman helmet and on a

line at the middle of the skull all the
warriors also wore an amulet of boars
tusks around the neck and since these
varied in number i supposed them to
be decorations for valorous deeds in
battle a great number wore rings of
yellow metal through their ear lobes
and nostrils but this seemed to be
optional every man but the chief
however had a red circle painted on
his right cheek

  the chief was a man who would
have drawn attention anywhere he
was easily seven feet in height he
wore metal bands on both wrists and
both ankles and another about his
head but if he had worn no insig-
nia whatever one would have marked
him instantly where most of the
others were laughing and displaying
their rows of beautiful white teeth
this mans cadaverous features were
as immobile as a mask he sat apart
on a dais covered with skin his feet
planted on a jaguar hide and his
fierce gloomy eyes burning like two
points of light deep back in dark cav-
ernous sockets as solemn and forbid-
ding a figure as that of the wooden
idol which was placed on another
jaguar hide under a nearby palm tree

  this idol which was about eight feet
high and evidently hollow-since they
had carried it easily up the beach-
was presented to us in profile its
features were menacing in the ex-
treme what it resembled i could not
clearly tell as its nose was like the
beak of an eagle and its temples were
adorned with mountain goats horns
but its arms were human in shape and
folded across its breast the whole
was painted in every glaring color of
the rainbow

  these things we noted of course in
a glance we also noted that there
were no guns of any description in
sight no weapons in fact save bows
and arrows long shovel-bladed spears
short darts and shields covered with
stretched hide with some heavy
broadswords at least five feet in
length and four inches wide like the
spears the blades appeared to be made
of hammered bronze while the handles
were wooden and allowed a two
handed grip

  cut a bull in two with one swipe
odonnell whispered to me

  i merely nodded for my eyes were
now fastened on the poor naked pris-
oners there were not only two
there were a dozen all seated or lying
in a little circle not far from the idol
they were smaller in stature than
their captors neither were they so
the devils caldron



prepossessing in appearance having
darker skins and broader nostrils but
despite their repulsive monkey-like
features their plight filled my heart
with pity time and again my eyes
come back to them-drawn i suppose
by an irresistible morbid fascination
which one of them i thought would
be first to feel the executioners stroke

  captain i whispered lets save
those poor devils lets fire now
no jack the captain whispered
in return see how deyre scattered
and i could not but nod for there
were several on our left forefront
ve vant dcm a goot safe distance
veil vc fire he went on bunched
arount der fire if possible if dey
aint afraid from firearms dot gifs a
chance for us to run anyhow und
anyvay-see dere

  i followed his nod and almost vom-
ited outright a little group moving
aside just them we saw two butchers
busy with knives on a prisoners dead
body as they dismembered it the
parts were handed to others who
tossed them into the pots these were
then carried to the fire

  it iss too late you see said the
captain dey probably kill him yoost
before ve come

  just then the chief made a signal
and two warriors seized another pris-
oner and dragged him to a position
before the idol the poor wretch
wailed piteously and all his comrades
howled in sympathy but the bound
captive was forced down to a position
on his knees one strapping warrior
seizing him by the thick black hair
and pulling the head forward and
down while another poised at one
side ready with a two-handed sword

  for gods sake captain whis-
pered odonnell lets shoot
no the skipper whispered
fiercely der time iss nod now
odonnell as pale as a ghost slid
back a little way and buried his face in
shaking hands

  horrified yet held to the gruesome
spectacle as though by some magnet i
saw the stately chief arise with som-
ber dignity he strode toward the idol
pausing behind the prisoner he bent
down on one knee and bowed his head
as he did so all the other warriors
save the two executioners paused in
their tracks and did likewise

  the chief mumbled something and
his warriors broke out in a brief weird
chant it came to an abrupt end in
the very middle of a note the chief
suddenly shouted and from his war-
riors burst another chant-this time

short and sharp and unutterably sav-
age

 ha-ee ha-ee ha-ee ha
they intoned in rising cadence with
fierce exultation ringing in every note
and the last ha coming out like
the bang of a drum then suddenly
the chief arose held up his hand and
all rose with him while the swords-
man raised his weapon and stood
ready for the stroke

  oh oh oh wailed the bound
prisoners

  but before the sword could fall
there came a cry from a savage on
our left and from all the warriors
there came a cry of amazement

 the anthony wayne was winging
her way out of drakes bay

chapter xiv

new allies-and enemies

 hen sighted the
schooner had
rounded the south-
ern end of kidds
mauley and was
steering due north-
west on a course to
bring her close to
the entrance of cannibal cove she
came skimming over the sparkling blue
water with the grace of a swan her
beautiful white sails agleatn in the
morning sun and the savages were at
once thrown into a state bordering on
panic some shouted incoherently
with outflung hand pointing toward
the ship some started running along
shore to westward and others started
racing down the broad gently sloping
beach to where the canoes had been
drawn up on shore about one hundred
yards below the fire

  but the chief brought his followers
to heel in short order doubtless it
was instantly obvious to him that he
could not hope to outsail this great
winged craft and he knew at once
that he stood the better chance on
shore if the stranger was to prove an
enemy wheeling about he gave one
great booming shout which halted his
men dead in their tracks with a
fierce sweep of his arm he then bec-
koned them back and pointing toward
the fire he stalked toward it and sat
down once more on his dais-but this
time facing the approaching ship

  in a moment all his men were mov-
ing toward him even the execution-
ers left their prisoner to fall forward
at the feet of the hideous idol as
group after group came up and stop-
ped facing to seaward behind their

chief he was soon shut off from our
view

  this was the opportunity for which
captain van tassel had been waiting
the savages were now bunched and
between us and their fire and though
things might have turned out far dif-
ferently had we waited to ascertain
gentrys intentions we were agreed
afterward that the skipper was not to
be censured for his decision the ship
was still over a mile away and the
savages might separate at any minute

  shteady now the captain whis-
pered veil i giff der vort fire but
holt der secont musket for orters

  as carefully as we could we thrust
our muskets forward since the
range was so short we had added a
dozen small birdshot to each musket-
ball and now we rested  our el-
bows aiming full at the unconscious
pack not fifty yards from us

  fire the skipper suddenly com-
manded

  all four muskets roared as one and
the contours of the ground were such
that the reports were magnified and
came rocketing back from the frown-
ing cliffs on execution knob like rip-
ping peals of thunder

  the effect on the savages was shock-
ing never have i heard such fren-
zied yells bursting from human
throats the bird shot could not be
counted on for mortal wounds but
they scattered widely so that at least
twenty or more must have felt their
vicious sting while the heavy musket-
balls tore through the pack with a
hideous ripping sound at least nine
fell to the ground while their com-
rades milled over them shrieking
wailing and chattering like monkeys
in their horrid fear

  keep hittin said the captain as
coolly as though he were on his quarter
deck dis time yoost jack und i
fire now jack

  he and i fired our second muskets
on the instant and those who were not
already in motion now ran like mad-
men even the chief forgot his dig-
nity and followed his stampeding war-
riors they ran to westward with
the speed of deer hounds never paus-
ing until they had whipped into the
trees  the western side of the cove

  loat first und den ve go oudt
said the captain

  as quickly as possible we reloaded
all pieces and then followed the cap-
tain out on the beach

  as we moved out one of the fallen
cannibals who had evidently been
more frightened than hurt leaped up


the frontier

and ran screaming after his fellows
this man we allowed to depart with-
out further harm eleven more lay
on the ground seven of them stone
dead and four seriously wounded

  one thing said uncle george i
dont know that gentry will let us
get away now with one of those can-
oes but by the lord harry im going
to set these poor devils loose and
he nodded at the prisoners

  it was the first time my uncle had
spoken up to assert himself before the
captain gave an order he had taken
special pains to leave the leadership in
his skippers hands as i knew for the
sake of discipline but now he marched
straight for the poor bound wretches
without another word

  a good tought said the skipper
with a little grin then being ever
practical he added dryly it may pay
us to do it anyvay ve coult maype
use dem extra hants if olt skull face
gets ofer being scared unt gomes back

  at his nod we stepped after my
uncle-though odonnell with a hor-
rible grimace must needs pause to
throw a jaguar skin over the butchered
carcass and kick the pots with their
sickening mess over into the fire be-
fore he could lend a hand

hen we knelt over
the prisoners with
our knives all
howled dismally
and despite the
sympathy in our
tones the first one
released as soon as
he stood free turned and ran like a
deer for the water our shouts only
served to increase his speed and we
concluded that he must have been tem-
porarily deranged with fright for he
plunged straight into the water and be-
gan swimming with frenzied strokes
to seaward

  but the others were soon quieted
some of them in fact had been bound
so long that they could neither stand
nor even so much as bend their stiff-
ened fingers they groaned with pain
when we tried to help them erect
when we started to chafe their swol-
len wrists and ankles the fear in their
eyes faded before a look of dog-like
gratitude and one of them caught my
hand and pressed it against his cheek
those who had been bound more
loosely soon flexed their muscles and
fell to massaging their cramped com-
rades and when the skipper handed
two of them swords and made it plain
that they were to arm themselves from

the litter which their enemies had dis-
carded they were in raptures

  they danced they laughed they
shouted they made the blades whistle
through the air to show us what they
would do and they fairly stampeded
us with signs of gratitude and affec-
tion some pressed our hands against
their cheeks some sought to embrace
us others flung themselves on the
sands and clasped our ankles in an
ecstasy

  indeed if we had thought them re-
pulsive before it was marvelous how
wholesome and pleasing their eloquent
countenances were now furthermore
it was plain that we had rescued any-
thing but cowards they were mus-
cled like gorillas one of them by way
of demonstration picked up a spear
and drove the point a full eight inches
into a tree from a distance of thirty
feet eagerly they pointed to the
place where their enemies had disap-
peared making the most savage of
grimaces and begging us with eloquent
gestures to follow and annihilate them

  when the captain shook his head
frowned and pointed toward the ap-
proaching ship they were at first
plainly puzzled and disappointed in
a trice another incident set them to
redoubling their pleas one of them
ran suddenly to the idol spat upon it
chopped the face with his sword and
knocked it over there on the jaguar
skin lay the head of the slain victim
jt had been thrust through the idols
gaping mouth as a sort of offering i
suppose with a cry to pierce the
heart the savage picked up the head
clutching it to his breast and sobbing
as though his heart were broken
whereupon his comrades crying out
with sympathy and rage ran pell-mell
upon the fallen warriors near the fire
in a jiffy they had beheaded every one
dead and wounded alike

  nor was this all before we could
quiet them they rushed upon the idol
carried it to the fire set it up at the
edge and fed every head through the
mouth then they pushed the whole
farther into the blaze and threw the
kings dais after it following this-
which seemed to satisfy them mightily
-they pointed at the pots and by un-
mistakable signs of nausea made it
plain to us that they were not caters
of human flesh then making it plain
that they wished to bury their own
dead comrade and receiving permis-
sion from the captain they fell to
scooping out a grave in the sands

  all this while there was not a sign
from the other savages though now

and again we saw movements and
knew they were watching us from the
distant trees and the ship in the
meantime was drawing rapidly nearer

  capn said odonnell rather
nervously dont you think wed best
up anchor  theyll take a crack at us
with them long nines i shouldnt won-
der

  the captain heaved a sigh he had
been standing for a moment in deep
thought with a frown upon his face

  jess he said i subbose so mr
pellew he continued addressing my
uncle i vas consitering porting dem
in say two or tree canoes if he drops
anchor maype vun vould get to him
-with luck maype two but if deni
cannibals see dey have an ally-den
look out

  exactly said my uncle with a
sigh on his own account they
might come back out of the woods into
the remaining canoes and then-
he shrugged wed be between the
devil and the deep sea

  why by your leave capn said
odonnell heres an idea shove em
all off-the canoes i mean-and put
one of these niggers in say each one
but three its a long chance that
but i havent seen any short ones by
thunder them in the woods couldnt
get to us anyway-and as you say
sir we might get alongside with luck
the captain suddenly crashed his
first into his palm

  ve try it he declared if chen-
try anchors ve do it

  forthwith he made signs to the res-
cued savages to hurry their burial and
when they were finished bade them
collect their arms more than enough
equipment had been dropped by the
fleeing warriors to give each one of
our new allies a shield spear sword
a bow and in some cases even two
quivers of arrows the few remain-
ing weapons were thrown into the fire
then we strode down in a body to-
ward the canoes

chapter xv

repulsed

e had no sooner
started for the
canoes than the
gigantic chief with
several of his war-
riors plucked up
courage and em-
erged from the
shadowy forest to westward the
chief was gesticulating vehemently
and we could hear him shouting in a
the devils caldron



voice choked with rage this we saw
at once was having some effect for
now a score or more came out onto
the sands fitting arrows to their long
bows

  mr pellew said the captain try
a shot at dem

  my uncle paused and took careful
aim it was a long range for our
pieces something over three hundred
yards but uncle george made due al-
lowance for this and luck was with us
as the gun roared one of the enemy
threw up his arms and fell to the
ground with a cry that sent the chills
racing up and down my spine

  our own allies who had clapped
their hands to their ears now yelled
with mingled fear delight and aston-
ishment  while all but the enemy chief-
tain turned and fled back behind the
trees

  our allies were in ecstasies they
danced round us like children touching
the guns with fearful but loving ges-
tures they begged us anew to follow
the enemy into the woods not until
the captain let out a roar like the first
blast of a typhoon did they give over
he pointed to the ship shook his fist
at it with palpable hatred and made it
plain to them at last that we intended
attacking it when this was under-
stood the savages at first showed
great amazement pointing to the can-
oes illustrating their comparative
smallness by holding up their palms
close together and flinging them wide
while nodding at the ship but when
the captain summoned them on with a
jerk of his head they made it patent
on the instant that they would attack
a fleet if we desired it

  the tide was ebbing and we were
forced to set to moving the heavy dug-
outs down the sandy slope one at a
time

  by the time the second proa was in
the water the ship was standing in
across the mouth of the cove with
gentry on the poop holding a telescope
in his hand a moment later he hove
to put a boat over the side picked up
the demented savage swimming there
in the water and then when he was
hauled aboard filled away and stood
closer in on the port tack we had by
this time shoved three more canoes
into the water but we might as well
have saved ourselves the labor for we
saw men busy at the guns and their
broadside was no sooner presented
than they were training them upon us

  down cried the captain crouch-
ing with the word

  flame and smoke burst from the

side of the ship the very sides of ex-
ecution knob seemed to be shaking
with the re-echoes of the report and
a roundshot screamed directly over-
head and threw a fountain of sand up
over the fire the other three guns
chimed in one after the other one
lucky shot smashing in the side of a
canoe the second spanking up a great
shower of water at our left and the
third flying high cutting down a palm
tree beyond the fire

  for my own part the hair was
bristling on the back of my neck our
new friends meantime were on the
verge of fleeing their eyes were pop-
ping all color had left their dusky
features had one of us so much as
taken a step they undoubtedly would
have run to the other end of the island
but none of us did more than crouch
and the captain laughing out as though
it were all a sort of game held them in
check

  veil he said standing erect after
the last shot no vun is hit vich is
our luck but its blain ve cant count
on dese fellows against dem guns
yoost yet a vile dey got to get used
to it first ve mofe back by dor trees
a vile

  cautioning us to move slowly lesi
the savages take fright and break we
started back as it was their eyes
were still round with fear they gazed
backward over their shoulder at the
ship and exclaimed in wonder over the
hole dug in the sands by the first shot
and now and again they looked at us
in utter bewilderment

  they cant understand why were
not running yet said my uncle with
a dry chuckle if they could feel the
chill along my spine theyd laugh

  me too said odonnell ah
there they come about again now for
the guns on the other side

  valk shteady said the skipper
ve must holt dese fellows i tell you

  another gun roared in a minute or
so later we were then close to the
trees the shot went overhead lop-
ping off another palm half-way up the
trunk at this at least half of our
savages broke and ran for the trees

  shteady the skipper roared

  this checked them though they were
trembling visibly then he increased
his gait a little coming up to those
who had run he signified that they
were to hand him their weapons as
they did so he handed them over one
at a time to their comrades who had
walked steadily then he picked up
little sticks and gave them to the dis-
armed men

  when the savages grasped the im-
port of this those who had not run
cackled with glee while the others
filled with shame begged to have their
weapons returned but the captain
solemnly shook his head he clapped
the valiant ones on the back signify-
ing that only the bravest were fit to
bear weapons nor did he return
their arms until gentry fired again
this time the roundshot whistled close
by my ear judging from the sound
it ricochetted from a palm tree and
went screaming up and away over the
forest toward execution knob with
a wail at the last to chill ones blood
but not a man stirred instead one
after another of the disarmed men
thumped himself on the chesf looked
the skipper full in the eye and held out
his hand for his weapons

  ha said the captain i tink ve
count on dem now

  too late for boarding though
said uncle george nodding at the
anthony wayne

  it was patent that gentry now had
no intention of anchoring opposite us
instead he fired one more shot which
did no damage and then coming
about he steered for the western side
of the cove heaving to at a point
opposite the spot where the cannibals
had disappeared he then put a boat
over and with six men at the oars
pulled in toward the shore within
one hundred yards or so from the
beach he stopped and then he stood
up in the sheets and held out his open
palms in token of peace

  not a man of us stirred not a man
spoke at first gentrys intentions were
obvious to all we had been balked
in our attempt to capture the canoes
and had also made a new horde of en-
emies gentry fully cognizant of the
situation was now bent on making
these enemies his allies

  for a time there was no response
from the green depths of the woods
growing impatient at last gentry then
turned his boat back toward the an-
thony wayne in a brace of shakes
the poor savage whom they had cap-
tured was handed down into the gig
he was now tied hand and foot and
gentry pulling back to his former
position off the beach stood up in the
sheets and indicated his purpose with
unmistakable gestures he was
plainly willing to give up the victim to
his fiendish captors to gain their
friendship and aid

  this time the response was forth-
coming skull face as the skipper
had dubbed the cannibal chief un-


the frontier

doubtedly had recovered from his first
fright and had seen that the ship was
firing on us and not at his men now
he stepped forward out of the trees
-though not too far for he probably
was still thinking of my uncles last
lucky shot-and then when gentry
gestured and shouted anew the big
chieftain stood up very straight placed
his left hand over his heart and
raised his right arm with the palm
held outward full length above his
head

  at this the poor captive in the boat
wailed piteously a long-drawn quaver-
ing cry that might well have moved a
wooden idol but gentry clouted him
on the head knocking him down into
the bottom of the gig then he re-
peated the chiefs gesture and nodded
at his men to pull closer in

  a sol broke from one of our allies
it broke our silence and all in a breath
the natives we had so lately rescued
were clamoring to attack but the
captain pointing at our muskets and
then at the arms borne by the men in
the boat shook his head

  vun ting is diss he said to
uncle george olt skull face has a
score against us unt propaply he helps
chentry now dot means der ship
shtill shtays und vile she shtays dere
is alvays hope ve gets her back

  at his orders then our allies picked
up such sacks of provender as they
could carry handily threw the rest
into the fire and retreated with us to-
ward our cavern if gentry attacked
we stood the best chance there if not
then we could at least sortie

chapter xvi

savage aid

s soon as we
reached the cave
where we were wel-
comed vociferously
by our three
wounded comrades
who had been wait-
ing in a fever of
apprehension and anxiety odonnell
was sent aloft on the bluff with a glass
he reported that the ship was now at
anchor that the wind had died away
and that most of the cannibals were
now clustered about the gig which had
been drawn up on the shore near the
canoes those canoes which we had
set adrift he said had been hauled in
the prisoner he could not make out
but he said that gentry had handed
the chief a musket which he was then
examining while some of the canni-

bals were passing around what he took
to be a bottle of brandy

  what gentry planned to do we could
not of course tell with certainty but
if the treasure really lay near the falls

the poor captive wailed piteously

as he had said then we reasoned he
would return to drakes bay as soon
as the breeze came up again drakes
bay not only afforded the best anchor-
age but it brought him closest to the
falls and with his new allies his pros-
pects for gaining his object seemed to
have been brightened immeasurably
in the meantime we were agreed that
it would be folly for us to attack them
in their present position

  let us hope they do attack cried
the judge with these husky chaps
to help-why well give them the
damnedest drubbing one could wish
you mark my words

  while we were away it developed
the judge had gone out to see how
things had fared with gunderson
dumphey and his three companions
had regained the ship during the night
and as the judge had anticipated had
made no effort to remove their
wounded comrade he had lain all
night at the foot of the slope writh-
ing in pain and there the judge had
found him so when our story was
told he asked that the poor fellow be
brought to the cavern

  certainly said the skipper forth-
with my uncle was sent down with
four of the savages to return pres-
ently with the groaning sailor on an
improvised litter

  i got what i deserves sir the
man said weakly when they had laid
him down i thought it was a case
of saving my own life sir now-

  dont talk said my uncle kindly
you must save your strength

  well ive got to say id give a
deal to show you what i feels gun-
derson persisted them swabs 
and when he heard how gentry had
given back the poor savage to be eaten
by the cannibals he writhed with
loathing why hed eat some o that
hisself sir to gain an end he would
he cried

  few of us gave him much chance
for recovery the man had been shot
clean through and he was now the
color of wax but we had not rec-
koned with our new friends

  as soon as they entered the cavern
the captain had bade them set down
their sacks of provender and fall to
eating for this they were humbly
grateful and running to the brook
and drinking like men who had been
traveling on a desert they opened one
of the sacks this contained parched
corn sweet potatoes a sort of pern-
mican thick corn cakes bunches of
dried grapes dried fish and vegetables
which resembled carrots and our on-
ions as we found by tasting this
food was palatable enough save that
most of it lacked the salt to which we
were accustomed our savages downed
it with gusto they were also delighted
with the bits of cheese jerked beef
and ships biscuit which we gave them
to sample

  but while they were eating their
quick eyes were taking in everything
in the place and when the captain
by means of signs told them that the
rations they saw before them were all
we had to subsist on they made eager
motions to assure us we need not
worry on that score as soon as they
had finished eating four of them
picked up bows and arrows pointed
eagerly at the woods and at the cap-
tains nod went over the barricade in
a bound two others noting our shat-
tered clay pots ran to the patch of
clay at the back of the cavern and
after getting permission from the
skipper fell to shaping new utensils
and others going to our wounded
men pointed first to the wounds then
at the forest and then back at the
fire signifying that they would soon
concoct remedies to ease them of their
pain

  being given permission to go they
returned shortly with some black gum
like tar and a collection of herbs and
palm leaves as well as strips of bark
and some bright red berries all save
the gum was placed in the coffee pot
and brought to a boil over the fire
the devils caldron



as soon as it had cooled gunderson
johannsen the judge and killifer were
given a draught which they took will-
ingly enough though with many grim-
aces within ten minutes all were
sound asleep

 remarkable cried my uncle
whats more see how white and
drawn they were-and all have better
color already

  and a natural sleep too said
odonnell marveling well ive
seen men with a drop in their grog a-
breathin like a boss with the heaves
but nothin like this we can learn
even from these swabs i take it

  the four were no sooner asleep than
the savages with little crooning mur-
murs of sympathy uncovered their
wounds one of them in the interim
heated the black gum in a pannikin
while the stuff was still bubbling they
dipped it up on wooden paddles and
smeared it over the wounds after
which they bound up the patients with
palm leaves and strips of inner bark
showing a dexterity and tenderness
that was admirable to behold

  during these ministrations not a pa-
tient so much as moved they slept
like little children moreover not one
of them awakened till the following
morning when all appeared wonder-
fully refreshed and declared that they
felt nothing but a rather pleasant itch-
ing sensation around the surface of
their wounds even gunderson said
that he believed he could now sit up-
thoughof coursehe was not allowed to

  nor was this all the hunters in
the meantime returned with two wild
hogs and a small deer these were
speedily cut up and hung on poles
over the fire to smoke others brought
back turtles eggs breadfruit mangoes
luscious wild grapes more clams coco-
nuts and some tender vegetables which
they called bago resembling long rad-
ishes all these things they brought
in with an air of childish pride look-
ing to us like so many eager dogs
waiting to be patted

  why said my uncle if we were
left free to forage we could live here
a matter of years with these chaps to
show us the way of it

f all my memor-
ies of that island
those of that day
and the next are
perhaps the most
pleasant the sav-
ages who called
themselves usagos
proved excellent cooks in their own

way of doing with a bit of coaching
they rapidly picked up our own ideas
of preparing food so we feasted like
kings and added enough stores on the
second day to keep us a matter of two
weeks or more moreover we found
our allies as interesting to watch as so
many quick and eager monkies

  they manifested the keenest of in-
terest in everything we had and it was
laughable to see them wondering and
exclaiming over a watch or noting the
play of a compass needle when settling

  it was also something to see when
one of them filled a pipe which
odonnell loaned him and made wry
faces signifying that the tobacco had
burned his tongue yet the same man
soon after came in with some dried
brown fluff resembling that which our
indians call kinnikinick rolled it in a
yellow palm leaf and smoked away
contentedly they also found and
chewed a sort of black tender nut
which they took from a green husk
like that of a walnut and though we
found them very bitter to the taste
the usagos preferred them to samples
of our own natural twist

  we made slow work at first of pick-
ing up their guttural jargon save the
names of objects such as bogo for
sword and bees for spear but by
holding up objects making signs and
drawing diagrams in the sand we came
at last to a fair understanding they
were worshippers of the sun and lived
on an island two days travel to west-
ward by canoe with fair direct winds
their enemies whom they called
buscas lived on another island to the
iiorth and west and about the same
distance for these buscas they ex-
pressed the deepest hatred and loath-
ing yet they declared that they were
not afraid of them their own cap-
ture they explained by illustrating in
pantomime they had been hunting
they had fallen asleep after a hearty
feast and being only twenty in num-
ber had been surprised by as many as
sixty

  at first they could not understand
why we had come to the island be-
ing shown a gold coin they were im-
mediately intrigued with the bas-relief
portrait and the lettering thereon but
it was plain that they did not recog-
nize it as a thing of value holding
up their wrists and ankles they showed
where they had worn ornaments of
the same metal this they indicated
they had taken from streams on their
island in nuggets and had shaped it
for mere ornamentation then when
they grasped the fact that we had

hoped to take many such coins from
this island and in pantomime had been
shown what one such coin would pur-
chase one of them took my uncle by
the arm

  pointing toward the west he took
a few steps with uncle george then
he paused and threw his arms wide
as though to clasp my uncle to his
bosom following this gesture he
took off my uncles hat held out his
hand for the coin dropped it into the
hat and made a motion as though
heaping it full and picking up a
pebble somewhat of the same color
lie pretended to fill the hat over and
over thrusting it each time toward my
uncles hands

  plain enough cried my uncle
if we will go with them they will
load us down with nuggets

  but here he shrugged helplessly
pointed westward laughed and flap-
ped his arms like a bird flying

  the usago understood for he
laughed in answer and picking up one
of our axes showed with this and a
rough picture on the sand how he
and his fellows would shape a dugout
if a tree large enough could be found
this heartened us mightily

  why cried odonnell in some
ways id as soon hide out till them
swabs puts to sea them pirates and
cannibals i means whats gold to a
dead man anyway i says let an
take the swag and we try for the
other island

  not much use hiding if they take
pains to find us said uncle george
no by jophet i have a feeling that
somehow someway well do them yet
and get the ship

  when we showed the usagos the
chart of the island they were at first
at a loss to know what to make of it
but when we pointed out drakes bay
and the peninsulas they had seen com-
ing in they understood with many
shakes of the head they pointed at
the lake making signs to show that
the water leaped up in fountains now
and again while the earth trembled all
round it we took this to mean that
volcanic disturbances occurred at the
bottom on occasion with earthquake
tremors and concluded that the island
was not inhabited because the savages
believed it to be cursed by evil spirits

  meantime we took turns watching
cannibal cove from the bluff by day
and maintained a vigilant guard at
night occasionally we could see the
gig going and coming from the ship
while groups of cannibals staggered
into view now and then plainly drunk


the frontier

  i go down und get a look said
the captain on the second morning
maype if all is drunk ve surbrise
em some

  nothing we could say would dis-
suade him from the risk so he and my
uncle set out but they returned with-
in the hour saying that drunk or not
old skull face maintained discipline

  but on that same day we made two
important discoveries the bluff face
above the mouth of our cave it will
be remembered rose perpendicularly
for fifty feet or more at the top a
ledge overhung several feet odon-
nell who was aloft with a telescope
was moving about to stretch his legs
and walked to the edge a cracked
fragment on which he stepped began
to teeter with his weight and he
leaped back just in time the great
stone weighing several tons rocked
a little then settled back into place
thereupon odonnell reported to the
skipper a stout pole was cut and
taken up and it was found that one
man could easily tip the slab over

  ha chuckled the skipper vot
a surbrise dey get now if dey attack
and he looked below at the spot where
the slab would probably strike it
was fairly in front of the cavern
mouth

  i made the other discovery chanc-
ing to look behind a huge rock at the
back of the cavern i found that it
covered a hole we rolled the rock
away and exploration disclosed the
fact that we had unearthed a natural
tunnel there were some tight
squeezes here and there but no by-
passages  and it wound on and slightly
upward to an exit on the west side of
the knoll some three hundred feet
from the cavern

  it vill help us scouting ven dey tink
vere cooped said the skipper

  meantime the anthony wayne did
not move until noon observation then
she weighed anchor and with the can-
oes trailing came sailing round kidds
mauley once more and up to a posi-
tion opposite our cavern

chapter xvii

i scout for treasure

before the an-
y wayne let
her anchor -
h was at about
oclock or four

-	a warning
from my
uncle aloft on the
bluff had brought in our last foragers

and all was made ready for an attack
my uncle remained on the bluff the
captain took the first watch at the bar-
ricade  and the rest of us in two par-
ties stood ready behind the walls on
either side of the breastworks

  my party which included five of
the usagos and odonnell took the
right side the judge and killifer who
insisted they were quite able to fight
were on the left with the remaining
six allies johannsen and gunderson
were placed behind them though
johannsen grumbled audibly and
swore he would be into it leg or no
leg if they succeeded in boarding us

  but almost immediately we con-
cluded that gentry did not contemplate
immediate hostilities the cannibals
came up the bay shouting drunkenly
at their paddles and beached to the
northeast of us behind the trees a
few of them came to the edge of the
forest to shout at us one planted a
spear at the foot of the slope with the
head of their last victim upon it but
they soon had a fire going and could
be heard chanting and gibbering in
drunken abandon then too a gig
put off from the ship gentry the
busca chief two of his cannibals
dumphey and three sailors were in
it and they were headed up toward the
rivers mouth to northward

  it was then that i made a mad pro-
posal it seemed reasonable to believe
that there would be no attack with the
two chieftains away and i was some-
how certain that their trip had to do
with the treasure

  theyre headed up to the waterfall
ill wager i argued probably to
make plans for the treasures removal
they feel sure they have us bottled
up but why not let me spy on them
and learn what i can

  at first the skipper frowned it
seemed a mad risk he did not want to
expose me unnecessarily nor weaken
our party but i pointed out i had
an excellent chance to slip out behind
the knoll through the tunnel the
buscas were in all probability watching
only the front of the cave thinking
we had no other outlet and i was a
good runner and enough of a woods-
man to take full advantage of cover
at last he yielded

  i voulnt do it he said patting
me awkwardly on the shoulder with a
suspicion of moisture in his eyes only
-i haf a feeling you come back und
gott go mit you-jess

  even as i had expected there were
no signs of the buscas when i emerged
from the tunnel the knoll was now

between me and them and i ran down
the slope to westward and plunged
into the trees there safely hidden
from their view i turned northward
till i ran into the trail we had so re-
cently cut and headed westward again
intent on mounting the plateau

  for the sake of lightness i had
taken only a musket a pistol a com-
pass and a few ships biscuits so i
made rapid progress and within the
hour was at the top of the plateau

  from there i had little trouble in
reaching the falls there were no
vines to hinder me here the footing
was good and the thunder of the
tumbling waters served as a guide

  for cautions sake i proceeded
carefully when i neared the falls for
though i reasoned that if they were
coming here they would not hurry
as i had done there was always the
chance that i had miscalculated the
chart showed a great bend in the river
between the falls and the mouth ac-
cording to this they had much the
greater distance to travel yet i had
no means of knowing how far they
would be able to row against the cur-
rent nor whether gentry knew of a
shorter route and a less precipitate
slope to mount but i reached my
destination without mishap to all ap-
pearances i was alone upon the pla-
teau

  i was brought up standing the in-
stant i came within view of the brink

he river at this
point was about
fifty feet wide at
the brink and ex-
tending up-stream
was a rocky projec-
tion it was shaped
somewhat after the
fashion of a ship turned keel up with
the bows heading up-stream this
acted as a delta splitting the stream in
two in length the projection was not
over fifty feet while the top of the
ridge rose ten or twelve feet above the
water and it was approximately but
ten feet through at the thickest part
so that the channel on the north side
was about ten feet wide and that on
the south-the side on which i was
standing-something near ten yards
in width splitting at the beak of the
delta the blue waters raced through
these channels pell-mell plunging on
and downward over the brink in two
distinct falls to the rocks some seventy
feet below

  well this in itself was nothing to
marvel at but there on the northern
the devil s caldron



bank where the pines grew in a thick
wall down close to the water i saw a
great gap there was an indentation
in the bank opposite the end of the
delta which had never been made by
the water and there were the stumps
of several trees close by with the ax
marks weather-beaten as they were
still plain upon them but not a fallen
trunk remained in sight why they
had been cut down where they had
been taken to and why they had been
cut in this particular spot i could in no
wise imagine

  nor was this all just opposite the
up-stream end of the projection on the
south bank and about fifteen feet in
from the edge of the channel was a
bluff well in this low bluff which
was not over twenty feet high some-
one had caused a sort of grotto to be
hewed from the rocks in this grotto
was a wooden idol it had been carved
from blackest ebony was about eight
feet high had a great hooked beak for
a nose and showed a great ugly
mouth with the lips curled back from
teeth which had been made from the
inner surface of shells i almost
jumped when i looked at the eyes for
they were formed of green crystal
resembling emerald and were as bale-
ful in expression as those of a lynx
staring at one from the dark depths of
a cavern

  it was the bright golden sunlight
of course which caused those green
depths to sparkle so yet the effect was
most uncanny wherever one moved
in the arc before it the eyes of that
hideous monster seemed to follow-
and i could even imagine that there
was a hint of sardonic mirth in those
terrible orbs as the idol which was
squatted upon a carved dais sat there
with grimly folded arms and watched
me move about

  at the feet of the thing was a little
cone of human skulls four in number
and a spear a bow a quiver of ar-
rows and a shield made of hide these
by the appearance had been there a
long time and behind the idol lay
more weapons and more skulls these
had lain there for a much longer pe-
riod i judged than the others for
some of the quivers were rotten with
age

  so struck was i by these sights that
for a moment i forgot my mission
but presently i was startled by the
raucous screaming of a red-billed bird
below me and as it soared away over
the trees i crept close to the brink and
peered below here and there i saw
where steps had been hewn from the

rock and at a point about half-way
down the steep slope where the trees
were thick and on my side of the
falls i caught the gleam of a musket
barrel

  there was  time for indecision
i had guessed true the buccaneers
were coming to the falls now i must
either run or stay to see whatever was
about to happen having come thus
far i elected to stay

  the face of the little bluff ran sheer
to the brink of the falls this left a
flat beach about fifteen feet wide be-
tween it and the water if the big
chief and the buccaneers followed the
line of the steps after emerging from
the trees-and this seemed likely-i
reasoned that they would emerge on
this beach hence i had two choices
to hide behind the idol or mount the
bluff from its footslope to westward
a hump back of the grotto would hide
me from their view as they came up
and there were also thickets close to
the edge to shield me when they
reached the beach so i selected the
bluff and in a brace of shakes was hid-
ing behind the thickets a little to west-
ward of the idol and some ten feet
above it

chapter xvih

 jerry blunts cache

had not long to
wait before gentry
and the big chief
appeared they
made an unforget-
table picture as they
topped the rise-
the chief a golden-
skinned statue quite naked save for
his girdle and ornaments and gentry
all decked out with a yellow silk shirt
a bright red head scarf and a blue-
and-white polka-dotted sash around
his waist i have yet to look upon two
better specimens of physical develop-
ment the chief topped gentry by
half a head and gentry was a full six
inches over six feet in height the
big savage was also scarred about the
breast with bony features as devoid
of warmth as that of a grinning skull
yet of the two i had much rather
have faced the cannibal

  gentrys shirt was open at the neck
exposing a scarred and tattooed breast
that reminded me of joined shields
his sleeves were rolled up to the el-
bows showing his great forearms
with corded muscles as thick as a ships
hawser and now as he dashed the
sweat from his hammered features

and twisted his eyebrows up into
devils horns glaring quickly about
him the while i was sure that i had
never looked upon a more formidable
villain

  after one glance at the idol which
the chief saluted with a quick bend of
the knee both went to the rivers edge
and lay down for a deep drink dum-
phey horn two other sailors and the
two cannibals followed one another up
the steps a moment later and they
too hurried forward for a draught of
the sparkling water

  and now i was treated to an agree-
able surprise i had feared that the
roar of the falls would bother me in
hearing them speak but at the first
word this fear vanished with the
close growth of the trees on every
hand i found that the acoustics were
such that i heard them easily

  ah  growled gentry standing up
and resting his great right hand on the
butt of a silver-mounted pistol in his
sash thats better nor brandy after
all how about it old marble face
and he looked at the chief and rubbed
his belly with a little smile

  the chief did not return the smile
though he grunted huh and
nodded then with a look of fierce
pride he pointed at the statue or idol
thence back to the river and again at
the end of the delta kneeling down
he drew something in the sand crossed
his wrists before him made a motion
as though binding them pointed again
at the stream made a sweeping mo-
tion with his arm toward the falls and
then pointed once more at the up-
stream prow of the delta then he
stood back and folded his arms dra-
matically

  whats he powwowing about
asked dumphey coming up

  why said gentry who had been
nodding understanding through the
chiefs demonstration heres the way
of it i take it when theyre to pick
a chief they comes here well as near
as i can make out they ups and puts
him in a canoe up above there and
him no paddle arms tied too mind
you if this here ebony god is feelin
right about the liver-which is hard to
figger if them eyes means anything
-why that canoe goes smack against
them rocks in the middle there and
stays if not-why over the falls

  the others now came up and gen-
try must needs repeat the story to
them

  ah exclaimed a seaman named
blake a squat hairy tar with a cast


the frontier

in one eye i wouldnt want to take
that risk myself not i

  nor i growled dumphey that
eye in that there figgerhead a-lookin
on too brrr it fair gives me the
creeps a-lookin at it

  well at that though said blake
whats all that got to do with what we
comes for  the mans one good eye
was burning in his head and he looked
all round about him eagerly wheres
that blunt is what i wants to know
stow that gentry snapped
who are you tom blake shovin
yourself forward so brash maybe
you was wishin to fall foul of me by
the flying dutchman i well if you

  avast there capn blake cried
taking a fearful step backward i

was ony askin-

  well then gentry cut in in softer
tones thats fair enough but you
see here now old marble face comes
first dyhear you didnt want to
fight no more lest it was forced on
you you had your bellyfull the lot
of you cept ony dumphey here as
ive made mate and youre expecting
these cannibals to do the bulk of your
fightin while you gets the blunt
thats about it isnt it

  well thats one way of puttin it
blake admitted grudgingly but you
cant deny sir them swabs had the
devils luck

  the devils pluck id call it
snorted gentry ah a fine lot you
were to sail under the jolly roger
but here-theres old marble face a-
standin there a-waitin and thinkin
im explaining what he did now all
of you nod like you understand and
make a powwow over him lively
now

  all turned then toward the waiting
chief who still stood with his arms
folded and by signs and vigorous
nods with many fearful glances at the
boiling stream they hailed him as the
bravest of the brave

  and what now sir  said blake as
the big chief visibly flattered stooped
for the musket he had placed upon the
sands

  well wait till he gets through
said gentry see them weppings
afore that idol them i take it was
the offerings he made afore taking that
ride now i guess from what he
tries to tell me below hes going to
make another

  they all stood quiet as the chief
stepped forward toward the idol
pausing before it he looked at the
tnusket then quickly unslung a quiver

and bow from his back then after
a moments hesitation he knelt facing
the idol and holding the bow and
the quiver of arrows up on his out-
stretched palms began a weird chant

 huh grunted blake makin
his chice atween the arrows and that
gun for an offering reminds me of an
ole skinflint i saw once in church
youdve died laughing and he
chuckled now at thought of it why
that man-

  but at this the chief looked round

he knelt facing the idol

with a frown and gentry spoke up
angrily

 avast there tom blake he
roared now i tells you fair one
more slip in that jaw tackle afore this
is over and ill throw you over the
falls make a mock of a man at his
worship would you especially this
man as will do our fightin for us  by
the flying dutchman no kneel
down now every man jack of you
what for growled blake

  what for to show him we aint
a-makin fun o him thats what for
well all right said blake i
guess it wont hurt us

  and he with the others-save one
man-kneeled with gentry on the
ground

onder of won-
ders the exception
was horn-a griz-
zled old drunken
seaman with his
face badly marked
by gunpowder brass
ear-rings dangling
beside his leathery neck and his cheek
bulging with tobacco now he spat
into the dirt shifted from one leg to
the other and gave a hitch at his
broad leather belt

  capn said he theres things i
draw the line at and this is one
taint pious

  pious cried gentry who said
it was  it dont mean a thing

  does to me said horn stubbornly
i didnt say nothin when that poor
swab was a-given back for duck soup
-though it give me a turn i aint for-
got-but this here stops me dead it
do kneel to a wooden idol  not me
it aint right and it aint pious and
afore i do it may i be keel-hauled
well then said gentry with un-
expected gentleness turn your back
then i aint for forcin a mans hand
in matters o religion

  thankee sir said horn turning
about but mark my words capn
i read about that once in the bible and
if good comes of it may i be scuttled
but gentry waved his hand angrily
and the chief facing the idol once
more continued his chant then fin-
ishing abruptly he laid his bow and
arrows at the feet of the image picked
up his musket and faced about

  huh he grunted

  which i suppose means thankee
said gentry arising now lads
since thats over ill tell you what
jerry did with the treasure saying
which he reached into his shirt and
pulled out a packet

  all the buccaneers crowded round
him eagerly as he pulled out a sheet
of heavy parchment the chief and
his two henchman also pressed for-
ward so that all were placed in a close
group not far from the rivers edge

  you see that paper said gentry
holding it out

  aye by thunder cried blake
why theres the falls as pretty as a
pitcher sure enough drawed out by
a smart man that were

  ah growled dumphey but you
are right there smart he was when
i sailed with him was jerry blunt-a
smart man and no mistake

  well said gentry to the man
horn you take it and read what it
says below there

why said horn with a shame-
faced grimace thats hand of write
thought you said you could read
cried gentry leastways you said
you read in the bible

  that were print said horn
well then said gentry any of
the others you wanted to see where
the treasure is you did so one of you
read it out

  neither blake nor the remaining
seaman could read it appeared and
the devils caldron



though the new mate dumphey
reached for the paper gentry waved
his hand

  you can read it out to em later if
you doubts said he heres the
way of it men and you can see it in
a minute what do you suppose them
trees was cut down for

  why ive been a-wondering about
that right smart said blake	

  well you might said gentry
but they was cut down for a dam
thats what cant you see now how
he had em laid from that niche in the
bank he had dug over to the upper
end there of that projection why
it was easy as easy only a ten foot
stretch you see the logs overlapped
water pushed em tight dirt and rocks
did the rest so all of it was shunted
-the water i mean-over into this
south channel

  and the treasure cried horn

  why wheres your head man
under the falls to be sure ah by the
flying dutchman but that were a
prime dodge once the water is
stopped he had them niggers pick out
a cavern down below and there he
stowed the blunt that being done
why they knocked down the dam-
and theres your treasure hidden till
another dam is built its all told
there in that part of the chart  cuts
away

  but when do we get at it cried
blake couldnt we let old marble
face here hold em in the cave whiles
we lifts this blunt

  hold em roared gentry now
you see here tom blake youre goin
to help out fightin for this blunt or
youll go to the yard arm now mark
me on that hold em in youve
had a sample o that dutchmans guts
-aye and the rest of em aint much
behind him you wont hold em
moren a day or so ill gamble and
then with them prowlin around this
island in a game o hide and seek i
reckon theyd give an account of them-
selves

  well i aint said i wouldnt fight
have i  growled blake i was ony
a-suggestin like

  you can keep your suggestions for
the focsle my lad said gentry
i tell you flat ive a sweat on me now
expecting each minute to hear the guns
a-going down below if that dutchman
were to come chargin out again i
wouldnt bet two coppers but what he
routed the lot of them no sir its
him who attacks as has the bulge and
only for you wantin to see for your-

selves and old marble face wanting
to salve this wooden figgerhead here
probably for to change his luck wed
have attacked this very day

  and what will we do with em-
them whats left i mean said horn

  do with em  cried gentry
leave em to old hi-cock-a-iorum
here thats what

  perhaps it was my involuntary shud-
der perhaps it was my carelessness
but at all events a little rock was dis-
lodged at this juncture and tumbled
down from my little precipice to the
ground below striking another rock
there it glanced and bounded out to-
ward the group

  only two of them turned on the in-
stant but blake gave a startled cry
and i knew that they would be atop
that bluff in another minute so i
pushed my musket forward and fired
without pausing to do more than throw
the gun to my shoulder

  i had taken no aim but blake
pitched forward on his face while the
chief bellowed with rage and pain
throwing up an arm from which the
blood was streaming in the same
breath i was on my feet and running
like a deer to southward

  several things favored me or i
would never have lived to tell the nar-
rative the very suddenness of the
shot had sent them plunging in all di-
rections for they doubtless thought
during one horrid moment that they
had been ambuscaded again before
they could realize that i was alone i
was in flight furthermore they had
the bluff to mount and by the time the
first shot was fired at me i was dodg-
ing in and out among the pines along
the eastern edge of the plateau sev-
eral bullets whistled perilously close
but these only served to increase my
speed and as they had all been drink-
ing heavily i had soon left them in the
lurch

chapter xix

barnaby revolts

eeling assured of
this at last i
whipped into the
brush for a brief
breathing spell
but i had been ly-
ing there but a mo-
ment or two it
seemed to me when i heard the thump
of heavy feet just above me and
someone breasting a thicket i also

heard gentrys voice hailing in the dis-
tance

  instantly alert i lay as quiet as a
mouse my heart pounding heavily
against my ribs it was impossible for
me to see through the growth immedi-
ately before me and it was from that
direction that the sounds had come
my only hope i reasoned lay in locat-
ing my enemys exact position before
jumping up for if i moved and ho
saw me first there would be little
doubt about the outcome

  so for a moment there was an abso-
lute quiet in the forest about us save
for the thrumming of the insects and
the sough of the leaves in the gentle
breeze my enemy had paused on his
own account and i knew he must be
listening as intently as i

  the silence was broken by another
hail from gentry it came to me
faintly and eerily as though it were
a ghostly echo from the stark heights
of london tower baking there in
the glaring sunlight to northward

  horn came the hail come
about barnaby and let him go
then after a pause you cant find
him in that jungle you swab all
hands back to lay aboard ship

  not a sound came from the man
who had pursued me that is in an-
swer to gentrys hail but suddenly 
heard a stealthy movement near me
and horn panting heavily to regain
his breath

  a second later and i would have
been aiming toward him but he spoke
in a guarded husky whisper

  jack he called imploringly
mister jack i knows you must be
here someeres i seed you duck 
did im done with them swabs jack
if i can go back to my dooty

  there was no time to dilly-dally
gentry might decide to follow after
him at any minute

  horn i said if youre honest in
this face north with hands up quick
now-i am aiming at you

  this was not literally true since i
could not see him and was aiming only
at the place where i judged him to be
standing but he spoke up at once say-
ing aye aye sir and i stepped
out he was standing some twenty
feet away faced to the north with his
hands aloft and his musket on the
ground beside him

  i had no sooner picked up his mus-
ket than jack he cried huskily
wheeling about you take a look at
my deadlights son ah but i do
be a sick man at heart jack to think


the frontier

as i ever had truck with the likes o
them a man must live jack and
there didnt seem to be no hope and
i deserted but jack my stummick
do be full up o them by thunder
did you see em there a-kneelin to
that heathen idol

  in one sense i was tempted to laugh
aloud this rum-soaked old sailor
with bleary powder-marked features
was certainly one of the last men on
earth i thought to retain any relig-
ious scruples but one never can tell
exactly what queer kinks he will en-
counter in the minds of men i have
found and it was patent that old
barnaby was in deadly earnest

  i saw them i said and now
barnaby heres your gun

 he seized my hand then in his
gnarled old horny fist-the palm was
as rough as a file-and two big tears
rolled down his cheeks

  by thunder boy you wont regret
that he cricd hoarsely no you
wont ill count it a pleasure a priv-
ilege by thunder to finish my days

with true seamen i-

  never mind that barnaby i in-
terrupted weve got to budge
right you are sir he returned
quickly dashing his hand across his
eyes

  just then another hail came from
gentry

  jack said horn well fool him
maybe forthwith he whipped out
his pistol and fired a shot into the air
there he continued maybe hell
think i got it

  two or three more hails came ring-
ing across the plateau but we did not
wait longer taking up a dog trot to-
ward the downward trail

  if they look around for me horn
panted why thatll delay them that
much longer gettin back and weve
got to get there first for theyll be on
us sure as shootin after this

 on the way horn told me that
gentry and dumphey had even gone
ashore in cannibal cove while the can-
nibals were dancing around the fire at
their feast he had dared to tell gen-
try then that no good would come of
it he said and reckoning up he said
that blakes death and his own depar-
ture had reduced roaring bills crew
to ten able men only two of the
wounded he said were left alive
aboard the ship

  we did not encounter any of the
cannibals scouting in the woods be-
hind our knoll and reached the tunnel
at about half past four we had not

heard a single shot during the trip

  you may well imagine the welcome
i received when i stepped into the
cave horn on the other hand com-
ing in sheepishly behind me was
greeted with a frown from killifer
and a prolonged stare from the judge
but i acted as spokesman for him

  veil said the skipper finally i
take him back

  ah cried horn fervently ill
prove i can be trusted this time
goot said the skipper ve see
pooty soon anyvay

  the location of the treasure aroused
some discussion the judge suggesting
that we might gain by moving out that
night and taking position at the falls
where we could keep the buccaneers
from working at the necessary dam
but the skipper shook his head from
my description he judged that we could
not fortify the place so well as the
cave we would have at least three
sides to guard where here we had but
one and we could accomplish as much
by sorties with the cave as a base

  anyvay he said deres a lot of
daylight yet und he may attack dis
afternoon

  we had not long to wait before we
received proof of this my comrades
had not been molested during the af-
ternoon save for an occasional arrow
whizzing into the cavern and during
my absence the skipper had ordered a
further strengthening of the barricade
the usagos leather shields with their
circular wooden frames had been
placed on top and banked with dirt
behind them leaving semi-loop-holes
or notches for us to shoot through
and when the afternoon shadow from
the bluff had crept well down the slope
i looked through one of the apertures
and saw the gig returning both gen-
try and the cannibal chief were bawl-
ing orders across the water to ship and
beach the furious tones told a plain
story

chapter xx

 cannon ball and arrow

 grunted the
kipper now
jines der fun

he took his pipe
ith its porcelain
owl from his
louth polished it
carefully and laid
it lovingly in a far corner

  i dont vant it shoult be proken
he said to my uncle then he looked

around here is enuff logs und dirt
to holt der shot dis time from dem
cannon i tink he said efery
man to a port-hole now mr pellew
you und de chudge und odonnell to
de left-jess jack killifer und
horn de right so spread out und
leave room for dese other fellows in
between so i take de middle und
keep down now till i gifs de vord

  we were shortly in position as he
wanted us each white man with a cut-
lass stuck into the sand beside him
and the extra muskets leaning against
the inner side of the barricade all
loaded and ready to hand our pistols
were thrust into our belts and each
held a musket firmly gripped-and
loaded by the captains direction with
bird shot as well as musket balls the
usagos meantime had stuck their
two-handed swords and spears before
them in the sand and stood ready with
bows and arrows

  capn cried gunderson from the
corner prop me up sir and gimme a
pistol i want a whack at them swabs
if they comes in

  at the skippers nod horn and i
placed the big square-faced seaman
with his back to the cavern wall and
left a pistol in his thick scarred hands
it was a heavy double-barrelled wea-
pon and he gazed upon it affection-
ately

  if i had any wish he said it
would be you leave that donovan-or
gentry he calls hisself-come through
ill blow his belly out through his
spine so help me

  horn and i would have run back to
our positions had the skipper not cau-
tioned us

  shteady he said no hurry
shteady and cool is vot do it my
poys and when we were in place
jack he said you keep vatch 
dot site und mr pellew  der left
so

  i was glad of the opportunity to
peer out for crouching there on one
knee was trying

  this time the ship was anchored a
little farther out but her broadside
was presented as before and i must
own that my spine prickled when i
noted the frowning muzzles of those
four long nines pointing directly at
me it is one thing to figure errors in
depth and dispersion on paper but
quite another to consider the possi-
bilities when facing the guns

  however one thing was made im-
mediately plain only two men re-
mained aboard to touch them off for
the devils caldron



gentry dumphey and six others were
now pulling ashore in a gig all carry-
ing extra muskets gentry doubtless
had given over hopes of reducing our
barricade by cannon fire and intended
to use them only in hopes of a lucky
hit and to lend encouragement to the
cannibals

  the gig disappeared behind the trees
near the cannibals fire then a great
shout arose the savages began beat-
ing on kettle drums and here and
there i could see buccaneers and yell-
ing cannibals dodging into position
along the northern side of the fan-
shaped slope

  see any on der sout site asked
the skipper

  none i said and uncle george
also shook his head

  dey come from der norteast as
before said the captain shteady
now if dey starts ven der guns open
up dont be oxcited ve let dese
usagos shoot arrows so fast dey can
yoost so soon dey start but ve hold
our fire till dey is close in

  i glanced about me and noted the
aspect of my comrades all were
somewhat nervous nothing else could
have been expected but their mouths
were tight and their eyes blazed as
for the usagos-i might have laughed
under other circumstances their eyes
were popping they could not keep
still and they gave vent to little gut-
tural cries or whined like puppies or
spat into the sand and performed a
weird sort of shuffling dance with
their gums bared and their hands
working in short circles at their sides
the beating of the kettle drums and
the shouts below them had acted 
them like wine and it was impossible
to keep them from bobbing up to peer
over the barricade

  ten minutes or more dragged by in
this manner

  damn it said the judge why
dont they come

  then suddenly a whistle blew sharp
and clear the tomtoms took up a
frenzied tattoo and with a terrible
shout the horde of cannibals broke
from the trees and started swarming
up the slope

  at the same time we were greeted
with the crash of musketry and one
after the other three guns aboardship
thundered and their heavy missiles
came shrieking through the air

  the first cannon ball struck fair in
the center of the breastworks but be-
low the line of shields a great cloud
of dust was spanked aloft by the hit

while a shower of sand was thrown up
by another which landed just below us
on the slope the third shot whipped
through just above the barricade with
a wail like a lost soul it struck the
wall at the rear of the cave with a tre-
mendous crash knocking down a
shower of rock

  in the same space of time several
musket balls chugged into the logs be-
fore us and others ripped viciously
through the leather shields nor were
they without effect i heard the judge
cry out sharply while the usago be-
side me clapped a hand to his cheek
and brought it away streaming with
blood

  in that brief instant we might well
have lost the fight bedlam reigned
the reports of the long nines were re-
echoing back and forth between the
bluff and the ridge on blackbeards
boot the kettle drums were being
pounded by madmen and what with
the terrifying howls of the cannon
balls the vicious spat of the slugs
from the muskets and the bloodthirsty
yells from the cannibals we were in a
fair way toward being stampeded

  shteady roared the skipper
all hands up

  suddenly i was as cool as ice and
i think my shipmates were similarly
affected by the captains coolness the
cannibals were coming on in bounds
up that steep slope the buccaneers
fired again and again from the edge of

the rock came crashing down

the trees till their allies spread out
across their line of fire then they too
leaped out on their own account all
carrying cutlases and shouting wildly
but not a one of my shipmates fired
all waited for the word

  in the meantime our usagos were

not inactive they were firing arrows
into the pack with a rapidity that
amazed me they snatched an arrow
from the quiver before them fitted it
to the string drew it back till the head
touched the bow fired and reached
for another arrow all in one contin-
uous motion and their marksman-
ship was amazing too the cannibals
had not come twenty yards from the
trees when i saw one pluck at his
breast and fall and others were sent
kicking and howling to the ground as
they came on but still they contin-
ued to come a howling horde of
drunken devils with their gigantic
chief raging like a madman at their
head

hen when they
were a full half-
way up the slope
the skipper barked
the order to fire

  the effect of our
broadside could
not have leen bet-
tered at least five went down while
others struck by the scattering bird
shot screamed and faltered immedi-
ately we were pouring lead into them
from the remaining muskets each
man firing as fast as he could pick up
a gun and aim

  then to add to their confusion the
fourth cannon aboardship roared and
the ball struck fair in the midst of the
thickest part of their line not thirty
yards from the barricade at least
two must have been killed instantly
while several more were struck by fly-
ing rocks or blinded by the shower of
dirt

  this catastrophe must have taken
the heart out of a full third of them
screaming with fright they scattered
to right and left or started running for
their lives toward the trees

  when this happened some of the
foremost with the chief among them
were within five yards of us  lis fol-
lowers who had converged were
charging in behind strung out over
ten yards or more of ground and
just then johannsens rock came crash-
ing down bringing with it a deluge of
smaller pieces

 four-as we counted afterward-
were smashed flat under the slab
two or three more were knocked
down by smaller rocks but this with
the cannon shot fired into their backs
and a volley of arrows and pistol balls
sent another score howling back down
the slope


the frontier

  i had but a heart-beat in which to
realize this when the big chief and
eight or nine more were leaping up
the barricade upon us

  in spite of our previous luck our
fate in that instant hung perilously
near the wrong side of the scales
odonnell was writhing on the ground
with a spear through his breast two
of the usagos were dead the judge
had been wounded with a musket ball
in the left arm and while our en-
emies swarmed up the breastworks
gentry and his buccaneers were half-
way up the hill

  my heart as the saying goes had
turned to lead a second before we
had been firing behind cover now we
came to grips in a raging howling
hurly-burly of shots cries screams
and clashing steel with reinforcements
for the enemy coming up to make an
end of us

  had we fallen back had we wav-
ered an instant all would have been
lost but above all that infernal roar
came a desperate bellow from the
skipper which turned the tide

  charge em he yelled as the big
chief mounted the barricade and in-
stantly for all his weight he had
leaped upon the breastworks and
chopped down the nearest enemy

  this acted powerfully upon the
usagos who had abandoned their
bows and arrows for swords or spears
with a wild yell they bounded up after
the skipper and the rest of us with
pistols and cutlases were after them
on the instant

  the big chief hung poised above me
as i lunged his spear was drawn
liack for a thrust that would have
pierced me through and through my
pistol ball fired with the left hand
struck him full in the breast he
staggered but i fended his spear just
in time with my cutlas for with his
last spasm he lunged forward down
he came tumbling like a big bullock
and i used him for a step to mount
the barricade as i did so odonnell
staggered part way up fired a pistol
with his last gasp and struck the can-
nibal before me in the leg he
howled and pitched backward to the
ground horn scrambling up beside
me was knocked down by a brute with
a two-handed sword but a usago fin-
ished the cannibal with a ripping spear
thrust from below in the next heart-
beat four more went down-one with-
in the cavern two on the breastwork
one on the outside the only remain-
ing cannibal turned and ran for his life

  thunderstruck by this turn of
events three of the buccaneers also
turned and fled the others halted
uncertainly about thirty yards from
us gentry raved like a berserker be-
fore them with a pistol in one hand
and a cutlas in the other but he bel-
lowed in vain uncle george whipped
up his pistol and sent a ball whistling
through the side of gentrys yellow
silk shirt and the man behind him
spun crazily and pitched to the ground
all of the remaining buccaneers in-
cluding dumphey turned and flew for
the trees

  gentry paused a moment still shak-
ing his cutlas at us i will long re-
member that ugly distorted visage
with the bloody patch on one cheek
and the slash of a mouth set like the
jaws of a wolf trap

  ill get you yet he roared sud-
denly ill feed every man jack of
you to these niggers if i have to stay
here a year

  shifting quickly to dodge a spear
thrown by one of the ufcagos he
lifted his pistol and fired both barrels
quick as winking and uncle george
grunted and fell back against the
skipper then gentry turned and ran
back down the hill we were forced
to let him go in safety for my uncles
shot had been our last and he was
gone before we could reload

  quite out of hand for the moment
our usagos now ran out and fell upon
the wounded cannibals they had ex-
pected no quarter and they gave none
of the twenty-three who had fallen
near the barricade not one was left
alive for more than a minute after
gentry ran

  meanwhile i ran to my uncle i
found that the pistol ball had cut
through his left breast muscles and out
under the arm pit he had also been
gashed in the right side with a spear
and was bleeding from another cut in
the calf of his left leg his wounds
were not necessarily fatal i could see
but he was very pale and no longer to
be counted on as a combatant the
judge was also painfully wounded for
the second time the bullet had passed
clean through the biceps of his left
arm barely missing the bone and
though he insisted on helping uncle
george back behind the breastworks
he fainted dead away as soon as we
had set my uncle down

  nor was this all killifers old
wound had reopened and he had suf-
fered another gash in the left shoul-
der odonnell was stone dead as

were two of the usagos a third
usago with his skull split lingered
for some hours but never recovered
consciousness three of them had
minor wounds but one had been so
severely wounded in the left arm that
we feared amputation would be nec-
essary

  i had expected to see horn lying
stiff as well as odonnell but here i
was agreeably surprised i found him
sitting up behind the barricade with
blood flowing from a scalp wound but
no more than a little dazed a dash
of water and a drink of brandy quickly
brought him round again he had
fended off the cannibals blow with his
cutlas he said and so only received a
glancing crack probably with the flat
side of the blade

  gunderson who declared with sav-
age satisfaction that he had shot at
least one cannibal from his comer and
johannsen who hobbled down soon
afterward from the cliff to be greeted
with hearty cheers had also escaped
without further injuries but there
now remained only the skipper horn
myself and six of the usagos who
could le counted on as fit combatants

chapter xxi

barnaby takes a citance

s a matter of pre-
caution the skipper
horn and i re-
loaded all the fire-
arms while the
usagos busied
themselves caring
for the wounded
but we were not attacked again that
afternoon the buccaneers and the
cannibals remained out of sight lie-
hind the trees on the beach at the north
side of the opening and were doubtless
busy enough as the skipper declared
picking the bird shot from their hides

  however our situation was now ex-
tremely serious the morrow was
coming and even the skipper agreed
that we would be hard put to it to
withstand another attack so while
the dusk fell and the bats came down
in a great swarm from their burrows
in execution knob grinning hide-
ously down at the dead as they flew
slothfully toward the palms we held
a grim council

  there was one hope we were
agreed and this lay in the possible de-
parture of the cannibals their chief
was dead nothing but disaster had be-
fallen them since they came to the
island moreover there was the can-
non shot which had been fired into
their backs we were fairly certain
that this had been the result of an ac-
cident or carelessness but it remained
to be seen whether or not gentry
would be able to explain it to the sav-
ages

  if he can explain it said my
uncle therell be a serious how-do-
you-do and no mistake though one
things plain we can count on these
usagos ill gamble to the last man

  this was plain enough indeed they
had sobbed like children over their
dead but pointing to them and again
at the woods they signified by sweep-
ing their hands across their throats
and holding up their fingers that they
hoped to get at least ten of the canni-
bals for each one

  veil said the skipper at last ve
cant mofe our wounded dots plain
if dey gome again ve fight dots all
so now i shtart to gif dese fellows in-
structions how to use dese muskets
jess

  now up to this time horn had said
very little but now he spoke up

  capn said he ive a word to
say sir by your leave

  vat iss it said the skipper

  why said horn heres the way
of it i take it i see fires down there
and theyve got liquor them canni-
bals i mean its my opinion they
wont be hasty to leave sir while thats
available-not them anyway which-
ever way you take it what do we gain
by a-waitin to see which way the
wind blows nothin as i can see
so id like to try somethin of my
own

   veil lets hear it

  see down there  said horn point-
ing two fires one is the canni-
bals and theres most of gentrys
swabs around the other ill gamble
now there aint nothin theyd stop
at so what i would do is this lemme
sneak around down there they
havent seen me here for i was down
behind the breastwork afore gentry
could get a look at me i take it they
think maybe jack plugged me this af-
ternoon well this here scalpll bear
it out and if i can make out to get
aboard that ship theyll never get her
again

  the skipper answered not a word
for several seconds

  capn said horn leaning for-
ward in his earnestness i know what
youre a-thinkin of i know i de-
serted once who knows better

the devils caldron

but look what i shows this very day
now i tell you itll be easier than you
think if theres ony two or three left
aboard ill borry the gig from gen-
try to get aboard sos i can dress my
head dysee and them aboard--
they wont suspect me-and then-
he made a suggestive movement with
his knife

  still the skipper held silence study-
ing the face of the seaman intently

  its the best chance we has horn
urged and see here sir let jack
work his way down with me we can
take a look at the lay o the land to-
gether and if it aint right why we
can come back

  for my own part i was convinced
at once that the risk was preferable to
waiting for future events nor had i
any fear that horn was merely seek-
ing another chance to desert us i had
seen him defy gentry and had also
noted his fearlessness in the fray dur-
ing the afternoon

  i hope youll let us go captain
i said its only following your
own contentions nothing risked noth-
ing gained

  all right said the captain sud-
denly yo go-und gott go mitt
you

  we were soon ready and with a
hard grip of the hand all round horn
and i departed through the tunnel

y	this time it was
black as pitch and
we had some trou-
ble in rounding the
knoll and picking
our way to the
northeast through
the trees b u t
there was always the glare of the fires
on the beach to guide us and within
the hour we had picked our way round
in a wide detour and had come down
within sight of the smaller blaze to
northward crawling forward care-
fully we saw dumphey and three buc-
caneers growling in talk about this
blaze while the cannibals were ranged
round the larger fire a short distance
to southward

  one cannibal who stood with his
back to us was delivering some sort
of oration with many savage gestures
and almost immediately we received
an explanation of its import

  i wish the capn would shake a leg
with them muskets growled one buc-
caneer i tell you i aint much stom-
ach for this or that

 stomach  snorted dumphey



no i guess not youd run and leave
that blunt would you why man
think of it-youll be drunk as a lord
the rest of your life when we gets out
of this

  aye-if we do the man returned
what good is blunt to me if im dead
as bilge i tell you that shot in the
back didnt go down with these swabs
and small wonder

  well aint the old man got em
pacified  cried dumphey hear
there now hes coming and we
too heard the oarlocks in the darkness
between us and the dim lights of the
ship hell be here with them mus-
kets pretty quick my hearty the pi-
rate mate continued and then well
see whats what once they get their
hands on them and we teach em how
to use em-well youll be thankful
youre sailin undler a man as has
backbone and something more for a
head than a jellyfish by judas

  that may all be said another
with a bitter curse but i never see
such rotten luck on nary cruise ive
sailed but for that shot-yes even
with the rock a-tumblin down-why
theyd a had em

  well i couldnt help a hang fire
could i cried another man with
some truculence

  you mightve swiveled her
growled dumphey

  after she hung fire cried the
cannoneer why bowd i know she
might blow up or somethin not i
i touched a light to that there touch-
hole and when it didnt go off i was
done musta been a little wet chunk
there just enough to hold it back
and then bang she went

  aw one of his mates broke in
with an empty drunken laugh weve
overhauled them words a dozen times
whats done is done lets have an-
other go at the rum and leave whats
astern astern

  barnaby now edged nearer and
placed his mouth close to my ear

  jack he whispered so soon as i
see how manys with gentry im a-
goin if so be it my story wont
wash youll never let em torture me
jack  youll shoot straight as straight
my lad

  my heart sank at the prospect
barnaby i whispered in return
its too much to risk lets give em
a broadside and run for it

  no jack he replied firmly its
the biggest and best chance we got
why with no ship we might be here
years no boy im a-goin and i


the frontier

would it be askin too much if you
was to say a prayer for me 

  this i promised readily and within
a minute the gig beached gentry
summoned all hands to carry muskets
and the whole party came up into the
firelight with the arms they were
now seven in all

  jack whispered the old seaman
that there leaves but two aboard
im a-goin now if i takes the ship
mind im pullin back with the gig a
ways but not clear in ill be a-singin
when i comes then all you has to do
is slip down in the dark and swim out
to me

  and with no further words he arose
crept back a trifle emerged on the
beach and walked boldly forward into
the firelight

  who goes roared gentry whirl-
ing suddenly then as he recognized
horn why its barnaby he cried

  ah said barnaby a bit thickly
leaning on his musket i wouldnt a
found my way back save for these
fires not i where have i been sir
a-layin up atop o that plateau a
goodish while where that yonker
cracked me

  thats the way i figgered it said
dumphey

  and the more fool you was for not
cornin back when i called said gen-
try you remember me hailin you
dont you

  aye sir horn admitted but
blake were my messmate and i were
main set on scuttling that young swab
i were but here i be sir and all well
save for the crease he gave me and
now-whats happened sir

whats happened  gentry laughed
with a touch of bitterness in his tones
we tried to lay aboard em barnaby
and they give us a bastin thats what
no cried barnaby

  yes said gentry theres a

who goes roared gentry wheeling suddenly

score or more of these swabs of
buscas a-layin up there now and
he gave horn a brief outline of the
affray so now he continued
theres one or two here wants to cut
and run for it but thats not me by
the flying dutchman he shook his
great mallet-like fist in the air toward
the cavern i tell you he cried
well have that blunt now if i has to
haul the long nines ashore to do it
ive got these swabs pacified-partly
anyway-and you see now when i
gives em these guns once they know
how to use em-well youll see
here he clapped dumphey on the back
adding drink up now and well pro-
ceed with the ceremony of presenta-
tion here barnaby you need a
calker i shouldnt wonder

  i do and no mistake said barn-
aby downing his drink and capn
if you dont mind id like for to go
aboard a few minutes its to dress
up this head dysee

  all right barnaby gentry agreed
here lemnie look at your head first
barnaby slipped off the handker-
chief and gentry gave vent to an ex-
clamation of surprise he had noted
the usago dressing

  why by the flying dutchman
he cried whats all this black gum
whered you get that

  got it off a tree said barnaby
my head was that hot and i thought
it would cool it

  you thought eh snorted gentry
get yourself aboard ship for a lub-
ber barnaby lucky you are if you
havent poisoned yourself you tell
that nigger aboard to wash this stuff
off and youll find a jar of salve on
the cabin table but be back here with
the gig as soon as you get fixed ship-
shape mind

  aye aye sir said barnaby read-
justing his scarf

  oh yes said gentry looking to-
ward the cannibals fire i see their
keg is drained fetch a keg o brandy
barnaby

  aye aye sir said the old seaman
moving off toward the gig

  now during this talk i had scarcely
dared to breathe but when i saw
barnaby depart my heart seemed to
swell to twice its normal size so far
our mad venture had received the
blessing of providence

s soon as barn-
aby pushed off into
the darkness gen-
try summoned his
men and bearing
the muskets they
stepped over to the
buscas fire

  the cannibals falling silent rose up
from their haunches-many stagger-
ing as they did so-and grouped them-
selves behind the man whom i took to
be their temporary chieftain there
still were over thirty of them but sev-
eral of these were bearing minor
wounds

  at gentrys direction the muskets
were stacked before the new chief
then the pirate stood back placed his
right hand on his heart and waved his
left toward the guns with an eloquent
gesture

  the new cannibal leader had been
standing with his arms folded across
his mighty breast but even he forgot
his dignity at this and snatched up a
musket with a cry of delight his
men meanwhile fairly fell over one
another in their eagerness to handle
the new weapons in a minute they
were laughing shouting cocking the
pieces pulling triggers and dancing
round the buccaneers like frenzied
children

  you see said gentry when their
the devil s caldron



first exuberance had somewhat spent
itself they only about half under-
stood what the devil was hitting them
wait till they knows how to use them

  here the chief stepped up to gentry
pointed at the muzzle of his musket
and then at one of the buccaneers
powder horns

  they knows the way of it said
dumphey with a chuckle they
watched us loading

  right you are said gentry well
now ill not give them powder horns
-save the chief maybe-till morning
theyll be blowing themselves to jer-
icho but ill commence now with the
chief

  forthwith he summoned the savages
around him took the chiefs musket
and carefully loaded it for him point-
ing out each move with powder horn
shot and rammer he then handed
the piece to the cannibal motioned the
rest back a pace or two and showed
him how to aim at a nearby palm
tree which was outlined in the firelight

  had i dared i would have laughed
hysterically at the figure that cannibal
cut as he aimed he was the new
chief he dared not show his fear
openly yet he could not control the
trembling of his hands nor the twitch-
ing of his features gentry tried to
make him understand that he must
hold the piece tightly against his
shoulder to lessen the kick of the re-
coil but evidently he did not grasp the
import of it for when the gun roared
the butt smashed back against his
shoulder slipped struck his jaw and
almost knocked him off his feet
whereupon he dropped the gun
grabbed his bleeding jaw and glared
at gentry in mixed fear and rage

  if one man laughs said gentry
fiercely ill throw him to the sharks
shaking his head then he picked up
the gun loaded it and had one man
standing to one side attempt to pull
the gun away from his shoulder to il-
lustrate how firmly he held it then
lie fired hitting the tree and again
prepared the gun for the chief

  this time the cannibal got the hang
of it and a great cry of delight went
up as he fired and struck the tree on
his own account he puffed out his
chest and strutted in childish pride
over his exploit nor was he content
to allow the others to practice until he
had loaded and fired three more shots

  all this while not a sound had come
from the ship a good half hour went
by before i heard the sound of oar-
locks on the water

  at this juncture the cannibals and
the buccaneers were still grouped on
the north side of the large fire they
had formed a short line between the
larger group and the trees with a buc-
caneer as instructor for each new rifle-
man as they came up in turn as all
were side-on to me by now and i was
well out of the firelight i arose and
slipped quietly down to the beach

  i think that in the next half minute
or so what with the racing of my
heart and the chills running up and
down my spine i must have lived a
life time

  then when the gig came close in
and still not a sound from barnaby i
broke out with perspiration from every
pore he had said he would be sing-
ing it was so dark i could barely
make out the gig as a blotch somewhat
darker than the night itself and i
could not tell whether there was one
man in it or two had barnaby de-
serted after all and was this another
of the crew come to give gentry warn-
ing of my presence

  but still i lingered for at least i
had the beach to run upon and i
wanted to be absolutely sure before i
moved at all events i was deter-
mined to kill gentry before leaving
for he stood just to one side beside
the new cannibal leader laughing and
gesticulating and now and again offer-
ing the savage his flask he was a
fair target in the firelight and i felt
that i could not miss

  the gig came to shore not far from
me but still there was no sound from
the man or men aboard her then i
heard someone arise and clamber out
and in a brace of shakes a man was
walking toward the big fire i had
barely time to recognize him as barn-
aby as he stepped into the outer edge
of the firelight for suddenly he raised
the keg which he was carrying and
hurled it straight into the fire it had
no more than struck when barnaby
threw himself flat and the very earth
rocked with a tremendous explosion

chapter xxii

barnabys bomb

o	band of villains
was ever treated to
a more terrible sur-
prise the terrific
force of that ex-
plosion threw some
of the fagots as
far as our cavern
tossed one cannibal into the treetops

blew others into shreds and set those
who were not knocked down to run-
ning in all directions like so many jib-
bering idiots nor were the buccan-
eers in any better shape

  but barnaby had been on his feet
with the sound of the crash and was
running back to the gig shouting
jack jack at the top of his lungs
in a flash he had picked up a musket
and fired following it with another
and still another these muskets as he
told me later were loaded with slugs
and bird shot some of the stunned
survivors were struck even before they
could regain their knees and those
who had started toward the gig or the
canoes turned and flew back into the
trees

  by this time i was beside barnaby
a quick shove on the gig and we were
out into the darkness and laying to the
oars with a will only two shots fol-
lowed us and these were wide of the
mark

  easy all now said barnaby at
last when we were near the ship
were safe at last-and thats an
end of capn gentry i shouldnt won-
der

  barnaby i cried throwing an arm
around his shoulders i want you to
forgive me

  forgive you said barnaby and
what for

  ill tell you some time i cried
squeezing his shoulders in an ecstasy
did you have trouble in getting the
ship and bowd you ever con-
ceive-

  why he threw one hisself once
you remember barnaby cut in it
was when he said to fetch a keg of
brandy i thought of it a kegs a keg
in the dark i jist punched a wee hole
in her so the fire would hit her quick
dymind as for getting the ship-
i knocked out the nigger in the cabin
and tied him the same for jim on
deck and it was done then he
broke off as a fresh hullabaloo of cries
and shouts broke out on shore

  theyre getting into the canoes
said barnaby quick lad if theyre
a mind to tackle the ship wed best
man a long nine

  leaving the gig fast to the gang-
plank we ran on deck we had the
fear upon us that the fruits of victory
might be snatched from us in spite of
all

  seizing a megaphone i ran to the
ships side and sent a hail ringing over
the water toward the cavern


the frontier

  ahoy the cave i yelled we
liave the ship

  is dot you jack the answering
hail came back

  yes i yelled keep the pirates
away from the canoes

  ve be right down he replied and
never have i heard a more pleasant
sound

  but we need not have worried
finding the long nine loaded-for
they had never fully trusted the can-
nibals it appeared-we touched off one
in the direction of the dark splotch be-
low the remaining fire and the af right-
ed yells we heard told us the cannibals
had had more than enough they
made no attempt to get up sail but
paddled desperately-as we could tell
by the sounds-until they were well
clear of the ship and heading toward
the mouth of the bay we never saw
them again

  before they were out of earshot the
captain and four usagos came down
the slope on the run the savages
some twenty in number had taken
only three of the canoes and captain
van tassel seized the others seeing
this the only remaining buccaneers
left alive on shore four in number
came up and threw down their arms
begging for gods sake to be spared

  very well said the skipper i
could use hants or i vouldnt und
now vere is chentry und dot dum-
phey 

  dead sir one of the buccaneers
explained he said that the two had
been blown fairly to pieces by the blast
which killed seven of the savages and
wounded four more

  what a celebration we had that night
you may well imagine the usagos
and the four prisoners made litters
and we had the wounded brought
aboard ship where we were soon gath-
ered round a punch bowl poor barn-
aby was toasted so many times that he
finally fell overboard and would have
drowned but for two of the usagos

ell as it turned
out there were no
more shots fired in
anger on the island
being short-handed
we were a matter
of a week and more
in building the dam
at the falls and getting the treasure
but there it was sure enough not a
million pounds but over four hundred
thousand all told all safely stored in
a dry cavity dug out of the rock in
the line of the north falls the coins
were packed in a dozen mahogany
chests lxmnd round with studded
brass and had jerry blunt been killed
before he drew his chart they might
well have remained there until dooms-
day

  as for our prisoners-eight in all
counting the two wounded and the
two barnaby had knocked out aboard
ship-uncle george decided that they
were to be forgiven there had been
enough bloodshed he said nero the
remaining negro was but little better
than a child in intellect after all and
allen thompson and nutter were
never buccaneers at heart so for
their sakes all were spared

  once we had the treasure aboard
we stood out of drakes bay and away
for the usagos island the reception
we had would make another story but
it is sufficient to say that they made it
so pleasant for us in their nipa shacks
that we spent a full month with them
taking on stores and letting our
wounded convalesce

  they gave us many golden nuggets
as they had promised but when these
were assayed they proved to be full
of dross on the other hand we took
some fine pearls in trade for muskets
and other articles and later my uncles
ships made many trips to this island
and others in the vicinity to trade
meantime some ten of them desir-
ing to see the world agreed to ship
with us for the voyage home and soon
proved to be dependable seamen

 we made an uneventful voyage
home with the faithful hands berthed
aft for once as a mark of favor
uncle george took van tassel in as a
partner and sturdy johannsen now
sails the anthony wayne with kill-
ifer as mate even gunderson was
given a berth as coxswain while barn-
aby horn purchased a little inn on the
waterfront and married a widow who
keeps a firm hand on the parse strings

  of course i was glad to be home
again but the sea is in my blood and
though i shudder sometimes at
thought of the bats and the cannibals
round their fire i occasionally wish i
could lxi treading the deck of another
gallant ship and sailing over sun-kissed
seas to hunt for pirates loot on an-
other devils caldron

trail toll bridge charters

in the emigrant and wagon freight-
ing days of the west ranchers were
scattered along the main trails and
many of them who happened to le lo-
cated near the regular fords made con-
siderable money by building bridges
over the fords at high water usually
the streams were insignificant but in
the spring they often became deep
swift and formidable the territorial

by clarence e mulford

governments issued toll bridge charters
to anyone who asked for one and the
charters neglected to put any limit on
the fees to be levied which left the
matter of adjusting toll charges to the
builders of the bridges none of the
rough and temporary structures were
more than twenty yards long but the
tolls ran from  to  per
wagon

  one of the most famous was on the
trail crossing at green river wyo
and was owned by a mormon named
hickman who charged as much for its
use as he thought the traveler could
part with some of the emigrant
trains and freight outfits contained
many wagons and during the years
travel was at its height the tolls col-
lected amounted to no small sum

the waters of bowlegs
creek

by j e grinstead

  author of the scourge of the little c the master squatter etc

        the dry homestead on big bowlegs creek looked like a hopeless proposition until clell
        berry started to investigate the source of the stream-and then it became a lively one indeed

ll out called the
 foreman of the
 grading outfit as
 he stood on a little
 eminence over-
 looking the labor-
 ing teams in the
 long railroad cut

 instantly the trained mules stopped
in their tracks some with scrapers
half filled others with scrapers half
dumped and answered the welcome
call with a prolonged bray hur-
riedly the dust-covered sweating
teamsters unhitched their teams and
rushed away to the nearby construc-
tion camp there they washed their
faces in tepid water that had been
hauled from the nearest water-hole in
a wooden tank and prepared for the
noonday meal of beef and beans and
coffee

 it was only april but already the
sun was bearing down like august
hot puffs of dust-laden wind came up
from the great desert that lay to the
south the snow caps on distant
mountains aggravated the mind with-
out relieving the bodily discomfort of
the men who were building a railroad
through the heart of arizona to con-

nect two great transcontinental lines

  clell berry raised the water from
one of the battered basins on a long
bench and dashed it over his sun-
browned face and neck then when
he had dried his face and hands he
picked up a twisted piece of brush
and beat the white dust out of the folds
of his sweat-stained shirt before go-
ing into the mess tent by a hundred
little acts all of which clell seemed
trying to hide he showed that he was
with but not of the miscellaneous
crowd required for frontier railroad
building

  the fact was clell berry was a
gentleman not by special training for
the part not because of his lineage-
though it was good enough-but nat-
urally born a gentleman a man who
even when he fought and he some-
times had to fight did it in a gentle-
manly fair clean manner

  clell was nearly six feet broad of
shoulder and his sober gray eyes
ooked out straight from beneath heavy
sandy brows a thatch of crispy red-
dish brown hair lightened by alkali
dust and the lack of a barbers atten-
tion covered a well shaped head the
sun and dust and wind together with

a naturally good-humored disposition
had put little nests of permanent
wrinkles at the corners of his eyes
just now there was a look of serious-
ness in clells gray eyes as he avoided
the jam and rush of men going into
the tent and waited quietly until he
could enter like the gentleman he was

  the reason for the serious look was
that clell was about to undertake an
adventure of which he could see only
the beginning and couldnt even guess
the end he was quitting the con-
struction company for two reasons
one was that if he stayed on the job
he would have to whip buck spradley
that indeed would have been a
rather pleasant task if it had been
merely a matter between him and
spradley for buck needed a trimming
but mr spradley owned three teams
which he worked on the grade hiring
his own teamsters clell knew theyd
gang on him and he also knew he
wasnt rough enough for the other
men to take his part

  the main reason for his quitting
however was that he had been work-
ing steadily on the job for more than
a year it was a dogs life to him and
hed had enough besides that he had


the waters of bowlegs creek



been thinking people would come
in with the railroad they would
have to eat a few irrigated acres of
land would be a fortune and he was
going to look for land and water that
could be gotten together he would
need no engineer to tell him that water
would run down-hill he was an en-
gineer himself that was what he
had come west for he had found
that engineers like officers in an army
were fairly plentiful but privates
were always in demand so he had
worked in rock cuts driven teams on
grade work and served a general ap-
prenticeship at railroad building now
that he had learned the trade he was
quitting to try something else

  gell wasnt the kind of fellow that
would throw down his tools and quit
in the middle of the day he was
twenty-eight and thoughtful for his
age he always wanted to be fair
the eight-hour day hadnt been born
at that time so it was almost dark
when the days work done clell
berry went to the foremans tent to
get his time

  as clell entered the tent he met a
man coming out the stranger was a
tall slender sharp-featured man
wearing a long-tailed coat he greeted
clell with a nod as they met and
passed on a few minutes later when
clell came out placing his pay check
in his pocket he saw the stranger
sitting on a boulder a little way from
the tent

  id like to talk to you a minute
pardner said the man and motioned
to a seat on the stone by his side

  clell had never become fully ac-
customed to the western custom of
being perfectly at home with stran-
gers he knew there were men who
followed the construction camps for
the purpose of gambling with the men
this man was clad very much like an
itinerant gambler but he hadnt the
right expression in his face

  quitting the outfit asked the
stranger as clell took the proffered
seat

  yes

  dont blame you its pretty rough
going back to civilization

  no thought id just stick around
and help civilize this country replied
clell

  oh i see joining up with the
rangers i reckon

  wrong again laughed clell
im no fighting man fact is im
still a little bit afraid of the west
im going to look for some land that
i can put water on and grow things

for all these new people to eat i have

an idea-

and its a good one too inter-
rupted the stranger i wanted to do

that but-

  the man coughed and they sat in
silence for a full minute

  marshall is my name-john mar-
shall he then went on im up
against it hard and i want to talk to
a man that can understand things i
believe you are that kind and i want
to tell you my troubles it wont hurt
you and maybe itll help me

  go ahead nodded clell my
names clell berry and i have noth-
ing to do until morning then im
going down to badger hole at the
end of the track draw my pay and
look about a bit

ont be a long
story marshall
answered a year
ago the doctors told
me to get a wagon
and team come out
to this dry coun-
try and rough it
i did and i seemed to be getting bet-
ter but i found out that a man cant
keep traveling about without money
i got the same idea about farming by
irrigation that you have i found the
place too and could have bought the
claim for a song but by that time i
couldnt sing a note i was broke
and looking for something that i could
do to eat i came down here think-
ing i might work my team a while on
the grade but its no go i began to
cough when i got in a mile of this
dust then i gave up decided to sell
my wagon and team for enough to
take me back to the old home where
i can at least be buried like a chris-
tion

  the man stopped and hung his head
in a despondent manner

  did you sell your team asked
clell

  no thats what i was doing in
the foremans tent he said the out-
fit wouldnt buy horses at any price
because they couldnt stand the work
if i had mules he might buy them
the wagon he wouldnt have
thats hard luck commented
clell in a sympathetic tone

  yes ive got a good outfit the
horses are missouri stock been out
here a year and are acclimated
theyre only six years old and the
wagon was new when i started a
fellow that runs some teams on this
job names spradley offered me

  seventy five dollars for the two horses
if i could get rid of the wagon id
take it but that wouldnt get me back
to phoenix by stage and buy me a
ticket home to say nothing of any-
thing to eat

  qell pondered the problem a minute
before he spoke

  if i had enough money id buy
your outfit he said then i might
raise enough but thered be none left
for a grub-stake

  it wouldnt take much to buy it
said marshall with a gleam of hope
in his sunken eyes you could go
up on little bowlegs then and get
that claim i told you about theres
about a hundred acres that can be put
under water and theres an ocean of
water in little bowlegs plenty of
good pasture land adjoining it and
nobody would ever crowd in because
theres no more farm land on the
creek just the place youre looking
for i wouldnt tell you but i cant
have it myself come go down to my
camp and look at the outfit and
marshall rose from his seat on the
boulder

  clell joined him and they walked
away together the stranger had de-
scribed the very thing that clell had
been dreaming of for months he
had more than enough money to buy
the outfit at a reasonable fair price
but not enough to do that and have
any operating capital left there
must be money to pay the shiftless
squatter something for the claim and
to go on until a crop could be raised
true he might grind this poor sick
broken-hearted wanderer down buy
his team for a pittance and get by
that way he knew that was one way
men got rich in this world but his
decent character revolted at the
thought

  as they walked away through the
camp a man got up from behind a
great boulder within twenty feet of
where they had been sitting and went
into the foremans tent it was buck
spradley

  a quarter of a mile from the con-
struction camp they came to mar-
shalls wagon and the two great raw-
boned bay horses clell looked the
horses over the best he could in the
fading light caught the spokes of a
wagon wheel and shook it to see how
badly the thimbles were worn and
then sat down on the wagon tongue
and lit his pipe a scheme was hatch-
ing in his mind but he wanted mar-
shall to talk more before he decided
on it


the frontier

  hasnt the climate done you any
good he asked between puffs at his
pipe

  as long as i could stay up in the
foothills like the bowlegs country i
seemed to mend but as soon as i come
down where the alkali dust is its all
off

  wouldnt you like to go back up
there 

  id rather le there than anywhere
on earth but i cant live on climate
and scenery buy my outfit at your
own price then go up there and
make a fortune id rather have that
little irrigated farm than to have any
mining proposition in the territory
id like to try a lot of things on it that
i learned in my four years in college
botany horticulture and agriculture
were hobbies of mine

  clell smoked in silence buying
horses from strangers in arizona at
that time was a doubtful enterprise
they might be good horses but the
buyer might also be called on by a
party of enraged citizens who knew
but one remedy for horse stealing and
carried it with them coiled at a sad-
dle horn marshall didnt look like a
thief nor did he talk like a receiver
of stolen goods still clell was cau-
tious

  i wont buy your team he said
at last i-

  oh for pity sake man cried
marshall with almost a sob in his
voice ill take any price you say

i	cant work and i dont want to
starve this west they tell about is
a great place and the people are all
right the proportion of good and
bad is about the same as in other
places-except in railroad camps-
but the west is too busy to take care
of cripples its a fight out here a
real he-mans job

  oh i dont know ive seen some
cripples make a pretty good fight in
my time using your head in a fight
cuts a good deal of ice sometimes
im going to make a proposition to
you by which i cant loose and you
can eat youll know im all right
or i wouldnt make the offer and ill
know youre game if you take me up
on it

  good enough lets have it

  ill go up to the bunk tent get my
dunnage and put it in your wagon
then well get a little sleep about
four oclock while its cool well head
out for badger hole when we get
there ill draw my money grubstake
the outfit against your wagon and
team and well prospect little bow-

  legs together share and share alike
thats fair

 more than i ever hoped for
cried marshall grasping clells hand
i didnt want to be a quitter with
a partner like you ill stick it out and
get well yet

  so were friendships made in the old
west between men driven together by
hard necessity they might appar-
ently have little in common but such
friendships often lasted until death
many a time men have stood with a
dead partner at their feet fighting on
more to avenge the death of a friend
than to protect themselves such be-
came the friendship between these two
men

  it was forty miles from the con-
struction camp to the claim on little
bowlegs twenty-five miles from the
camp to the end of the track at
badger hole and forty miles from
badger hole to the little bowlegs
country thus making an isosceles
triangle with a twenty-five mile base
and the claim on little bowlegs at the
apex

               hree days later
               the wagon well
               stocked with sup-
               plies and grain for
               the team the part-
               ners topped a rise
               and marshall who
               was driving stop-
               ped

  yonder said he is bowlegs
creek there are two of them big
bowlegs and little bowlegs big
bowlegs is dry except when it rains
which isnt often little bowlegs has
a flood of water from head springs
all the time you see that the two
streams head almost together curve
out like a parenthesis and come to-
gether again it looks like a bow-
legged giant lying on his back his
head in the mountains his feet to-
gether in the edge of the plain and a
ridge of foothills between his knees
thats what the creeks took their
name from this trail crosses just
below where the two creeks come to-
gether half a mile below that point
the water sinks into the sand and dis-
appears below that bowlegs is a
dry gorge except when theres a
waterspout and then its a terror
looks quiet and peaceful up there
commented clell

  yes only the one squatter in all
that country far as i know and hes
anxious to get away theres no water
between here and the crossing on

bowlegs so weve got to make it there
tonight and marshall urged the team
on

  peaceful oh yes bowlegs looked
peaceful enough but one old-timer
said yep you kin grow crops awful
quick on this arizony land if you put
water on it plumb stonishing but
more stonishinger how quick men kin
raise hell on it-without no water
a-tall

  it was quite dark when winding
through the thick timber that grew
along the banks of bowlegs creek the
partners heard the welcome music of
the gurgling rushing stream

  hullo said marshall theres
a camp-fire just tins side of the creek
wonder whats up now 

  they made camp at a little distance
from the other and started a fire
pretty soon the other wayfarer came
over to their camp

  hello fiddler glad to see you
cried the visitor and extending his
hand to marsliall

 why why-how are you mr
mosby returned marshall grasping
his hand make yourself comfort-
able and well have some supper
pretty soon this is my partner mr
berry

  mosby acknowledged the introduc-
tion

  much obliged but i done et he
said id like to hear you fiddle some
after supper though

  marshall and clell went on with
their cooking but clell was wondering
just a little about this acquaintance of
marshalls in a country where there
was supposed to be but one man
marshall was doing some thinking
himself he was wondering how the
owner of that coveted claim in little
bowlegs came to be camping here be-
low the forks and presently he asked
the question

  oh said mosby as he squatted
on his heels and smoked his old pipe
i done sold out my claim on little
bowlegs made the trade yesterday

  to whom  asked marshall with a
note of disappointment in his voice

  fellow named spradley said hed
been running some teams on the new
railroad traded me a pretty good
mule to match the one i had and
lowed i could get work down there

  im sorry said marshall we
were on our way up to give you a
trade for that claim

  shucks you dont want that lit-
tle old place i sting that feller
spradley good when i traded it to
him theys ony a hundred acres of
the waters of bowlegs creek



farm land sides that theys a trick
in it that i didnt tell you it lays
pretty there in the bend and looks
like movin about four shovels of dirt
would put water all over it and it
would just about

  whats the trick then 

  gravel subsoil and cracks in the
rocks underneath that lets the water
all out and mosby went on to tell
the faults of a property he had sold
as men often do but unlike many
others he was telling the truth

 is there any other farm land
farther up bowlegs asked clell

 not on little bowlegs there
aint a patch of dirt that a dog could
bed on from my old place to the head
of the creek-just a lot of canyons
and crevices and rocks where a yeth-
quake or something has plumb busted
things sometime

  the partners finished their cooking
and fell to with hearty appetites and
the silence that usually attended eat-
ing on the frontier mr mosbys
jaws were not otherwise employed so
he went on talking

  if you fellows want some real good
land youd orto go up big bowlegs
theres two or three hundred acres
up there red clay subsoil good deep
loam and she lays plumb pretty for
water cept they aint a dang drop of
water only when it rains then theys
loo much old gray hoss rileys up
there-or was last time i seen him
hes been there five year and raised
one good crop

  mosby rattled on until the partners
finished eating afterward marshall
got out his violin and blended its music
with that of the gurgling stream he
was a dreamer and a rare musician
next morning the partners were
awakened by the rattle of mosbys
wagon as he broke camp a little after
daylight

  i dont like to give this bowlegs
project up said marshall after
breakfast if mosby told the truth
spradley will be wanting to sell pretty
soon suppose we take a little trip up
big bowlegs and get the lay of the
country no use trying to trade with
spradley now

  might as well now that were
here replied clell i dont want to
see buck spradley theres pretty apt
to be trouble whenever and wherever
we meet hes a good man i reckon
but i cant get along with him

  they hitched up the team and took
the dim road that led up big bowlegs
ten miles from their camp they
emerged from the boulder-strewn

wilderness into a beautiful valley
walled alxmt with foothills the creek
ran almost due south from the moun-
tains and the valley lay on the east side
of it as mosby said there was two or
three hundred acres of fine land but
no water there were two cabins in
sight and a wreath of smoke was curl-
ing from the chimney of one

  old gray hoss riley was standing
in the door of the first cabin they

riley was standing in the door

came to and the old gray bag o bones
that gave him his name was grazing
the stunted bunch grass near the cabin

  mawnin gents called the old hob-
goblin as the wagon stopped his
tobacco-stained whiskers bobbing up
and down and giving the appearance
of an ancient billy goat prospectin
i reckn he went on when they had
returned his greeting

  thought we might locate a claim
in this section if we could find a good
one ventured clell

  aint but three claims in twenty
mile thats worth the filin fee and
theyre all took mosbys got one on
little bowlegs and i got two here on
big bowlegs his claim aint worth
a copper-lined damn nothin but
water over there lands no account
hows this land of yours

  best land cast of the range
dont seem to be much growing
on it

  too airly yit git our rains mostly
in may and june

  would you sell these claims
no sirree just suit me to a tee
marshall made a movement as if to
start the team

  hold on pardner dont hurry

i	might sell thatn up there that the
other cabins on i reckn ones all i
need ill take a thousand dollars for

it and-

  and ill give you a hundred for a

quit-claim deed said clell

  anybody but a pair of easy marks
would have known mr riley for
what he was-a cold-blooded old rep-
robate who would rob his grand-
mothers grave for a penny he swore
and protested that the offer was an
insult but within an hour he had a
hundred dollars which was more than
he would have given for the whole of
arizona and the partners had a quit-
claim deed written by marshall and
duly signed together with the original
papers issued by the land office this
title wasnt much as it stood but if
they made certain payments and did
certain things within a specified time
it would be perfect

  they took possession of the cabin
and marshall began to figure he
was figuring forty bales of alfalfa to
the load and a ready market at 
a bale at the railroad he took no
account of the fact thatwhen the rail-
road was built alfalfa would be
shipped in cheaper than that in the
midst of his figuring while clell was
silently trying to figure out why he
bought the claim old gray hoss hob-
bled up to the cabin

  howdy gents been thinkin about
these claims youd orter have one
apiece im getting pretty old and
id sell out entire if i got the right
offer

  now clell was putting up the
money for the enterprise and had
been wondering why he had paid a
hundred for a dry claim where it
never rained neither of the partners
spoke

  tell you what ill do mr riley
went  you seem a likely pair of
youngsters thats apt to make some-
thing of this valley im too old to
work it ill sell you the other claim
for another hundred

  no said clell if its any good
one claim is enough if it isnt any
good one claim is too much

  but mr riley was no quitter when
he had set his hand to the plow he
came down to seventy-five then to
fifty and finally offered to take a
winchester rifle and twenty-five dol-
lars and leave the valley more for
the riddance than for the land clell
made the trade

  soon after noon mr riley packed
his most intimate belongings on the
old gray plug and disappeared into
the roughs at the south end of the
valley he had bumped two suckers
and it was not the first time he had
done the like with those same two
claims


the frontier

n his two years
in the west gell
berry had seen
very few safe de-
posit vaults - ex-
cept the mountains
where nature had
deposited her gold
and silver and copper and had appar-
ently thrown away the key by tacit
agreement he was head of the firm so
he took all the papers in the land deal
folded them carefully and placed
them in his pocketbook he noticed
that the papers from the land office
on which the quit-claim deeds were
based had been much handled and on
one of them there was a splotch that
looked like dried blood he paid it
no attention so the papers reposed
in the old leather pocketbook which
clell always carried on his person

  clell wasnt crazy by any means
he was an engineer he saw at a
glance that with very little labor a dam
could be built just above the upper
cabin and storm water enough stored
to irrigate considerable land as soon
as riley was out of sight he picked up
the remaining rifle told marshall he
was going to take a look farther up the
gorge and left the cabin

  it was little more than a mile from
the cabin to the head of the creek but
owing to the curve it couldnt be seen
clell took his way up the gorge scan-
ning the ground with critical eye a
little way up the stream he came upon
pools of water with lush grass and
weeds growing along the banks half
a mile from the cabin the gorge be-
came a crevasse with towering walls
of stone and the stream a tiny ripple
over the stone bed by this time he
could see that the gorge ended appar-
ently in the side of a mountain with
no way out except the way he had
come in he went on and came upon
an immense blue pool of water under
the over-hanging cliffs a hundred
feet above him a tiny stream came
over the precipice it looked like a
silver rope that unravelled as it came
on until it was a broad tassel of spray
by the time it struck the pool and cast
a tiny rainbow on the dark blue water
he was spellbound with the beauty of
the thing as he stood looking in
wonder there was a great roar of
water seemingly all around him

  at last he tore himself away from
the beauty spot searched out a way
and climbed the bluff on the east side
of the creek at the top of the bluff
he walked around to where the little
stream broke over the cliff then

stopped and caught his breath the
roaring water was not far to seek
about a hundred feet to the west of
where he stood was the head of little
bowlegs a flood of pure clear
water was pouring through a deep
wide crevasse in the solid stone of the
mountains the tiny stream that
flowed into big bowlegs was simply
overflow from a low place in the stone
banks that ran through an age-worn
channel to the cliff from where he
stood clell could see his own valley
and could see that it was far wider
and lower than that of little bowlegs
at that point the head of little bow-
legs was a straight stone channel for
several hundred feet as if nature had
labored at it for a million years or
some titian had chiseled an immense
chute in the stone the water was
level with the top and sweeping by
with the speed of a railroad train

  clell turned from it and started to
find the source he had gone but a
little way when climbing on to a ledge
of stone lie saw for the first time the
basin spring it was a hundred feet
across and boiling and bubbling like
an immense pot he crept to the edge
of the spring and gingerly put his
finger in the flood it was icy cold
the melting snow of the mountains
was finding its way to the sea through
crevices and grottoes

  clell glanced up and then started as
he saw a woman standing on the other
side of the basin she was looking
at him but if she was speaking he
couldnt hear her from the rumble of
the water a little way beyond the
woman was a cabin there was a
climbing rose by the cabin door and
just above the house watered by a
smaller spring was a little garden
patch and some green alfalfa here
and there were bright spots where
some homely flower bloomed

 walking around the rim clell
crossed a brawling little stream that
came from above the garden and
emptied into the basin the woman
didnt run away she didnt seem the
least frightened or embarrassed just
surprised she was a young woman
little more than a girl and she was
pretty clell said good evening
the girls teeth flashed white between
red lips as she returned his greeting

  do-do you- and clell stuck

  yes laughed the girl strange
as it may seem i do i live in that
cabin with my father wont you
come and see him

  clell would and he did on the
way to the cabin he told the young

woman his name was clell berry and
she told him her name was jenny ta-
tum how else could they be intro-
duced there was no one else to do
it that part of the west was not
very well up on conventionalities

  the house was two log rooms with
a little lean-to at one side flowers
were growing in every nook and
cranny about the place there was
some home-like gripping thing about
this solitary cabin lost here in the
mountains that berry couldnt explain
to himself just them

hen they entered
the cabin the visi-
tor saw a long-

	a i r e d bushy-
whiskered old man
sitting by a win-
dow f i n g e ri n g
some bits of broken
quartz

  this is my father mr tatum mr
berry introduced jenny

  glad to meet you sir and the old
man extended a gnarled and knotted
hand knew a jim berry at placer
city any relation of yours

  why i havent figured but-er
that is i dont know sir

  yes said tatum a little later i
been prospecting here in these moun-
tains for twenty years or more every-
body on the range knows old ranse
tatum most of em knows i got a
cabin on the head of bowlegs but
mighty few have ever seen it flowd
you find it prospecting

no sir replied clell i bought
some claims down on big bowlegs
claims claims why you got
flimflammed theres no mining down
there

  claims of land explained clell
oh squatters claims why they
aint worth a whoop why didnt you
take up that little pocket of land down
on little bowlegs plenty of water
to irrigate that cant raise anything
in this country without water

  i was on a trade for that but an-
other fellow beat me to it

  what another fellow  whats
his name know him

  yes sir i know him buck sprad-
ley is his name

  huh this country is getting too
thick settled for me dont mind hav-
ing one neighbor but if they get too
thick- dont matter on bowlegs
though ive prospected both branches
clean to the mouth and never got
color now i struck a little pocket
over on the west prong of hell roar-
the waters of bowlegs creek



in creek in  i reckn it was

and-

  father did you know the alfalfa
was ready to cut again interrupted
jenny

  reckn it is now theres some-
thing thatll show you what good dirt
and water will do in this country mr
berry four year ago we built this
cabin here at the basin spring noth-
ing would do jenny but we must have
a garden patch it raises all the fruit
and vegetables we want and enough
alfalfa to feed my saddle mule
jennys pony and two burros why
back in  or maybe it was the next
year i struck a little pocket over
on-

  maybe mr berry would like to
see the garden father interrupted
jenny again

  yes  expect he would and reach-
ing for his cane ranse tatum rose
and hobbled to the door

   i limp pretty bad yet the old fel-
low said as they went toward the
miniature farm but im getting bet-
ter all the time pretty soon i will
be able to make another round i was
up the range a ways last year or
maybe it was the year before and fell
nnd busted my leg minded me of the
time i struck that little pocket back
in-

  father tell mr berry how many
limes we cut this alfalfa in a year
diverted from his little pocket
again tatum told clell about the hay
and the fruit and vegetables that
jenny grew on the little plot of
ground

  yes sir it is wonderful what will
grow  land in this country if you
give it water but jennys the farmer
lie concluded im a prospector
iack in  or maybe it was  i

struck a little pock-

  theres at least another acre of
good land here mr berry said
jenny again preventing her father
from explaining about that little
jiocket but i cant get the water on
it it looks lower than the other but
the water wont run that way

  well now i havent figured but
if i had my instrument here i could
fix it for you clell said

  oh could you

  yesm all you have to do is
find out which way is down-hill and
let the water run that way if you
want ill bring up my instrument and
figure it for you

  id be so glad that would make
me quite a farm

  that was the beginning of their ac-

quaintance clell stayed an hour and
at jennys invitation promised to come
the next day and show her which way
was down-hill

  old ranse tatum had tried a dozen
times to tell about that little pocket on
the west prong of hell roarin creek
but every time jenny would interrupt
him the facts were that old ranse
had been out  a prospecting trip
three years before jenny had been
with him the old fellow had fallen
off a bluff and had broken about
everything that was breakable knock-
ing a dent in his head for good meas-
ure

   throughout his fight back to life
he muttered about that little pocket on
west prong he got up again but was
crippled for life and now he only sat
by the window looking at his pieces of
quartz and muttering to himself about
this pocket perfectly rational when
roused out of his reverie but when
he had talked a few moments intelli-
gently he would slip a cog and go back
to that pocket

   clell looked again at the mammoth
spring and speculated on how much
or rather how little labor would be
required to turn a sufficient amount of
that great volume of water into his
valley to irrigate all the farm land he
and his partner had it was the heart
of a primitive wilderness doubtless
this was the first time a trained eye
ever had studied the possibilities of
the spring as an irrigation project

   reaching the bed of the gorge by a
perilous climb clell gave one hurried
glance at the beautiful silver rope
which he meant to enlarge until he
could climb by it to fortune and sub-
consciously he was thinking of a won-
derful woman

   clell berry he muttered to him-
self youre just about the luckiest
man in the world lucky in coming
to arizona in the first place lucky in
meeting up with john marshall lucky
that buck spradley beat you to the
claim on little bowlegs lucky that
you bought out both of rileys claims
and-just luck every way thats all
and he whistled a merry tune as he
hurried on down the gorge

t was almost sun-
set when he got in
sight of the cabin
he could see only
one of the horses
and marshall was
not in sight he
sensed something
wrong and quickened his pace he

found his partner bound and gagged
on the dirt floor of the cabin there
was a frightful lump on his head
where he had been struck a heavy
blow and he was groaning with pain
who did this demanded clell

  i dont know replied marshall
weakly after you left i lay down
to take a little nap when i woke or
rather when i came to i was bound
and gagged and my head was burst-
ing

  clell forgot the wonderful story of
luck that he was going to tell his part-
ner the first thought that came to
his mind as he removed the gag and
unbound marshalls hands even be-
fore marshall had spoken was that
buck spradley was at the bottom of
this outrage clell like most good-
natured fair-minded men was a ter-
ror when he was mad and he was
good and mad now there was plenty
of room in that country for the few
people in it without crowding and he
didnt mean to be crowded buck
spradley had found out in some way
and had come into the bowlegs coun-
try to beat him out of a claim he
had succeeded and ought to be satis-
fied

  as soon as marshall was a little
better clell dug into a pack and got
out an old colts  he buckled it
on grimly

  seems like you have to fight for
what you get in this country same as
anywhere else he said i didnt
want to fight but if nothing else will
do im in

   marshall tottered over to a battered
old grip and hauled out an old hog-
leg he buckled it  dragged it
from the holster and spun the cylin-
der awkwardly it was a piece of
comedy to watch him and clell
laughed outright

  oh i know its a joke clell but
-but-ill do my best to shoot the
next fellow that-oh hell im not
fit for the frontier lets hitch up
and get out of here

  hitch lip what didnt you know
one of the horses was gone

  no

  well its true and ive been won-
dering why they didnt take both

looks like-

  i know why nobody on earth
but me can catch old seelum when
hes turned loose i turned them loose
to graze

  well here we are i might put the
saddle on seelum and try to track the
thief down but it would be foolish

i dont know the country the thief


the frontier

has got four or five hours start guess
well have to let him go-for the pres-
ent

  clell knew buck spradley was a
bully and a gambler but never thought
of him before as an out-and-out thief
the thoroughness with which the
marauder had gone through their ef-
fects after putting marshall out did-
nt escape clell there was evidence
also that marshalls pockets had been
gone through but not a thing was
missing this puzzled clell but he
made no mention of it to his partner
who apparently had troubles enough
for the time

  they ate supper tied seelum to the
wagon right at the cabin door where
they could watch him then sat smok-
ing in silence finally marshall
broke out railing at himself for get-
ting them into a mess

  oh cut that out growled clell
im the one that caused it all by
making an enemy of buck spradley
but i never did know how he came to
hate me so dont blame yourself
youre hurt worse than i am youve
lost a horse and got a cracked head
ive only lost a couple of hundred dol-
lars-and that aint lost yet i dont
think

  the last words clell spoke as they
went to bed were im going to sleep
with one eye open and if anybody
fools around this cabin before morn-
ing ill do my best to keep him with
us

  it was past midnight and the wan-
ing moon had risen when they both
woke and sprang up to listen the
pounding hoofs of a running horse
came thundering tip the valley they
drew their guns and stood tensely
waiting grim determination was 
their faces neither of them had ever
been in a gun-fight but they were
willing to try the lone horse gal-
iojed into view a length of frayed
rope flying at its neck it was see-
 ums mate come home

  good cried clell now we are
whole again except your cracked
head

  and thatll heal said marshall as
he secured a rope and tied up the re-
turning horse i wont go to sleep
at the switch again

  marshall said clell next morn-
ing after breakfast theres no use
trying to fool ourselves about this
thing were up against trouble
somebody-i dont know who it is-
dont want us to have these claims
if you say the word well pull up and
leave

  if i say the word do you want
to quit

  not any i never wanted to do
anything as much in my life as i want
to stick on and fight this thing out
talk sense then said marshall
i wouldnt live more than fifteen min-
utes anywhere else and id get more
pleasure out of taking one shot at the
gent that cracked me over the head
than i could ever get in any other way
lets take the balance of our stuff out
of the wagon and go to housekeeping
right

  that afternoon clell fished his
transit out of his kit of surveyors in-
struments and told marshall he wanted
to go up the gorge again and take
some levels

  go ahead coughed marshall i
havent got wind enough to go with
you but ive got good eyes and i
wont be caught asleep again

  after finding marshall bound and
gagged clell didnt mention his dis-
covery at the head of the gorge hed
take some levels and make sure that
he could do the things that looked so
easy before he told his partner about
it

ack at the tatum
cottage clell set
up his instrument
ostensibly to do a
bit of engineering
for jenny tatum
he could have
handled her prob-
lem by simply looking at the ground
an hours work with the pick and
shovel and he had water on the little
plat of ground incidentally he had
found out something he wanted to
know about the stone that lay between
the basin spring and the bluff where
his silver rope hung over

  i dont know how i can ever repay
you for putting the water on the bal-
ance of my little farm said jenny

tatum as he was about to take his
leave

  ill take part of the vegetables that
grow on it grinned clell

  oh sliame  me why didnt i
think to offer you some vegetables
there are plenty here take what
you like

  not this time he said this old
transit is load enough theres some-
thing that i would like to have
though

  and that is

  permission to turn some of the
water from the basin spring into big
bowlegs so i can irrigate my land

  turn it all in there if you want to
its below my farm can you do it

  i dont know maam ill be back
in a week or two and i can tell you
then

  jenny tatum the prospectors
daughter watched clells broad shoul-
ders until they went out of sight over
the bluff there was an odd light in
her brown eyes she was wondering
if he really could turn that flood of
water onto his land certainly he
could she told herself a man like
that could do anything there was
another thought still back of that in
her mind as she turned to where old
ranse was mumbling over his bits of
quartz at the cabin door

  clell found marshall undisturbed
on his former return from the ta-
tum cabin his story had been held
back by the condition in which he had
found his partner now there was
another cause-just pure jealousy he
would not have admitted it-didnt
even know it in fact-but subcon-
sciously he was telling himself that
he had found this wonderful woman
and didnt want her to meet the pol-
ished affable john marshall with his
music until- that was as far as his
mind went it refused to set a date
for the meeting

  only once had he been a bit sus-
picious of this partner whom he had
pickcd up in a moment at the construc-
tion camp that was when they met
mosby and he found that the two men
were acquainted

  weve got to go down to the near-
est land office in the morning an-
nounced clell as they sat smoking
after supper i want to be sure of
our title to these claims

  think theyre worth the trouble
with no water on them asked mar-
shall

  yes i think we can put water on
them with a little work but i dont
the waters of bowlegs creek



want to do the work for someone
else

  the following morning they loaded
their effects into the wagon and left
at daylight clell made the mental
note that it looked as if they were
abandoning their claims and won-
dered what spradleys next move
would be

  it was fifty miles to the nearest land
office arrival there it was discov-
ered that the documents were all reg-
ular the payment of nominal fees
for the recording of the papers and
going through certain forms perfected
the title to the two claims one in the
name of clell berry and the other in
the name of john marshall

  now let spradley crack his whip
said clell as they left the land office
that land is ours to have and to
hold etc 

  im afraid ive let you in for a
lot of trouble said marshall in a
doubtful tone

  trouble youve let me in for a
fortune and the only life worth liv-
ing

  you are an enthusiastic farmer
smiled marshall he didnt know
that thtre was more than the promise
of green fields back there on bowlegs
to clell berry

bout noon on
the fourth day
their wagon now
heavily laden and
containing among
other things some
bags of alfalfa and
other seeds rattled
into the valley on big bowlegs
clell had feared spradley would burn
the cabins in their absence the valley
was just as it had been when they
first entered it even old gray hoss
riley was standing in the door of the
first cabin and the old gray bag o
bones was cropping the dry bunch
grass

  mawnin gents greeted gray
hoss i been on a little prospectin
trip over east a ways i draps in here
last night about dark to see how you
fellows makes out in yo new home
dont see nobody around so i stays
all night in the cabin where yall
been 

  down to the railroad to get some
bacon and flour replied clell

  no effort was made by either of the
partners to detain mr riley and he
soon left going down big bowlegs
just as he had done on that first day
when they had brought him out

  wonder what that old devil is
hanging around here for growled
clell when riley was out of hearing

  oh hes just a shiftless old pros-
pector replied marshall the
mountains are full of them theyre
no good to themselves or anyone else
the hundred and twenty-five you paid
him has made him rich hell go on
hunting a fortune now until his
money is gone then hell freeze to
death in a blizzard or starve in the
desert most of them are half crazy
clell thought of old ranse tatum
but didnt mention him

  well mr riley is one prospector
that i can get along without he said
instead ive got a hunch that hes
acquainted with buck spradley our
title to these claims is good and i
mean to stay here if he comes snoop-
ing around here again im going to
find out why

  a little way above the upper cabin
which the partners had selected as
their home a natural dam lay across
the creek it looked as if at some
time nature had hurled down part
of a mountain and the seamed stone
had landed across the gorge their
water supply came from what was
supposed to be a spring at the upper
end of the long pool formed by the
dam that is at the upper end of
what would have been a deep pool a
quarter of a mile long had there been
any water in it the partners drove
the wagon around the end of the dam
and on toward the spring which clell
knew was nothing but the water from
his silver rope and which trickled
down the gorge under the gravel that
covered the solid stone floor

  must have been ten years since it
rained in this country commented
marshall or thered be water in that
place

  fissure in it replied clell
thats what these ten bags of cement
are for nature has done just about
everything for us up here all we
have to do is put on the finishing
touches and well have a paradise
on high ground near the spring a
good part of their load was unloaded
beneath some bushes and covered up

  i feel better said clell as the
wagon rattled back down to the cabin
i know what dynamite will do and
i dont enjoy riding on a load of it
back at the cabin they unloaded a
plow hoes shovels bags of seeds and
miscellaneous supplies

  now were all set cried clell as
he wiped the sweat from his face
can you plow marshall 

  i think so i never plowed much
but i have a general working knowl-
edge of the business and marshall
smiled in his whiskers

  i dont mean to be bossy said
clell but the job of stopping the fis-
sure in the dam and turning water
from that spring i found is too hard
for you if youll keep house and
plow a little on both claims just to
show our good faith as homesteaders
ill work at the water problem

  fine youre the boss clell if
it hadnt been for you id either have
starved to death or else id be back at
the old home broke coughing away
the little time left me with everybody
pitying me and at the same time wish-
ing i was out of the way id rather
be dead yes ill plow what i can
you go right ahead and boss the job

  two weeks passed clell was off
by daylight every morning and re-
turned at dark marshall saw the
white limy drill dust on cells over-
alls and knew he was preparing to
blast some stone but he asked no
questions he too was busy he
had plowed a considerable patch of
land on the upper claim and enough
on the lower one to show good inten-
tions

  every day these two weeks clell
had eaten a good dinner of fresh vege-
tables wholesome bread and meat and
coffee at the tatum cabin while old
ranses dog spurned the lunch he in-
variably carried he felt ashamed of
not telling marshall what was at the
head of the gorge but he just couldnt
do it he was willing to work for his
sick partner and to divide everything
else with him but jenny tatum was a
different matter

  every day jenny tatum watched
from the cabin door as clell drove the
long churn drill into the soft stone
barrier that lay between him and a
fortune and he began to hope true
she knew nothing about him but con-
ventions must be dispensed with on
the frontier he knew nothing about
her except that her father was a half-
mad old prospector but that made no
difference to him there was no
other woman on earth like jenny to
him and never could be

  she had come out to where he was
at work late that afternoon as she
often did and stood watching him
draw the long drill and clean the drill-
ings from the hole with the narrow
iron spoon

  thats the last hole said clell as
he looked up at her pretty soon


the frontier

ill shoot them and then ill have
water on my land

  and pretty soon after that youll
be busy on your farm and forget
where the water comes from she
said and there was a wistful note in
her voice

  not in a thousand years and
clells voice trembled ive got
everything ready to turn the water
into big bowlegs but unless- and
he stopped

  unless what murmured jenny

  unless i can have you i dont
want any water dont want any farm
ill go back to rambling

  he looked into her eyes and the
next instant she was in his arms the
only other work clell did that day was
to take a sledge and cold chisel and
break away the stone at the low rim
of the basin this let out enough
water to enlarge his silver rope about
a hundred times as he went down
the gorge water was gurgling over
the stones and he knew there would
be plenty in the great pool by morning
with which to mix his cement and
close the fissure then he would be
ready to turn the stream into his en-
chanted valley then would come
wealth and-jenny

  he said nothing of all this to mar-
shall but he couldnt help showing his
happiness in his beaming countenance
marshall saw it and attributed it to
the buoyant health which his partner
had and which he himself could never
regain marshall had a fiddling fit
on him that night he rarely played
except when lie was low-spirited he
hadnt plowed any that day the
fact was he had had a slight hem-
orrhage but had said nothing about it

  on into the night the violin poured
out its melody but it was mostly sad
classical compositions clell sat in
lie cabin door listened and wondered
the sad music had driven the gay
mood from his heart he thought of
buck spradley of old gray hoss
riley of mosby and his apparent in-
timacy with marshall someone
wanted him out of the valley who
could it be except spradley why
had he kept quiet the last two weeks
he wasnt the kind to give up without
a fight ugly thoughts marched
through clells mind like platoons of
enemy soldiers when at last they
went to bed sleep didnt come quickly
as usual and he was restless when he
did finally sleep

  clell woke with a start and sat up
on his pallet the moon was shining
brightly and marshalls pallet was

vacant clell called to him and he
answered from just outside the door
a moment later he came in

  ive got a blue spell tonight
clell he said been sitting out there
on the old wagon tongue looking at
the moon as i have so often done
since ive been in this country it
looks as if one could almost reach the
moon and stars do you believe in
premonitions 

  no laughed clell guess my
livers too active for that and he
stretched out on his pallet

  the two horses had been driven up
the gorge above the spring and left
to graze on the greener grass and
weeds they found there there was
a dead stillness over the place and
clell fell asleep again it seemed to
him that he had slept but a moment
when marshall shook him by the arm

  wake up clell he whispered
listen

the great still-
ss they could
ar the hoofs of
veral horses com-
g up the valley
theyre coming
drive us out
this time said

marshall calmly

 and we wont drive worth a
damn snapped clell as he drew on
his trousers and boots buckled on his
pistol and sprang for his rifle that
stood in the corner will you stay
with me if it comes to a fight mar-
shall

  ill stay as long as i last clell but
im afraid i wont be much help i
never was in a gun-fight and-

  hello in there called a voice
from the outside

  hello yourself returned clell
what do you want

  come out here

  cant right now im busy state
your business i can hear you

  all right we come to notify you
nesters to get out of this valley this
is a cow country and we dont aim to
have any farmers in it

  oh you wont have any farms
clell answered well now you listen
to me theres one little farm 
bowlegs thats going to stay right
here we have a title to the land
from the government and if you
dont get away from here and stay
away somebodyll get hurt

  the reply was a volley of shots
peering out through a crack clell had
seen six mounted men one of them

was old gray hoss riley the others
were strangers buck spradley wasnt
with them as the bullets spattered
the cabin wall one or two coming
through cracks clells rifle spat a
streak of flame and riley slid from
his old gray bag  bones

   get down and rush em fellers
 called the man who had been the
 spokesman and seemed to be the
 leader theyre just a coupla damned
 tenderfoots

   at the word clell and marshall
both began working their guns clell
was mad now and beside himself
with rage

   come on in damn you he called
 out in a lull of the firing as he shoved
 fresh cartridges through the loading-
 gate of his winchester my feet
 may be tender but my hands are hard
 from honest work i cant shoot
 much but i can hit like hell

   the gang dismounted and bunched
for a rush two streams of fire from
the cabin wall poured into them two
more of the six went down the other
three fled toward their horses

   through his lookout clell saw four
 more men gallop up to the fray

  reinforcements now we will
have it he growled

   marshall leaning against the wall
 coughed slightly but said nothing he
 had said he would stay as long as he
 lasted and he was staying clell had
 no time to look at his partner a
 funny thing was happening out there
 in the moonlight the four new-
 comers had covered the three sur-
 vivors of the battle and coolly hand-
 cuffed them

 -	hello within there called one

   all right replied clell whats
 on your mind want a little of the
 same 

   not any thank you laughed the
 man were state rangers and tried
 to catch this gang before they got
 here lets suspend hostilities and
 see what you have done to them

   at that instant clell heard a chok-
 ing noise from marshalls corner of
 the cabin and turned just in time to
 see his partner turn loose the wall to
 which he had been holding and slump
 to the floor

   clell lit the old battered lantern
 and the captain of the ranger squad
 came in

  one dead and two hurt bad
enough to hold em for a while on the
outside whats the casualty list in
here 

   my partners hit faltered clell
 looking up from where he knelt by
the waters of bowlegs creek



 the side of marshall who was covered
 with blood

  the ranger went over the still form
that lay on the floor

  yes your partners hit pretty
hard a moment later he said hes
dead i guess that bullet caused his
death but the blood didnt come from
his wound then lowering his voice
he was a lunger wasnt he

  clell nodded

  i thought so continued the
ranger its murder just the same
and will be the finish of this gang
weve been trying to catch them with
the goods for a year it is a regular
organized business they have filed
on claims like this all along the foot-
hills a tenderfoot comes along some
member steers him to one of the
claims telling him it can be bought
for a song he buys it and then the
gang runs him off

  by this time they had walked to the
door in spite of the battle and of
marshalls death clell was thinking
of another matter

  what about that claim on little
bowlegs he asked

  that replied the ranger captain
was another one they used the land
is worthless but theres plenty of
water and the green settler grabbed
it fellow by the name of mosby
worked it they hadnt bumped a
sucker for months and we thought
theyd quit then a few days ago a
man named spradley came to us with
a tale about trading for mosbys claim
and afterward being run ragged until
he left it then we heard somebody
was plowing the claims on big bow-
legs and hurried up here

  clell said nothing he was pretty
sure spradley knew all about the
claim on little bowlegs and had
intended to bump him with it but had
been caught in his own net

  come morning and the rangers
helped clell bury his late partner 
a bit of rising ground at the edge of
the valley

  now mr berry said the ranger
captain well pay you to take your
wagon and haul this quiet gent who
was wanted dead or alive gray iioss
and the other cripple and the three
sound ones down to headquarters
you can take the team and bring
it back said clell i dont want to
leave here just now

  dont blame you much well send
the team back and also a split out of
the reward money

  just send the team dont think

i could use any money i got that way
said clell

t was midafter-
noon john mar-
shalls old brown
violin lay silent in
its case clell had
looked through the
dead mans meager
effects there was
nothing but some odds and ends of
clothing and a book or two nothing
to identify him no former address
from a little bunch of keys found in
marshalls pocket he fitted one to a
leather-bound trunk-shaped valise and
opened it here clell expected to
find papers that would tell whom to
notify of his partners death what
he did find was a single sheet of pa-
per the last will and testament of
john marshall dated the day before
and written in ink in a clear hand and
scholarly language it left his wagon
and team his interest in the claims
and all his earthly effects to mcclel-
lan berry

  clell folded it reverently and placed
it in his pocketbook for safe keeping
whoever and whatever marshall may
have been there was  evidence now
a little heap of paper ashes in the
fireplace evidently made the day be-
fore and unnoticed by clell until now
bore mute testimony of the mans
thoroughness clell was thinking
sadly that they had buried him almost
before he was cold when a shadow
fell in the cabin door he started
violently and turned to see the tear-
stained face of jenny tatum

  wha-whats the matter stam-
mered clell

 fa-fathers d-dead jenny
sobbed as she sank to a proffered
camp stool

  then she sobbed out her story old
ranse had spells in which he fell and
became unconscious a doctor had
told her once it was caused by clots
on the brain and that some time it
would kill him that morning he had
fallen and in spite of all her efforts
the old prospectors spirit had gone to
investigate the little pocket in an-
other land

  when she had rested a while clell
took up his pick and shovel and si-
lently led the way up the gorge there
was nothing to say at least his
tongue was not schooled to say the
things that might be said so he used
the true language of sympathy-si-
lence

  in a little cove above the garden
under a juniper tree clell made a
grave then lie took up tenderly the
emaciated body of the broken old
prospector and laid it to its last long
sleep when the last shovelful of
earth had been replaced they returned
to the cabin and sat in the doorway
as the sun sank in the west

  jenny told him she had  one to go
to  relatives  friends her
mother who had died when she was
twelve had taught her many things
among others to be a true woman
after her mothers death she had
gone from place to place with her
father the last four years they had
lived in this cabin spending sparingly
of the proceeds of the little pocket
of which ranse was always talking it
was about gone now their last trip
to the little mining town thirty miles
over the range had almost cleaned it
up

  i dont want you to go to anybody
else jenny faltered clell but-

  i know clell youre thinking
about a preacher and everything reg-
ular like that i been thinking about
that too we can make a trip down
to the settlement and get married reg-
ular so people wont talk

  another thing jenny when i
drilled the holes for those blasts i
didnt think about anything but getting
water into big bowlegs if i ever
fire them there wont be a splinter left
of your cabin-

  thats all right clell i wont
need it any more im going with you
wait until i put a few things in a bag
well get the rest before you fire the
blasts

  together they went back down the
gorge in the purple diik

  the team came back and a week
later the fissure in the dam was closed
a mighty thunder of blasts shook the
mountains and the waters of bow-
legs creek changed their course lit-
tle bowlegs was a dry gorge after
that and mosbys worthless claim be-
came a barren spot of mountain

  old records of yavapai county
running back to early territorial days
carry the information that mcclellan
berry and jenny tatum were duly
married  a certain date approxi-
mately that of the great blast down
where bowlegs once sank into the
sand there is now a great reservoir
and many hundreds of acres of fruit
and alfalfa but clells old claim on
big bowlegs was the pioneer and still
yields its crop of green gold
author of the forty-niners the comstock lode etc

though the government officials hushed up the discovery fearing that it might lead to an utter dis-
organization of societygold mil out-and when it came out australia experienced a stampede of the
icildest sort with nuggets of wondrous size and fortunes picked up over night

land

by roderick ohargan

here was a cele-
bration at the stags
head saloon dovvn-
ieville sierra coun-
ty california a
dozen or more gold-
seekers from the
nearhy bars on the
yuba river were on hand to say
good-by to sailor hargraves the
great california gold rush of  was
approaching its crest the city as
san francisco was known throughout
the diggings was overflowing with
wealth crowds of red-shirted miners
from the crccks anxious to exchange
their dust for something-anything-
anything that caught their eye-met
and mingled with the vast horde of ad-
venturers drawn from all parts of the
world from the over-taxed saloons
came the droning cry money on the
bar indicating a lucky man inviting
the world to celebrate with him

  even downieville born only a few
months before was bubbling with ex-
citement the guest of the evening
edward hargraves was returning to
australia with the avowed intention of
discovering a goldfield even greater
than that of california like many
others he had come hotfoot to the cal-
ifornia diggings one year before he
had not been successful as a miner
this soldier sailor and bushman per-
haps he was more of a talker than a
worker he certainly had a flair for
the theatrical and was given to boast-
ing of australia

  half a century before this little fare-
well celebration took place englands
political heads were puzzling over what
to do with a huge island in the south-
ern seas a penal colony good idea
so for fifty years she had dumped her
convicts there-some cut-throats of the
lowest type others misguided idealists
who had queer political views as a
result about one-half of the popula-
tion of australia were either convicts
or emancipists-the latter convicts
who had served their terms but were
not permitted to return to the mother-
land

  even if you did discover a gold-
field in australia hargraves that old
queen of yours wouldnt let you
have the gold an emancipist from
australia sneered while hargraves
boasted

  queen victoria god bless her will
be informed that i have discovered a
great goldfield and will make me one
of her gold commissioners and per-
haps afterward a peer of the realm
hargraves replied striking an attitude

  curiously enough a large part of
this childish boast was destined to
come true

  arrived in sydney new south
wales hargraves tried to induce old
friends and acquaintances to put up
funds for him to make an expedition
into the back-blocks to discover a
goldfield he pointed out that he had
just come from california and was an
expert at both discovering and washing
gold his friends refused to put their


money into such a wild speculation
nothing daunted he invested the few
dollars that represented all his capital
in a saddle horse he then rode across
the blue mountains through bathurst
to guyong where he picked up a native
guide and plunged into the wilderness

  about fifteen miles from the settle-
ment at a point  lewis ponds
creek a tributary of the mcquarie
river the two men prepared their first
meal having eaten hargraves prob-
ably regretting that he had no larger
audience informed the native of the
object of their expedition the eyes
of the blackfellow bulged with ex-
citement this slight encouragement
was sufficient to cause hargraves to
get to his feet right where we are
now resting is a goldfield he an-
nounced it is all about us i will
prove it to you

  he took a dishpan and washed a
pan of dirt it showed a few grains
of gold in all he washed five pans
in rapid succession and four of them
showed colors later he admitted that
his talk had been bluff he had only
hoped that gold was there

  a few weeks later hargraves
walked into the office of the honor-
able deas-thompson colonial secre-
tary at sydney and opened a mys-
terious paper package the official
was in a cheerful frame of mind he
listened to his visitor with patience and
good humor

  by jove my man it is gold hs
finally exclaimed adjusting his eye-
australia-fortune land



glasses i believe your story i will
have it investigated

argraves
dramatic discovery
was not the first
time gold had been
talked of in aus-
tralia nearly thirty
years before one of
die convicts at bot-
any bay showed a specimen of gold-
splashed quartz he claimed he had
found when asked to show the place
of discover he was unable to find it
again and was awarded one hundred
and fifty lashes for his deception
a few years later a gang of convicts
building a road through the blue
mountains found a number of gold
specimens but the news was promptly
suppressed because it was feared that
the convicts would get out of hand

  in  ten years before hargraves
returned from california a bushman
named adam forres found a good
size nugget and showed it to w b
clarke a geologist clarke took it to
governor gipps who dismissed the
matter by saying put it away mr
clarke put it away or we shall all
have our throats cut clarke there-
upon advised his friends who were
excited about the find that he would
not make it public as he feared it
might lead to the utter disorganiza-
tion of society

  the investigation of hargraves dis-
covery promised by secretary deas-
thompson took place again the offi-
cial mind was stubborn

  i can see no evidence whatever of
the precious metal in the district indi-
cated mr stutchburg the govern-
ment geologist reported

  but hargraves was so earnest and
so insistent that the geologist made a
second visit and watched hargraves
wash out a dozen pans of dirt several
of which showed a string of colors
moreover half a dozen men who had
caught the trick from the forty-niner
were panning  the creek and show-
ing colors in pan after pan the geol-
ogist was forced to admit the gold was
there the news was reported in the
press the stampede was on what a
government geologist said  thought
did not matter now he was brushed
aside like a chip in the wind within a
few days four hundred amateur miners
were milling around the spot where
hargraves had washed his historic pan
of dirt

  before hargraves find was fully ac-
cepted two new fields were discovered

one on the turon river and another
on the abercrombie and these were
followed almost immediately by the
kerr strike at a little sheep sta-
tion on the banks of the merro river
a blackboy horsebreaker idly chip-
ping at a quartz boulder struck harder
than he had intended and split the rock
revealing to his astonished gaze a core
of solid gold bigger than his fist two
other similar boulders were promptly
broken up bringing to light even larger
chunks of solid gold one of these
had it remained unbroken probably
would have been the biggest sample of
native gold in the world

  the news ran through australia like
wildfire within a few weeks from al-
most every point of the compass re-
ports of new discoveries were coming
in one on the heels of the other there
were

clunes	 july th

buninyong on august th
andersons creek on august  ith
balarat	on september th

mount alexander on september th
broken river on september th

  four of these discoveries became
great producers mount alexander
for instance produced more than ten
thousand ounces of gold in the first fif-
teen days of existence any man with
a spade and tin dish could be a success-
ful miner indeed few knew anything
of mining shown by the fact that many
claims were abandoned and re-aban-
doned only to yield fortunes to second
and third comers one such aband-
oned claim the poor boy at eureka
yielded a nugget of pure gold weighing
over six hundred ounces in another
instance a pillar of earth left as a sup-
port in a deserted claim at bendigo
calved a nugget weighing more than
five hundred ounces

  the effect of these discoveries was
two-fold to the officials it was a cal-
amity to the masses it was a wind-
fall the officials saw in it only a pos-
sible uprising of the convicts and de-
moralization of the laboring classes
the commissioner of lands at bath-
urst hearing of hargraves activities
sent a special message to the governor
advising that steps be taken to pre-
vent the working classes from desert-
ing their regular employment for the
goldfields gold to the masses
spelled quick fortunes and trade re-
vival

  australia had been passing through
a period of great commercial depres-
sion people were drifting away
especially to california the gold
strike was a lifesaver first timidly

then boldly committees of wealthy citi-
zens offered cash rewards for gold dis-
coveries men women and children
gave part or all of their time to the
search often looking in the most un-
likely places yet sometimes not without
results a stagecoach driver in his
spare time found the ding-dong de-
posits and realized a fortune

t was as if some
electric shock ran
through every town
village and house-
h  d in australia
almost the entire
male popula-
tion poured along
the roads that led to the goldfields
men forsook their ordinary vocations
the shearer left the sheep station the
driver his team lawyers and even
judges forsook their courts the mer-
chant his counting-house and the
clerks their desks geelong mellxiurne
and sydney became almost empty
towns in hobsons bay on january
th  there lay forty-seven mer-
chant ships abandoned by their crews
who had set out for the goldfields to
wash a fortune out of a tin dish the
police resigned in scores even warders
in lunatic asylums left their patients
business reached a standstill schools
were closed in some places not a
man was left

  at melbourne out of forty-four
constables only two remained on duty
the governor issued a circular to de-
partment heads in sydney asking how
they were affected by the gold dis-
turbance the police chief reported
although a great increase of pay has
been offered fifty of my fifty-five con-
stables have gone to the goldfields
the postmaster an entire disruption
has taken place in this department and
immediate measures must be taken
the harbor master reported i have
only one man left

  society was cast into the melting
pot all disappeared over the rim of
the horizon in a breathless race to
where they had been told gold nuggets
were being dug up like potatoes thus
had the whisper of gold risen to a
shout of gold and it ran round the
world and turned the stems of ships
on every sea toward australia it was
the day of the clipper ships of new
england and their skippers went after
this new trade with yankee keenness

  during this time passenger traffic
between australia and san francisco
was greater than it has ever been since
-australians stampeding to cali-


the frontier

fornia and californians rushing to
australia in five months eleven thou-
sand immigrants passed through the
principal australian ports in the next
four years over four hundred thousand
immigrants arrived almost all drawn
there by the lure of gold

  after the first rush to the diggings
had subsided the cities began to fill up
again supplies for the new mining
camps became a commercial factor and
this together with the handling of the
horde of overseas stampeders caused
a big expansion in business then
when the miners began to take their
vacations from the diggings these
australian cities formerly quiet sheep
towns experienced their first period of
rushing business and wild extrava-
gance

  the lucky diggers became the out-
standing figures of local society
their wagerings at the race track or
gaming table put former plungers into
the shade they imported the worlds
best race-horses the worlds largest
diamonds and built fine homes until
that time the wealthy in australia were
almost exclusively the official class
aristocrats from england but with the
coming of gold men rose from poverty
to wealth almost overnight and the old
social lines were thrust aside the
forceful and hard-fisted bosses of the
mining camps became the leaders and
dominators of commerce finance and
society

  as in american get-rich-quick com-
munities a plague of human parasites
began to infest these easy-money cen-
ters bands of bushrangers sprang
into existence and prayed upon the
traffic between the goldfields and the
cities but the authorities if slow were
sure they stamped out crime with a
deadly thoroughness that cowed the
rough element hold-up-robbery
under arms it was called-was a
crime punishable by death australias
period of lawlessness in many ways
romantic and interesting was of short
duration the citizens formed no vigi-
lance committees putting down
crime was left to the mounted police
and they made a good job of it

he returns in the
first few m o n t h s
after gold was dis-
covered made a dazz-
ling record the
first dolly set rock-
ing at golden point
yielded four and
one-half pounds of gold in two hours

at canadian valley in the same dis-
trict the wash and rubble yielded an
average of about thirty-five pounds
 weight of gold per claim at black-
smiths hole on the canadian river
one party of mates in one day obtained
over fifteen hundred dollars per man
the average of the claim being one
ounce of gold to every bucket of earth
this claim was worked twice after
being abandoned and in all yielded
more than one ton in weight of the
precious metal

   from one fraction only twelve feet
by twelve feet at gravel bend one
hundred and twenty-five pounds
weight of gold was taken out in less
than thirty days another syndicate
of eight men working nearby pock-
eted one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars the prince claim
was leased for one week and yielded
about eighty thousand dollars then
for a two-week period yielding forty-
five thousand dollars before the end
of the year  over thirty thousand
miners were working in the victoria
goldfields in the following year this
province alone yielded gold to the value
of forty-eight million dollars and in
the succeeding year one hundred and
five million dollars and this golden
flood spelled prosperity to the whole of
australia

   australia too startled the imagina-
tion of the world by the large size of
the chunks of gold occasionally found
for several years the industry of min-
ing was mostly a matter of luck it
was a tenderfoots paradise barbers
had equal chance with geologists and
jockeys with experienced m i n e r s
there is no other example in the his-
tory of mining such a succession of
great nuggets one expert has made
a calculation of the worlds famous
nuggets one hundred and fifty in
number of these one hundred and
nineteen were found in australia the
united states trailing along a poor
second with only nine

  the welcome stranger nugget
found at dunolly only a few inches
below the surface was a block of gold
twenty-four inches long and ten inches
thick and yielded two thousand two
hundred and forty-eight ounces of
pure gold valued at just under forty-
nine thousand dollars the welcome
nugget found at ballarat weighed two
thousand two hundred and seventeen
ounces and was sold for forty-six
thousand dollars the blanche
barkly picked up at kingower at a
depth of only fifteen feet yielded sev-

enteen hundred and forty-three ounces
and was worth thirty-four thousand
dollars another weighing sixteen
hundred and nineteen ounces was part
of a small rock slide that rolled into
canadian gully

  this nugget was picked up by a
widow just out from england and
forthwith sold for twenty-six thousand
dollars this fortunate woman was
of the stuff that make real pioneers
she had a family to support and hear-
ing of the australian goldfields she
stowed her family aboard a sailing
ship and came-and in the fifties a
voyage more than half way around the
world was  picnic it could be said
of her in truth she came she saw
she conquered-for the finding of this
nugget was only the beginning

  what any man can do i can do
she said and she did both in australia
and in england where for thirty years
after she was a power in financial and
social circles

  and what of the original stamped-
ers few of the worlds adventurers
have been more suitably rewarded than
was edward hammond hargraves
officially recognized as the discoverer
of gold in australia he gained
wealth a good position and a title
wore showy uniforms and became a
public functionary surrounded by an
army of satellites he received the
appointment  f commissioner  f
crown lands the british govern-
ment bestowed upon him a gift of fifty
thousand dollars the government of
victoria a gift of twenty-five thousand
dollars new south wales gave him
a life pension of two thousand five
hundred dollars per annum har-
graves became a great man

  of the others thomas hiscock
who discovered ballarat died before
he enjoyed much material reward
harry frenchman discoverer of gol-
den gully at bendigo became a weal-
thy woolnian fortescue the brilliant
emancipist attorney tossed away a for-
tune in the cause of his oppressed
brethren in ireland but died poor
marshal owned race-horses envied
alike by english peers and south afri-
can magnates nat bayley and charles
ford the pair who later found gold
in western australia retired with
great wealth

  the australian gold rush must be
reckoned among the worlds great
stampedes one which yielded huge
prizes to the few and good prizes for
nearly all who had the high courage
and cool foresight to take a chance

by anthony m rud

author of smoke gila joe etc

it was mocking fate that decreed that toi-yabe tolman ex-outlaw but now law-abiding prospector should
come face to face with the one man who could identify him to the sheriff-and that that man should be
ilaj maddox in whose evil brain hate and vengeance were ever ready to seize the slightest opportunity
for fresh plotting

i

ne man squatted on
his heels before the
squeejaw saloon at
hartnett and rolled
brown paper cigar-
ettes in front of
the cactus spine
two false-fronted
frame buildings farther down the
dusty street a heavy-bodied counter-
part of the idler lounged with bowed
muscle-bound legs thrust out in a con-
cave-sided v on the shaded sand he
likewise rolled and smoked brown pa-
per cigarettes

  neither seemed to notice the other
yet they had passed on horseback
warily they knew each other only
too well if toi-yabe tolman the
tall desert-lean prospector who hun-
kered as he smoked had guessed haj
maddox was in town the meeting
would not have occurred he hated
maddox and despised him likewise
lie feared maddox as one may fear a
rattler in his blanket

  haj maddox an eighth-blood pima
his father a greek peddler with asthma
-incidentally named socopoulos-
was a hog-bodied loose-mouthed
swarthy individual with black close-
set eyes he had used many names for

many crimes usually of the petty or
sneaking variety sometimes of a sort
even less admirable unfortunately
once the leader of the silver peak
gang of stage robbers of which notori-
ous organization toi-yabe had been a
lieutenant had used maddox as a go-
between

  just once that had been enough
even the flint-eyed leader of those out-
laws the ex-gambler cold deck diehl
lost control of himself and beat to a
bruised pulp that apish greasy thing in
human form and diehl who had
learned boxing in the east broke one
of his valuable gamblers hands on the
fellow

  toi-yabe thought it all over his
obvious move was to walk over pick
a quarrel and shoot the bulky enemy
full of holes then the world would
be better off-and toi-yabe tolman
owner now of a promising proved up
claim inside the first ridge of the red
chalk range would not have the con-
stant worry of a sheriff possibly on his
trail over in esmeralda-for what
he had been careful to make seem good
and sufficient reason-they thought
him dead they even had paid the re-
ward to the individual who had come
upon a certain body and some of toi-
yabes undoubted possessions at gol-
mans well in the corduroy hills

  but haj maddox had started in gen-
uine surprise and recognition he
grinned loosely grunted a hail-unan-
swered then he looked back steadily
a set sneering hate and triumph in his
black eyes and puffy mouth toi-
yabe tolman two thousand dollars
walking around loose provided at sil-
ver peak theyd pay the reward again
probably they wouldnt anyway
certain plans just taking shape in the
cunning mind of haj-unspeakable
things they were-might easily fit
themselves well to the presence of a
fugitive outlaw whenever haj be-
came daring it was because he saw his
way clear to make another seem guilty
of his crime once in new mexico a
man was hanged-but that is another
story better forgotten by men who like
to believe justice and the law synony-
mous

  toi-yabe arose snapped away his
cigarette turned and strode swiftly
toward the cactus spine saloon
thumbs hitched in his belt hands
ready for the deadly swoop and draw
of s lie came straight to haj mad-
dox the latter squirmed but did not
dare attempt to get to his feet his
black irised eyes showed like bulls-
feyes in discs of white

  yuh recognized me said toi-
yabe in a low even tone well im




the frontier

dead-an aim to stay dead get me 

  oh yes yes yes came the hur-
ried slurred reply they pay the re-
ward yore dead toi-yabe i not
goint say nothin

  all right snapped the ex-bandit
yore a liar an worse jes let me
tell yuh suthin though snake-yuh
aint even a hombre i got suthin on
down thisaway an i aint alone if
yuh want to keep on livin dust outa
town his right hand fell to the
wooden butt of a six-gun

  oh yes yes smirked haj albeit
his features still bore the print of fear
i was goin so quick anyhow i am
bound onward too far-a long ways
eh  i don come back gear to lara-
mie 

  toi-yabe nodded once briefly
without deigning to look around again
at the enemy who might have shot he
strode back to the rhombus-fronted
notorious squeejaw-a crazy wooden
shack ready to collapse with the first
stiff wind yet one of the most cele-
brated rendezvous and honkytonks in
all southern nevada

  but haj maddox had scuffled up
furtively and dashed with short pad-
ding steps to the deserted bar of the
cactus spine he needed a drink sev-
eral drinks with enough of the pep-
pered whisky under his belt he could
plan hellishly and now was the time
for liquor already he had worked
out a scheme which would have re-
volted an orang-utan but earlier than
the meeting with toi-yabe he had not
picked his victim here was one toi-
yabe tolman not until the fourth
straight whisky did haj really decide
certainly upon the ex-bandit

  haj grinned blackly showing a few
stumps of teeth to the bar mirror of
a sudden he began talking owlishly
confidentially to a bored bartender
only too glad to listen haj wanted a
quart to take along he was going on
clear to laramie and he was starting
right away right away he stag-
gered clasped the stained cherry for
support

  they do certain things even for men
they distrust down there at the des-
erts edge the bartender did not try
to dissuade haj maddox that was not
within the code he gave over the
quart of liquor but saw it stowed at
the bottom of a saddle pack and the
man in the white apron also filled
maddoxs two canteens with fresh
water then as haj clumsily mounted
and rode away swaying in the saddle
the server of refreshment shrugged
and shook his head

  hell never make through damn
if he will was his muttered judg-
ment and then he forgot about haj
maddox

  but the pudgy ones alibi was there
ready made for use if necessity de-
manded

tone bellin-
ger was sheriff
of nye county
stun-bruise as
was his cognomen
from the valley of
great salt lake to
this sandy hells
kitchen of nevada was forty-six but
looked older and harder even than his
nickname he had been a cowman
and a farmer never a miner he was
a mormon apostate and a bitter enemy
of all things mormon three emis-
saries came at various times from the
mormon state of deseret determined
to kill him three grimly lettered
crosses over at the boot hill at hart-
nett revealed the gun speed and
shrewdness of the quarry and the
stark courage also

  stun-bruise had been a mormon
he loved a mormon girl and had no
earlier wives she smiled happily
when he passed on horseback raising
his straight-brimmed low-crowned hat
she loved him but love on the part of
woman was not then considered of im-
portance in deseret

  she was sealed for marriage with
one of the council whom she had not
even seen-knowingly she fled by
night to the man of her hearts choice
and he rose to the occasion he damned
mormonism briefly and then fled the
valley finally distancing the secret
danite band of avenging angels
which took his trail

  but less than a year later a long
way distant from the mormon power
and safe except from the assassin emis-
saries sent to extirpate those who
found the shackles of mormonism in-
supportable a son was born to stone
bellinger-a lusty nine-pound young-
ster who yelled like a piute the instant
he was presented to his new surround-
ings

  stone bellinger did not know-or
care his girl wife was smiling weakly
trying to return the kisses he gave
while the life ebbed from her slender
lovely body

  our boy she breathed you will
-make him-a man like-you  may-
hap that should not have been a ques-
tion mark but an exclamation point
but just then the girl mother for whom

a strong man had thrown away his
faith his chance at wealth his all save
love died her lips curved richly in a
half-smile of confidence she knew
her fate and smiled

  stones greatest weakness came to
the surface then unfortunately al-
ways he had been a hard man just but
inflexible-owing to the influence of
his mormon training perhaps now
he cursed harshly holding himself and
that little red-cuticled atom responsi-
ble for his wife genevras death
true he did not level an accusation
even mentally against the tiny lad yet
the feeling overwhelmed paternal af-
fection from the very first he avoided
sight of the infant getting an indian
woman to care for the baby tempo-
rarily he then hired a widow at tono-
pah a rather coy lady of thirty who
had one child of her own-and definite
hopes still in the field of matrimony

  so four and one-half years passed
the widow from the first honestly ad-
miring sheriff stone bellinger took
excellent care of little dick and as
the months grew into years im-
planted in the baby mind a hero wor-
ship of the stern hard-riding sheriff
father but those years ended it a
middle-aged assayer stopped for a time
at hartnett the widow despairing
now of ever becoming mrs stone bel-
linger smiled at the newcomer and
used her wiles successfully dickie
lost the nearest to a mother he ever
had known

  the only other white woman of the
region available then was mrs thor-
gesson a dull-featured big-armed
scandinavian of forty-odd the mus-
cled ignorant relict of a drunken
miner mrs thorgesson seemed happy
enough to leave her washboard how-
ever she plunged into housekeeping
again and the care of a child with
rough-handed enthusiasm she sewed
several pairs of red flannel kilts for
dickie

  and then each time she was paid
by stone she guzzled a quart or
thereabouts of whisky and let the
household run itself for thirty-six
hours

  dickie never had seen kilts before
he hated them and protested vehem-
ently but in the old country kilts for
boys had been up-to-date attire when
mrs thorgesson had been a flicka
therefore she overruled his protests
with a heavy hand once when dickie
rebelious had dared even to run to the
father he rarely saw stone was not
able to become outwardly sympathetic

  mebbe pretty soon hes big enough
chaparejos



for pants he said gruffly and strode
out

  but nothing short of an outright
command would have made an impres-
sion on the phlegmatic mrs thorges-
son she grunted fingering the money
she had got and then when she was
sure stone had ridden out of town
she went to the squeejaw honkytonk
for her quart of liquor an hour later
she was singing hoarsely there was
no supper prepared that night for the
youngster me found some hard bread
and choked down a few bites of it
through a throat constricted with a
pain of tears which under the kindly
care of bis first foster-mother he had
learned to repress

  he had fallen asleep still clothed
when the rear door squeaked on its
rusted hinges he did not awaken
nor did the housekeeper hear a
crouching bulbous shadow entered
for a moment it squatted in the door-
way then tiptoed into the shack this
time only petty pilfering was the pur-
pose of the stealthy intruder but on
his next visit haj maddox would have
a far more serious mission he in-
tended to fulfill that mission soon

  for the moment though he walked
on tiptoe a faint jangle coming from
his mexican spurs in place of the
empty overturned whisky bottle beside
the snoring housekeeper haj left a
quart with seals unbroken then from
a heap of clothing in one corner of the
next room he sorted out a pair of
shoes and a pair of stockings-tiny
size-and grinning fled with these to
his horse

  after some trouble he had located
the mining claim of toi-yabe tolman
with the stealth which was his pima
heritage maddox would leave these
stolen trifles of child attire somewhere
thereabouts he rode grinning evilly
it might be possible even yet to col-
lect that reward at any rate he haj
would secure ample revenge upon toi-
yabe whom he hated and then there
would be the youngster-ransom per-
haps that far in advance his brut-
ish mind was content to figure only
hazily

half off half on the cot bed dickie
scowled he called to her at first in
a low disapproving voice but then
louder he was hungry couldnt she
understand 

  this time she couldnt she had
awakened earlier and found the sec-
ond bottle it would be many many
hours before she took an interest in
the affairs of her charge

  the hard lump tightened in the
boys throat his lower lip quivered
from its usual line of decision he
didnt want any more of that darn
hard bread he was hungry

  an idea struck him he went into
his own room and rummaged through
a broken tomato packing case where he
kept the odds and ends of his small
possessions he had money he
would go to chong yens restaurant
and buy brefuss jes like daddy did

  the money was in a bronze coin
bank the figure of an indian when
shaken it rattled faintly dickie knew
how to get the money out he had seen
old torky do it so now he pried
and shook and shook and finally out
jingled the money-a dime and two
nickels that was all

  but the little fellow saw no discrep-
ancy between that sum and the high
prices for edibles chalked on the wall
of chong yens restaurant-laundry
next door to the lantern-jawed leer-
ing squeejaw he left the house
squaring his shoulders importantly
and marched down the dusty single
street

  chong yen thriftily utilizing the
morning hours in washing for the
town came forward arms soapy per-
haps just the glint of surprised recog-
nition showed in his seamed parch-
ment features

  hlo how do lil fellah he
questioned wiping his arms

  brefuss mes hungry an-
nounced dickie with careful nonchal-
ance standing on tiptoe to slap the
twenty cents upon the lunch counter
then by stepping on the rail and knee-
ing up he managed to mount one of
the stools the level of the board still
came even with his chin

  lots o brefuss he repeated of a
sudden an odd unsure notelike wist-
fulness shaking the peremptory deci-
sion after all he was a very small
boy acting for the first time in his five
years as a man of affairs

  chong yen looked at him at the
small change on the counter and cast
a brief expressionless glance at his
chalked menu-the least item of which
was coffee-two-bits 

  but then a quick subtle change came
in his wooden features perhaps chong
yen liked children perchance he re-
called one time years before when he
had been a newcomer in hartnett a
day on which the father of this
tiny lad intervened just when some
drunken miners were engaged in the
hilarious pastime of braiding his queue
into the tail of a bronc with nervous
heels

  at any rate he grinned and chuck-
led he came around the counter

  missy tolgesson dlunk he que-
ried

  ye-ah said dickie with distaste
and resentment

  huh grunted chong yen he
lifted dickie from the stool and car-
ried him back there was a low
scrupulously clean board table and a
box which stood on end made an ex-
cellent chair forthwith the chinaman
set forth a dish of delicious canncd
peaches which dickie devoured the
while watching with anxious glowing
eyes the further preparations chong
cut and sawed out the tenderloin of a
choice beefsteak and had it sizzling in
no time hot rice toasted bread and
a dish of beans with hot crisped bacon
-perhaps not the fare for a pampered
baby but dickie did not know the taste
of fresh milk and was accustomed to
hearty plain food he ate till he could
eat no more then sighed vastly getting
down with difficulty he never had
been pampered

  fanks he said-and then remem-
bered the business side of the transac-
tion i give you my money

  chong grinned then his face
quickly became impassive again

  suah he agreed bowing mak
change and with that he gravely
passed back a dime and a nickel in
that transaction there was more under-
standing of his youthful customer than
could have lain in the providing gratis
of a dozen meals

  before the oriental let him leave
dickie carried a neat bundle in which
reposed two cheese and two ham sand-
wiches chong knew old torky
and in an obscure way he was repaying
a long cherished debt

n the way back a
mexican lounger
gratuitously insult-
ed dickie-right at
a moment when the
boys pride had
swelled almost to
the bursting point
buenos dias nina he greeted

ickie bellin-
ger awoke raven-
ous he scrambled
up jerked with a
scowl at his rum-
pled kilts and then
ran in to the lit-
tered reeking room
of the housekeeper old torky as
he called her still slept she sprawled


the frontier

mockingly doffing his sombrero and
showing white even teeth in a wide
grin

  dickie gasped little girl indeed
his chin came up with a snap and his
tiny fists clenched he ignored the
lounger but his steps hurried became
uneven and a rosy flush overwhelmed
his cheeks and flowed over the back of
his neck nina it was those darn
darn kilts oh why couldnt he have
pants like a big man-an-an chaps
like daddy wore

  stone bellinger alone among the
prospectors miners and general drift-
ers at hartnett wore leather chapare-
jos as he rode a cowman lie had
been and a cowman sheriff he would
remain even though his lot was cast
among other sorts of westerners the
nearest ranch of any sort lay in the se-
cluded demijohn valley forty-five
miles to the northeast

  the last steps dickie took at a run
flinging himself inside the shack and
slamming the door dry sobs were in
his throat but no tears flowed he
saw without caring that old torky
had not come to consciousness darn
her anyway darn her for making
him wear kilts

  but then he looked into his own dis-
ordered room and what he saw spilled
on a table brought a flash of inspira-
tion a sewing basket had been over-
turned shears-chaps maybe pants
too

  he closed old torkys door silently
and tiptoed back to the table there
were the implements hastily seizing
scissors and a paper of safety pins that
lay on top he dropped to the floor and
scrambled under the table there he
pulled the cover down until he was
screened from any casual observer who
might come into the room and went
busily to work

  poking the sharp-pointed shears
through the material of his red kilts at
the waistline in front he sawed his
way down the weave of the-cloth until
a last chew of the none-too-sharp
shears severed the binding at the bot-
tom this made the kilts gape open
alarmingly in front but dickie stuck
manfully to his task his fingers trem-
bling from over-zealousness and a rush
of excitement

  straining his rounded stomach into
smallest compass he managed to turn
the kilts completely around so that the
slit was exactly at the back then he
repeated the process with the scissors
cutting a new slit down the opposite
side of the kilts this finished he
dropped the shears from his trembling

fingers and seized the paper of safety
pins a little flush of triumph rose in
his face as he succeeded in pinning to-
gether the bottom flaps around above
his right knee here were his trou-
sers in his excitement he stuck the
point of a pin deep in his finger but
went on disregarding the pain

  in a trice he had fastened three pins
in his right pants-leg and two in the
left that would do because some-
how or other he couldnt make his fin-
gers work to fasten the other pin he
tiptoed again to the hall door and lis-
tened

  old torky snored triumphant
dickie flushed as he looked down at
his handiwork on the wall hung a
cracked mirror the beloved daddy used
when he shaved dickie climbed up
and secured it his blue eyes glistened
with pleasure then as he held the glass
this way and that reflecting the meta-
morphosed kilts course they werent
exactly pants but they were a lot bet-
ter than those darn darn things

  now if he only had chaparejos to
wear outside

  the drive of inspiration was in him
though he looked down on the
littered floor was an old fragment of
rag carpet raveled at the edges and

the sheriff unrolled the bundle

stiff with dirt dickie caught his
breath the chaps sitting down with
the dull shears he forthwith attacked
the ancient fabric

  it proved a long slow job one
which made his hand and wrist ache
fiercely the hours dragged along
in the other room old torky ceased
snoring and groaned heavily then
there was the sound of a staggering
step a gurgle as of liquid being de-
canted-another gurgle then by and

by a creak of cot springs and finally
another snore

  dicky had sawed out one long ir-
regular triangle of rug and affixed it
by pins and raveling tied together
when his aching arm and the demands
of his stomach made him call a halt
he remembered the sandwiches and
forthwith ate them all it was long
past noon

  later the joy of creation a trifle
dulled but determination unimpaired
he started the task of sawing out a
duplicate growing heavy-eyed as the
shadows crept down from the west-
ward buttes

ii

ut in a valley of
the red chalk
range toi-yabe
tolman frowned
down puzzledly at
a pair of small
shoes and a pair of
childs stockings he
had found behind a boulder he looked
about him a kid of some kind the
valley though was as silent as a dead
desert calm even his own animals
were not grazing on the sparse vegeta-
tion jus then he was sure that no
one else could be within miles-and
certain also or nearly so that these
garments had not been behind the
boulder the day before why he had
sat on that stone to eat his beans and
pan biscuit yet he might have over-
looked them as he had been thinking
almost entirely of haj maddox and
what that treacherous coyote might be
expected to do with his knowledge that
the ex-bandit toi-yabe tolman still
lived

  toi-yabe rolled up the shoes and
stockings and tossed them back to the
place he had found them then he
looked deep into the crannies of the
narrow cave he used as a provision
cache and later devoted a half hour to
a climb reaching a spot which gave
him a birds-eye view of the valley
but beside a pair of far buzzards
slowly circling no living thing was in
sight he returned to his labor with
drill pick and shovel

  unaware of the net being woven for
him he labored in the shaft he was
sinking diagonally downward at a
right-angle to the slanting side of the
bare mountain float gold was plenti-
ful about the claim he owned low
grade ore also was present in irregular
veins two feet below the surface sep-
arated and broken by white barren
bull quartz the low grade ore rep-
chaparejos



resented a certain though small sale
value on account of the nearness to
hartnett and the rail head at lamar
yet toi-yabe always a firm believer
in rich float gold as a certain index of
the nearness of a mother lode-a the-
ory which has made dozens of pros-
pectors very rich and thousands desti-
tute-chose to ignore the  a ton
rock and delve on the gamblers chance

  that evening crouched with frying-
pan and coflfec pot before a small blaze
of mesquite twigs toi-yabe suddenly
heard the click of steel on rock the
sounds of a shod horse approaching
with possible trouble stirred up by
haj maddox foremost in mind toi-
yabe slid quickly from the firelight to
the protection of a boulder hands
dropping to his six-guns

  howdy came a hail in a tired
voice  sail right hornbre its me
-stone bellinger

  undoubtedly that news would have
been reassuring to many toi-yabe
was not certain that he welcomed it
he let the sheriff approach and dis-
mount from his lathered roan how-
ever and then emerged

   wasnt sure he apologized gruffly

  uh-huh acknowledged stone un-
cinching got enough water

  toi-yabe merely gestured at the
narrow black aperture which housed
his water cans and grubstake bel-
linger investigated poured a panful
for the roan and a drink for himself
then he slouched back to the fire
poured himself a cup of coffee and ac-
cepted the tin plate heaped with beans
and bacon tendered by toi-yabe with
a nod of acknowledgement

  such was desert hospitality given
and taken by men almost a match in
sternness and taciturnity toi-yabe
realizing that the sheriff simply had
chanced upon the claim at the end of a
long ride and had grasped the chance
to rest his horse would not have
spoken during the moments of smok-
ing that followed except that he re-
membered the curious find made that
day reaching back of the boulder
he brought up the small roll of shoes
and stockings he had discovered and
tossed them across the fire

  ever see any yonkers up thisa-
way he queried these was lyin
here when i come back from town

  the officer unrolled the bundle
then a frown gathered on his fore-
head why those things looked about
big enough for his own kid-really
something like the duds hed seen on
dickie a few times but of course
there was no possible way dickie could

get out here he assumed besides his
own son however stone bellinger
strove in vain to recall any children
this size in the region outside of a few
mexican babies down at tres casas
and these of course wore neither
shoes nor stockings

  yuh say yuh aint seen any party
up this side of the red chalk he
questioned glancing keenly up through
graying brows he did not know or
ask the name of his host a shrewd
judge of men was stone bellinger a
man who cared nothing for names or
ready-made reputations

  nope toi-yabes answer was
laconic final

   bellinger considered

  then i reckon ill tote em along
with me in the mornin he con-
cluded and he went to roll up in his
blankets without further ado

  next morning he was up in the
false dawns graying before toi-yabe
built a fire fed and watered the roan
made the coffee and prepared a sim-
ple meal seeing that the prospector
still slumbered-apparently only toi-
yabe was not altogether sure of the
sheriffs intentions-stone ate quickly
and in silence then set the coffee pot
on the dying embers saddled and rode
away toward golmans well toi-
yabe waited until the clicking of hoofs
died away into silence before thrusting
back a revolver into its holster and
arising he grinned a trifle wryly a
year before it would have been court-
ing sudden death for him to have
camped a night with any sheriff

n hour later
with his drilling for
a small blasting
charge completed
toi-yabe affixed a
cap and generous
length of fuse to
the sticks of forty
per cent he lighted the sputtering
cord with its heart of black powder
then hastened over to the gully in
which the animals were tethered the
burros could be counted  they knew
dynamite but cochise the pinto pony
always snorted and reared a wild
straining whiteness coming into his
eyes only when toi-yabe was near
could he be prevented from going into
a nervous frenzy

  seconds elapsed then a satisfying
grroommm announced that the tamp-
ing had been effective that the force
of the giant powder had been exerted
downward as well a in the direction
of the shaft mouth

  as if that explosion had been an
awaited signal a sudden faint pop-
popping began home to toi-yabe
seemingly from over the low mountain
into which he was driving the shaft
he listened tense making certain that
the gun battle-for the character of
that fast shooting was unmistakable
-was not in his valley though proba-
bly just beyond the ridge then he
shrugged it was none of his affair
he went back to examine the shaft
bending to fan away the poisonous
fumes with broad-brimmed stetson
before sliding down

   a cursory glance was rather disap-
pointing the rock showed no marked
change in character being if anything
a trifle more barren in appearance but
suddenly toi-yabe became quiet
crouched on one knee he had heard
a most curious sound one which
brought every desert trained faculty
into play a low rushing murmur
came to his ears

   that instant he became aware too
that a strange coolness was seeping in
around his lowered knee and shin
quickly he bent lower testing with his
ear sniffing carefully he heard it
more plainly now water he was
near a subterranean stream or spring
that almost priceless discovery in this
arid range water if cool and
sweet it would allow him uninter-
rupted search for treasure and com-
fort beyond imagining

   at last he found the tiny crevice
through which a distinct chill of air
rose in a steady current with his ear
to the crack he could hear the mur-
muring rush of waters even more dis-
tinctly feverishly then forgetting
for the time all thoughts of gold he
widened the crack and into it thrust
a prepared dynamite cartridge light-
ing the fuse he scrambled out and
away such was his haste he did not
glimpse a furtive oddly clad little fig-
ure on an abutment of rock just above

   thoroughly frightened gasping for
breath after his flight and climb to es-
cape the terrible man who had
snatched him from his bed before
dawn that morning dickie bellinger
wanted to climb down and speak to the
tall lean prospector-but had been too
much in the grip of terror one of the
safety pins had opened allowing the
top of his rough cut chaps to drag
behind as he crawled on hands and
knees but he paid it no attention now
he wanted someone anyone-even
old torky would have been welcome
so he came closer to that funny hole
where the big man had gone


the frontier

  he was close enough now so he
could almost rubberneck over and see
the man when suddenly the latter re-
appeared scrambling running toi-
yabe had used only a short length of
fuse this time and he possessed a
wholesome respect for dynamite

  dickie stared bewildered what
made that funny man run in and out of
that hole was it the big bang he had
heard

  that second while toi-yabe still
sprinted for the horse dickies ques-
tions were answered decisively of a
sudden a hideous jarring roar blasted
his ears the rock upon which he
crouched quaked and leaped throw-
ing him sidewise and the shock drove
consciousness from him he saw a
swirl of black and green then he knew
no more

  it was as well though protected
by a foot-high sleeve of rim rock so
that none of the upflung debris struck
him directly dickie had perched on a
battered ledge which had been about to
slide of its own weight the second
shock was just enough unostenta-
tiously nine hundred pounds of rock
cracking to fragments broke away
hesitated then slumped gently into the
prospect shaft bearing on its top a tat-
tered unconscious little five-year-old
who on this morning alone had lived
through enough perils for a lifetime

  toi-yabe was delayed a few min-
utes in spite of his impatience the
pinto cochise just then decided he
had quite enough of these rumbling
explosions and acted fractious so
toi-yabe saw neither the small ava-
lanche nor the figure of dickie

  but he came on as soon as possible
and it was while fanning the fumes
with his stetson that he caught sight
of something decidedly strange there
in the bottom of the shaft was that
the yellow curly head of a child for
the love of heaven he blinked
gasped as sudden icy dread clutched
his heart his mind raced the shoes
and stockings-the sheriffs pointed
question-

  had he killed some little youngster
unknowingly 

ill

ven as these
thoughts flashed
through his mind
he was scrambling
down however he
lit sliding in the
loose rock it was
a child a boy half
buried but still breathing toi-yabe

flung himself to his knees tearing
away the rock with his finger

  god i hope he aint hurt he half
prayed in the stress of anxiety

  just then came an odd straining
creak from the floor and the rock walls
about him supposedly solid as they
were just then they moved slowly an
inch two-

  but toi-yabe was lifting out the
youngster noting with increasing be-
wilderment the queer attire-and the
fact that dickie wore both shoes and
stockings hurriedly examining the
child toi-yabe could discover naught
save a multitude of small bruises just
then dickie sighed and moved in toi-
yabes arms

  oh-oh he gasped torky
oh

   sail right old-timer all o k
broke in the prospector vastly relieved
ill have yuh fixed up an goin
strong in jes a second i wonder how
in hell yuh ever got-

  he rose to his feet bearing dickie
with one arm and stamping a way over
the loose rock toward the upward slant
right there a black aperture through
which cold air rushed vehemently sep-
arated the floor from the side wall
-and inch by inch to the accompani-
ment of weird creaks that crack was
widening alarmingly

  toi-yabe saw and understood-just
too late a cry ripped from his throat
and he sprang for the slant but as
one boot was upraised to catch a foot-
hold suddenly and with no further
ostentation a rough circle of foot-
thick rock-the thin floor of the shal-
low shaft-dropped downward into
unmeasured blackness

  toi-yabe holding fast to dickie
pitched forward an involuntary cry
bursting from his set dry lips and one
arm grabbing widely and seizing-
nothing tumbling headlong he went
into the black fathomless pit in the
brief split second of falling he touched
nothing and gave himself up for lost
there was no telling how deep might
be this awesome subterranean cavern

  he found out almost instantly with
a ripping splash which reverberated
from close-constricting walls the sec-
tion of rock ceiling struck the surface
of a black sweeping almost silent
river hastening on its way beneath the
rock arches to the flume which gave it
back to the daylight in the far almost
inaccessible canyon of the virgin
river

  toi-yabe and his companion in mis-
fortune struck the upflung spray in
falling and then his breath was caught

from him in a constricted gasp he
clove the surface of an icy stream was
caught by the full force of the deep
current and fought with a reaction of
furious energy against the whirling
sucking current against the bruising
outthrusts of the rock wall and above
all against the unbelievable chill of this
subterranean river

  the immersion brought a choked
outcry of terror from dickie coming
abruptly to consciousness with child-
ish instinct he flung both arms about
the neck of toi-yabe and held on with
all his strength it was perhaps the
best thing possible as toi-yabe in the
following seconds could not even
spare the use of one arm

  this was no sunken spring of the
desert gradually cooled by its hidden
course in its majestic onsweep could
be recognized the force of miles of de-
scent and the pull of a predetermined
outlet in its gripping cold was the
taste of far distant snows of the high
sierras

  hampered as he was by dickie by
heavy boots crisscrossed belts with
their weights of cartridges and bol-
stered six-guns toi-yabe struggled
for every breath he drew much of
the time as helpless as a curled pinon
chip in a whirlpool he was drawn be-
neath the surface flung sidewise or
end-on against slime-smoothed gran-
ite or bruised by obstacles in the curv-
ing course

  he scraped his fingernails along a
slippery wall and then without warn-
ing was tossed to the far side of the
river there he struck with stunning
force against something which held
him a moment in spite of the dragging
power of the relentless river instinct-
ively he clutched and though his fin-
gers slipped as if trying for a hold on
buttered brass this was a rock forma-
tion of such shape that he was allowed
to grip one elbow about it clasping his
own bent wrist instantly he was
swirled about his boots swinging to
the surface as his body skittered as a
float of little appreciable weight

  hold on kid he gasped

  only then did he truly come to grips
with the immensity of the streams mo-
mentum for several seconds he
held on breathing in great gasps of the
chill air coughing and choking out the
water which had descended to his
lungs

  he did not dodge comprehension of
the issue if once he let go of this up-
right column which like an i-beam let
the flood roar past on both sides both
of them were finished he never would
cha pare jos



have the stamina to struggle again with
the sweep of the current slowly and
with infinite carefulness he drew him-
self back to a precarious kneeling po-
sition against the sloping pedestal base
of the i-beam the fingers of one
hand explored upward but found
nothing save added inches of the slip-
pery column

  if he only could see little hope
stirred in his mind that even at the top
of this sliver of granite lay anything
promising escape yet in the very fiber
of toi-yabe tolman was that deep-
wedged elan of the battler that flexi-
bility of ready combative spirit which
takes emergencies and perils exactly as
they come and compresses from each
the full blood of opportunity

  an opportunity to determine just
how bad really was his plight came to
mind he edged closer to the pillar
slipped from the rounded pedestal
nearly losing his grip then slowly won
back until he could hold his weight
against the current with bis left elbow
and hand then he reached to his
right holster the revolver was gone

  his lips set grimly yet he did not
falter in the long careful process of
shifting back so that he could reach the
other gun he reflected sardonically that
if a few million thirsty animals like his
own tethered and deserted burros and
pinto back there in the arid valley just
could get at this river for a vhile-up-
stream of course-hed be able to
wade out of the damned thing

he second colt was
there pie lifted it
flirted it sidewise
and back to remove
as much water as
possible and then
pulled the trigger
click one cart-
ridge at least had been ruined by the
immersion this time his thumb drew
back the hammer and released it in one
smooth motion the muzzle shot red-

yellow fire into the dripping black-
ness and the explosion of the big re-
volver caught and thrown back by the
cramping ceiling was deafening

  but toi-yabe did not care he even
grinned

  hold if kid he cautioned again

  there only two feet above the level
of his head ran a smooth yard-wide
ledge-probably a high-water mark of
some day long past or perhaps the
remnant of a river bed which once ex-
isted when this stream held far greater
volume

  the problem was ticklish enough
climbing to the ledge meant mounting
to the sloping base of the pillar
straightening upward securing some
sort of hold in a crevice or outcrop 
the floor of the ledge kneeling with
one arm crooked about the upright
rock he just could reach across and
touch the finger-tips of one hand to
the sharp edge between pillar and
wall below the ledge swift water
swirled

  twice he essayed to stand and both
times the impossibility of obtaining a
dependable foothold was emphasized
by bruising falls against the pillar and
back into the water once only a quick
grab of both arms saved him from be-
ing swept away

  now in spite of his great reserves
of strength lie felt the dulling of ex-
haustion his shoulders ached the
feet in his watersoaked boots had
numbed into clods he still could
move them from the knees and ankles
but sensation had departed

  freezin he muttered hope
yore warmerll i am little feller

  gaining the kneeling position again
by slow painful degrees he reached
down one hand carefully and unbuck-
led one of his two crossed cartridge
belts that which held the empty hol-
ster of his right-hand gun

  he slipped the fraction of an inch
clutched and froze then inch by inch
with infinite caution he encircled the

slender pillar with the strap while
holding the buckle clamped between
his teeth a leaning forward-a meet-
ing of the two ends-a quick pull

  he made an inarticulate noise of tri-
umph one that was chopped into jig-
gling syllables by his irresponsible
teeth the belt was in place it hung
slantingly in the water with the loop
of the cartridges below toi-yabe
tested it with one hand found that it
could slip  lower then he reached
about and loosened the viselike grip
about his neck securing a sound hold
of the terrified speechless child

  that instant he thrust one knee into
the loop drew up the other foot and
stood erect from that position it was
easy enough to cross the narrow gap
to the ledge

  upon hands and knees little dickie
close beside him feeling his way upon
the down-slope of the ledge toi-yabe
started in the direction of the spot
where he had dropped from surface of
the valley above far far up-stream
there would be a hole in the roof of
this cavern and light-if nothing else
hopeful it seemed too much to ex-
pect that lie could negotiate a way to
the point where his mishap had oc-
curred and there manage to climb to
the hole yet this seemed the great-
est chance probably it was the only
one

  the two made rather rapid progress
for a time toi-yabe keeping his left
hand upon the outside edge and grop-
ing forward and sidewise with his
right before going ahead always he
held dickie inside once the ledge
narrowed to little more than two feet
of width here a wedge of the rock
had dropped away too by sitting
down letting his boots touch the sur-
face of the stream again he managed
to lift himself and the boy along the
broken causeway however to the reas-
suring widening beyond where the
ledge rose a trifle he breathed freer

  the relief was short-lived three

the two made rapid progress for a time


the frontier

or four yards beyond toi-yabes left
hand found a sharp right-angle in the
edge and his groping right encoun-
tered nothingness he inched for-
ward lifted out the colt revolver a
shot blazed into the inky darkness
causing dickie to cry out and shrink
close during the momentary life of
that red-yellow flare toi-yabe saw
that what he had dreaded most lay be-
fore him this was the end of the
ledge true ten or twelve yards be-
yond a six-inch sliver of horizontal
rock still clung to the arching tunnel
wall yet all the rest had broken away
since manifestly it was impossible to
cross the stream or breast the current
they could proceed no farther in this
direction

  but one alternative remained and
toi-yabe his wide mouth tightened
played it he turned and slowly made
his way with the lad back through the
pitch blackness time for them did
not exist since they had fallen into
the water he supposed several hours
had elapsed and now with every
prospect of another blind end to his
ledge of comparative safety he was
tortured by the picture of the suffer-
ing he had brought upon the child-
suffering borne uncomplainingly how-
ever

t the break in the
ledge where the
black speeding sur-
face curved on two
feet below he
leaned cupped his
hand and drank
then offering some
to dickie the water was hard with
mineral yet it lacked even a trace of
alkaline bitterness this showed
clearly that for a long distance up-
stream at least the river did not see
the surface and daylight though toi-
yabe never was to ascertain the fact
the stream likewise kept to its subter-
ranean channel until it mingled its sub-
stance with that of the stern virgin
bound for a mating with the great
colorado

  time unmarked unguessed crawled
along when he was tolerably certain
that he had passed the pillar which had
given him access to the ledge toi-
yabe halted and fired desiring another
brief glimpse there right ahead a
few yards was the self-same pillar or
another exactly like it such similar-
ity was not probable toi-yabe gri-
maccd the progress of the two was
like that of a heavy lizard yet he cer-
tainly had believed they must have

traversed much more than this dis-
tance he continued the grim almost
hopeless journey speaking brief words
of encouragement to dickie

  he reached what seemed the end in-
deed a cave-in of the wall had filled
the ledge with loose rock one large
jagged chunk in particular blocked the
way the remaining shots from toi-
yabes six-gun revealed that the block-
ade extended over a width of only four
or five feet though for all he could do
in climbing the burdened ledge itself
might as well have given away

  methodically reloading the weapon
the prospector probed forward with
one hand leading his charge he soon
found that the risk of clinging to this
jutting as he edged about would be a
poor chance indeed loose rock sliv-
ers fell away and more came from the
wall instead of attempting this toi-
yabe dug carefully with his fingers
lifting out pieces of granite and drop-
ping them in the stream soon he met
the large boulder tentatively he
wrenched and then crowded back in
quick alarm with a grinding crash
quickly followed by a splash the over-
balanced weight of granite fell into
the stream

  toi-yabe who had dared hope for
no such immediate success quickly
seized dickie and edged past the spot
upon which more rock might fall at
any moment he found himself upon
a broadening ascending curve of the
ledge where the low rushing mutter
of the onyx waters seemed to die away
here though he did not pay it much
attention the stream dived still deeper
in a brief arc along the breast of this
curve sheer centrifugal force threw
outward small whitecaps invisible
now

  a dozen yards more and then toi-
yabe stopped quivering-and not
from the cold which had left his veins
there while he wrestled with the cave-
in of rock unless hope deceived his
eyesight ahead and high on the same
side he traveled was a faint but dis-
cernible streak of gray it had to be
light and the presence of light in this
tunnel could mean nothing save an
aperture in the ceiling-possibly just
such a break in the floor of the valley
as that one through which toi-yabe
and the lad had come into peril

  it was characteristic of the tall lean
ex-bandit that an unexpected hope in-
stead of causing him to rush forward
in an impulse of tumultuous relief
held him quiet one interminable min-
ute arm around dickie considering
ithen he drew the newly loaded six-

gun snapped two spoiled cartridges
and obtained an explosion from the
third

  but he saw little during the brief
flash except that a ten-foot ledge in-
clined upward he rose to his feet

  looks good little feller he said

  im c-cold chattered dickie

  that second from perhaps fifty
yards in front and above him a shot
blazed forth in answer to his own the
leaden slug went pttt upon some part
of the rock wall then whined on in
ricochet almost the same instant a
second flash and report came where
the bullet went toi-yabe did not
know he thrust dickie behind him
his gaze was fastened upon the broad
way gently inclining upward in a slow
curve he had caught an ephemeral
glimpse of a crouching figure there at
the top of the slope

  toi-yabe dropped to his elbow
forcing dickie to lie down

  stay right there pard he whis-
pered reloading the fired chambers
of the  he shifted his single remain-
ing belt holster to the rear and began
the indian stalk the other man had
all the advantage yet toi-yabe ob-
sessed by a gnawing sympathy for the
lad whose life had been thrust into his
hands was in  mood to compromise
more than once he had fought to a fin-
ish with an opponent in the chaparral
his bandit days were filled with such
encounters now with the gray light
high to the right becoming more and
more plain he was ready to exercise
every wile and kill without mercy this
unknown man who obstructed the
road

  another might have cried out at-
tempting parley-and surely failing
as circumstances were ordered toi-
yabe believing that the skulker above
would think him hugging the inside
wall bellied forward  the very brink
of the river now he saw vaguely the
wide flat of a horizontal lie of the
ledge though strive as he might he
could distinguish no hint of his un-
known opponent

  a third shot blazed this time toi-
yabe saw momentarily the mans head
and extended arm yet toi-yabe held
his fire he knew now where the other
was waiting and went for that spot
with a minimum of delay knowing
that he himself was shielded by an im-
penetrable blackness toi-yabe cov-
ered the yards swiftly but noiselessly
keeping to the outside

  the grayness was becoming more
pronounced toi-yabe saw that it
must come from a ceiling aperture
chaparejos



some distance beyond and to the side
of his quarry it did not show up the
bed of the ledge however so fol-
lowing a rapid approach of what he
estimated to be forty yards toi-yabe
assumed his slow crawl again leaving
the outside for the first time in a
hand-to-hand tussle as this well might
prove to be he preferred the rock wall
at his back

 who could be the man who was
ready to dispute with lead any en-
croachment upon this peculiar subter-
ranean preserve what was his rea-
son for jealousy toi-yabe creeping
forward would have liked an answer
to both questions

iv

ie expected gun-
fight to a decision
did not occur toi-
yabe had crawled
at least far enough
he thought still
he heard a sound
ahead it was the
aspiration of slow but jerky breathing
then came a low groan some mut-
tered unintelligible words

  toi-yabe frowned a futile de-
coy he edged toward the sound
however rose to his feet his thumb
held back the filed hammer of his six-
gun he hoped grimly that it did not
misfire again from a water-soaked
cartridge when he came to the show-
down

  outside in the big sunlit world a
mere handful of nimbus had been over
the sun for a space of minutes alone
in a painfully blue nevada sky the
cloud held on a while and then gave
up in another clime it might have
been thought the precursor of a storm
here it was something to be looked at
and viewed with wonder of course
no rain was expected

  toi-yabe did not know anything ox
the cloud yet as he inched along
waiting to kill a man whose hand had
fired three times at him-and with-
out excuse-he saw the gray light
brighten become even intense the
broad ledge gradually became limned
by reflected sunlight

  then toi-yabe saw his man

  the prospector did not fire immedi-
ately-and eventually did not fire at
all the fact was that with the grow-
ing light of the inducted sun he saw a
figure sprawled out face against the
rock and right hand limply holding a
weapon far ahead

  toi-yabe watched his thumb hold-
ing back the hammer of the colt thus

he stood while long seconds ticked by

  then he walked forward a step two
silent steps three after due delibera-
tion he reached the prone body quickly
secured its two revolvers and made
certain the man had no knife or der-
ringer concealed

  after that toi-yabe looked more
closely at his antagonist finding him
unconscious he was sheriff bellin-
ger

  repressing his unbounded astonish-
ment toi-yabe hurriedly brought up
dickie and then examined the
wounded sheriff the latter was
wounded twice one bullet had passed
through the right side rather shal-
lowly  whether or not it had damaged
a vital organ the prospector could not
determine the second leaden slug
had shattered bellingers right shin-
bone and undoubtedly was more pain-
ful if not as dangerous the sheriff
had lost a great deal of blood toi-
yabe utilizing the others own clothes
for bandages and a rude compress
managed to check the flow-albeit
from the pools of blood on the rocky
floor he doubted seriously that stone
bellinger ever would recover con-
sciousness

daddy cried the boy when first
he glimpsed the face of the inert man

  he squirmed away from toi-yabe
to run to the side of his idol-the man
who from the first had chosen the grim
pursuit of the laws vengeance rather
than the love he himself had helped to
create

  the hell gasped toi-yabe tol-
man this affair had grown too com-
plicated for even his keen abilities in
analysis the kid belonged to the
sheriff the sheriff had half-recog-
nized the shoes and stockings ap-
parently he toi-yabe unwittingly
had imperiled the lad only to save him
from the subterranean river-and find
at the other end of the cavern stone
bellinger ready to fight to the last
gasp against someone and then there
was the memory of that rapid gunfire
heard across the ridge-shooting which
occurred only a short time after the
sheriff departed from toi-yabes
camp what did it all mean 

  he drew dickie away comforting
the lad assuring him that the daddy
would be all right after hed had a
good long sleep-phrasing hope rather
than certainty then by tactful ques-
tions he drew from the boy a lurid
nightmarish tale of being snatched
from bed gagged and carried away
by a big fat man on horseback toi-
yabe obtained a serviceable descrip-

tion of that big fat man and his
mouth drew into a line haj maddox
what the fools idea could have been
was hard to discern yet motives now
were unimportant maddox once and
for all had placed himself beyond the
pale of sympathy or toleration only
justice could await him now

  the running fight down the neigh-
boring valley with the sheriff riding
hard in pursuit and shooting only at
the legs of hajs fleeing animal in
order not to wound his own son dickie
gave with a dramatic force entirely un-
conscious haj terrified at the unex-
pected meeting which jettisoned his
scheme in an instant thought only of
his own escape riding as hard as he
could force the cayuse he came to
rocky uneven ground down among the
cave formations steadily losing his
lead over the relentless bellinger

  a sudden idea came to the fleeing
criminal passing a black crevice in
the hillside one which looked like it
might drop to the bowels of the earth
haj bent from the saddle and tossed
dickie into it he figured stone bel-
linger would stop and that was ex-
actly what the sheriff did-but for an-
other reason

  both men fired and both scored
hits bellinger tumbled from the sad-
dle while ahead of him the horse of
haj maddox stumbled and pitched
headlong dying and then while
both men were dazed little dickie
scrambled up and climbed to escape
them unaware that his own father was
one of the creatures of this terribly
real nightmare

  later haj realized that now he was
committed either the sheriff and his
boy died right then and there or
haj could plan on stretching hemp
shots were exchanged bellinger was
wounded again but managed to crawl
to the sheltering crevice grinning like
a wolf haj maddox was satisfied he
did not dream of another entrance to
that cavelike hole he settled six-gun
in hand to await the appearance of
either the boy or man he would be
in no danger this sort of pot-shot
gun-fighting suited him right down to
the ground

  toi-yabe did not learn all of this
from dickie yet he could surmise the
situation his face took on the ham-
mered bronze expression well known
to his old associates of bandit days
the killers mask he removed his own
watersoakcd belt and gun replacing it
with the sheriffs two belts and long-
barreled remingtons he hefted the
weapons saw that they were freshly


the frontier

loaded and then slipped them up and
down in their holsters then caution-
ing dickie to remain beside his father
lie climbed up the narrow way to the
irregular opening to the sunlight

the cow-
ddox of
fabe felt
t the kid-
ould be
close to
i of the
cavern waiting like
a bloated spider to pounce upon its
prey the chief fact then to be de-
termined was the exact direction and
whereabouts of the ambush just back
of the shielding slate overhang which
made an elbow of the crevice at ground
level he froze to immobility listening

  yet it was not through the sense of
hearing that toi-yabe discovered the
necessary information not a sound
came to him haj if he were there
had found a restful position appar-
ently and was enjoying the anticipa-
tory wait

  toi-yabe suddenly sniffed gently
borne to him diffused but yet pun-
gent came an aroma he recognized
one which set up within him the acute
appetite of long deprivation-cigarette
smoke the smoke reached his nos-
trils but where did it come from
there was almost no breeze at all

  then he suddenly tautened a wisp
of bluish gray fumes holding together
drifted lazily across his vision coming
from the left well haj was there
one time was as good as another
crouching his muscles coiled like steel
springs he drew both guns then
with a wild terrific shout of jeering
triumph he leaped up like a jack-in-
the-box and alighted-running and
shooting he had one brief glimpse
of haj maddox back against one
houlder while his left elbow rested on
another maddox shot toi-yabe
shot twice while scarcely on the
ground all three bullets went wild
then toi-yabe chuckling in sinister
fashion dove behind the identical
boulder which sheltered his enemy

  ive come for yore ears maddox
toi-yabe chuckled in a blood-curdling
tone be sayin yore prayers hom-
bre if yuh got any he went on
without cessation the while watching
eagle-eyed for the slightest glimpse of
the criminal who huddled on the other
side of the rock

  toi-yabe knew his man the leap
and yell had been carefully calculated

and successful now while possessing
no real advantage in position or other-
wise over maddox toi-yabe played
deliberately for the yellow streak he
firmly believed maddox possessed as
the assortment of threats and promises
came about the four-foot boulder the
shrinking appalled kidnappers nerve
broke i aint got no fight with yuh
toi-yabe he quavered at last les
call it quits

  no quits retorted toi-yabe he
calmly shot away an inch of stetson
rim which showed for an instant at
one side of the sheltering boulder
throw yore guns away an reach for
the sky

  yuh aint goin to-

  ill count five then im cornin
one-two-three-

  i-i give up came the yelp of
terror seemingly unadulterated

  a pair of six-guns clanked to the
rocks and the green-swarthy hatless
head and two upraised arms of haj
maddox appeared an odd desperate
gleam shone from his black beads of
eyes nevertheless

  at a loss to account for it for a sec-
ond toi-yabe studied his prisoner
then he noted that hajs hands were
held aloft palms backward-and he
smiled grimly an old trick but good
at times

  aright come here he bade
seeming to let his revolvers droop
carelessly

  it seemed to be what haj had hoped
to see with a sound between a grunt
and squeal he suddenly yanked down
his right hand

  that same split second a slug from
one of the big remingtons smashed
through his navel the stratagem had
failed hajs palmed derringer ex-
ploded indeed just as he buckled
screaming but the bullet merely
smudged a whitish streak upon the
rock between toi-yabes feet and rico-
cheted away

  merciless grim toi-yale lifted
the dead body of maddox and dragged
it far down the valley dropping it
without ceremony then he returned
to dickie and his father

  bellinger was conscious

  did yuh get him he queried in a
whisper

  toi-yabe nodded

  hes out there-the only hombre i
ever hope to kill i wouldnt cover up
from the buzzards he added but
now ill get yuh a drink i want yuh
to take it easy the kid here an me
plan to move my camp over thisaway

 so we can lake care of yuh right is
 that o k

    the trip over and back and then the
 ensuing days of bellingers early con-
 valescence were strange days indeed
 in the career of toi-yabe tolman
 shamelessly from the first he made a
 partner of the five-year-old though
 realizing the idolatry of stone which
 occupied nine-tenths of the lads heart
 little by little toi-yabe learned the
 whole pathetic story of the kilts and
 the home-made chaparejos

   once when alone he clenched a fist
 and shook it at the back of the sheriff
 who now was sitting up

   damn yuh muttered toi-yabe
 id take pleasure in belting yuh a cou-
 ple myself if yuh was well a father
 -huh

   but then while dickie had the
 parent he worshipped all to himself
 and signs of a different attitude were
 plain in the expression of bellinger
 toi-yabe occupied himself mysteri-
 ously he pretended to be prospect-
 ing a far canyon branching from this
 valley actually with some of his
 own clothes and one of bellingers
 worn bearskin chaps he was making
 strange upward and downward passes
 with a coarse needle

   then came a day when he called the
 boy and made him don a certain cos-
 tume-complete in imitation of his
 daddys even to the belts and holsters
 -the latter cut down from those of
 maddox then he made the impatient
 dickie await call while he squatted
 down beside the sheriff then and
 there the latter heard the entire story
 of the boy he had shunned

   come here dickie concluded
 toi-yabe rising unexpectedly

   with a glad excited shout dickie
 asmile from ear to ear dashed out
 proudly stopped threw out his chest
 and slapped his hands to the empty
 holsters

   i got pants-an real honest-to-
 time chaps he cried joyfully

   that-thars yore son remarked
 toi-yabe dryly avoiding looking at
 stone bellinger down whose rugged
 cheeks tears now coursed frankly if
 twas me id say yuh didnt deserve
 him

    and with that he turned on his heel
 just seeing the lad run to his father
 and went to where the laden burros
 and xny were waiting

   cmon cochise he bade quietly
  s time we was mooching along i
 reckon though somehow its goin to

 -	be damn lonesome in the next valley

by alanson skinner

author of the american indian winking bear goes to war etc

a man should stick to one woman-especially if that woman is extremely jealous and has a temper of her
own-yes and more especially if prospective spouse number two is as ugly as roaming chiefs old
mdow so very properly bright horns took precautions to avoid further matrimonial entanglement

know partner
larked bright
rns my sauk
ian friend i
to leave our
ip on the deep
k in a hurry
because the widow
of the old pawnee roaming chief
showed up looking for one of our peo-
ple who had got her to release him
when he was a prisoner in her village
by promising to elope with her well
as i told you that indian was me as
a matter of fact though winking
bear the name of my no-account cou-
sin was the name that i had given her
and as it had been too dark for her to
see my face it looked as though my
cousin was going to have a hard time
to get out of it t had the news from
a young relative in time to pack up
and get out of camp because i did
not wish to do anything that might in-
terfere with winking bear and his ar-
rangements

  well that old pawnee woman was
something to have bad dreams about
wah her face was warty she had a
long red nose and she was as skinny
as a lean jack-rabbit and fight say
partner i once saw her drive old
roaming chief all over the prairie
beating him with the flat of a war-

club so when i left the yellow
earth village for the creek country
my medicine told me to keep right on
going and i never stopped until i got
clean over to the spavinaw hills in
the cherokee nation

  not at all did that old horned toad
show up at the deep fork alone she
fetched them all along her relations
there were about twenty-five pawnee
warriors with presents and horses
and they evidently meant to have a big
time at the old ladys wedding to
winking bear now keokuk who
was our chief at the time was very
friendly toward the pawnee and old
lady roaming chief was a pretty im-
portant person among the skidi band
so when the word came that she was
there keokuk called in all his braves
and they turned out with their best
deerskin clothes and feathers on and
their heads newly shaved and painted
and with their war-spears and clubs

  wah from what they told me
afterward they made a fine show and
they came and escorted the old skele-
ton into the camp keokuk feasted
them all and afterward when the
dancing was over and a whole lot of
presents had been given back and
forth she told keokuk just what she
had come there for of course keo-
kuk was pleased and he sent half a


dozen braves over to winking bears
lodge where he was eating with his
menomini wife at the time winking
bear couldnt figure out just what the
chief wanted him for but he thought
in his heart since the pawnee were in
camp that it must have something to
do with the horses that he and i had
stolen from them a couple of moons
before when i was captured in roam-
ing chiefs lodge but there wasnt
any way to escape so he had to go

  when he got over there and went
into keokuks big bark house he saw
the big crowd of pawnee all gathered
together and that homely old widow
who was the main one sitting beside
keokuk in the guest place at the back
of the lodge smoking a long pipe like
a man she was so hard to look at that
my cousin felt his stomach completely
turn over

   hau pawnee woman here is
your bridegroom the chief spoke

  really it is in my heart almost to
be sorry for winking bear when i
think of it that old fence lizard
jumped up from her place and before
poor winking bear could even draw
breath she threw her arms around him
and gave him a kiss a wet kiss right
on his mouth and her whiskers
scratched him like so many quills from
a porcupine


the frontier

  hagwai yelled my miserable
cousin hold on never before have
i seen this woman

   be not so bashful boy she an-
swered in pretty good sauk too i
am your own little fawn whom you
eloped with from the skidi camp and
who would have been your bride two
moons past if it had not been that i
fell from our horse when the warriors
were pursuing us and now i have
come to claim you

  at once it became clear to winking
bear that it must have been me bright
horns who had stolen the woman
no i had never thought that it was
necessary to tell him what had hap-
pened to me after he had betrayed and
abandoned me that night but just then
not at all was it difficult for him to fin-
ish the picture and also alas he be-
gan to worry about what his first wife
that menomini woman whom he
cheated me out of would have to say
about it of course with the indian
people not at all are we limited to one
wife by custom oh no but then
again it is not wise to cross the will of
a determined woman and winking
bear was rather of the belief in his
heart that his wife would not like it
even though this old widow roaming
chief was so homely that a buzzard
would never have lit on her carcass

   now of a truth and the sun
hears me say it you have made a mis-
take winking bear protested never
indeed was i the man who eloped with
you the earth our mother is wit-
ness that i never set eyes  you be-
fore this moment pawnee woman
may the thunderbirds destroy me
with lightning if i speak not straight
but then oh keokuk my chief and
you too pawnee woman my cousin
bright horns that snake that dog
that crookcd speaker of a sooth i
know that he was on a raid to the skidi
settlement he is the man no doubt
at all but he made love to this beauti-
ful maiden and deceived her and gave
her my name let him be brought
here and give an account of himself

  the old pawnee hag was about to
protest but keokuk signed to his
braves

   fetch him here bright horns
he ordered

  but they could not find me in the
camp partner by that time i was
about three miles south of kelleyville
and traveling fast winking bear man-
aged to get to his wife and he told her
explaining that it was a trick played on
him by me his cousin i dont know
what that menomini woman really

thought but when she saw the paw-
nee widow by words at least she
agreed with him she it was that
hunted around camp and found that
worthless young man that brought me
the news of the pawnee coming i had
paid him most handsomely to go back
home and say nothing but as soon as
i was out of sight he had sneaked in
again

   why to the spavinaw hills i
heard him say he was going over be-
yond the creek country this worth-
less one told her and not at all will
he return did he say until a vision
which he had is fulfilled a one-eyed
creek half-breed was to give him a
spotted pony before he would pack up
and come homeward were the words
that he said to his wife

  when they found that out very
sure was winking bear in his heart
that i was the one who had made him
the trouble he hustled around and
at last he got hold of a poor miserable
old spotted pony blind in one eye and
almost too toothless to eat the next
thing to do was to locate a creek half-
breed with one eye but my cousin
winking bear having some creek
blood that too with the help of his
relatives was he able to accomplish
they found a creek mulatto who had
had one eye put out with a razor by a
black-meat negro and they hired
him to chase up to the spavinaw hills
and give me the horse telling me that
he was instructed to do so in a dream

ell partner not
any such vision that
i would have to
stay up there until
i was given a calico
pony by a creek
half-breed with one
eye did i have as a
matter of course that was just an
excuse to satisfy my woman the sis-
ter of winking bear so that she
would pack up and go away from there
with me but wah when that half-
breed appeared with the horse she
wanted right away to go back and me
well i began to think there was some-
thing medicine alxmt it in my own
heart never at all did i suspect it
was a trap until i got right back to
deep fork and keokuk sent his
braves to pounce on me and fetch me
into his wigwam to face the pawnee
woman

  of course there was my cousin
winking bear with his face as blank
as a smooth stone but laughing in his
heart at me and the easy way that he

was getting out of his trouble the
pawnee old witch seemed to recognize
me also she hugged me and kissed
me and began to get out a lot of pres-
ents for me and for keokuk hey
alas pretty bad is the way that it
began to look for me and my woman
she was right there too in the lodge
and looking on not at all did i like
the way that her eyes blazed at me

   oh keokuk great chief of the
yellow earths i shouted for the old
man was a bit deaf why am i who
am but a young man and as yet have
never done anything worthy of men-
tion selected to receive this honor

  the old man grinned

   why to be sure as a matter of
course this is your beautiful little
fawn woman with whom you eloped
from the pawnee village of skidi he
answered she fell from your horse
in the pursuit set up by her husband
and he recaptured her but now he is
dead and she is seeking her bride-
groom be happy tonight we will
have a big feast and i will give you
each five horses for i am glad to see
our people allied with the powerful
pawnee

  partner about this time i felt like
a man who has had a skinful of fire-
water the night before and is only
just beginning to come back to his
senses huh very sick was the way
that i felt inside from the appearance
of that old pawnee horned toad and
again even if she had been as beauti-
ful as an antelope my wife is a very
jealous woman i began to call on my
medicine and play for a little time

   alas o chief i regret that i
cannot accept your horses i spoke
up not very well known is it about
our nation but when i was born at
the very same time i say did my
mother give birth to a twin brother
with me exactly like me is the way
that they say he looks though i have
never seen him alas at no more than
the age of three was he stolen away by
the comanche but i have reason to
believe that he is still alive since many
times since have i been blamed for the
scrapes that he gets into

  old keokuk looked long and hard
at me and sat there smoking as for
the pawnee woman she paid no at-
tention but kept ou unpacking her
presents apparently she was well
content with the man that was brought
her winking bear had escaped but
not at all did she mean to let me get
out of her clutches as for our chief
hm well very likely he did not believe
that straight was the way that i was
a bride too many



talking and yet maybe in his heart
there was after all a little pity for me
for am i not bright horns a man of
the buffalo clan who has done much
to build up the honor of our people
something like this it was in my heart
to remind him of when he spoke to
me

    it is good bright horns my son
you say that your twin brother still
lives in the comanche country very
well just now a white buffalo hunter
has come into our camp i will send
for him and see if he can give us word
of your brother if your brother ex-
ists then no doubt he is really the man
if not tonight we will celebrate the
marriage ceremony between you and
this pawnee woman

   so the old chief sent out for a mes-
senger and while we were waiting i
tried to look at my wife out of the cor-
ner of one eye but she was gone from
the wigwam then i got the attention
of straight horns a man of my clan
who was a brave and served keokuk

   five horses if you will stand
away from the door and let me run for
it i offered six if you manage to
block the way and give me a good
start

  but straight horns was of the
opinion that once i had cheated him in
the matter of a swapping of horses
and he pretended he could not see me
besides winking bear that ill-smell-
ing sore-eyed coyote held up seven
fingers meaning that was the number
of ponies that he was willing to give
to have me held there eh wah that
was the worst fix that i have ever been
caught in and once the osage found
me taking a swim naked in an old
spring-hole without any weapons

  every time i studied that old paw-
nee woman the bottom seemed to fall
out of my stomach and every time i
thought of what my wife would say i
really desired to be back in the spring-
hole surrounded by the osage and lis-
tening to their laughter

man were hard up because cherokee
bill and his outlaws had run off all
their stock but i got them all back for
them and kept them from starving

five horses if you will let me run for it

i offered

they and their little children am i
not called bright horns that was
the obligation i had him under a few
words of the long knife tongue  am
able to master

  my fiend tellum yes you don
know me i whispered help me my
fiend

  that white man he never made
out to hear me he just walks in
and stands there

  do you know him this man
keokuk asks him in the sign lan-
guage

  pope filbert he shut one eye and
studied me long time very hard

   no cant say i do keokuk he
signs back but ive seen a man just
like him

  where signed keokuk

  why over in the comanche coun-
try

    can you fetch him here 

    no

   why not

   he is dead only last week i
helped bury him he and some friends
stole a bunch of cheyenne horses the
cheyenne chased them and caught
them and put out their fires

  well right now keokuk and the
braves and even the old pawnee wo-
man began to believe that i had been
talking straight almost did winking
bear commence to believe it and part-
ner i was so surprised to hear the
white man back up my whole story
that i began to think that i must have

had a twin brother myself that old
pawnee horned toad began to weep
and wail and tear her hair the guards
let me go and i heard her calling to
the men of her party to pack up be-
cause she was going right over where
her lover was buried and make a sacri-
fice at his grave yes the white man
said that for two horses and four buf-
falo robes he would guide her right to
it i went back to my lodge to get my
best buffalo horse

   really to my mysterious brothers
grave i ought to be likewise making a
pilgrimage i thought in my heart

  besides i also considered that it
was better to put off explaining to my
woman about it until she had cooled
ofl a litde

  but when i got to the place where
my wigwam had stood there was noth-
ing there but the poles the ponies
were all gone my buffalo horse and
all the others there was a boy loaf-
ing around a boy of the thunder clan
and he spoke to me

   oh yes bright horns your wo-
man has gone up to yuchi creek to
visit her mother he told me the
ponies and all the household utensils
she has taken with her only your
buffalo horse and about three other
ponies i saw her give them to that
white fellow just before keokuk sent
for him for a long time she was
talking with him

   huh so that is the way of it
in what manner of a way was my wo-
man apparently feeling when she de-
parted i asked him

  well as a matter of fact very
red in the face was your woman
hardly even pleasantly did she talk
even to me

  when i had studied this over i de-
cided that i would go and borrow a
pony of winking bear surely i
thought in my heart even my vaga-
bond cousin will not refuse me espe-
cially when it was through him that i
find myself in this extremity

ut when i got to
where winking
bears wigwam was
standing in the
morning exactly in
the same condition
as mine did i find
it poles only and
there was winking bear all alone sit-
ting with his blanket pulled up over his
head as though his heart was bad i
went up to him

   hau cousin i said to him but
he answered me nothing i say wink-

soon i
heard the sound of
many footsteps
and a lot of our na-
tion came into the
wigwam and with
them the white
buffalo hunter
when i saw who it was my heart
started beating once more a little be-
hold it was pope filbert for that is
the way that they name him and once
in a very tight place i had managed to
get him out of it yes he and his wo-


the frontier

ing bear where is your wigwam and
where is your woman 

   huh well as a matter of fact she
does not believe the truth about that
pawnee widow not at all have i
been able to convince her that i am in-
nocent and so she has departed for
her friends up at the yuchi creek and
taken everything with her

  and so i sat down beside winking
bear in hopes that between us we
could think up some way of doing
something to get presents and square
it up again with our women which
of course in the long run we were
able to do although it was not easy
of that  shall tell you some day

though pioneers reported that
grass in the west was boundless
and inexhaustible it is the sad truth
that the open range was exhausted in
only thirty-five years after the begin-
ning of the great cattle drives from
texas by  practically no part
of the west was unstocked indeed
the land was so seriously overstocked
with cattle that the native range grasses
disappeared and the range itself was
nearly ruined

  it seems incredible-and was unbe-
lievable to the first settlers-that range
which could support millions of buffalo
would be ruined by longhorns the
first white men crossed the plains
through grass from one to three feet
in height and so thick that a thousand
cows and five thousand sheep and a
cavvy of five hundred horses grazed
across it without leaving a track plain
enough for a rear guard to follow
this was in  and the fact is at-
tested by the relation of the span-
iard castenada who accompanied cor-
onados army

  as late as  alexander majors
of the famous frontier freighting firm
of russell majors and waddell
wrote that he had wintered fifteen
thousand work oxen on the open plains
without providing hay grain or shel-

  oh yes the pawnee woman and
her party well as a matter of fact
that pope filbert took them right out
into the country between the coman-
che and the cheyenne holdings he
steered them for a big bottom along
the south fork of the canadian full of
cottonwoods and then he left them
well as a matter of fact they pushed
on but when they got there not at all
did they find the body of my twin
brother wrapped up in a blanket and
stuck in the fork of a tree no right
into a big camp of cheyenne and ara-
paho did they blunder

  huh wah those cheyenne ran
the pawnee clean back to skidi with-

ter of any kind not only had the
cattle come through the winter in good
condition but feed was so plentiful
that many had fattened enough to be
fit for beef about  just before
the stocking of the ranges began in
earnest the range in certain texas
counties would support three hundred
cows to the square mile or one to each
two acres on the same land fifteen
years later a cow needed five acres and
by  ten acres was the average
overgrazing had reduced the produc-
tiveness of the range to one-fifth its
original value

  for this depreciation however it
would be unjust to blame the early
settlers the grass was free to every-
one if a ranchman did not put as
many cows  his land as it would pos-
sibly support someone else would
drive in a herd or a lock of sheep
that would eat the grass down to the
roots the small amount of land it
was legal to homestead was not exten-
sive enough to raise cattle profitably
and if public lands were seized and
fenced illegally a range war was liable
to develop between the squatter and
neighboring owners who claimed-
truly enough-that they had as much
right to the land as he

  the buffalo herds were constantly

out letting them take time to stop for
breathing it is said and then the paw-
nee came out of their village and ran
the gieyenne right back again pope
filbert says that they caught the chey-
enne chief and were going to put him
to torture because he was a bad in-
dian who had slain plenty of pawnee
but they let him off  condition that
he marry the old horned toad woman
the wife of roaming chief maybe
they did i dont know but me-hag-
wai- would take the torture for
partner it wouldnt last so long and
think you how would it be to spend
the rest of a long life looking at that
pawnee woman

on the move grazing from north to
south with the seasons though they
might eat off the grass on a given terri-
tory they would then move on and the
forage would have months in which to
get its growth seed and cure for win-
ter feed in the effort to increase the
value of range lands the forest ser-
vice today is advocating a return to
the method of the buffaloes in the
spring for example the herds will be
moved into the desert to eat the fila-
ree grass which lasts for only two
months beginning about the middle of
february they will then be driven
into the mountains for summer range
and for the next six months there will
be no cows in the desert forage will
grow undisturbed until november
when the herds return to their winter
range

  however even today on the public
domain there is nothing to prevent an
owner from using the desert in sum-
mer though one cow grazing then will
eat grass that might have grown into
forage enough to support several cows
through the winter what is free to
the individual is ruinously expensive
to the cattle industry as a whole-and
on ranges once considered excellent it
requires today forty acres to feed a
single cow the year round

free grass ruined the open range

by eugene cunningham

author of beginnings of great cities the luck of lombardy bart etc

a second robin hood was the romantic sam bass to the cowboys of texas-but quite another matter
was he to the railroad companies and the peace officers fm whom he and his gang made life miserable

he trace wound
through the rolling
wooded prairies of
the n a t i o n
w here clearings
were carpeted with
rustling dead leaves
and dry grass the
fight spring wagon bounced over ruts
though the team was wearied by a long
day in harness and the wagons pace
was slow the driver was a cowboy
-just a lean brown cowboy with noth-
ing to set him apart particularly from
any of a thousand others in this year
of  when texas trail herds were
moving north and ever north in the
great hegira that was to stock ranges
from the nation to the selkirks with
texas longhorns

  the black-haired man on the seat
beside the driver was shorter-five full
inches below six feet-and powerfully
muscled of shoulder twenty-six years
old he was with a face that might
have belonged to a boy for all the
brown mustache at which he now
tugged thoughtfully as restless dark
eyes looked around in half a dozen
ways at once

  suddenly the driver who had been
moving restlessly on the box-seat
jerked in the travel-worn horses so
that they fairly sat down upon their
launches

  i been a-smellin smoke for five
minutes he muttered i wonder

now if-

  one lean brown hand the left
gripped the lines the right had

curled about the sinister black butt of
a long-barreled frontier colt

  i smell it too nodded his com-
panion tensely hell i see it
yonder

  a light film that was barely de-
tectable against the treetops a hundred
yards ahead showed faintly gray

  an that damn axle a-squeakm
like a dyin shote snarled the driver
reckon they heard us

  he was furious-faced glaring at the
lacy smoke-film as at sign of an enemy
but the dark stocky man was  the
ground with a snaky wriggle and he
took with him the  winchester car-
bine that had been hanging in its scab-
bard from the wagon-seat he van-
ished into the bushes and with an oath
the driver flipped the lines in loops
about the brake-handle and leaped
down to follow

  he was not so good a woodsman as
the other so his progress to be noise-
less must be slower he met the dark-
haired man coming back grinning
there was something tight-lipped
rather grim about that smile which
showed large white teeth

  soldiers he whispered theyve
already heard us we just got to go
on and trust to luck theyre sneak-
in into the brush right now to look us
up

  they went back to the wagon quick-
ly mounted to the seat again and drove
on fifty seventy-five yards for-
ward then from the brush on each
side of the trace burst blue-clad men
afoot a smart boyish lieutenant

stepped up to the front wheel

  who are you he demanded

  the driver looked sidelong at his
companion who grinned down at the
officer

  why he drawled were a couple
o cowboys a-goin home to santone
our names wouldnt mean nothin i
reckon been- vaguely he waved
his arm to indicate the vast spaces be-
hind him-up north with a trail herd
charlie howells trail herd
cavalrymen had edged closer to the
wagon by this time glancing in curi-
ously at the jumble of bedding and
clothes-bags the black-haired man
who had done the explaining to the
lieutenant gave them  heed still he
grinned down quite frankly and
friendly upon the officer

  if you dont mind capn he said
wed like to camp along with you-all
tonight by gosh wish we could
make a trade with you to ride with us
till we get clean out o the nation
he laughed infectiously two nights
back men bill here we camped with
a bunch we overtook we never got
what you might call a good nights
sleep i seen wild-lookin fellows but
the tall one a-leadin that gang he took
the prize we was sure glad to get
away next mornin an i dont mind
say in we sort o figgered sos one o
us was always facin their way

  the nation isnt much of a health-
resort nodded the lieutenant smiling
n his turn well come along well
see that you have a good nights sleep
tonight anyway




the frontier

  the wagon moved on with the cav-
alrymen accompanying into a wide
clearing where the twenty-odd soldiers
of the detachment had bivouacked
after supper the two cowboys sought
out the lieutenant who alone had a
tent he was lonely being the only
officer with the detachment also he
had been thinking over the reference
to a hard bunch somewhere to the
north the cowboys found him ready
to talk

  were up here scouting around for
some train-robbers who held up a u
p train at ogallala nebraska he
told them as they sat smoking outside
the tent there were six altogether
in the gang we heard that two were
killed shortly after the robbery at a
little place called buffalo stage up in
kansas

  hell them fellowsll never come
down this way cried the taller cow-
boy he who had driven the wagon
with much emphasis not much

  the dark-haired man shot a furious
glance sidelong at the emphatic one

  an why not  he snapped dont
ever tom dick an harry thats on
the dodge head for the nation you
think with them fancy boots o yours
bill reckon ol lengthys gang
that was so free with hard looks for
us is a bunch o sunday school super-
intendents mebbe  could you get up
in court an swear that they wasnt this
gang that stuck up that train 

  mebbe youre right frank nod-
ded the driver meekly

  how many were in this gang you
camped with thus the lieutenant
leaning forward eagerly

  why the tall fellow an three orn-
ery lookin customers that is they
hadnt had a wash or shave for a right
smart while horses looked like theyd
been hard rid-

  he was rolling a cigarette the black-
haired man now he looked up side-
way at the lieutenant as he put away
durham and papers with the ready
grin that showed his white teeth

  probly didnt look no worse at
that he smiled than men bill
here

  the lieutenant laughed with him
then sobered abruptly

  well im glad you fellows hap-
pened along he remarked i think
ill have a look at your back-trail to-
morrow aud see if i can have a talk
with lengthy and his friends four
eh by jove that would be the
tally now if they killed two in kan-
sas

lhind the spring-
w a g o  rolling
south again with
dawn the cavalry
camp had vanished
the troopers were
in the saddle head-
ing north to inves-
tigate lengthy the black-haired
man turned on the box-seat and his
white teeth showed he shook with
noiseless laughter

  an hes goin to have a look at
lengthy he exploded suddenly
oh lawdy i sure wish him lots o
luck

  well he pitched a big scare into
me just the same nodded jack
davis sourly when he says hes a-
lookin for train-robbers sam i could
count the bars on the winder

  he never scared me half as much
as you did grunted sam bass irrita-
bly you blame fool you like to
make him suspicious o us

  do you reckon they are a-lookin
for us jack davis was plainly un-
easy at the thought hell mebbe
we better not figger on goin to den-
ton sam we got twenty thousand
between us lets head for south
america

  no sam bass square jaw was
set and his mouth tight beneath the
brown mustache no sir theres
folks in denton i want to show a few
they always said id never amount to
nothin a-runnin around the country
like i did clean down to dallas to race
the denton mare i want to parade
down the street a-throwin twenty-
dollar gold-pieces over the bars well
have a look though before we ride
in

  jack davis whose nerves were tense
from uncertainty these days and who
shared none of sam bass pleasure at
nearing denton nodded gloomily

   s a good idee he said but me
i wisht we was high-tailin it for south
america

  to which sam replied with a glint
of white teeth beneath his mustache as
they squatted on the edge of the bot-
toms waiting for dusk and his trip to
the house of a certain good friend

  if sheriff everhart and certain oth-
ers of the oldsters in the community
had looked askance at sam and his
wild ways almost without exception
the younger generation had been al-
ways on his side as the owner of that
little sorrel beauty the denton mare
he had been known far and wide
known and liked immensely

   it was not altogether that he was a

rider without peer a dead shot with
winchester or colt leader in any dar-
ing enterprise of the boys a master
cowboy nor was his popularity born
wholly of generosity and a certain
rough chivalry though these qualities
he had in large measure others have
had the every characteristic of sam
bass yet have waked no such fierce
loyalty as this stocky dark-eyed cow-
boy knew such admiration in cow-
land where he is a heroic figure even
today

  from friends in denton sam learned
that an ogallala man an ex-express
messenger had suspected the six cow-
boys of the train robbery though the
officials had not been suspicious of
them as in the days after the robbery
they mingled with sheriffs and mar-
shals and railroad detectives in ogal-
lala he had trailed the party south-
ward this ex-messenger and spying
upon their camp had heard them dis-
cuss the crime had learned their plans
their real names had even seen them
handling bright new gold-pieces of the
year  his knowledge he had
communicated to the officials the
law wanted sam bass and jack davis
-wanted them hard

   so to jack davis hiding in the elm-
bottoms sam bass took back the story
of the search and the large reward of-
fered for them to the authenticated
report of the death of collins and ilef-
fridge two of their gang he added
the account of the killing of another
jim berry in his home town mexico
missouri where berrys shining new
gold-pieces had connected him with the
robbery

  that leaves just three out  the
six said sam seems  dad un-
derwood never went to missoury with
jim berry anyway they never got
him

   i told you wed better hit for south
america complained jack davis
whose bump of discretion seems to
have been well-developed  taint too
late now lets high-tail it sam we
cant buck all this

  ah whats to be scared of
scoffed sam those large white teeth
showing in his famous grin dont

i	know this-here country like the palm
o my hand dont be losin your
nerve jack well just stick here an
be damned to em to catch us

  but jack davis was beyond persua-
sion he never had thought such a
hornets nest would be aroused by that
u p robbery while planning it
collins had stressed the large cliance
of their never being recognized to
sam bass



be on the dodge in the face of such
widespread and earnest search broke
davis nerve so from the elm-bot-
toms outside of denton jack davis
rode hell-for-leather rode out of the
picture entirely whether he made
south america or started afresh un-
der another name in the states there
is no authentic report but certain it
is that neither he nor old dad under-
wood ever paid the penalty officially
for the crime

am bass who
had left denton
that spring a lik-
able bull-headed
but honest cowboy
came home a fam-
ous outlaw fit to
mention with jesse
james and the youngers nor did he
lack apologists texas had always
held itself somewhat aloof from na-
tional affairs what a man did else-
where seldom worried the texans so
long as he obeyed the code in their
midst

  now it was complained that texan
authorities were pulling nebraska
chestnuts from what might well be a
hot fire that sam bass was being per-
secuted in this state when he had com-
mitted no crime whatsoever against
the sovereignty of texas

 meanwhile moving through the
well-known county with a surety a
prescience almost that baffled his pur-
suers sam bass gained a following
attracted by his reputation-perhaps
by thought of that not-yet-spent ten
thousand in shiny gold-pieces of -
men appeared unobtrusively in the
elm-bottoms

 so came henry underwood with
arkansas johnson sebe barnes jim
murphy young frank jackson pipes
herndon later two or three others
not so well known joined the gang
daring dangerous men some of theses
men with records as gun-fighters as
hard characters when on the prod
but sam bass was their undisputed
leader

  not long could such a group be con-
tent to ride into the little hamlets of
denton and dallas and tarrant coun-
ties to belly up to the bar and
amuse themselves with occupations so
mild as the mere downing of old jor-
dan and shooting at marks-in or out
of the saloons-and talking of past do-
ings the logical thought came to bass
that he could be hunted no more than
he was he had committed no crime
in texas yet texan officers chased

him he had the name it would cost
him little or nothing to get the game

  the gangs first job was the robbery
of a texas and pacific train at eagle
ford some seven miles west of dal-
las it was a simple job to stop the
train near the sleepy little farming vil-
lage and go through it thereafter
two or three similar robberies were
executed with no features particularly
interesting considering the numbers
in sam bass gang the profit was
small averaging perhaps five hundred
dollars per man in each robbery it
is not his train-robberies which give
the interest to the career of sam bass
upon which his tradition rests but the
masterly fashion in which for months
he tied sheriffs posses and texas ran-
gers into knots

  john b jones was adjutant-gen-
eral of texas during - and so
commanded the texas rangers jones
was an able and experienced officer
and the train-robberies of sam bass
which were becoming very frequent
roused him to unusual energy hav-
ing visited denton dallas and the sur-
rounding country personally he organ-
ized a new company of thirty rangers
at dallas giving the command to cap-
tain june peak

  to this company was given the spe-
cific duty of capturing the sam bass
gang but figuratively if not actually
sam mocked captain peak and his
clumsy inexperienced recruits it is
said that counting rangers and sher-
iffs posses at least a hundred men
now took the trail of texas train-
robber premier yet tradition has it
also that during his time on the
dodge sam himself was rarely if
ever driven out of the three adjoining

it was a simple jok to stop the train

counties of denton dallas and tar-
rant the wooded nature of the coun-
try in this locality made it simple for
him to elude the blundering officers

  not always did the gang hold to-
gether now bass second-in-com-
mand the daredevil arkansas john-
son was killed at salt creek in wise
county by captain peaks rangers
then pipes herndon and jim mur-
phy were captured sam himself with
sebe barnes and young frank jack-
son were the only members out of
jail and they hugged the elm-bottoms
of denton county the handwriting
on the wall became clear now this
dodging might go on almost indefin-
itely but the nerve-racking strain was
telling on them all they were weary
of it sam decided to leave his beloved
north texas and in mexico or some
other foreign country make a new
start

  to general jones by this time the
intent to capture or kill sam bass had
become an obsession we may shrug
away mention of stool pigeons and
traitors as necessary units of police
equipment but by texans generally
and especially by the cowboys who re-
garded sam bass as one of themselves
the methods of general jones were
given no fancy names whatever

  jim murphy was the tool chosen by
jones to murphy then in jail await-
ing federal trial for robbery of the
mails jones went with the offer of
freedom on condition that he execute a
certain plan which would result in sam
bass betrayal into the officers hands
murphy to give him the tiny modicum
of credit one may at first rejected the
proposal even though life imprison-
ment seemed its alternative but jones
was persistent and finally threats and
promises together overcame murphys
remembrance of sam bass many
kindnesses to the needy murphy clan

jim murphy zvas arrested and then re-
  leased  bail

he jumped his bond at tyler and then
  took the train for terrell

but major jones had posted jim and
  that was all a stall

jtwas only a plan to capture sam be-
  fore the coming fall

  so runs a verse of the old ballad
with the clear unquibbling judgment
of the outdoors it tells unmincingly
the tale of jones plan to trap sam
bass

  murphy having been released on
bail supplied by certain men in jones
confidence jumped his bond and a


the frontier

great hue-and-cry was raised as had
been planned it preceded jim murphy
to denton where he rejoined sam
bass sebe barnes and frank jackson
but friends of bass and barnes had
written warning that this looked to be
a snare that the bondsmen were prob-
ably creatures of general jones con-
fronted with these letters for his very
life murphy played his part in mas-
terly fashion-without however con-
vincing sam and barnes the white-
faced protesting traitor read murder
in their hard eyes and restless gun-
hands

  frank jackson barely twenty-two
years old had become with arkansas
johnsons death sams right-hand
man now frank took murphys part
declaring his belief in the traitors
good faith but there were tense mo-
ments in the dusky elm-bottoms with
sam and sebe barnes glaring murder-
ously at the trembling murphy before
frank jackson flung down his ulti-
matum  they must kill him before they
killed murphy

  it was decided to rob a bank and
then strike out for mexico so early
in july  the four riders left den-
ton county forever heading south
just outside of waco the four made
camp and looked over the town in a
saloon frequented by cattlemen so tra-
dition has it sam bass flung down a
twenty-dollar gold-piece upon the bar
with a bitter sentence that sums up all
the pros and cons of such a life as his
weighing all the tinsel glory against the
myriad hardships of the outlaws lot

  there goes the last u p gold-
piece he grunted watching moodily
as it spun toward the bartenders wait-
ing hand an a lot  good they
done me

  sam decided that a job in waco
would he too dangerous to attempt
hence the quartet mounted their horses
again and jogged  south steadily
nearing the state capital at austin
where jones sat waiting for word from
his tool

  to jones came a hastily scrawled
note postmarked belton saying that
sam bass moved toward round rock
in williamson county there to rob the
bank then ensued action upon the
quiet capital grounds

  there was a ranger company sta-
tioned at san saba under the veteran
thief-taker lieutenant n o rey-
nolds one of the headquarters de-
tachment killed a horse getting to rey-
nolds while jones himself having dis-
patched r c ware and two other

rangers to round rock followed the
next morning

 upon coming into round rock
jones warned local officials that the
bass gang was coming in the texas
of that day these words were enough
to insure feverish activity in any town
small or large on no account jones
insisted were the town officers to at-
tempt an arrest before the arrival of
reynolds and his rangers

riday july tq
 reynolds
company e fron-
tier battalion tex-
as rangers had
made the one hun-
dred fifty miles
from san saba to
old round rock at top speed and in
early afternoon pitched camp outside
of town sam bass with barnes
jackson and murphy were also
camped upon the towns outskirts the
outlaws rode into town for a last
check-up of the robberys details mur-
phy sensing the final scene so soon to
be played upon some pretext dropped
lehind so bass and barnes and young
frank jackson came up to copprels
store together as they went inside
they were noticed by the two local
deputy sheriffs moore and grimes

  they stared hard at the three dusty
strangers but apparently without
thought that the trio were the famous
outlaws they were awaiting upon
whose heads were placed rewards by
states and railroads and express com-
panies when sam bass broad shoul-
ders had disappeared within the door
moore turned to grimes

  i think those fellows got guns on
he said

  i think so too nodded grimes
im goin in an search em

  lie went in a hero and a martyr in
a way but history as written by the
cool and practical judgment of range-
land in fifty years makes him also and
more so pretty much plain damned
fool for he took none of the me-
chanical precautions of the wary peace
officer confronting strangers as
grimes stepped inside moore trailed
him to the door and stood blinking

  at grimes entrance the trio at the
counter whirled instinctively for a
long instant deputy sheriff and outlaws
eyed each other

  i think you fellows got guns on
said grimes a trifle belligerently im
goin to search you he added in the
dead silence that greeted his speech

  something about the silent group

must have struck a warning note with-
in him for now gun hand going
toward colt butt he began to back
toward the door where moore still
stood gaping at the play inside

  sure we got guns snarled sam
bass suddenly

  as if the phrase were a signal his
gun and barnes and jacksons flashed
out there was a rolling roar deaf-
ening in the confined space of cop-
prels store as three colts flung heavy
bullets into the luckless deputy grimes
staggered under the triple impact but
continued to back out moore had
leaped aside and grimes reached the
sidewalk to crash forward upon his
face after him sprang the outlaws
sensing a trap scenting disaster
moore was shot through the lungs as
he snatched belatedly at his colt

  ranger dick ware was sitting in the
barber shop almost next door waiting
for a shave the heavy three-in-one
report from the store jerked him to his
feet automatically his colt came out
and he stepped into the street to come
almost face to face with the outlaws
who stood staring down at the bodies
upon the sidewalk

  an utterly fearless man this ran-
ger dick ware worthy exponent of all
the heroic traditions of the service
odds of three to one might well have
sent a genuinely brave officer tack in-
doors to fire from cover but ware
ran toward them his  flipping up
there was a hitching post on the side-
walk and bullets from bass gang
knocked splinters from it that struck
ware in the face but he came on
firing rapidly a bullet struck sam
bass cartridge belt broke two shells
and mushrooming tore his right kid-
ney to ribbons

  general jones at this moment com-
ing up-street heard the staccato rattle
of the firing and came on the run as
bass and the others backed toward
their horses jones had but a small-
calibre double-action colt but he en-
tered the duel blithely joining dick
ware the other two rangers who
had come to round rock with ware
now ran up also while from doorways
up and down the street appeared armed
citizens to open fire upon the trio by
the horses

  barnes was shot dead bass was
mortally wounded only young frank
jackson now stood erect and with
bravery equal to dick wares he kept
up the outlaws end of the firing while
with left hand he unhitched sam bass
horse bullets fairly rained around
him from all directions as he helped
sam bass



bass into the saddle then sprang upon
his own animal

  out through old round rock gal-
loped the two frightened horses bass
reeling in the saddle frank jackson
holding him up jim murphy the
traitor pale shaken stricken by we
know not what torture of remorse or
perhaps none at all saw the two escap-
ing

  for the rest of that day bass and
jackson vanished from sight posses
and ranger detachments scoured the
vicinity but not until saturday morn-
ing did rangers find sam bass alone
near death lying beneath a large oak
he admitted his identity and made no
resistance

  jackson had insisted upon remaining
with his dying leader but bass-game
unselfish to the last the cowboys ideal
now as he had been in brighter days-
was equally insistent that frank save
himself so having made bass as
comfortable as possible unwillingly
jackson escaped

  taken into round rock bass re-
ceived the best attention local medicos
could administer but he died on sun-
day july st his twenty-seventh
birthday steadfastly refusing to give
the names of associates or friends
upon the tombstone set to mark his
grave was carved the inscription

samuel bass
born july st 
died july st 
a brave man reposes in death here
why was he not true 

  frank jackson after sam bass
death asked only for an opportunity
to meet the traitor jim murphy but
the latter evaded him and finally com-
mitted suicide so the famous bass
gang was finally broken up but the
memory of sam and frank jackson
of sebe barnes and arkansas and of
the traitor murphy is green today in
texas

  a few years ago the writer was re-
turning to texas from new york in
company with a san angelo cowboy
we unloaded the mercer roadster on
the mallory dock at galveston and
started for el paso coming into a
land of wide prairies near menard
vast and bleak under the pitiless de-
cember wind we encountered three
lean riders in two gallon stetsons and
fort worth boots and stopped to pass
the time of day the durham and the
quart when we had gossiped a while
of range affairs and with benumbed
fingers wrapped tobacco in those huge
thick brown papers colloquially known
in cattle land as saddle blankets

we said so long to the cowboys and
they jogged 

  the tall puncher in the checked mac-
kinaw began to sing in a high dolor-
ous tenor swaying to his ponys run-
ning-walk

sam bass was born in indiana it was
    his native home

and at the age of seventeen young
    sum began to roam

he first came down to texas a cow-
    boy for to be

a kinder hearted fellozv you seldom
    ever see

  beside me mechanically morg took
up the old ballad that every texan
knows that i had not heard for years
sang it to the last verse which deals
with jim murphys treachery

and so he sold out sam and barnes
and left their friends to mourn
oh what a scorching jim will get when
gabriel blows his horn

perhaps hes got to heaven theres
    c of us can say

but if i am right in my surmise hes
    gone the other way

  he was a great guy sam opined
morg twentieth century cowpuncher
hadnt been for that blanked illegiti-
mate murphy he wouldnt have been
caught either

author of seven gay riders

a good gun and a loyal partner-these are the white mans medicine as the sioux learned when
don aletes came to the spirit hills of dakota in search of adventure and the precious yellow iron

   true to a hair i made you

      barrel and sight and lock

   in beauty i arrayed you

     hammer and guard and stock

   go to the western border

      work of my mind and hand

    there you shall give the order

      there you shall take the land

-song of the gunsmith

is uncle a gunsmith
and an old fron-
tiersman had been
largely responsible
for rousing the ata-
vistic urge that had
lifted don aletes
from the humdrum
surroundings of a small town and sent
him toward the setting sun until from
that ribbon of dust the oregon trail
he sighted the peaks of the mysterious
black hills

   after years of wandering in the
west the boys uncle had returned to
the sleepy little ohio town to find his
nephew an orphan the old frontiers-
man was a practical man he opened
a gun shop and made don his appren-
tice while they fashioned deadly but
beautiful weapons for the aletes guns
soon became famous for their beauty
balance and accuracy the frontiersman
told the lad of the wild west in the
forties of the buffalo roaming the
plains in countless numbers of the

rushing rivers and vast canyons and
of the gold he had located in the moun-
tains

  softly the years slipped by and
presently the old frontiersman worked
no more in his little gun shop he sat
on the porch of the house where he
and don kept bachelor quarters and
dreamed of the prairies and mountains
of the west then to speed the dull
hours in the spring of  he fell to
planning a return to the trail he
knew that he would never see the buf-
falo again but it pleased his fancy to
pretend that he was preparing for the
journey don now a silent meditat-
ive youth going quietly to and from
the gun shop listened with rapt atten-
tion to the old mans plans the wan-
derlust stirring within him

  first thing don is a brace of dou-
ble-barreled rifles

  the youth nodded gravely for to
him his uncle was the font of all wis-
dom

  yes thats it chuckled the old
man a brace of double-barreled
rifles that will be a surprise for the
indians we may run against a war
party they will come on after our
first shots to get into us before we
have time to reload the second bar-
rel will surprise them they will fall
back because to them our medicine will


be strong medicine dont forget don
a brace of double-barreled rifles you
can turn them out but ill show you
the fine points and pistols too the
new six-shooters-a great invention
but we can buy them cheaper than we
can make them

  and i have been thinking of com-
bining powder and ball some way so
that a man would not have to take so
much time to reload there were
times in the west when my life hung
on a hair and the seconds required to
reload were all against me i have
been turning it over in my mind a
man could put the powder and ball in a
paper jacket he could seal in a stick
or a bit of string to break the paper
and let the powder into the barrel
then he could ram down paper and
ball one move and he could get pow-
der and ball and wadding another
move for his cap after he had rammed
the charge home and he would be
ready

  well start out in a covered wagon
well drive mules and lead saddle
horses well trim right down to ne-
cessities but take along a little grain
for saddle horses every night well
rub down the saddle horses a horse
means a lot to a man in the west don
get there with your horse in good con-
dition
yellow iron



   and well go to the spirit hills in
the dakota country i was through
that country once you have seen the
nuggets i washed out you have seen
the map i made in the bars of the
stream i named pactolus there are
plenty more nuggets like those i found
the stream disappears-runs under a
canyon wall

  we had to skip on account of the
sioux but that is a chance every man
has to take when he enters that coun-
try but if he keeps his wits about
him he is not likely to be surprised
still its mostly chance

  and tobacco plenty of tobacco if
nothing else

  nothing but material that will
stand service well get the best don
the west is no place for shoddy ma-
terial or shoddy men there are shod-
dy men out there but the indians or
somebody kill them sooner or later
the west weeds out the white weak-
lings but there arc a lot of white men
out there who can make the indian
look a saint by comparison but youll
get along with them because youre
calm and have no fear you dont
talk much and that will help you

  i talk too much well my boy
that is an old mans privilege and
now bring me my pipe and my shawl
too the sun is shining but somehow
it seems chilly-chilly to me

       ut death will not
       wait for the con-
         y summation of hu-

     -	 v man plans one
            night the old fron-
            tiersmans heart
            stopped beating
            and he sank into
            the sleep from which none awaken

  after the funeral the youth concen-
trated on the plans his uncle had made
for seeking the gold in the spirit hills
he had no attachments and though he
attracted many a warm and admiring
glance from the maidens of the village
his heart was as yet untouched by the
softer emotions

  his uncle had left him some money
more than enough to pay the expenses
of the venture after making a dou-
ble-barreled rifle a beautiful weapon
which he wished his uncle could see
he sold the gun shop and the house

  when all that he owned was turned
into cash he sought the little grave-
yard where he had erected a simple
slab in memory of the kindly soul
whom he had deeply loved in his calm
undemonstrative way

  gently he patted the tombstone

   well good-by he said softly and
turned away

  he was soon in st louis where he
assembled his outfit following closely
his uncles plan he joined a wagon
train but made no close friends and
told no man of his destination at
fort laramie he fell out of the long
procession gave his wagon and har-
ness into the keeping of the half-breed
traders secured a supply of dried buf-
falo meat packed his mules and with
only a casual farewell to the loungers
near the gate of the stockade headed
toward the spirit hills

  now without mishap or the faint-
est sign of danger he had penetrated
into the heart of the mysterious moun-
tains

  quietly enjoying the pristine beau-
ties unfolding before his eyes he rode
slowly into a great park that lay like a
vast green robe spread carelessly be-
tween the black forbidding walls of
the forest

  he lounged back in his roomy flat-
horned saddle rested his double-bar-
reled muzzle-loader across his thighs
and considered the work before him
he would make his camp beyond the
stream convenient to both wood and
water he would erect a rude shelter
possibly a lean-to against that white
rock upthrust at the forests edge a
mighty monolith glittering against a
dark background of pines it would
be easy too to construct a fireplace of
rock and mud sheltering it against
sudden showers he would get up a
supply of dry wood he would live
comfortably while he searched for the
stream his uncle had named pactolus
he had enough provisions to last him
through the summer there would be
weeks when except for salt he would
not have to touch his reserves the
country was thronging with game and
there would be plenty of wild fruit
strawberries juneberries choke-cher-
ries and raspberries

  what a home could be built up in
this opening he visioned a log
house built against the great white
rock the rock would serve for the
back of a fireplace

   in the rich black soil potatoes and
cabbages and oats would flourish why
a man could have a home here that
would make a king envy him

  plenty of good grass for say fif-
teen or twenty cows one old spot
perhaps would wear a bell

  reluctantly he returned to reality
his dream had been a very pleasant
one but it was only a dream-a
dream that might never come true and

all at once the silence seemingly inten-
sified by all the softly-blended voices
rising from the heart of the wilder-
ness suddenly oppressed him he
felt a desire to hear some familiar
sound though it be but that of his own
voice and he turned in his saddle to
admonish his two pack mules who
tempted by the tender young grass had
been loitering by the way

  here you jacks-

  but the two mules were not snatch-
ing greedy mouthfuls of the juicy
grass instead with heads held high
and long ears aslant they stood mo-
tionless eyes fixed on something in
the forest far to their right presently
they snorted in unison and trotted up
to the horse as if seeking comfort and
reassurance from the animal they had
so blindly followed through gloomy
canyons and dim forest aisles

  come along you two remonstrat-
ed the youth youre always getting
scared at nothing every wildcat you
smell you think it a bear or a moun-
tain lion come now well sooi make
camp

  then as the mules continued to
stare at the fearsome something in the
pines-to the sight of the man scarce-
ly the height of toy trees-he rather
anxiously followed their gaze but
amid the shifting lights and shadows
he could distinguish no form of men-
ace possibly the mules had scented a
bear and were staging the usual
alarm but now the horse had caught
sight of the dread something head
high he gave vent to a long whistling
snort the youth could feel the great
muscles tense and quiver

   old faithful sees it too he mut-
tered

  he glanced down at his gun to make
sure the caps were on the nipples
whatever it was he was prepared to
receive it two shots in the rifle and
six in each of his heavy pistols

uddenly he saw
something moving
through the trees
far to his right
and at last from
the shifting lights
and shadows of the
forest three riders
emerged they were not coming di-
rectly toward him but were obliquing
toward the white rock then quickly
turning his head he saw another trio
of riders emerging from the forest to
his left tiny figures scarcely a hand
high and then he saw far back on
his trail two moving dots


the frontier

  indians

  they were bent on surrounding him
on forcing him to make a stand in the
shelterless opening this was his first
indian attack but his self-control and
practical sense did not desert him

  for a moment he considered the
feasibility of making a stand in the
opening but his uncle had told him of
the indians circle of death and he
realized that his only hope lay in mak-
ing a race for the great white rock
nearby no fear clamored in his
heart he was as calm as when he was
making the double-barreled gun in the
little shop yet he was conscious of a
savage irritation the indians would
secure his outfit each carefully se-
lected article was now priceless for it
could not be replaced without a long
toilsome journey he had no hatred
against the speeding warriors but he
had the anglo-saxons attachment to
property for what was his he would
fight it might be only a handful of
salt but if it was his he would fight
for it

  with difficulty he held in his wild
and frantic horse yet as they got
under way the mules developed as-
tonishing speed and he gave faithful
thfe reins closely followed by the
mules the youth sped across the open-
ing passed far ahead of the obliquing
lines of warriors and plunged through
the willows faithful cleared the
stream at one bound

  he reached the shelter of the rock
flung himself from his horse and for
the first time the voice of the double-
barreled rifle with crashing reverbera-
tions smote the silence of the spirit
hills

  the nearest trio halted abruptly as
the ounce ball raised a warning spurt
of dirt far in front of them both
trios then rode swiftly toward the cen-
ter of the opening and disappeared
back of a great clump of willows

  aletes watchcd the two advancing
along his trail until they too disap-
peared back of the willows

  the spurt of dust iiad told him that
they were not within the range of his
rifle and he resolved to hold his fire
until sure of hitting a horse or a rider
what were they doing back of the
willows the delay strained his
nerves far more than the thought of
the numerical odds against him why
didnt they attack he was half-
minded to move on

  back of him was a tangle of brush
beyond the brush a long opening be-
tween the pines seemingly led into an-
other park the rock its inner walls

forming a great triangle afforded shel-
ter on two sides for himself and his
stock out from the rock ran natural
barricades of stone perhaps if he
raced on he would not soon find an-
other such a natural breastwork he

indians

 placed his ammunition within easy
 reach and awaited the next move of
 the indians

    it was plain that none of them pos-
 sessed a gun the great rifle was
 true and possessed tremendous shock-
 ing power he would make each shot
 count he was confident that the war
 party would not pay the price he set
  his life he would kill one or two
 of them and the others would fall
 back

    with the indomitable egotism and
 self-reliance of his race he gave little
 thought to the possibilities of defeat
 nor did he offer up any prayers to the
 god of victory he looked to his
 arms they would decide who was to
 live and who was to die

ii

     my raedicinc protects me

    no arrow can touch me

     my medicine is strong

    hey hey my medicine is strong

-medicine song

 ack of the screen-
 ing willows eight
 young dakotas dis-
 mounted to pray to
 wakantanka great
 spirit and to in-
 voke the protection
 and favor of their
 guardian spirits

    twenty winters would have spanned
 their average age but they were war-
 riors all with no hint of softness nor
 callowness their youth was indicat-

 ed by the faultless symmetry of their
 lithe bodies the barely perceptible rip-
 ple of muscle under their bronzed
 skins the easy resiliency of their
 movements

  they wore moccasins thigh leggins
and breech-cloths more to avoid
scratches and bruises than for protec-
tion against wind sun and rain across
their naked backs were slung combina-
tion bow and arrow cases from sev-
eral of which depended the claws of
the mountain lion heavy knives hung
in ornamented sheaths from their belts
and each youth carried a highly-orna-
mented pouch in which he kept his
paints and various personal belongings
slung from straps in such fashion as
not to interfere with the use of the
bow they carried small round shields
of thick buffalo hide over which were
two covers of dressed deerskin be-
tween the covers were kept the em-
blems of their respective guardian
spirits the medicine tliat would
ward off misfortune evil wounds and
death the shields had been made by
medicine-men who had received in
dreams spiritual instructions as to their
design and ornamentation the mcdi-
cine-men had given them to the youths
with much ceremony and had been
suitably rewarded to each warrior
his shield was sacred and there were
certain taboos and obligations he must
observe or it would not protect him

  petuspa firebrand the war chief
had said that it was the holy duty of a
dakota to kill a white man when and
where he found him the white men
were invading the land of the dakotas
scattering and killing the buffalo tak-
ing only the tongues and leaving the
good sweet meat for the coyotes and
wolves on the buffalo depended the
lives of the dakotas without the
meat of the buffalo how could they
prepare the nourishing zvasna pem-
mican against the needs of winter
when the north wind whipped the
snow around the banked-up tipis and
the great herds had drifted far to the
south elk meat would not feed the
dakotas neither could they exist on
deer meat no meat was as rich and
nourishing as buffalo meat nothing as
satisfying as the marrow of buffalo
bones the great spirit had given
them the buffalo they could spare
everything but the buffalo to the
words of petuspa they had listened
not only with their ears but with their
hearts

  also they had other scores to settle
with the white man had he not sent
liars among them saying that he loved
yellow iron



peace when always was he fighting
he loved peace only when it was to his
advantage back of all his words
loomed death aye to kill a white
man was a good deed

  each warrior though eager for the
fray was bound by the religious cus-
toms of his tribe in a spiritual sense
each red youth drew apart from his
comrades to consult his medicine

  in the hollow of his hand the
whirlpool miniomni in dakota held
his totem a fragment of quartz crys-
tal he called it the-frozen-water-
the-sun-cannot-bite to him it was
the symbol of the soul of the turn-
ing water for to the indian every-
thing has a soul

  now he seemed to hear his guard-
ian spirit speak with the voice of the
turning water

  in chanting tones and swaying to
and fro he repeated what his guard-
ian spirit told him

  miniomni shall do a great deed

  he alone shall fight the white man

  with knives shall miniomni and the
white man fight

  the white man shall miniomni slay
his hair shall miniomni taker

  upon him came the delirium of
heroism he became possessed of the
fighting madness his lips drew back
from his teeth in a wolf snarl and his
eyes became set and glaring

  he sprang on his horse and rode to
and fro in front of his comrades
boasting that he would cut off the
white mans ears and make him eat
them

   he added an interesting touch to the
effect that he would cut out the white
mans heart and eat it but for the fact
that he did not want to become a cow-
ard and a liar this was not intended
as humor for he believed if one ate
the heart of an enemy that he would
acquire both the virtues and weak-
nesses of his fallen foe

  to and fro he rode working him-
self up to the highest pitch of excite-
ment

  his comrades made no comment and
offered no objection the spirit of
miniomni had spoken first his medi-
cine was strong and it was jjis privi-
lege to demand if his spirit so ruled
the honor of single combat

  abruptly the whirlpool turned his
pony and dashed through an opening
in the willows his comrades slipped
through the tangle crossed the little
stream and crawled through the wil-
lows on the far bank to watch from
covert the whirlpool advance on the
hidden white man

t first aletes
thought the lone
warrior riding to-
ward him in zigzag
fashion was an
emissary of peace
his uncle had in-
structed him in in-
dian signs and customs and he waited
hoping to see the advancing warrior
raise empty hands in the sign of
peace

  nearer and nearer came the zig-
zagging rider but instead of the sign
of peace he brandished a knife slowly
it dawned on the white youth that the
indian was challenging him to a knife
duel

  the foolhardiness of the dakota
puzzled him why should the indian
indulge in such a parade when there
was nothing to be gained but per-
haps he was creating a diversion
while his comrades executed a flank
movement

  his fingers cuddled the twin trig-
gers yet he hesitated to shoot down the
daring brave admiration stirred
within him and he was reluctant to de-
stroy so valiant a foe

  now he could see the paint on the
face of the brave distinguish his orna-
ments and decorations the little
round shield was a tempting mark an
inviting bulls eye the white youth
was an indifferent hand with a pistol
but with a rifle he was cold deadly
certainty itself

  the whirlpool came on brandish-
ing his knife and yelling insults

  the harsh taunting tones raised the
hair on the back of the white youths
neck lie could not understand the
words of the reckless savage but he
could sense the insults though he
held the life of the red man under his
two fingers some fierce desire for close
combat stirred within him but he was
too far removed from the days of
clashing swords to give way to the im-
pulse between him and the sword-
wielder were too many practical hard-
headed men too many generations that
had concentrated on the invention and
making of superior weapons he
would as his uncle had often advised
him use common sense he would
kill the indian and that would make
one less

  the whirlpool had dismounted and
was now slowly advancing pausing at
times to brandish his knife to stamp
the ground like a buck in rutting sea-
son or to make known by sign and in-
sulting gesture his ardent desire to
cross blades with his hereditary enemy

  the little round shield came into the
sights of the double-barreled rifle re-
luctantly since he could not entirely
put aside admiration for the reckless
courage of the red man aletes pressed
the forward trigger the great gun
responded with a withering blast that
swept from the pines a vast lingering
reverberation

  slowly the whirlpool sank to earth
hastily aletes reloaded the right bar-
rel glancing as he placed a cap  the
nipple at his deadly handiwork he
should have shot him in the head and
finished him quickly but the little
round shield had been too tempting

  youre a brave rascal he mut-
tered a brave rascal just the same
the whirlpool had raised himself
up on his elbow a hand over the great
wound in his side yet despite his
swiftly-ebbing strength he managed to
raise his painted face to the sky clear
save for a single gleaming cloud that
to his dimming eyes held the shape of
a mighty hovering eagle

  no longer was he the whirlpool
he would enter the land of spirits
proudly bearing a new name he be-
gan singing his death-song

  lo i tread the way of darkness
  but my people will remember

  for a neiv name i am given-
  shining eagle-cloud  comrades
  shining eagle-cloud-

  the faint chanting faltered he sank
back drew his knees up convulsively
and then relaxed his filming eyes star-
ing up at the bright cloud then sud-
denly the life left him and he was
merely that which would soon return
to dust

ill

now from the taut string springing

straight my way and swift my winging
to the soft flesh go i singing
of the deatli my fang is bringing

-arrow song

he comrades of the
dead miniomni
now began a spec-
tacular attack that
would have been
frowned on by old-
er and more ex-
perienced warriors
under cover of the willows they rode
some distance up the bank of the
stream crossed over and with long in-
tervals between them dashed back
parallel with the rock hanging from
the backs and necks of their ponies


the frontier

  through the sights aletcs saw
horse after horse pass at top speed
with only a leg and the tip of a feather
showing above the line of its back
vet from each hidden wild rider ar-
rows rose in curving flights

  the deadly hiss of the feathered
shafts made him cringe involuntarily
i fowever the great rock afforded am-
ple protection on the front and left for
him and his stock he had little to
fear if they continued this sort of
thing but they might try to gain his
rear the rock was shaped like the
corner of a great roofless room open
to attack on right and rear if they
gained his rear they could easily stam-
pede his stock and set him afoot then
sooner or later he would fall asleep
and their arrows would find him

  now they were coming back this
time veering in a little closer he
held his breath and the moment a
speeding horse entered the sights he
pressed the forward trigger and ere
the mighty echoes ceased crashing
among the trees he pressed the rear
trigger he saw two warriors spring
clear of their floundering ponies and
run in zigzag fashion for the cover of
the willows feverishly he reloaded
but by the time the caps were on the
nipples the runners had disappeared
and the riders now far to his left
were returning to the shelter of the
willows apparently the parade was
over

  now he decided to move on he
placed his rifle in its scabbard loos-
ened the flaps of his pistol holsters and
mounted he didnt think much of the
six-shooters but in a running fight
he could at least make a lot of noise
with them

    f he could find some position where
his flanks could not be turned and
where there was shelter for his stock
he knew he could work frightful havoc
with the rifle that was his weapon-
the long rifle

  with the pack mules thumping be-
hind him he trotted up the pine-
hedged passageway which he now saw
with some misgivings sloped up to a
gap between great masses of rock
apparently that gap was the only out-
let

  the warriors had for a few mo-
ments in the shelter of the willows
gravely considered the exceedingly
strong medicine of the white man

   never before had they heard a gun
that times-two-quickly-spoke this
white mans gim did not talk slowly
bang bang lo this white mans

gun said bang-bang and behold
two horses went down

  it was very apparent that they could
not hope to secure the hair of this
white man by a frontal attack the
quick-talking gun was very strong
medicine they decided to make an
attempt to turn his right flank

  while they were counseling mini-
omnis horse came crashing through
the willows the two warriors whose
ponies had been killed mounted the ani-
mal

  the party followed the stream into
the pines then curved back toward the
rock tying their ponies in an open-
ing amid thick quaking asp they glided
swiftly through the brush and tangle
as they came within bow range of the
rock they saw their quarry riding up
the long opening between the pines

  without a spoken word or sigh but
naturally as coyotes angle a jackrab-
bit they turned and ran back to their
horses and sped up a parallel passage-
way coming out in time to see the
white man heading up the slope and
toward the gap between the masses of
rock

  pung seven bowstrings twanged

  aletes was beyond bowshot but the
mules some distance back of him of-
fered fair targets for the hissing ar-
rows of the dakotas they received
the iron-pointed shafts dumbly crazed
with pain they whirled and bucking
pitching and lashing out with their
heels in futile attempts to rid them-
selves of the arrows in their flanks
they stampeded toward the indians

   aletes plunging up the slope opened
fire with one six-shooter but he might
as well have saved his ammunition
the little gun was only effective in the
hand of a man who by long practice
had learned how to use it under any
and all conditions

  the dakotas promptly killed the
mules and as the white man disap-
peared over the crest they leaped from
their ponies and taking every advan-
tage of cover ran up the slope they
knew that on either side of their flee-
ing enemy was a wall of rock and that
below him yawned a steep-walled can-
yon but the one and only avenue of
escape they overlooked for though fa-
miliar with the country they were not
infallible

  swiftly they ran up to the crest of
the rise and dropped to their hands
and knees and crawled forward until
they could look down into the canyon
but the white man had disappeared
for a moment superstition clutched
them and then with exultant yelps

they raced down to the rim of the can-
yon wall

  they had overlooked the great
stoneslide there lie was half-way
down its treacherous slope his horse
sliding on its haunches amid rushing
streams of rock and gravel they sent
a flight of arrows after him

  they saw the horse make a frantic
lunge as the arrows struck it then fall
and slide against a dead pine upthrust
above the rock and gravel there the
animal lodged with the leg of its rider
caught under it they saw the horse
struggle ineflectually and the man
make a futile attempt to rise

ix of them drew
their knives and
plunged recklessly
down the slope
each wildly eager
to be the first to
strike the white
man and thereby
win the greatest honor and be permit-
ted to wear a feather of the royal eagle
in commemoration of the deed he
who killed the invader and he who
scalped him wotdd also win honor and
count coup the formal token of vic-
tory in battle but lie who first struck
the living enemy would gain the great-
est distinction since that indicated
close quarters and to him would be
given the weapons of the slain

  the panther older and more cau-
tious and thoughtful paused on the
brink of the slide an arrow on his bow
string there was something about
the performance that he did not like
something in which he sensed danger

  to aletes it seemed that his soul
had detached itself from the body and
assumed the role of a spectator calm-
ly watching the fleeting phantasma-
goria of a terrible dream

  there was no sensation in the leg
pinioned under the horse probably
broken he thought there was a dull
gnawing pain in his left shoulder he
turned his head and nearly cut his
chin on a protruding arrow head the
shaft had penetrated the shoulder mus-
cle a sliding fragment of rock
thumped against his spine he threw
his head back in a straining effort to
face his doom above him he glimpsed
the wild savage figures they seemed to
be floating down he must get a wea-
pon-somehow-some way-

  now the leading figure poised for a
breath knife in hand it was scarlet
cloud who hoped to gain the highest
honor to be the first to strike the liv-
ing foe
yellow iron



  then camc a terrific rifle blast
mighty reverberations slapped the can-
yon walls and thinned out into echoes
that whispered in far remote places

  the five reckless comrades of scar-
let cloud plunged down the slide and
into grotesque sprawls-twitching col-
orful forms against a gray background
with little avalanches flowing over
their limbs or banking up against them

  the panther felt something strike
his arm in one leap he gained cover
and by crawling on his hands and
knees managed to slip over the rise
unseen bv the white men of whom he
had caught but a fleeting glimpse he
ran back to the ponies he yearned to
search the packs on the dead mules
and sentiment bade him secure the
body of the valiant miniomni yet
those were matters of little importance
compared to rousing the warriors in
the camp so that the slaughter of his
comrades might be avenged he
mounted and swept down through the
pines and across the great opening at
full speed as his pony settled down
into the tireless cayuse lope he glanced
at his arm the bullet had merely
burned the skin he would let the
wind and sun irritate it that it might
become a scar he could exhibit with
pride

  now from the brush beyond the foot
of the slide came a series of rifle shots
as though some angry giant were slam-
ming a great door the additional
lead stopped the twitching of all but
scarlet cloud shot through the lungs
right arm broken and knee-cap shat-
tered the life yet burned within him
a few feet above aletes he managed
to hunch himself down the slide
though every move must have cost him
exquisite torture

  the white youth could see the red
youth glaring down at him with im-
placable hostility then in one final
desperate effort the dakota threw
himself on his broken arm turned over
and brought the lips of his fingers
against the shoulder of his enemy he
had struck the living foe he had
counted coup faintly from his lips
came the war cry

  a tall gaunt man with a matted
dun-colored beard cleft by a mammoth
demonish grin suddenly came into
aletes line of vision he bore a hand
ax

  this uncouth apparition seized one
of scarlet clouds black braids jerked
the indians head up and back and
grinned down at him lor a moment
then emitting a hoarse throaty chor-
tle he knocked the warrior in the head

other men came crashing through the brush

using the ax as he would use a knife
he deftly scalped his victim

  this done to his chortling satisfac-
tion he flung a glance at aletes

  hurry up joe and help me git
this feller outn his fix he called over
his shoulder to a little man coming up
the slide then to himself i calls
this slick work six of them as neat
as a cats whisker good clean shoot-
in

  the little man came up to the dead
pine aletes heard him say something
about the saddle cinch having caught
on a pitchy spike the cinch loos-
ened the horse slid slowly from his
anchorage and down the slide

  the tall man slipped powerful hands
under aletes arms and hauled him to
his feet the youth was greatly re-
lieved to find that no bones were
broken

  how many was there young fel-
ler asked the little man leaning his
rifle against the tree his weapon had
an octagon barrel the size of a shovel
handle and lacked only a few inches of
its owners height we popped six
how many was there

  eight aletes told him suddenly
feeling the need of the tall mans
steadying hand i shot one-and
two horses

  the little man had drawn the youths
rifle from the scabbard as the horse
slid clear of the tree he now blew
the dust and dirt from it and exam-
ined it closely

  a married gun he chuckled
mister and missus bang-bang fust
i ever saw a right handy and sweet
weapon i say

  he placed the double-barreled rifle
with his and scrambled up to aletes

  whats that in your shoulder
didnt you know you had an arrer
stickin in yeh then to the tall ax-
wielder prayerful you keep an eye
skinned at the top o that wall might

be some injuns follerin these scamps
ill fix this boy up

  he notched the shaft carefully
broke off the head and in one quick
pull jerked the shaft from the clinging
flesh tlie youth felt his stomach
heave and for a moment he thought
his legs would give way under him

   jes under the hide a little the
garrulous amateur surgeon assured his
patient slap a little terbacker on it
to stop the bleedin and you wont
know you was ever hit prayerful
you bring his gun

  prayerful you know he ex-
plained as he helped aletes down the
slide allers cleans up after an injun
killin knocks em all in the head to
make sure theres no possum-playin
prizes skelps morell i do beaver skins
how you makin it

   im all right the youth said with
a smile a little bruised thats all
at the foot of the slide a french
half-breed came up with a hatful of
water which aletes drank gratefully
other men came crashing through the
brush frontiersmen and half-breeds

iv

   i gits two squaws
   from the omahas

fer a jug of mountain dew

   theyre fat and fine

   them gals of mine

and whirlwinds with the stew

   my skin is white but my heart is wild
   as wild as wild kin be

   and im bound to say as i go my way
   no pale-face gals fer me

   i like the squaws
   of the omahas

but the crow gals i like too

   and once a-while

   to change my style

i pick me out a sioux

a squaw you quit when you want a change
   walk off and leave her be

   but the white gals clutch and ask too
      much

   to suit the likes of me

-trapper song

nder the expert
ministrations of the
little frontiersman
whom he was soon
calling joe aletes
found himself en-
joying some sur-
cease from the
twinge and pull of the wound in his
shoulder

   joe was as talkative as a magpie and
as active as a chipmunk his beard
shot upward from his chin ending in a
billy-goat tuft that his chronic gar-


the frontier

rulity kept in constant motion

  what say the name was boy oh
yes a-lee-teez hold on now whard
i hear that name afore somewhere
-now lets see by the staggerin
tracks of my great grandpaw its on
old never-fail

  he snatched up his long rifle and
held the barrel under aletes nose

  there she is right there plain as
daylight he exclaimed triumphantly
i knowed id heerd the name afore

  aletes nodded

  yes he said quietly that is one
of our guns we made only three of
that style and pattern my uncle al-
ways named each gun

  well well whod a-thunk it joe
marveled here we was goin along
and then all a-sudden you come tear-
in down that slide with the injuns
steppin on your hind legs up goes old
never-fail and the rest of them and
ka-whang then i find out that the very
gun i help stop the injuns with was
made by your hand-or the help of
your hand haint she strange how
things twist around by the stagger-
in tracks of my great grandpaw shes
a queer world boy im stickin to
you you dont talk and thats the
kind of pard i want oh i know i
talk all the time it somehow helps me
ive talked myself outn many a hole
many a tight corner it comes natral
to me same as keepin still comes nat-
ral to you or honin fer skelps comes
natral to prayerful evry man to his
way of livin and dyin now you set
here and take it easy and ill see to
your hoss hes a couple of stickers
in him but nothin to make him lay
down ill be back directly

  as joe disappeared in the brush in
the direction of the wounded horse a
fat pouchy-checked ferret-eyed man
clad in a long-skirted black coat buck-
skin trousers and boots and wearing a
high bell-crowned hat came up and
introduced himself to aletes

  i am doctor mubsley he an-
nounced pompously i take it that
under the conditions you will join my
party

  mubsley had been an actor an auc-
tioneer a tooth-puller and a quack doc-
tor then he had drifted west and
become a trader alcohol he had
found would secure almost anything
the average indian possessed while
the main purpose of his invasion of
the spirit hills was to find gold he
had brought along several kegs of alco-
hol with which he hoped to strip the
dakotas of their choicest robes and
skins he was yet a little shaken with

the shock of battle and his pouchy
cheeks quivered perceptibly

  i may say he went on removing
his monstrous hat and flicking some
drops of perspiration from his brow
i may say that i hardly expected this
but you can remain with my party un-
til such time as other arrangements can
be made you can help the half-
breeds

  not by a long shot doc explod-
ed joe suddenly parting the brush
back of the pseudo medico that boy
dont help no breeds he goes along
with us and does as he pleases till he
and i git some idee of how were go-
in to strike out together

  but this is my party blustered
mubsley

  maybe so snapped joe but im
doin the talkin i aint so perticler
bout hangin with you mubsley i
agreed to guide you in these here
mountains but i aint married to you
none besides youre talkin to hear
yourself talk when we should be mov-
in on this little fight has changed
things a heap wed better hit back
fer the river one injun got away
and petuspa wont rest when he hears
seven of his young men are wiped
out

  if you knew that the killing of the
indians would bring trouble down on
us why did you give the signal to
fire bleated mubsley

  youre talkin only with your
mouth joe grumbled impatiently
your words dont make sense im
white when i see a white man chased
by injuns i open with old never-fail
as fer this bein your party you ought
to know better than that no man has
a party in this country-leastwise not
of white men no man says to me
you belong to my party i belong to
myself any time i want to go i take
my salt and old never-fail and go if
you dont like my style you and me
strike diffrent trails right now

  im through with you mubsley
stormed striking a dramatic attitude
we shall proceed without you he
turned to the other frontiersmen trap-
pers mostly and border scalawags cast
from the same mould that had turned
out joe men bring up the pack
train

  joe laughed dryly

   men  he mimicked  bring up
the pack train  then in natural
tones but where you goin to take it
when you bring it up which way
you goin and whos goin to tell you
how to git outn here not joe rakin

fer joe and his young pard here are
trailin alone

  you cant break up my party
yelled mubsley i wont have it my
orders shall be obeyed my money is
paying for this-i shall-

t this juncture a
little thin m a n
wearing a coat of
the mubsley pat-
tern trotted up
waving womanish
hands

  peace he cried
rolling his eyes brethren let there
be peace between you

  aletes saw joe smile contemptu-
ously

  youll have peace deacon
grinned the little frontiersman ever-
lastin peace if the sioux git hold of
you you aint no hair to lose but a
man generly prizes that most which
hes got the least of

  a fanatical gleam came into the
deep-set eyes of the deacon

  i came to save the souls of the sav-
ages he whined to bring sweetness
and light and forgiveness

but all youve done drawled joe
is to keep good grub from spilin
abruptly mubsley whirled on the
fanatic and smacked his face with his
open hand

  shut up that whine he bellowed
welcoming an opportunity to vent his
rage against joe on the helpless and
inoffensive effeminate im sick of
your blat get back and stay back
and dont talk when men are speak-
ing

  i and my pard here are strikin
out announced joe ignoring mubs-
leys outburst and dropping never-
fail into the crook of his arm

  with mubsley we will not stay
said one of the half-breeds in sioux
with joe we will go

  im trailin with joe declared
prayerful and crossed over to the side
of the independent frontiersman

  another frontiersman followed
prayerful he was a big man with a
great paunch but apparently as active
as a weasel he was known as
squeaky bill sometimes he was called
the squaw-killer his beard black and
bristly grew within a half-inch of his
eyes and his eyebrows were a straight
black bar between his eyebrows and
his hair line was scarcely a finger-
breadth of forehead oddly enough
considering his bulk he spoke in a thin
high soprano

  im with joe he squeaked
yellow iron



  the other frontiersmen and the
breeds gathered around joe mubsley
finding himself deserted by all save the
deacon who was now hovering near
him hands waving and thin lips twitch-
ing now quickly changed front

  now now he cried with a
throaty gurgle we must get along
my temper got the best of me joe
he waved his arms in token of sur-
render and smiled blandly we must
stand together he added dramatically
against the red devils

  joe chuckled always was mubs-
ley amusing one could read the fakir
as easily as he could follow a buffalo
water trail yet the big blow-hard
thought lie was cunning and clever

  oh all right then he agreed
shortly well hit fer the river he
turned briskly to the breeds git the
pack mules inovin now then to the
frontiersmen this boy and i will go
ahead two of you foller up the
breeds prayerful you and bill kin
work along the sides look sharp fer
that injun that got away may not have
fur to go to git help now lets
move

  faithful had lost considerable blood
but now with the arrows removed and
the wounds washed by the tireless joe
the horse seemed little the worse for
his battle experience joe helped aletes
into the saddle they moved up to the
head of the little column mubsley
mounted on a small mule fell in ahead
of the pack train

  too bad my misfortune broke up
your plans remarked aletes to joe
as the column moved off

  never you fret my boy only
thing im sorry about is that we aint
the time to git your outfit i know you
must set a store by your stuff but
weve lost too much time aready i
was foolish to come with this oufit any-
way trail alone i say or with a good
pard never mix with a bunch ner
work fer no man mubsley thought to
pick up nuggets the size of hen eggs
but hes full of foolish idees we
found some gold here and there
enough maybe to put in a holler tooth
but not enough to pay i should a-
stuck to my trappin a mat should
stick to what he knows he kin do i
aint no gold miner im a trapper i
know beaver from beginnin to end but
what i dont know about gold is
moren i could tell in ten thousand
moons yep a man should stick to
what he knows how to do

  aletes made no reply to joes chat-
ter and yet he wondered why the lit-
tle man had not questioned him he

was yet to learn that while joe was a
chronic spiller of words he never
asked direct questions the frontiers-
man might volunteer information but
he was careful not to pry into any
mans private affairs he simply liked
to talk

   the youth saw that temporarily at
 least he would have to give up his
 quest of the stream his uncle had
 named pactolus he might return to
 civilization and secure a new outfit but
 that was too far in the future to give
 much thought

   with joe leading the way they fol-
 lowed the stream down until it opened

mubsley found himself deserted

 out into a great park there with
 guards out they rested desr stood
 agaze within easy range but joe would
 permit no shooting they ate sparing-
 ly of pemmican and washed it down
 with cold mountain water

   joe with some idea of blinding the
 trail led them up a tributary of the
 stream they had been following this
 was tedious work for at times the cur-
 rent eddied around their waists aletes
 however was put to little strain as
 faithful splashed methodically up the
 stream shortly before sundown they
 came to a high divide sparsely tim-
 bered but covered with rich grass
 there they rested until nightfall

   with difficulty aletes gained his
 feet he was stiff and sore and his
 wound was throbbing joe helped him
 into the saddle and led the way
 through the gloom

 t dawn they were
 descending a game
 trail that zig-zagged
 down to a swift-
 flowing stream

    well foller this
 crick down joe
 told the youth its
 a queer crick down at the mouth of

 the canyon she runs under the wall
 and thats the end of her

  aletes despite his natural calmness
gasped a little why this was the
stream his uncle had described he
visualized the map his uncie had
drawn should he share the secret
with these men to secure the gold
alone would mean a return to civiliza-
tion and a long toilsome journey back
to the mountains

  these men had saved his life it
was only fair that lie should tell them
that here was the stream in whose bank
his uncle had found the gold

  when they reached the floor of the
canyon he reined in his horse

  whats the trouble asked joe
feelin sick

  no i have something to say

  mubsley came up followed by pray-
erful and squeaky bill and the other
frontiersmen

  i want to tell you about this
stream said the youth in his quiet
fashion there is gold here my uncle
found gold here-nuggets i have
a sack of them in my pocket you are
searching for gold i thought it no
more than right that i should tell you
you have been kind to me ive a map
that will prove what i say

  mubsley flung himself from his lit-
tle mule

  lets see the nuggets he almost
yelled

  aletes gave him the little buckskin
sack

  now the half-breeds came up their
eyes glittered as the dully-gleaming
nuggets rolled into mubsleys palm

  but we cant stop remonstrated
joe yet he picked over the nuggets
in his employers hand

  its gold all fht-the pure quill
he commented excitedly

  lets see the map demanded
mubsley if the stuff is like this we
can clean up enough here in a few days
to make us all rich

  but the injuns-the injuns
whined joe dancing about but invari-
ably returning to the fascinating nug-
gets as though hypnotized by their
dull gleam

  indians hell bellowed prayerful
ill take a chanct

  same here squeaked bill

  thats it chortled mubsley well
stay-well stay now the map-the
map

  in my right saddle bag aletes
quietly directed marveling not a little
at the mad excitement the sight of the
nuggets had aroused

  mubsley clawed forth the map and


the frontier

spread it on the ground

  thats it joe exulted now as ex-
cited as his employer whoever
drawed that map knowed what he was
doin i know this crick and he sure
was here theres the place where he
found the nuggets-above the pint
where the crick slides under the wall
suddenly he threw up his head and
barked at squeaky bill and prayerful
keep an eye out fer the injuns we
dont all have to look at this map he
flicked the paper yep thats it i
know the place like my fet know their
moccasins

  go ahead then ordered mubs-
ley well be rich men before we
know it

v

i am the stream of which men dream

  for me the bold and daring
have sailed the deep and scaled the steep
aud to their doom went faring

i am the stream of which men dream

  for me the coward quailing

has crushed his fears and hushed his tears
  and cursed the thought of failing

i am the stream of which men dream

  be they awake or sleeping

to seize and hold my lees of gold

theyd blind the world with weeping

-song of pactolus

ow said joe to
aletes as the y
came out on a wide
bar spotted here
and there with
clumps of quaking
asp this pint here
is about a half-mile
above where the crick runs under the
canyon wall but your map dont
show where they found the gold-jes
says about half-mile above where the
crick goes outn sight

  my uncle said they built a monu-
ment of rocks and he gave me direc-
tions for finding the spot where they
dug the monument is on the south
side of the canyon above the flood
line

  you say they were in here thirty
year ago pondered joe well
things would change a heap in thirty
years cloud-bursts have conic down
this canyon in that time sweepin it as
clean as a rabbits snoot one thing
certain we wont find where they dug
thatll be all filled in and brushed over

they probly didnt dig deep and-

  the thing to do is to look for the
monument broke in mubsley impa-
tiently

he turned to the breeds and waved

his arms toward the far side of the
canyon

  rocks-high-hand laid-search he
shouted in sioux

  after a prolonged search they
found the monument grown over with
raspberry bushes and weathered to the
tones of its background topping it
was a flat stone on which had been
scratched the names of the party with
an arrow pointing in the direction of
their find the name of the youths
uncle headed the list

  thats it said aletes confidently
he patted the stone my uncle never
made any mistakes everything is
just as lie told me

  but the gold isnt here grumbled
mubsley looking around him as if he
half expected to see lumps of the pre-
cious stuff scattered about

  my uncle said to walk five hundred
paces due north which should bring us
close to the bank of the stream he
said they dug in a bar along the stream
well see how it comes out

  he drew a small compass from his
pocket lined up with a lightning-
blasted pine on the opposite side of the
canyon and slowly descended the
slope

  a few paces from the stream he
halted and glanced around him per-
haps there yet lingered some sign of
the feverish work of the gold-seekers
but not even a dimple in the ground
remained nature had long since filled
in and smoothed over all evidences of
the work of restless man

  this is as near as i can get to it
he told mubsley if you have tools
the next thing to do is to dig

  mubsley looked at the ground dubi-
ously displaying no eagerness to doff
his long coat all his life he had been
looking for easy money digging in
no way appealed to him but there
were the half-breeds they could dig
he ordered them to unpack and bring
up the picks and shovels

  aletes turned to joe while mubsley
was shouting orders at the breeds

  im sorry i cant help here lie said
regretfully but it takes two hands
to swing a pick

  jes you set down somewhere and
look on joe gently advised youll
git half of everything found anyway
as this is your find

  mubsley whirled on the little fron-
tiersman

  youre too fast with dividing up
what you havent got he snarled
these are my tools and my men ill
settle with him he waggled his
head at aletes

  you heard me talkin twanged
joe patting never-fail this boy
led us here and this find belongs to
him half of what we git goes to him
as is his right this is his claim not
yours or mine and ive been think-
in wed better start a new deal half
to the boy here and the rest split up
among us equal share to each man
you may own the outfit but you gotta
have us to keep your hair on your head
a mans hair is worth moren any out-
fit if you dont want us why well
hold a meetin and take over what you
got fer the good of the most men this
here is a free country and democratic
ive lieerd since i could tote a rifle
that the majority rules and when the
majority is concerned what one man
thinks dont count

  this is robbery spluttered the
trader i never heard of such a
thing

  youre hearin of it now mister
mubsley joe grinned and i
wouldnt try to change the deal he
cocked never-fail accidents will
happen you know ive heerd of ac-
cidents happenin to men like you
gun goes off and theres a dead man
and nobody knows how it happened
theres no law here and so weve the
right to make our own if we should
figger that you was goin agin what
was right and proper fer this party we
could if we wanted to take a piece of
rawhide and hang you by the neck

  prayerful who had been giving
joes words rapt attention broke into a
hoarse bellow of laughter

  sure-fire and nineteen wildcats
outn hell with their tails tied together
joe you said all there was to be said
he yelled he gave mubsley a terrific
slap on the back haugh haugh old
whey-belly youd sure look purty a-
hangin to a tree

  mubsleys thick lower lip hung slack
and bloodless as a piece of tripe he
attempted to reply to the terrible neigh-
ing of prayerful but the words stuck
in his throat

  let us have no more disputes he
finally managed to husk no more
disputes

  joe leaned never-fail against a sap-
ling and snatched a pick from a breed

  git at it he ordered mubsley
you dont seem to like heavy work so
you can help with the pannin you
and missoury and buckskin kin pan
and the rest of us will do the diggin
and watch out he added emphati-
cally watch out fer injuns gold
wont do us no good with our hides full
of sioux arrers
yellow iron



ach man under
joes quick orders
went to work with
a will mubsley
even cast aside his
long coat and great
hat aletes inward-
ly chafing at his
enforced inactivity seated himself
near the squatting buckskin a little
red-headed frontiersman who seemed
to have had some experience in pan-
ning

   ive prospected a little lie told the
youth but trappin comes more natral
to me he held up the pan that
aletes might see the string of light
colors following the black sand not
much in that fer this bunch

  mubsley and missouri had no better
luck each one secured fine colors
but no flakes of coarse gold or nuggets
were uncovered by the swishing water

  as the day wore on and only fine
colors rewarded their strenuous efforts
mubsley became grumpy and crest-
fallen there was no money in this
sort of work the frontiersmen now
openly scoffed at aletes

  i thought you said we would find
gold here whined squeaky bill all
the gold weve got we could put on a
skeeters hind leg that uncle of
yourn musta been drunk when he was
in here

  my uncle never drank replied the
youth calmly and i will ask you
not to refer to him in that way again

  wholl stop me flared the fat
frontiersman

   i will

  squeaky clambered up and out of
the discovery hole for a moment
he stared at the tall thick-chested
youth and then strode up to him and
gripped his right wrist

  joe threw down his shovel and se-
cured never-fail

  take your hand off me said
aletes softly

  but squeaky only grinned insolently
and tightened his grip

  don was suffering from his wound
and had been weakened by the strain
of the constant pain but the rage ris-
ing within him cold and terrible more
than offset what strength he had lost
he had been a worker in iron and the
natural strength of his hands was far
above the ordinary it had been no
great feat for him to straighten a
horseshoe with his hands

  he jerked free of squeakvs grip
and seized the frontiersmans hand
squeaky welcomed the trial of
strength he would force the young

rooster to his knees then into his lit-
tle black eyes came a look of pained as-
tonishment the fingers that held his
were fingers of iron they closed re-
morselessly grinding the bones togeth-
er but that was only the start the
iron fingers closed tighter and tighter
squeakys knees began to sag and the
sweat popped out beneath his eyes still
the iron fingers crushed his suddenly
a thin whine broke from his lips and
he went down on his knees

  by the staggerin tracks of my
great grandpaw exclaimed joe he
made squeaky squeal and that too
with a hurt shoulder i give him a
new name so i do stronghand i
name him right smack here and now

  squeaky on his knees was striving
weakly to break the terrible grip but
aletes was thorough in all that he did

  my uncle was an honest man he
informed the helpless frontiersman
he said they found gold here-nug-
gets-and we will find that he told the
truth he threw aside the pulpy
hand i want no trouble with you
but you must not say that my uncle is
a liar

  right as a fox barked joe any
time you cant handle em old never-
fail will speak on your side now
squeaky take your mashed paw down
to the crick and after this dont let the
wind blow in your mouth and dont
try no more tricks with my pard
either or ill take you in hand

  muttering imprecations squeaky
picked up his rifle and sought the creek
to lave his mashed paw in the cold
water

  aletes ignored squeaky so far as
he was concerned the incident was
closed but to squeakys saurian
mind the incident was not closed as
soon as he recovered the use of his
hand he flung up his rifle but joe
was ready even as squeaky pressed
trigger never-fail spoke joe had
intended to kill killing a man had
never disturbed the conscience of the
little frontiersman who while he was
ever loyal to the man he selected as his
partner was as bloodthirsty as a wea-
sel for some time he had wanted to
kill squeaky he could offer no rea-
son squeaky had always roused in
him the desire to kill thus when he
had what seemed to him a good ex-
cuse he let never-fail speak his senti-
ments but the lead struck squeakys
gun and incidentally smashed his trig-
ger finger close to the knuckle

  he gripped the wrist of his wounded
hand and hopped about wildly

  now youve done it he wailed

thinly as joe sauntered down to him
my fingers gone-my fingers gone

  sure shes gone said joe calm-
ly taking full marksmanship credit
though it was an accidental hit i
allers git what i shoot at i aimed to
git a finger and i got it after this
when i tell you to leave my young pard
be youll think twict before cuttin
loose at him next time ill put lead
through your heart git back and let
prayerful fix you up hell tie up
your paw and put goose grease on it

  there was little comment to the
frontiersmen the incident seemed triv-
ial they left squeaky to his whining
and the nursing of his maimed hand
and resumed their labors squeakys
bullet had passed through a corner of
the fringed collar of aletes buckskin
shirt he dismissed the incident from
his mind the fat man was now help-
less  he had lost his trigger-finger
there was no call for further thought
of him

  joe gave no thought to squeaky be-
yond regretting that his bullet had not
found the big fellows heart but he
did think of the two echoing rifle shots
the canqon was like a funnel to carry
sound

  injuns he muttered injuns
have ears and mighty sharp ones
then to aletes what was you sayin
about bedrock partner 

  when we get down to bedrock we
will find the heavy gold the youth pa-
tiently explained i do not know a
great deal about placer mining but my
uncle said that they found the coarse
gold and nuggets in the crevices in the
bedrock we cant expect to pick it
up from the top of the ground

  yes i guess thats right but mill-
in aint what im cut out fer same
there with prayerful and the rest trap-
pers mostly mubsley wouldnt know
a mine from a badger hole im think-
in wed better let go of this and break
fer the open country them two shots
could be heard fer a long ways and i
been smellin injuns all day what
say we gather up and go

  no i think we should work a little
longer demurred aletes we will
soon be down to bedrock surely no
man can expect to gather up a load of
nuggets in a half days work still it
is not for me to say what the party
wants suits me

  all right then agreed joe dubi-
ously well do as you say-keep on
diggin

  weve found mighty little for our
work complained mubsley theres
nothing in this fine stuff but i sup-


the frontier

pose we can keep on digging until dark
we ought to eat though

  eat and dig then croaked joe
but i smell injuns

hey ate some pem-
mican and again
fell to digging but
through the long
afternoon they
found only the
light colors and
many pans showed
no colors at all then suddenly the
diggers broke into a pocket mubs-
ley became almost delirious as the
heavy gold and nuggets trailed after
the black sand

  weve struck it he exulted
weve struck it

  now each man fairly quivered with
excitement even joe forgot to croak
i smell injuns they worked fev-
erishly until nightfall

  though joe counseled against it
and mubsley grumbled prayerful and
the other frontiersmen insisted on
broaching a keg of the traders alco-
hol to eelebrate their good fortune
his grumbled objections were quickly
overruled by the majority and when
he had gulped several drinks in quick
succession he forgot that it was his
precious alcohol they were wasting
but he was carcful to keep in his pos-
session the gold they had panned out
he had not offered to divide it consid-
ering himself treasurer of the party
the frontiersmen said nothing about
the gold when they decided to di-
vide it they would divide it if mubs-
ley clung to it they would take it away
from him by force

  the trader reeling and staggering
with drunken generosity now bade the
frontiersmen and the breeds  drinker
down and forget your troubles di-
luting the alcohol with water the hardy
borderers swigged it as they would tea
in a short time they were roaring
drunk naturally on an intensely
dark night a spree cannot be thorough-
ly enjoyed without a fire thus they
built a camp-fire and piled on the resin-
ous branches

  they danced wild dances and sang
weird songs

  we got the world by the tail and
the down-hill pull mubsley bellowed
with the perspiration rolling down his
pouchy cheeks

  prayerful got out the scalps he had
taken and performed a war dance
even squeaky bill soon raving drunk
forgot his smashed finger and boasted
of his killings

squeaky bill forget his smashed finger and
boasted of his killings

  im a squaw-killer he yelled
kill a squaw and she dont raise in-
juns  im a squaw-killer i kill many
squaws i kill em-i kill em

  then prayerful and missouri caught
the little dcacon who had been remon-
strating against their evil ways and
forced a drink down his throat he
nearly strangled but they had no mer-
cy on him they laughed uproariously
when at last the alcohol mounted to the
little fanatics brain and he became
girlish and simpering the effect so
pleased them that they forced him to
drink again and again until at last he
fell sprawling into some bushes and
lay with his thin expressionless face
up to the dim stars

  the half-breeds drew apart from the
white men and sang chanties of the
red river country they were a peo-
ple apart neither indian nor french
yet in their drunkenness they did not
become wild beasts as had prayerful
and the other frontiersmen nor did
they boast and bellow like mubsley
the alcohol seemed to bring their
latin blood to the surface they di-
luted it until it was little stronger than
the wine of their fathers they sang
of their loved ones gaily and blithely
danced a little and passed flowery com-
pliments

  by midnight every white man ex-
cept aletes and joe was sprawled out
on the ground dead drunk the breeds
had sought their blankets pleasantly
befuddled joe -was apparently only
slightly intoxicated

  i kin carry all the licker i kin pour
in my hide without gittin down im
in a class by myself that-o-way he
explained

  aletes had taken one drink but hav-
ing no taste for the stuff and no desire
for its effects had quietly declined
mubsleys oft-repeated invitation of
drinker up shes free as water

vi

  we are the little rattlesnakes

-song of the little rattlesnakes

t was now the
darkest hour that
period of intense
stillness and almost
palpable darkness
just before the
ghostly fingers of
dawn begin to feel
their way through gloomy canyon and
black forest

 aletes had been unable to sleep
motionless and silent he stared gloom-
ily at the sprawling shapes about the
fire now a great bed of glowing coals
-a wicked red eye winking at the
night

  joe had what he called a walking
drunk he seemed to be continually
in motion like a humming-bird and
his tongue rattled incessant he
came to aletes and walked round him
droning his everlasting monolog

 loaded to the muzzle-fer evry
hump theres a holler-higher you
fly furder you fall-head a-buzzin but
kin think all right-thinker fine as a
fiddle see what a cussed fool i be
and cant help it big-headed bunch

that youn i-

the mules have been acting as
yellow iron



though they were frightened at some-
thing aletes finally managed to in-
terrupt my mules whistled and
snorted long before i saw the in-
dians

  yes i know sniggered joe a
mule is like some men-snort at their
own shadder ive seen men jes that
way of course i smell injuns but
whats the use to bother about it with
this bunch all down cept us and
its all i kin do to keep from steppin
on both ears kin think but the body
wants to run round in a circle mules
scared-yes a mules born scared
scared he wont turn out to be a jack
or a hoss and winds up by bein noth-
in sometimes a mule is right and
sometimes he aint bear in here and
a bear will give a mule the runnin ga-
zimpoes mountain lion everywhere in
here and a mountain lion would make
a mule leave his youngun-hold on
im goin too fur a mule dont have
no younguns i over-shot that time
i shore must be drunk when a man
my age gits up and claims mules have
younguns hes shore drunk and should
be knocked in the head and put to
bed he snickered

  he attempted a little skip caught
himself and resumed his walk-around

  it seemed to aletes that the inces-
sant drone of joes voice was actually
rubbing his wound at least the twing-
ing and throbbing increased he
stepped farther back into the dark-
ness hoping the talkative frontiers-
man would not follow but the little
man was not to be shaken off the
youth rested an elbow on his rifle and
settled down to endure the interminable
monolog

  for an infinitesimal fraction of a
second aletes mind held the thought
that he was dreaming there had
come out of the night a deadly vi-
cious swishing and the shapes about
the fire suddenly bristled with feath-
ered shafts he caught a glimpse of
mubsleys legs jerking convulsively
joe had disappeared

  don whirled and leaped blindly with
some thought of reaching his horse
picketed below the camp but he had
been staring at the fire and the dark-
ness was like a black curtain before
him he crashed into some bushes
and went down on his knees the
next moment he was hurled flat on his
back and his gun torn from his grasp
a hand clutched his throat and another
his hair he felt a heavy body across
his legs he heard a guttural com-
mand he felt his pistols drawn from
their holsters and his knife from its

sheath then he was hauled to his
feet he caught the racial reek of his
captors they were indians-his mer-
ciless enemies

  his practical sense regained control
and he calmly faced the stark reality
this then was the end

  they hustled him up to the fire he
now became aware that a tall young
warrior with a slightly wounded arm
was glaring at him murderously

  the panther sole survivor of the
stoneslide massacre and now possessor
of the double-barreled rifle was eager
to kill the young white man but his
chief had ordered that the captive be
held for torture in the camp of the
band since the chief was the relent-
less petuspa the panther did not dare
to satisfy his blood-lust yet he
pressed the muzzle of the double-bar-
reled rifle against aletes chest and
spoke bitter taunting words

  here is the white man who would
not fight miniomni he shouted to the
warriors pressing in from all sides
the white man who hid in the rock and
struck like a snake this is the cow-
ard who would not fight miniomni
this is he-whose-gun-speaks-two-
times-quickly

  there came harsh guttural respon-
ses from the warriors their painted
faces held only merciless hostility

  a warrior threw some wood on the
fire aletes shivered a little as he
glimpsed the still forms bristling with
arrows this was the indians night
he wondered if joe had escaped

  a superb figure swung into the fire-
light petuspa the war chief he
shouted an order at some warriors
crowding eagerly around the kegs of
alcohol for he hated the white mans
minhvakan ska as bitterly as he hated
its maker he was one of the few
chiefs who saw that alcohol was one of
the white mans strongest allies with
it he debauched and destroyed the in-
dian

  for a moment the warriors hesitated
then fiercely petuspa repeated the
order sullenly they threw the kegs
on the fire many were the guttural
exclamations of wonder as the blue
flames leaped high

  facing death and torture aletes
every sense was now abnormally keen
suddenly the warriors jerked his
hands behind him and bound his wrists
the strain on his wounded shoulder
seemed intolerable yet he found the
strength to endure it without betray-
ing his suffering to his captors

  after stripping him of his personal
belongings it seemed to amuse petuspa

to mount his captive on one of the
mules that had carried the alcohol
the war chief saw something both
comic and degrading in a mule to
the red aristocrat the long-eared hy-
brid was only fit for a white man to
ride

into the future i look

ilcar ye o my people

no more the buffalo

no more the village by the river

come now ghosts and tell me

where is the dakota

the dead come not back again

where oncc a thousand war ponies stamped
  the ground

an old man talks to himself

saith the spirits

-song of the medicine man

he cruel h o u r s
from sunrise to
mid-afternoon had
gnawed deeply in-
to aletes reserve
vitality yet he had
managed to hold a
stoical front against
the savage threats and menacing
weapons of the young warriors
ever incited to new devilment by
the relentless panther who found
it easy to excite their ferocity by
chanting of the valor of his comrade
miniomni and of the cowardice of the
white man who had refused to face a
dakota in hand-to-hand combat but
for the discipline imposed by the stern
petuspa a knife soon would have
found the white youths heart but un-
der the chiefs baleful eye even the re-
vengeful panther did not dare go be-
yond threats and weapon flourishing

  ere hoisting him on the mule the
indians had bound his hands behind his
back with rawhide thongs thq
strained position made it impossible
for him to favor his wounded shoul-
der the jolting stiff-legged gait of
the mule brought recurrent ripples of
pain from his wound yet his dogged
spirit held fast to the thought that he
must endure without whimpering
after what seemed to him to be long
centuries of pain the war party ap-
proached the camp

  warriors squaws and children
yelping screaming and howling
streamed out from the tepees to wel-
come the victors every cur in the
camp joined in the demoniac chorus
and even the fat papooses left in their
snug skin cradles by their excited
mothers added their vocal mites to


the frontier

the pandemonium with difficulty the
mounted warriors saved their captive
from the raging squaws who struck at
him with knives and sticks screeched
insults and spat at him

  aletes was hauled from the mule and
thrown into a tepee the dog sol-
diers or camp police drove back the
excited mob and under pctuspas di-
rection the owner of the tepee was
given charge of the prisoner

  as an additional precaution against
escape the indian had bound the feet
of his prisoner in the center of the
tepee a tiny fire blazed fitfully the
indian jailer lay at ease upon a willow
bed covered with robes naught to
him were the sufferings of the white
man now and then he roused up to
push the sticks laid like the spokes of
a wheel a little farther into the fire
and to stare at the captive with the cold
malignancy of a vulture at times he
recited to the white man the various
tortures he was to endure on the mor-
row this seemed to amuse him al-
though it was plain to him that the
captive did not understand a word of
his guttural talk

  he fumbled in a beaded bag and
drew forth several scalps aletes saw
that one scalp was that of a woman
he shuddered inwardly as he slared at
the long golden-brown hair the in-
dian grunted his satisfaction it was
pleasant to lie comfortably on a wil-
low bed and taunt a white man

  aletes had come to accept the gnaw-
ing pain of his wound and the throb of
his tortured wrists as a part of the
scheme of life and thus had conserved
his nerve force and vitality thirst
however gave him  rest he was
continually thinking of the cool bub-
bling springs from which he had
drunk particularly did he remember
a spring near his home town visions
of that little spring ice-cold clear and
sparkling taunted him cruelly what
wouldnt he give to return to that
spring and drink and drink and drink

  yet save for the visions prompted
by thirst and exhaustion his calm
practical spirit held imagination in
check he was helpless but he re-
fused to give way completely to de-
spair

  he knew that he could expect 
mercy from the dakotas for they had
bound his hands and feet and permit-
ted him to suffer hunger and thirst
his only hope was that they would kill
him quickly though he gave little en-
couragement to that hope his nature
grim stubborn and practical simply
stood at bay prepared to endure what-

ever agony fate held in store for him

  he thought of joe trying to remem-
ber the precise moment the little man
had disappeared it seemed to him
that joe had faded from view a breath
before the arrows had wrought their
deadly work yet it scarcely was pos-
sible that lie had escaped

letes relaxed as
best he could al-
though the bedlam
of indian n i g h t
made rest impossi-
ble not far away
some fiend was
pounding a drum
to the dull monotonous tunking the
dancers chanted in wild chorus
squaws lifted piercing shrieks for the
dead and the dogs barked continually
the whole village seemed to be en-
gaged in a talking contest he had
once read an account of the taciturnity
of the indian he now realized that
most of the written accounts of the
habits and customs of the indians were
written by men who had never suf-
fered a night of torture in an indian
camp

  there came a faint scratching at the
tepee flap and a low guttural sum-
mons

  brother one who talks with spirits
desires to look on the face of the white
man that his medicine may be strength-
ened said the voice

  the old indian did not stir from his
bed a medicine-man desired to look
on the face of the white captive who
was he to cross the desire of one who
talked with spirits

  it is good he droned o talker
with spirits

  the medicine-man entered the tepee
he was wrapped from head to foot in
a white robe aletes caught a glimpse
of a burning eye through the folds of
the robe for a moment the medicine
man stared at him and then half-
turned to the indian

  too loose he grunted pointing at
the bonds of the captive

   grunting a little the old indian rose
from his comfortable bed shambled
over to the captive and knelt down to
examine the bonds aletes felt the
cold clawlike fingers on his swollen
wrists

  then something rose from the robe
of the mysterious visitor and descended
on the head of the kneeling warrior
aletes felt the weight of a limp body
across his legs again the robed fig-
ure struck the indian and then seized
his legs and dragged him to the far

side of the tepee the next moment
the youth felt a knife sever his bonds
and caught the warning whisper its
joe

  the little frontiersman hauled his
partner to his feet and wrapped the
robe of the dead indian about him

  straight ahead to the crick he
whispered your hoss is in some cot-
tonwoods under a big sandstone cliff
about two miles down float-take
far side of crick wait fer me
skip

  aletes did not try to think by some
miracle joe had released him and he
would obey the resourceful little man
to the letter and trust to his good for-
tune covered from head to foot with
the robe he made a slow exit from the
tepee

  the dogs as he stalked toward the
creek gave him several thrills excit-
ed by the white mans scent they
barked furiously and one even ven-
tured to nip at his heels but he strode
on with what he conceived to be the
slow dignified stride of an indian war-
rior the dancing and excitement
made the barking of the dogs seem
trivial and commonplace robed fig-
ures were passing to and fro constant-
ly a short distance from the fires
every shape became blurred and indis-
tinct

  once a warrior addressed the youth
but he did not pause this aroused no
suspicion on the part of the indian
the one wrapped so tightly in his robe
was communing with his guardian
spirit

  as he entered the cottonwoods a
young squaw suddenly appeared and
came toward him slowly thinking him
a seeker of love he turned away
from her she put her hands over her
heart and ran toward the camp burn-
ing with shame she had approached
a warrior in the dark supposing that
he was seeking a maiden and had been
spurned for days she would hang
her head and look at no man

  the youths one desire now was to
feel the cooling waters of the moun-
tain stream yet he knew that he must
not halt until he was out of hearing of
the noises of the camp without mis-
hap he passed through the protecting
gloom of the cottonwoods and slipped
through the willows that lined the
creek it took all his will power to
wade the stream for his throat mus-
cles were jerking for a gulp of the cool
water but he resolutely pressed on
down the far bank until he was out of
hearing of the din of the camp

  now and then a rattlesnake buzzed
yellow ihox



faintly for once he welcomed the
buzzing of the hidden snakes indians
were not likely to be prowling through
a gloomy tangle of willows infested
with rattlesnakes warily he slipped
through the willows and came out on a
little grassy bank there he threw the
robe into the rushing current and
jerked off his boots and buckskin shirt
then with a great sigh of pleasure he
slipped into the cool water and sank
down until the little waves splashed his
face when a liitle of the water had
worked its way down his throat he
thought he could hear his blood fairly
singing for joy his body soaked up
the reviving fluid like a dry sponge
however he fought back the desire to
gulp his fill of the cold sweet water
drinking only enough to dull his thirst

  then he made a bundle of his shirt
and boots tied the sleeves around his
neck and waded into the rushing cur-
rent to float luxuriously in the foam
and smother the cool flood fed by
mountain springs allayed the fever in
his wound and eased the pain of his
lacerated wrists after his long hours
of suffering the rushing water seemed
to caress and to soothe his every nerve
and to remove every physical and men-
tal irritation

  lightly and swiftly the current car-
ried him he had only to keep afloat
only to rest lightly on the water at
times he would shift his burden to his
chest and float on his back down the
crystal flood with the little waves ca-
ressing his cheek now and then as
he floated close to the far bank a trail-
ing willow would brush his face

  when he saw the sandstone cliff
looming through the gloom he left the
soothing water regretfully faithful
received him with a startled snort but
after a few pats and low-toned admo-
nitions the good horse nuzzled his
dripping master and showed every evi-
dence of being glad to feel his touch
again

-song of the pard

breath before
the deadly arrows
had ended the am-
b i t i o n s of the
mubsley party joe
had taken flight
with something of
the action of a fly-
ing squirrel he had gained the back of

aletes horse severed the picket rope
and sped down the canyon while the
nearest warriors were struggling with
his partner

  the indians had dismounted above
the camp and crept up on two sides
the way down the dark canyon was
open their wild yelps of triumph
prevented them from hearing the
thump of the horses hoofs in their
mad excitement and fierce desire to se-
cure the scalps of their victims they
failed to note that one man had es-
caped

   the alcohol had not dulled the little

a silent terrible fight

mans thinking powers perhaps aletes
had fallen but he would make sure a
mans first duty was to save himself
a dead man can be of no help to his
partner

  with an uncanny sense of location
he pulled in faithful at the point where
the stream curved into the hole in the
canyon wall dismounting he dropped
on one knee and listened intently and
then led the horse down the center of
the stream and into the opening on
each side the creek extended to masses
of boulders which blocked the corners
of the opening but by keeping to the
center of the stream he was able to
lead faithful into the cavern although
the saddle horn scraped the low-hang-
ing lip

  feeling his way in the intense dark-
ness lie left the horse in a great room
hollowed out by countless floods and
returned to the stream that roared into
eternal night

  he knew that the indians would
doubtless with the coming of daylight
note the hoofprints but he was sure
that they would not investigate the hid-
den waterway such freaks of nature
they regarded as the work of the evil
one to them the dark opening in
the canyon wall was the mouth of the

evil one the white boulders in the
corners of the mouth of the evil one
were his teeth a stream flowed into
the mouth of the evil spirit yet he
was always thirsty as he swallowed
the stream so would he swallow a man

  by the dawn-light through the boul-
ders wedged in the side of the open-
ing the frontiersman watched the war
party with aletes in the center of the
column ford the stream above the
point where he had entered the water
passing a few rods above faithfuls
trail they had not discovered his hoof-
prints they rode on slowly talking
and gesticulating joe sighed his re-
lief when the last painted and befeath-
ered rider had passed he waited un-
til he was sure they were clear of the
canyon before he led faithful from
the grotto

  he was not long in gaining the sum-
mit of a hill from which he could
sweep the country with his telescopic
eye far to the north he saw the in-
dians moving in a straggling column
now and then he caught the flash of a
lance head or the gleam of a brass
ornament

  he sent faithful in a wide-flung cir-
cle to the east and approached the in-
dian camp from the down-stream side
he had no well-defined plan but en-
tertained some vain hope of rescuing
the youth from the clutches of the da-
kotas by deliberately crawling into
camp under cover of darkness

  he tied the horse among some cot-
tonwoods the sun was down but the
afterglow touched the trees and the
swiftly-flowing stream with purple
light the turtle doves were singing
mournful farewells to the day and
now and then a nightliawk clove the
air with sudden whirring twang
swiftly and silently as some twilight
ghost the frontiersman slipped toward
the camp

  white buffalo one of the medicine-
men of the band was communing with
the spirits and making medicine in a
little glade amid the cottonwoods so
engrossed was lie in his meditations
that he did not see the white man un-
til the deadly and intent figure was
confronting him knife in hand

  he drew his knife but indian-like
ere their wrists locked as joe had
hoped he must tell his name and boast

  white buffalo will take the heart
of the white man for medicine he
snarled and his hair for ornament

  a silent terrible fight in the little
opening while the turtle doves cooed
sweetly and the nighthawks zoomed
through the purple dusk presently


the frontier

such was the desperate fury of joes
attack the indian received a mortal
wound he sank to earth and died
quickly and silently for there was no
time for speech or death-song

  for a moment the frontiersman con-
templated his fallen foe and then a
plan came to him he returned to
faithful and cached his rifle which
fearful that the report would be heard
in the camp he had not dared to use

  returning to the little glade he
donned the costume of the medicine-
man as well as a horrible wig made of
the scalp and long braids of the talker
with the spirits he experienced some
difficulty in trimming his billy-goat
beard with his hunting knife but he
finally cut it down to a stubble then
he applied the paints of white buffalo
to his face and hands

iius disguised he
had made his way
to running wolfs
tepee and effected
aletes release
then to give don
plenty of time to
escape he stepped
from the tepee to confront a number of
young warriors who were approaching
it evidently bent on some nocturnal
devilment among them was the
panther carrying aletes double-bar-
reled gun

  it is not good said the panther
that the white man whose gun i now
hold should live through the night
the slayer of miniomni should die
before the sun shows his face

  such is not the will of petuspa
said another petuspa has given the
white man into the keeping of old run-
ning wolf it is ordered that he be
tortured before the people

  there will be little thought of the
white man with the coming of the
sun declared the panther are not
the women packing now that we may
move with the coming of light to re-
ceive the presents of the great white
father it would be a good deed to
kill the white man now

  abruptly he turned to joe standing
before the closed tepee flap wrapped
from head to foot in the robe of the
medicine-man as the panther turned
to him seeking his approval and sup-
port joes quick mind conjured up an-
other plan

  holding his head low like a man
communing with his medicine he made
the sign meaning wait the panther
hesitated but joe still barred his way
toward the prisoners tepee before

the indian could overcome his awe of
the medicine-man joe had signed that
the prisoner should be killed by the
panther-at which a light of fierce joy
showed on the indians face-but that
until morning he was to be left un-
harmed

  joe waited anxiously when the mes-
sage was finished had the indian un-
derstood-was he convinced  for
despite joes perfect familiarity with
the dakota tongue he dared not speak
the panther would know it was not
white buffalos voice

  it is well said the panther

  joe turned abruptly and walked
steadily toward the distant cotton-
woods he passed many robed fig-
ures but was not annoyed by the dogs
apparently the scent of his indian cos-
tume dulled the suspicions of the
prowling curs

  once in the gloom of the cotton-
woods he sprang forward into a run
gaining the bank of the creek he
plunged into the stream and discarded
the robe and horrible wig he paused
long enough to scrub his head vigor-
ously and then crossed the creek and
slipped through the willows and brush
and into the open country apparent-
ly tireless he trotted through the
gloom a wild figure that might easily
have been taken for an indian as a
matter of fact he was far more a crea-
ture of the wild than the indian and
far more deadly to the indians nat-
ural cunning he added the thinking
powers of the white man

  he was soon wading the creek oppo-
site the point where he had hidden
faithful aletes waded into the shal-
lows to help him ashore

  how in the name of heaven-
cried the youth shaken out of his ha-
bitual calm for once

  never mind how i did it snapped
the dripping joe shaking himself like
a dog its movin time fer us when
the injuns find that old guard of yours
dead as moses they may send a war
party on our trail although i heard
they was packin to git to the post and
git their presents from the govern-
ment jes the same we move i
learned something this trip don fer
a knock-em-cold weapon put a rock
in a medicine sack thats what i
fixed your guard with ka-sunk and
its all over no noise or nothin-jes
ka-sunk now fer the hoss and a lit-
tle skip and then some buffalo meat
well take turns ridin the hoss then
when we kin dry some meat well use
him fer packin im thinkin our trou-
bles are about over

few days later the
members of a long
wagon train sighted
two men coming
toward them across
the prairie one of
the men was lead-
ing a horse

  at the signals of the two the cap-
tain of the train ordered a halt

  i dont know joe told the captain
after recounting the escape of his part-
ner and himself from the dakotas as
id be in any hurry to go on the da-
kotas are coming to the post to git
presents and theyre pretty ugly
when i was in their camp they were
talkin about takin the presents with
one hand and holdin arrers in the
other id wait till they was clear of
the post and on their hunting ground
west of the spirit hills theres a
good campin place a little ways beyond
here circle your wagons there and
wait a few days id say you dont
need a couple of good men do you
yes i do replied the captain em-
phatically a number of our people
have become discouraged and are go-
ing back do you know the country
beyond laramie

  you bet was the frontiersmans
cheerful reply went onct as fur as
the big river that empties into the pa-
cific he turned to aletes with the
quizzical paternal smile with which he
habitually regarded the youth how
about you boy want to take a trip
to oregon and have a look at the pa-
cific maybe calijiforny where they
say they dig out the nuggets biggern
a mans head theres the country fer
yeller iron these here spirit hills
are poor pickins aside calijiforny
aletes who had listened closely to
the conversation between joe and the
captain of the train shook his head
slowly

  no joe he said rather sorrow-
fully i think it would be better for
me to go with the people who are re-
turning home ive had a great deal
of bad luck but for you i would
have nothing at all i see now that
until a man learns a lot of things he is
more or less of a burden to his friends
ill return home open a gun shop and
get a new start maybe ill try for
gold in the west again some time
now is as good a time as any re-
marked joe dryly if i waited till i
started with an outfit id never git
started

  for a moment the old frontiersman
searched the face of his young part-
ner for any sign of fear no the boy
yellow iron



wasnt afraid he was just the sort that
had to move in his own way

  i guess you know your own heart
better than anybody else he said
mournfully id liggered maybe wed
have several trips together out yonder
but i guess it is better fer you to go
back to the town country youre
young and theres a heap of fine girls
back there and a young feller ought to
git him a strappin young woman and
raise him a bunch of good americans
he sighed heavily wouldnt want
no pard of mine to be like me-with
squaws yep thats it don go back
to your home folks when the west
has more people bring your wife and
kids out here and let the younguns
grow up in that park you been tellin
me of-the place where the injuns
jumped you some day old joe will
come driftin in without a tooth in his
head to play with your youngsters and
chore around the place fer grub and
blankets

  aletes smiled

in the early ios emigrant
trains deviated from the beaten
trail that led into california over the
high sierra and wound westward
over the warner mountains from fort
hall into the isolated modoc country
here the covered wagons would camp
near bloody point on tule lake at
the mercy of the indians the help-
less pioneers would fight off for a time
the showers of poisoned arrows from
hidden bows then from the west
into the midst of their despair would
come a little band of galloping horse-
men-red and blue shirts broad slouch
hats handkerchiefs waving as a sign
of pcace and aid-ben wright and his
band of californians dashing upon the
modocs to send them scuttling a line
of lifeless braves on their trail

  indians upon lost river would steal
cattle and terrify lonely settlers again
ben wright would come dressed in
buckskins long black hair hanging

  youll always find a welcome as
long as i live ill always think of you
he said earnestly

  well well mourned joe al-
ways a lone trail fer us old cusses go
back don but fer me the trail toward
the settin sun-me and old never-fail
and a little salt

  yet as aletes rode away from the
camp with the fainthearts he began to
visualize the future he would return
to his home town and open a gun shop
he would make true and beautiful
weapons for other men to use when
his days work was done he would
seek his boarding-house he might
even get married and settle down and
become a solid respected citizen

  the return to the home town began
to assume a dull drab tone in sharp
contrast to it were the days and nights
on the sunset trail while he was
working in his quiet little shop other
men would be seeing new country
and experiencing splendid adventures
why the captain of the train had said

ben wright

b rachel middlebrook

often mistaken for an indian more
silent than his lurking foe he would
creep through the tule swamps recon-
noiter among the tents of the unsus-
pecting savages and returning lead
his band to surround and exterminate
the modoc rancheria a massacre on
pit river another  the klamath-
ben wright the pugnacious son of
gentle pennsylvania quakers was al-
ways chosen the avenger he followed
the american frontier westward in the
forties and became an outstanding fig-
ure in california and oregon when
law was a matter of bullet and knife

  his friends called him fair just and
admired his uncanny skill in tracking
down the red man whom he had sworn
to punish his enemies who included
many of the whites and most of the
indians called him atrociously cruel
their stories of his exploits vary as
greatly as their views upon his char-
acter but even the most generous ad-

that the oregon country was crossed
by mighty rivers and that it was des-
tined to be one of the greatest states
in the union california too was a
paradise but he was returning to the
stuffy little home town to make guns
what was wrong what had changed
him  was there something in the air
of the west that made a man tire of
the old things the old routine the
worn paths was his uncle right
when he said that once a man knew
the west his heart turned to it always

  suddenly he turned faithful and
bade the astonished faint-hearts an
abrupt farewell the west had
claimed him for its own

  joe grinned happily as the youth
rode into the camp

  well partner bowd you find all
the home folks  he greeted

  just fair laughed the youth as he
dismounted but none of them knew
how good buffalo meat tastes or what
it means to travel the sunset trail with
a good pard

vnit his part in the vital encounter of
his career the ben wright massacre
in the winter of - when he drew
forty-five modocs together under a
flag of truce and massacred most of
them by means of fighters held ready
in ambush he was a rough man and
an uncouth who had lived so much
among the indians that he sincerely
believed in fighting them only with
their own crafty weapons

  later however as a government
sub-agent among the indians in south-
ern oregon wright was known for
his fairness and kindliness to the na-
tives in  he was lured from
his cabin and instantly killed by a band
of indians contemplating a general
massacre his body was mutilated be-
yond recognition the superstitious
savages later told that they had cut
away his heart cooking and eating it in
the hope of gaining for themselves
the honored courage of ben wright
the straight of it

first of all we want to set j e
grinstead right and correct an er-
ror which crept into the magazine in
connection with his story oklahoma
 mr grinstead as ins readers
know is scrupulously careful in his
stories and can always be relied upon
for the authenticity of his history and
background-on which reliability he
justly prides himself it is doubly un-
fortunate therefore that one of those
editorial slips which seem to delight
in creeping in every once in so often
chose his story  which to pick

  in the introductory paragraph and
in the trading post for oklahoma
 we referred to the cherokee strip
whereas the story itself was concerned
with the oklahoma opening

  i have returned from my bear and
alligator hunt in the piney woods of
east texas and am going to call your
attention to a slight discrepancy in the
announcement of oklahoma 
mr grinstead promptly checked us up
in your reference to it in the trading
post there occurs  oklahoma  is
a story of the opening of cherokee
strip i think you will find that the
only reference that is made to the
cherokee strip in that yarn is that
those who went into oklahoma from
the north or kansas side had to cross
the strip while those  the south or
fndian territory side had a chance to
get right  the line in the chickasaw
country i tried to make all this plain
in the story and think i did you
will understand all this better when i

recall to your mind a thing that you
obviously knew but overlooked that
is oklahoma the original territory
was opened to settlement in april
 the cherokee strip was a little
slice of land that lay letween the north
line of oklahoma and the south line
of kansas it was claimed by the
cherokee indians as an outlet to the
hunting grounds to the westward over
which they could travel to and fro
without crossing the reservations of
other indians it was commonly called
the cherokee outlet this little strip
of land was not ceded to the united
states government until  and it
was more than four years after the ad-
venture of old bent raboms clan that
the strip and several other small res-
ervations were opened to settlement
compared to the original opening of
oklahoma the opening of the strip
loomed up about like a country dog-
fight compared to breaking the hin-
denburg line by that time the gov-
ernment had learned how to handle
such things there never could be but
one occurrence like the opening of
original oklahoma no government
of sane people would let such a thing
occur a second time it cannot be de-
scribed either in words or pictures

  the picture you have for the head-
ing is typical but it couldnt have liap-
pened in the cherokee strip because
it shows water there wasnt enough
water in the cherokee strip at that
time to keep a horned toad alive twenty
minutes except a little brackish trickle
in that dreadful gash in the plain
known as the salt fork of the cimar-

ron and it was nowhere near the line

  we stand corrected and penitent-
and swear to goodness it will not hap-
pen again

speed on the draw

recently we published a short
discussion between j e grin-
stead and colonel george b rod-
ney regarding the proper method of
carrying a six-gun for quick action
although the item took but a little
space in the trading post its fascinat-
ing subject matter was quick to attract
attention and brought in a fine harvest
of interesting letters of which we un-
fortunately have room to print but a
few

  the following from a former peace
officer of wyoming highly recom-
mended by the governor of that state
comes out in no uncertain terms in
support of mr grinstead

editor thf frontier

dear sir

  i read with a great deal of interest the
discussion between colonel rodney and mr
grinstead regarding the proper location on
the person of the six-gun

  having been brought up under the juris-
diction of judge colt as you might say-i
was raised in montana wyoming and the
dakotas-and also following an occupation
for some years necessitating the carrying
of sidearms perhaps i can shed some light
 the subject that may be helpful

  everything else laid aside-except the
necessity of getting the gun quick-granted
that the gunman is right-handed-there is
 place else that is naturally so handy as
the right side a little forward well down
on the leg bottom of holster tied fast just
above the knee the longer the gun the
farther down it must hang so that the hand


the trading post



gripping the butt will not have to be raised
unnaturally high in order to clear the muzzle
when brought to horizontal in the longer
models such as the colts frontier pattern
and the bisley model with the seven-inch
barrels the tip must hang almost to the
knee cap as these guns are close to a
foot in length it is easily understood why
this is neccssarv in other words the
weapon must be lifted vertically a foot be-
fore it can be leveled even from the hip
when one is in a hurry as is invariably the
case when the weapon is needed he is very
likely to attempt to level the weapon before
the tip of the muzzle is clear of the top
of the holster-a loss of valuable time
numberless funerals might have had differ-
ent principals but for this one little mis-
take so much for the necessity of carry-
ing the gun very low when on the right side
now then let us look at the arguments
against this position

  in the first place it is extremely trouble-
some to have several pounds of hardware
bumping and pounding at your leg every
time a violent or even quick move is made
the motion of a galloping horse will cause
the gun to beat the leg black and blue in a
days time unless strapped very tight to the
leg itself should the animal decide to buck
-which seems to be the constitutional right
of all western cayuses-the gun is not only
a hindrance but is very likely to jump out
of the holster and drop to the ground

  your range waddie mounts from the left
side of the horse standing facing the op-
posite way from that in which the horse
is facing well forward by the left shoul-
der this is a range bred necessity it
lessens the temptation for the brute to use
his hind foot too freely the left foot is
then placcd in the stirrup the right hand
grips the horn or pommel the rider swings
the right leg over the cantle of the saddle
the right foot describes an almost perfect
half circle if the animal plunges forward
which happens most of the time the motion
assists the rider into the saddle instead of
flinging him to the rear as would be the
case when mounting english fashion now
then for the relation of the six-shooter to all
this when the gun is carried on the right
side and low unless it is tied securely in the
holster it will slip out at that point in the
movement when the riders right thigh is
higher than the torso if the gun is tied
in the holster-as ive witnessed some green-
horns do-and unless the holster is tied
firmly to the leg the force of the swing
into the saddle brings the gun backward and
when the seating is effected your hero is
sitting on his gun very uncomfortable to
say the least-especially if the bronc gives
a few stiff-legged buck-jumps

  now then as to the position on the left
hip slightly to the front grip pointing for-
ward as did mr grinsteads hero in the
master squatter this position is used by
all the old cowmen that i know and i was
raised on the range the reasons arc simple
and practical to range uses this brings
the weapon fairly high at the waistline
thereby lessening the tendency to flop
around like a sheeps tail when the wearer
moves quickly

  it takes but one movement after the hand
falls on the grip to bring it out in a para-
bola shaped curve and pointed at the target
all one motion the front sight or muzzle
never catches in the holster

  in mounting being on the left side it is
never inverted thereby lessening the possi-
bility of dropping out of the holster i
believe that the foregoing are a few at least
of the very good reasons why the left side
butt forward muzzle pointing down and
back is the most popular

  i have seen the six-gun worn on the right
side and well down on the leg by some
mighty fast men but they were always
afoot usually gamblers and saloon toughs
to my memory i have never seen a mounted
cowman carry his gun in this manner

  i own and use one of the seven-inch bar-
reled frontier pattern colt s myself
this particular arm was made in  for
the u s government it was carried by
two kansas sheriffs in the early days-father
and son-and has been in my possession
for some years now i am afraid if it were
notched for every man it has accounted for
the steel would be completely filed away or
at least rendered useless sometimes my
work still carries me onto the range horse-
back even in this day of autos where when
i do need a gun it must be of fairly long
range and maximum shocking power this
one carries up point blank at a hundred
yards using the forty-five long smokeless
powder

  on the other hand here is a note
from an old-timer who ranched in
cochise county arizona in the early
eighties experience enough he cer-
tainly has had-and hes ready to back
it up too

editor the frontier

dear sir

  now i just must differ with j e grin-
steads article about carrying a gun on the
left hip unless a man is left-handed and
shoots with his left hand i was raised in
arizona and texas and my old pard was
frank lelie buckskin frank he was a
gun-fighter but not a killer and the fastest
gunman in either state he carried his gun
on his right hip handle to the front he
was my teacher and i will bet  to 
that even though i am past sixty i can pull
and fire before any man can pull from his
left hip if he is right-handed

  again here is another old-timer who
lias traipsed all over the west grin-
stead is right says he-and proceeds
to prove it in a mighty interesting
letter

editor the frontier

dfar sir

  i have spent around thirty-five years in
the west arizona new mexico texas
california nevada colorado montana
wyoming kansas and nebraska have
known many western types of citizen-the
cowboy prospcctor miner saloonman gam-
bler badman rustler train-robber etc j
e grinstead is right about packing a gun
on the left side as described but only cer-
tain ones do so many gunmen packed the
gun on the right hip and shot from the hip
when the low-hung holster was in use the

wearer would tie the lower end of the holster
to the leg to keep the gun from jamming
when a quick draw was needed the low-
hung was to give the arm more freedom
and wider sweep but it was discovered by
a keen man-killer that a lot of lost motion
was attached to the low-hung and he devised
the belt holster

  the hip-fire holster is attached to belt
with a single rivet so as to allow holster
to pivot with an upward motion the end
of holster is cut off enough to allow muzzle
of gun to protrude a chunk is cut out
around trigger-guard to allow insertion of
finger hipshots rarely drew gun from
scabbard for the reason that the target was
usually but a few feet distant making a
miss almost impossible some of these hip-
shots were very deadly of course two-
gun shooters used both hips and many were
ambidextrous where a single gun was used
but when both draws were made simultan-
eously the right hand took the right-hand
gun and the left the left-no crossing over
as in a single draw and the handles were
pointed back instead of front

  many saloon men bartenders gamblers
sports and rounders carried the colt gtin
without a holster or belt shoving it down on
the left hip with handle to front-between
waistband and body using the little hinged
clip that is in the right shoulder open as a
projection to hang onto the waistband i
have known some to wear a gun in the waist-
band on the right hip with handle pointed
back these were what is known as snap
shooters the gun is drawn with a hinge-
like movement of the arm as though closing
and the shot fired from in front of the hip
a little and a trifle away from it thus
gives the wrist free play to move the gun
in a weaving motion this cannot be done
with the liipshot through the scabbard
another snapshot is to raise the gun up
and backward over the shoulder bringing
it down in a sweeping motion onto the tar-
get pulling the trigger the moment of con-
tact of sight and target this is popular
in shooting at running objects but has too
much lost motion for rapid action

  many cowboys pack the gun on the right
hip to the rear when on foot and a little
further in front when riding so as not to
chafe the cantle of the saddle many pack
the gun in a holster on the side of the pom-
mel when riding and inside the shirt on
the left side when walking using waistband
for a support many officers of the law
carried a gun in a scabbard in the hip poc-
ket right some wore regulation belt and
holster i packed a gun as a cowboy on the
right hip as officer  the left side handle
front never in hip-pocket

  having the gun  the left hip-or right-
is an advantage to a two-handed man and
a big advantage to a right-handed shooter
provided it isnt known that he is right-
handed for most who are not in tlie know
would expect the wielder to use the hand
most convenient to the gun the cross
reach has fooled many a one

  however i think habit has a lot to do
with how a gun is toted one of the most
deadly killers i knew was an officer of the
law a texan he carried an old wooden-
handled forty-five in his coat pocket he
killed his last man in williams arizona
after the man had shot at him twice one
bullet going through liis hat the other wild
he deliberately gave the man a chance to


the frontier

shoot in order to have an excuse for killing
him and he did kill him twice that is he
fired two shots either of which would have
caused almost instant death one through
the neck and one through the heart

  i have been over the ground covered by
e e harriman in six-gun quarantine
i did some mining where the quarantine
fence was built-near dripping springs
tank its a fine story and deserves a place
in historical romances of the west we
must take care to perpetuate these stories
for it will be but a short time till the old-
timers and the writers who were born
on the ground will have passed we ought
to have a university where those things are
taught to the coming crop of western story
writers we have still plenty- of data and
enough old-time fiction writers such as
harriman raine manlove rhodes gray
muiford and a lot of that caliber we lost
a good one when hough passed out the
automatic started to sweep out the colt
but it failed the colt is back to stay the
automatic cant be depended on where there
is dust and grit and that is the best we
have in cowland so old colt is still with us

first out of the pouch this month
is a letter from a colorado reader
who rises to corroborate edwin l

too knows dr t and pays tribute to

ance 

editor the frontier

dkar sir

  i have just finished reading all clear
grit by edwin l sabin in the frontier
and i want to say it is all true from begin-
ning to end for i have heard the same story
from the doctors own lips just as it was
in mr sabins article

  i have known doctor t all my life and
he is just as mr sabin describes him being
a cjuiet man soft-spoken and gentle but
made of strong stuff or he could never have
crawled thirty miles through the snow after
being shot six times which i know to be a
fact for i have seen the scars

  dr t at the present time is living on a
farm which he has back in the hills where

he traps and hunts bear he is an excellent
hunter and a fine shot he is well liked
and respected by everyone who knows him
and the country would be benefited by it if
there were more men like him

  next comes a letter from a trading
post reader who checks up edward
parrish ware on his little article on
the red river raft

editor the frontier

dear sir

  i feel called upon to correct a false im-
pression conveyed by mr ware in his arti-
cle the red river raft mr ware
states that the raft finally so impregnated
the air with malaria that human existence
was unendurable in its vicinity the
rotting of the logs nearest the mouth of
the stream accounted for the deadly mal-
aria from this one unfamiliar with the
subject would be led to believe that malaria
is caused from the rotting of logs or from
bad air this assumption is absolutely in-
correct as our scientists have proven the
old theory of paludistn or of a sickness ex-
haled from the ground to be obsolete and
wholly wrong the broad facts on which
it was based are sufficiently accounted for
by the liabits of mosquitoes

  there arc many kinds of mosquitoes but
the female anopheles is the only one which
has and whose biie may transmit to humans
-the malarial germ although even they
will not be infected with malaria unless they
have bitten a human being having the dis-
ease

editor the frontier

dear sir

  i especially enjoy mr mulfords stories
because while i get all of the thrill that
comes from the romance and adventure of
western tales in ordinary they arc like ac-
curately photographed movies true in all
of the details one is getting a lot of ac-
curate information as well as fine enjoy-
ment in losing ones self in the sphere of
what is the most satisfying type of fiction
to many readers i like em wild i like em
woolly and i like em killed where they
ought to he killed that is what i pay
my quarter for as one new england
school-teacher said about western movies

  i have only been reading the frontier
about one year now but  look forward to
it eagerly each month shall miss alanson
skinners articles it seems to me tliat you
are doing a splendid work in scattering such
articles as those of muiford skinner the
cowboy songs etc in a fiction magazine
and bringing to peoples attention so much
of the interesting truths of the old west
and habits of frontier life
