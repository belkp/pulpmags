it was very apparent that his excellency
jonkheer adriaan adriaanszoon van
schouten governor-general of the
netherlands east indies was in a temper
his eyes sparked like an emery-wheel

biting cold steel his thin sharp-ridged
nose rose high and the nostrils quivered
his pale almost bloodless lips were set in
rigid lines over his finely chiseled birdlike
beak with its aggressive vandyke beard
his hair bristled straight and stiff like the
neck-feathers of a ruffled cock over the
edge of his linen collar it was this latter

evidence of the governors unpleasant
humor that his military associate general
gysbert karel vanden bosch observed
with growing anxiety

  the governor took a pinch of snuff with
great deliberation and glared across the
big table of his cabinet-room at the gen-
eral vanden bosch shrank visibly

   then my dear generaal he demand-
ed  you say we must let these sons of
jezebel burn down my residencies behead
my residents and feed my controlleurs to
the crocodiles without interference from
the military

  ach no your excellency general
vanden bosch expostulated hastily  not
that 

   i fear i have not understood you my
dear generaal what do you advise

  the icy sweetness of the choleric van
schouten sent a cold shiver along the com-
manders spine he wriggled nervously in
the capacious armchair that he filled so
snugly quite unconsciously he mumbled to
himself the clause which the pious javan-
ese had added to their prayers since van
schoutens coming to batavia  and from
the madness of the orang blanda devil at
the paleis allah deliver us

   ha generaal what do you say the
governor exclaimed

  vanden bosch coughed noisily and
rallied his wits

  ahem your excellency ah-hum it
is a problem as your excellency knows i
could send colonel heyns and his regi-
ment to bulungan if your excellency so
desires but-ahem-as your excellency
knows all he will find is empty huts
not a prau on the sea not a dyak in his
field

   you might as well send that many
wooden men van schouten snapped

  the general winced his portentously
solemn features that for forty years had
impressed the authorities at the hague
with his sagacity in military affairs be-
came severely grave oracularly he sug-
gested 

   would it not be wise your excellency
to give mynheer muller the controlleur

more time his last report was very
satisfactory very satisfactory indeed
he smacked his lips at the satisfactoriness
thereof

   donder en bliksem the governor
swore crashing his lean fist on the table
 more time for what the taxes have
not been paid for two years not a kilo
of rice has been grown on our plantations
not a liter of dammargum has been
shipped here the cane is left to rot un-
cut fire has ravaged the cinchona-groves
my predecessors set with such care every
ship brings fresh reports of piracies of
tribal wars and head-hunting how much
longer must we possess our souls in pa-
tience while these things go on

  the general shook his head with a brave
show of regret

   ach your excellency he replied
sadly  he promised so well

   promises the governor retorted  do
not pay taxes

  vanden bosch rubbed his purple nose in
perplexity

   i suppose it is the witch woman
again he remarked discouragedly

   who else van schouten growled
 always the witch woman that spawn
of satan koyala is at the bottom of every
uprising we have in borneo

   that is what we get for letting half-
breeds mingle with whites in our mission
schools vanden bosch observed bitterly

  the governor scowled  that folly
will cost the state five hundred gulden
he remarked  that is the price i have
put on her head

  the general pricked up his ears
 h-m that should interest mynheer
muller he remarked  there is nothing
he likes so well as the feel of a guilder be-
tween his fingers

  the governor snorted  neen gen-
eraal he negatived  for once he has
found a sweeter love than silver the fool
fairly grovels at koyalas feet sachsen
tells me

   so vanden bosch exclaimed with
quickened interest  they say she is
very fair
the argus pheasant



    if i could get my hands on her once
the argus pheasants pretty feathers would
molt quickly van schouten snarled
his fingers closed like an eagles talons

    argus pheasant bintang burung the
star bird-tis a sweet-sounding name the
malays have for her the general re-
marked musingly there was a sparkle in
his eye-the old warrior had not lost his
fondness for a pretty face if i was
younger he sighed  i might go to bul-
ungan myself

   the governor grunted

    you are an old cock that has lost his
tail-feathers generaal he growled  this
is a task for a young man

   the generals chest swelled and his chin
perked up jauntily

    i am not so old as you think your ex-
cellency he retorted with a trace of
asperity

   neen neen generaalthe governor
negatived  i cannot let you go-not for
your own good names sake the gossips
-of amsterdam and the hague would have
a rare scandal to prate about if it became
whispered arolind that gysbert vanden
bosch was scouring the jungles of bulun-
gan for a witch woman with a face and
form like helen of troys

   the general flushed his peccadillos
had followed him to java and he did not
like to be reminded of them

    the argus pheasant is too shy a bird
to come within gunshot your excellency
he replied somberly  it must be
trapped

    aye and so must she the governor
assented  that is how she got her name
but you are too seasoned for bait my dear
generaal he chuckled

  vanden bosch was too much impressed
with his own importance to enjoy being
chaffed ignoring the thrust he observed
dryly

    your excellency might try king sauls
plan

    ha the governor exclaimed with in-
terest  what is that

  van schouten prided himself on his
knowledge of the scriptures and the gen-

eral could not repress a little smirk of
triumph at catching him napping

   king saul tied davids hands by giv-
ing him his daughter to wife he ex-
plained  in the same way your excel-
lency might clip the argus pheasants
wings by marrying her to one of our loyal
servants it might be managed most satis-
factorily a proper marriage would-cause
her to forget the brown blood that she
hates so bitterly	i

   it is not her brown blood that she
hates it is her white blood van schouten
contradicted  but who would be the
man

   why not mynheer muller the con-
tf olleur vanden bosch asked  from
what your excellency says he would not
be unwilling then our troubles in bul-
ungan would be over

  van schouten scowled thoughtfully

   it would be a good match the gen-
eral urged he is only common blood-a
marken herring fishers son by a celebes
woman and she -he shrugged his
shoulders- for all her pretty face and
plump body she is leveque the french
traders daughter by a dyalc woman

  he licked his lips in relish of the plan
  van schouten shook his head

   no i cannot do it he said  i could
send her to the coffee plantations-that
would be just punishment for her trans-
gressions but god keep me from sen-
tencing any woman to marry

   but your excellency vanden bosch
entreated

   it is ridiculous generaalthe gover-
nor cut in autocratically  the argus
pheasant does not mate with the vulture
vanden boschs face fell  then your
excellency must appoint another resident
he said in evident disappointment  it
will take a strong man to bring those
dyaks to time

  van schouten looked at him fixedly for
several moments a miserable sensation
of having said too much crept over the
general

   ha van schouten exclaimed  you
say we must have a new resident that


all-story weekly

has been my idea too what bush-fighter
have you that can lead two hundred cut-
throats like himself and harry these tigers
out of their lairs till they crawl on their
bellies to beg for peace

  inwardly cursing himself for his folly in
ceasing to advocate muller the general
twiddled his thumbs and said nothing

   well generaal van schouten rasped
irascibly

   ahem-you know what troops i have
your excellency mostly raw recruits here
scarce three months there is not a man
among them i would trust alone in the
bush after all it might be wisest to give
mynheer muller another chance his
cheeks puffed till they were purple

  van schoutens face flamed

  enough enough he roared if
the military cannot keep our house in or-
der sachsen and i will find a man that
is all generaal goedendag

  vanden bosch made a hasty and none
too dignified exit damning under his
breath the administration that had trans-
ferred him from a highly ornamental post
in amsterdam to live with this pepper-pot
he was hardly out of the door before the
governor shouted

  sachsen hola sachsen

  the sound of the governors voice had
scarcely died in the marbled corridors
when sachsen the omniscient the indis-
pensable secretary bustled into the sanc-
tum his stooped shoulders were crooked
in a perpetual obeisance and his damp
gray hair was plastered thinly over his
ruddy scalp but the shrewd twinkle in his
eyes and the hawklike cast of his nose
and chin belied the air of humility he
affected

   sachsen the governor demanded the
eagle gleaming in his lean gesarian
face  where can i find a man that will
bring peace to bulungan

  the wrinkled features of the all-know-
ing sachsen crinkled with a smile of in-
spiration

   your excellency he murmured bow-
ing low  there is peter gross freeholder
of batavia

   pieter gross pieter gross van
schouten mused his brow puckered with a
thoughtful frown  the name seems to
have slipped my memory what has
pieter gross freeholder of batavia done
to merit such an appointment at our
hands sachsen

  the secretary bowed again punctili-
ously

   your excellency perhaps remembers
he reminded  that it was peter gross
who rescued lieutenant hendrik de
koren and twelve men from the pirates of
lombock

  ha  the governor exclaimed his stern
features relaxing a trifle  now sachsen
answer me truthfully has this peter
gross an eye for women

  the secretary bent low

   your excellency the fairest flowers of
batavia are his to pick and choose the
good god has given him a brave heart a
comely face and plenty of flesh to cover
his bones but his only mistress is the
sea

   if i should send him to bulungan
would that she-devil koyala make the
same fool of him that she has of muller
the governor demanded sharply of his
secretary

   your excellency the angels above
would fail sooner than he

  the governors fist crashed on the table
with a resounding thwack

   then he is the man we need he ex-
claimed  where shall i find this pieter

   your excellency he is now serving as
first mate of the yankee barkantine cory-
ander anchored in this port he was here
at the paleis onlya moment ago inquiring
for news of three of his crew who had ex-
ceeded their shore leave i think he has
gone to ah sings rumah makan in the
chinese campong

  van schouten sprang from his great
chair of state like a cockerel fluttering
from a roost he licked his thin lips and
curved them into a smile

   sachsen he said his eyes shining
with satisfaction  except myself you are

chapter ii

ah sing counts his nails

captain threthaway of the
barkantine coryander of boston
should have heeded the warning he
received from his first mate peter gross
to keep away from the roadstead of ba-
tavia he had no particular business in
that port but an equatorial sun hot
enough to melt the marrow in a mans
bones made the coryanders deck a blis-
tering griddle there was no ice on board
and the water in the casks tasted foul as
bilge so the captain let his longing for
iced tea and the cool depths of a palm-
grove get the better of his judgment

  passing timor floris and the other
links in the malayan chain captain
threthaway looked longingly at the deeply
shaded depths of the mangrove jungles
the lofty tops of the cane swayed gently
to a breeze scarcely perceptible on the
coryanders sizzling deck when the
bankantine rounded cape karawang he
saw a bediamonded rivulet leap sheer off
a lofty cliff and lose itself in the liana be-
low it was the last straw the captain
felt he had to land and taste ice on his
tongue again or die calling his first mate
he asked abruptly

   can we victual at batavia as cheaply
as at singpore mr gross

peter gross looked at the shoreline

   one place is as cheap as the other mr
threthaway but if its my opinion you
want i advise against stopping at ba-
tavia

  the captain frowned

 why mr gross he asked sharply

   because wed lose our crew and ba-
tavias a bad place to pick up another one
that gang forard isnt to be trusted
where theres liquor to be got twouldnt
be so bad to lose a few of them at singa-
pore - theres always english-speaking

sailors there waiting for a ship to get home
on but batavias dutch we might have
to lay around a week

   i dont think theres the slightest dan-
ger of desertions captain threthaway
replied testily  wtiat possible reason
could any of our crew have to leave

   the pay is all right and the grub is
all right theres no kicking on those
items peter gross said speaking guard-
edly  but most of this crew are drinking
men theyre used to their rations of
grog regular theyve been without liquor
since we left frisco except what they got
at melbourne and that was precious little
since the water fouled on us theyre ready
for anything up to murder and mutiny
therell be no holding them once we make
port

  captain threthaway flushed angrily
his thin ascetic jaw set with puritan
stubbornness as he retorted

   when i cant sail a ship without sup-
plying liquor to the crew ill retire mr
gross

   dont misunderstand me captain
peter gross replied with quiet patience
im not disagreeing with your teetotaler
principles they improve a crew if youve
got the right stock to work with but
when you take grog away from such dock-
sweepings as smith and jacobson and that
little frenchman le beouf you take away
the one thing on earth theyre willing to
work for wre had all we could do to hold
them in hand at melbourne and after the
contrary trades weve bucked the past
week and the heat their tongues are
hanging out for a drop of liquor

   let them dare come back drunk the
captain snapped angrily  i know what
will cure them

   they wont come back peter gross
asserted calmly

   then well go out and get them cap-
tain threthaway said grimly

   theyll be where they cant be found
peter gross replied

  captain threthaway snorted impa-
tiently

   look here captain peter gross ex-


all-story weekly

claimed facing his skipper squarely  ba-
tavia is my home when im not at sea i
know its ins and outs knowing the
town and knowing the crew weve got
im sure a stop there will be a mighty un-
pleasant experience all around theres a
chinaman there ah sing a public house
proprietor and a crimp that has runners
to meet every boat once a man goes into
his rumali makan hes as good as lost until
the next skipper comes along short-handed
and puts up the price

  captain threthaway smiled confidently

   poor as the crew is mr gross theres
no member of it will prefer lodging in a
chinese crimps public house ten thousand
miles from home to his berth here

   theyll forget his color when they
taste his hot rum peter gross returned
bruskly  and once they drink it theyll
forget everything else ah sing is the
smoothest article that ever plaited a queue
and they dont make them any slicker
than they do in china

  captain threthaways lips pinched to-
gether in irritation

   there are always the authorities he
remarked pettishly to end the controversy

  peter gross restrained a look of disgust
with difficulty

   yes there are always the authorities -
he conceded  but in the chinese cam-
pong theyre about as much use as a land-
lubber aloft in a blow the campong is a
little republic in itself and ah sing is the
man that runs it if the truth was known

i guess hes the boss chinaman of the east
indies-pirate trader politician-any-
thing he can make a guilder at from his
rum shop warrens run into every section
of chinatown and theyre so well hid that
the governor though hes sharp as a weasel
and by all odds the best man the dutch
ever had here cant find them its the
real port of missing men

  captain threthaway looked shoreward
where dusky breech-clouted natives were
resting in the cool shade of the heavy-
leafed mangroves a bit of breeze
stirred just then bringing with it the rich
spice-grove and jungle scents of the thickly

wooded island a fierce longing for the
shore seized the captain he squared his
shoulders with decision

   ill take the chance mr gross he
said  this heat is killing me you may
figure on twenty-four hours in port

  twelve hours after the coryander cast
anchor in batavia harbor smith jacob-
son and le beouf were reported missing
when captain threthaway for all his
boston upbringing had exhausted a pro-
lific vocabulary he called his first mate

   mr gross he said  the damned
renegades are gone do you think you
can find them

  long experience in the vicissitudes of
life acquired in that best school of all
the forecastle had taught peter gross the
folly of saying  i told you so there-
fore he merely replied  ill try sir

  so it befell that he sought news of the
missing ones at the great white stadhuis
where the heer sachsen always his friend
met him and conceived the inspiration for
his prompt recommendation to the gov-
ernor-general

  peter gross ambled on toward ah
sings rumah makan without the slightest
suspicion he was being followed on his
part governor-general van schouien was
content to let his quarry walk on uncon-
scious of observation while he measured
the man

   god in israel what a man his ex-
cellency exclaimed admiringly noting
peter grosss broad shoulders and stal-
wart thighs  if he packs as much brains
inside his skull as he does meat on his
bones there are some busy days ahead for
my dyaks he smacked his lips in
happy anticipation

  ah sings grog-shop with its colonnades
and porticoes and fussy gables and fan-
tastic cornices terminating in pigtail curli-
cues was a squalid place for all the orna-
mentation cluttered on it peter gross
observed its rubbishy surroundings with
ill-concealed disgust

   twould be a better batavia if some
the argus pheasant



one set fire to the place he muttered to
himself  yet the law would call it
arson

  looking up he saw ah sing seated in
one of the porticoes and quickly masked
his face to a smile of cordial greeting but
not before the chinaman had detected his
ill humor

  there was a touch of three continents
in ah sings appearance he sat beside a
table in the american fashion he smoked
a long-stemmed hookah after the turkish
fashion and he wore his clothes after the
chinese fashion the bland innocence of
his pudgy face and the seraphic mildness
of his unblinking almond eyes that peeped
through slits no wider than the streak of a
charcoal-pencil were as the guilelessness of
mother eve in the garden motionless as
a buddha idol he sat except for occasional
pulls at the hookah

   good morning ah sing peter gross
remarked happily as he mounted the
colonnade

  the tiny slits through which ah sing
beheld the pageantry of a sun-baked world
opened a trifle wider

    may allah bless thee vlr gross he
greeted impassively

  peter gross pulled a chair away from
one of the other tables and placed it across
the board from ah sing then he suc-
cumbed to it with a sigh of gentle ease

   a hot day he panted and fanned
himself as though he found the humidity
unbearable

    belly hot ah sing gravely agreed in
a guttural voice that sounded from un-
fathomable abysses

   a hot day for a man thats tasted no
liquor for nigh three months peter gross
amended

   you makee long trip ah sing in-
quired politely

  peter grosss features molded them-
selves into an expression eloquently ap-
preciative of his past miseries

    thats altogether how you take it ah
sing he replied  from frisco to mel-
bourne to batavia isnt such a thunderin
long ways not to a man thats done the

full circle three times but when you
make thevoyage with a methodist captain
who doesnt believe in grog its the longest
since captain cooks ah sing my
throats drier than a soueast monsoon
hot toddy for two

  ah sing clapped his hands and uttered
a magic word or two in chinese a can-
tonese waiter paddled swiftly outside bear-
ing a lacquered tray and two steaming
glasses one he placed before ah sing
and the other before peter gross who
tossed a coin on the table

   pledge your health sir peter gross
remarked and reached across the board to
clink glasses with his chinese friend ah
sing lifted his glass to meet the sailors
and suddenly found it snaked out of his
hands by a deft motion of peter grosss
middle finger gross slid his own glass
across the table toward ah sing

   if you dont mind he remarked
pleasantly  your waiter might have
mistaken me for a plain a b and ive
got to get back to my ship to-night

  ah sings bland and placid face re-
mained expressionless as a carved gods
but he let the glass stand untasted be-
side him

  the coryanders mate sipped his liquor
and sank deeper into his chair he
studied with an air of affectionate interest
the long lane of quaintly colonnaded build-
ings that edged the city within a city the
chinese campong pigtailed orientals un-
mindful of the steaming heat squirmed
across the scenery ten thousand stenches
were compounded into one in which the
flavor of garlic predominated peter gross
breathed the heavy air with a smile of
reminiscent pleasure and dropped another
notch into the chair

   it feels good to be back ashore again
for a spell ah sing he remarked  a
nice cool spot like this with nothing to
do and some of your grog under the belt
skins a blistery deck any day i dont
wonder so many salts put up here

  back of the curtain of fat through which
they peered ah sings oblique eyes quiv-
ered as they watched the sailor keenly


all-story weekly

   by the way peter gross observed
stretching his long legs out to the limit of
their reach  you havent seen any of my
men have you smith hes pock-
marked and has a cut over his right eye
jacobson a tall swede and le beouf a
little frenchman with a close-clipped
black mustache and beard

  ah sing gravely cudgeled his memory

   none of your men he assured  was
here

  peter grosss face fell

   thats too bad he exclaimed in evi-
dent disappointment  i thought sure
id find em here youre sure you havent
overlooked them that frenchy might
call for a hop we picked him out of a
hop-joint at frisco

   none your men here ah sing re-
peated gutturally

  peter gross rumpled his tousled hair
 we-ell he drawled unhappily  if
those chaps dont get back on shipboard
by nightfall ill have to buy some men
from you ah sing have ygot three
good hands that know one rope from
another

  two men off schooner marianna
ah sing replied in his same thick mono-
tone  one man steamer callee-opie
good strong man work hard

   you stole em i spose peter
gross asked pleasantly

 ah sings heavy jowls waggled in
gentle negation

   no stealum man he denied quietly
 him belly sick come here get well
allie big strong man

   how much a head

   twlenty dolla

   f o b the coryander and no extra
charges

  ah sings inscrutable face screwed it-
self into a maze of unreadable wrinkles
and lines

  him eat heap he announced
 five dlolla more for board

   you go to blazes peter gross re-
plied cheerfully  ill look up a couple
of men somewhere else or go shorthanded
if i have to

  ah sing made no reply and his im-
passive face did not alter its expression-
less fixity peter gross lazily pulled
himself up in his chair and extended his
right hand across the table a ring with
a big bloodstone in the center a blood-
stone cunningly chiseled and marked
rested on the middle finger

   see that ring ah sing he asked
 i got that down to mauritius wrhat
dye think its worth

  ah sings long clawlike fingers groped
avariciously toward the ring his tiny
fat-incased eyes gleamed with cupidity

  with a quick catlike movement
peter gross gripped one of the china-
mans hands

   dont pull he cautioned quickly as
ah sing tried to draw his hand away
 i was going to tell you that theres a
drop of adders poison inside the blood-
stone that runs down a little hollow pin
if you press the stone just so- he
moved to illustrate

  no no ah sing shrieked pig-
like squeals of terror

   just send one of your boys for my
salts will you peter gross requested
pleasantly  i understand they got
here yesterday morning and havent been
seen to leave talk english-no china
talk savvy

  a flash of malevolent fury broke ah
sings mask of impassivity the rage
his face expressed caused peter gross to
grip his hand the harder and look quick-
ly around for a possible danger from
behind they were alone peter gross
moved a finger toward the stone and
ah sing capitulated at his shrill cry
there was a hurried rustle from within
peter gross kept close grip on the china-
mans hand until he heard the shuffling
tramp of sailor feet smith jacobson
and le beouf blinking sleepily were
herded on the portico by two giant
tibetans

  peter gross shoved the table and ali
sing violently back and leaped to his
feet

  youll - desert - will you he ex-
the argus pheasant



claimed each word was punctuated by
a swift punch to the chin of one of the
unlucky sailors and an echoing thud on
the floor smith jacobson and le
beouf lay neatly cross-piled on one of
ah sings broken chairs

   ill pay for the chair peter gross
declared jerking his men to their feet
and shoving them down the steps

  ah sing shrilled an order in chinese
the tibetan giants leaped for peter
gross who sprang out of their reach and
put his back to the wall in his right
hand a gun flashed

   ah sing ill take you first he
shouted

  the screen separating them from the
adjoining portico was pushed aside

   ah sing exclaimed a sharp author-
itative voice

  ah sing looked about startled the
purpled fury his face expressed sickened
to a mottled gray adriaan adriaans-
zoon van schouten governor-general of
java leaning lightly on his cane frowned
sternly at the scene of disorder at a
cry from their master the two tibetans
backed away from peter gross who
lowered his weapon

   is it thus you observe our laws ah
sing van schouten demanded coldly

  ah sing licked his lips  light of
the sun- he began but the governor
interrupted shortly

   the magistrate will hear your ex-
planations his eagle eyes looked
penetratingly upon peter gross who
looked steadfastly back

   sailor you threatened to poison this
man the governor accused harshly in-
dicating ah sing

   you excellency that was bluff
peter gross replied  the ring is as
harmless as you excellencys own

  van schoutens eyes twinkled

   what is your name sailor and your
ship he demanded

   peter gross your excellency first
mate of the barkantine coryander of
boston now lying in your excellencys
harbor of batavia

  ah sing van schouten rasped
sternly  if these drunken louts are not
aboard their ship by nightfall you go
to the coffee fields

  ah sings gimlet eyes shrank to pin-
points his face was expressionless but
his whole body seemed to shake with
suppressed emotion as he choked in gut-
tural dutch

   your excellency shall be obeyed
he salaamed to the ground

  van schouten glared at peter gross

   mynheer gross the good name of
our fair city is very dear to us he said
sternly  scenes of violence like this
do it much damage i would have further
discourse with you be at the pales
within the hour

   i shall be there your excellency
peter gross promised

  the governor shifted his frown to ah
sing

   as for you ah sing i have heard
many evil reports of this place he said

  let me hear no more

  while ah sing salaamed again the
governor strode pompously away followed
at a respectful distance by peter gross
it was not until they had disappeared
beyond a curve in the road that ah sing
let his face show his feelings then an
expression of malignant fury before
which even the two tibetans quailed
ciossed it

  he uttered a harsh command to have
the debris removed the tibetans
jumped forward in trembling alacrity
without giving them another glance he
waddled into the building into a little
den screened off for his own use from
a patent steel safe of american make he
took an ebony box quaintly carved and
colored in glorious pinks and yellows
with a flower design opening this he
exposed a row of glass vials resting on
beds of cotton each vial contained
some nail parings

  he took out the vials one by one
looked at their labels inscribed in chi-
nese characters and placed them on an
ivory tray as he read each label a


all-story weekly

curious smile of satisfaction spread over
his features

  when he had removed the last vial
he sat at his desk dipped a pen into
india ink and wrote two more labels in
similar chinese characters when the
ink had dried he placed these on two
empty vials taken from a receptacle on
his desk the vials were placed with the
others in the ebony box and locked in
the safe

  the inscriptions he read on the labels
were the names of men who had died
sudden and violent deaths in the east
indies while he had lived at batavia
the labels he filled out carried the names
of adriaan adriaanszoon van schouten
and peter gross -

chapter iii

  peter gross is named resident

 o ailor the penalty for threatening
 the life of any citizen is penal
servitude on the states coffee
plantations

  the governors voice rang harshly
and he scowled across the big table in
his cabinet room at the coryanders
mate sitting opposite him his hooked
nose and sharp-pointed chin with its
finely-trimmed vandyke beard - jutted
forward rakishly

   i ask no other justice than your ex-
cellencys own sense of equity suggests
peter gross replied quietly

  h-mm the governor hummed he
looked at the coryanders mate keenly
for a few moments through half-closed
lids suddenly he said

   and what if i should appoint you
a resident sailor

  peter grosss lips pressed together
tightly but otherwise he gave no sign
of his profound astonishment at the gov-
ernors astounding proposal sinking
deeper into his chair until his head
sagged on his breast he deliberated be-
fore replying

 your excellency s in earnest

i do not jest on affairs of state
mynheer gross what is your answer
peter gross paused  your excellency
overwhelms me- he began but van
schouten cut him short

   enough when i have work to do
i choose the man who i think can do it
then you accept

   your excellency to my deep regret
i must most respectfully decline

  a look of blank amazement spread
over the governors face then his eyes
blazed ominously

   decline why he roared

   for several reasons peter gross
replied with disarming mildness  in
the first place i am under contract with
captain threthaway of the coryander-
 i will arrange that with your cap-
tain the governor broke in

   in the second place i am neither a
soldier nor a politician-

   that is for me to consider the
governor retorted

   in the third place i am a citizen of
the united states and therefore not
eligible to any civil appointment from
the government of the netherlands

   donder en blikseml the governor
exclaimed  i thought you were a free-
holder here

   i am peter gross admitted  the
land i own is at ryswyk i expect to
make it my home when i retire from the
sea

   how long have you owned that
land

   for nearly seven years

  the governor stroked his beard  you
talk holland like a hollander mynheer
gross he observed

   my mother was of dutch descent
peter gross explained  i learned the
language from her

  good van schouten inclined his
head with a curt nod of satisfaction
 half holland is all holland we can
take steps to make you a citizen at once
 i dont care to surrender my birth-
right peter gross negatived quietly
what van schouten shouted
the argus pheasant



 not for a residents post and eight
thousand guilders a year and a land
grant in java that will make you rich
for life if you make those hill tribes stick
to their plantations what say you to
this mynheer gross his lips curved
with a smile of anticipation

   the offer is tempting and the honor
great peter gross acknowledged quietly
 but i can not forget i was born an
american

  van schouten leaned back in his chair
with a look of astonishment

   you refuse he asked incredulously
i am sorry your excellency peter
grosss tone was unmistakably firm

   you refuse the governor repeated
still unbelieving  eight-thousand-
guilders and a land grant that will
make you rich for life

   i am an american and american i
shall stay

  the governors eyes sparkled with ad-
miration

  by the beard of orange he ex-
claimed  it is no wonder you yankees
have sucked the best blood of the world
into your country he leaned forward
confidentially

   mynheer gross i cannot appoint
you resident if you refuse to take the
oath of allegiance to the queen but i
can make you special agent of the gouv-
erneur-generaal i can make you a resi-
dent in fact if not in name of a country
larger than half the netherlands larger
than many of your own american states
i can give you the rewards i have
pledged you a fixed salary and the
choice of a thousand hectares of our
fairest state lands in java what do
you say

  he leaned forward belligerently in
that posture his long coarse hair rose
bristly above his neck giving him some-
thing of the appearance of a game-cock
with feathers ruffled it was this peculiar-
ity that first suggested the name he was
universally known by throughout the
sundas  de kemphaan  the game-
cock

   to what province would you appoint
me peter gross asked slowly

  the governor hesitated with the air
of a poker player forced to show his
hand heconfessed

   it is a difficult post mynheer and
needs a strong man as resident it is
the residency of bulungan borneo
there was the faintest flicker in peter
grosss eyes van schouten watched
him narrowly in the utter stillness that
followed the governor could hear his
watch tick

  peter gross rose abruptly leaped for
the door and threw it open he looked
straight into the serene imperturbable
face of chi wung lo autocrat of the
governors domestic establishment chi
wung bore a delicately lacquered tray
of oriental design on which were stand-
ing two long thin daintily cut glasses
containing cooling limes that bubbled
fragrantly without a word he swept
grandly in and placed the glasses on
the table one before the governor and
the other before peter grosss vacant
chair

 ha van schouten exclaimed
smacking his lips  chi wung you
peerless priceless servant how did you
guess our needs

  with a bland bow and never a glance
at peter gross chi wung strutted out
in oriental dignity carrying his empty
tray peter gross closed the door care-
fully and walked slowly back

   i was about to say your excellency
he murmured  that bulungan has not
a happy reputation

   it needs a strong man to rule it
the governor acknowledged running his
glance across peter grosss broad shoul-
ders in subtle compliment

   those who have held the post of
resident there found early graves

   you are young vigorous you have
lived here long enough to know how to
escape the fevers

   there are worse enemies in bulun-
gan than the fevers peter gross re-
plied  it is not for nothing that bulun-


all-story weekly

gan is known as the graveyard of
borneo

  the governor glanced at peter grosss
strong face and stalwart form regret-
fully

   your refusal is final he asked

   on the contrary if your excellency
will meet one condition i accept peter
gross replied

  the governor put his glass down
sharply and stared at the sailor

   you accept this post he de-
manded

  upon one condition yes

   what is that condition

   that i be allowed a free hand

   h-mm  van schouten drew a
deep breath and leaned back in his
chair the sharp julian cast of coun-
tenance was never more pronounced
and the eagle eyes gleamed inquiringly
calculatingly peter gross looked
steadily back the minutes passed and
neither spoke

   why do you want to go there the
governor exclaimed suddenly he
leaned forward in his chair till his eyes
burned across a narrow two feet into
peter grosss own

  the strong firm line of peter grosss
lips tightened he rested one elbow on
the table and drew nearer the governor
his voice was little more than a murmur
as he said

   your excellency let me tell you the
story of bulungan

  the governors face showed surprise
 proceed he directed

   six years ago when your excellency
was appointed governor-general of the
netherlands east -indies peter gross
began  bulungan was a no mans land
although nominally under the dutch
flag the pirates that infested the
celebes sea and the straits of macassar
found ports of refuge in its jungle-
banked rivers and marsh mazes where
no gunboat could find them the eng-
lish told your government that if it did
not stamp out piracy and subjugate the
dyaks it would that meant loss of

the province to the dutch crown ac-
cordingly you sent general van heem-
kerken there with eight hundred men
who marched from the lowlands to the
highlands and back again burning every
village they found but meeting no
dyaks except old men and women too
helpless to move general van heem-
kerken reported to you that he had paci-
fied the country on his report you
sent mynheer van scheltema there as
resident and cupido as controlleur
within six months van scheltema was
bitten by an adder placed in his bed-
room and cupido was assassinated by a
hill dyak who threw him out of a dug-
out into a river swarming with crocodiles

   lieve hemel no van schouten
cried  van scheltema and cupido
died of the fevers

   so it was reported to your ex-
cellency peter gross replied gravely
 i tell you the facts

  the governors thin spiked jaw shot
out like a vicious thorn and his teeth
clicked  go on he directed sharply

   for a year there was neither resi-
dent nor controlleur at bulungan then
the pirates became so bold that you
again took steps to repress them the
stockade at the village of bulungan was
enlarged and the garrison was increased
to fifty men lieutenant van slyck
the commandant was promoted to cap-
tain a new resident was appointed
mynheer de jonge a very dear friend
ot your excellency he was an old
man estimable and honest but ill-fitted
for such a post a failure in business
and a failure as a resident time after
time your excellency wrote him concern-
ing piracies hillmen raids and head-
hunting committed in his residency or
the adjoining seas each time he re-
plied that your excellency must be mis-
taken that the pirates and head-hunters
came from other districts

  the governors eyes popped in amaze-
ment how do you know this he
exclaimed but peter gross ignored the
question
the argus pheasant



   finally about two years ago myn-
heer de jonge through an accident
learned that he had been deceived by
those he had trusted had a right to
trust a remark made by a drunken
native opened his eyes one night he
called out captain van slyck and the
latters commando and made a flying
raid he all but surprised a band of
pirates looting a captured schooner and
might have taken them had they not re-
ceived a warning of his coming that
raid made him a marked man within
two weeks he was poisoned by being
pricked as he slept with a thorn dipped
in the juice of the deadly upas tree

   he was a suicide the governor ex-
claimed his face ashen  they brought
me a note in his own handwriting

   in which it was stated that he killed
himself because he felt he had lost your
excellencys confidence

   you know that too van schouten
whispered huskily

   your excellency has suffered remorse
without cause peter gross declared
quietly  the note is a forgery

  the governors hands gripped the
edge of the table

   you can prove that he cried

   for the present your excellency must
be satisfied with my word as resident
of bulungan i hope to secure proofs that
will satisfy a court of justice

  the governor gazed at peter gross in-
tently a conflict of emotions amaze-
ment unbelief and hope were expressed
on his face as he demanded fiercely
why should i believe you

  peter grosss face hardened the
sternness of the magistrate was on his
brow as he replied

   your excellency remembers the
schooner tetrina attacked by chinese
and dyak pirates off the coast of celebes
three years ago all her crew were
butchered except two left on the deck
that night for dead i was one of the
two your excellency my dead com-
rades have left me a big debt to pay
that is why i will go to bulungan

  the governor rose decision was
written on his brow

instrument of his eternal justice
peter gross raised a hand of warning

   sometimes the very walls have ears
your excellency he cautioned  if i
am to be resident of bulungan no word
of the appointment must leak out until
i arrive there

chapter iv

koyalas prayer

it was a blistering hot day in bulungan
the heavens were molten incandes-
cence the muddy river that bisected
the town wallowed through its estuary a
steaming tea-kettle the black muck-
fields baked and flaked under the torrid
heat the glassy surface of the bay ly-
ing within the protecting crook of a curl-
ing tail of coral reef quivered under the
impact of the suns rays like some senti-
ent thing

  in the village that nestled where fresh
and salt water met the streets were de-
serted almost lifeless gaunt pariah dogs
driven by the acid-sharp pangs of a never-
satiated hunger sniffed among the shad-
ows of the bamboo and palm-leaf huts
their backs arched and their tails slinking
between their legs too weak to grab
their share of the spoil in the hurly-burly
they scavenged in these hours of universal
inanity the doors of the huts were tight-
ly closed-barricaded against the heat
the merchant in his dingy shop the fish-
erman in his house on stilts and the fash-
ioner of metals in his thatched cottage in
the outskirts slept under their mats apo-
plexy was the swift and sure fate of those
who dared the awful torridity

  dawn had foretold the heat the sun
shot above the purple and orange waters
of the bay like a conflagration the mi-
asmal vapors that clustered thickly about

the flats by night gathered their linen
and fled like the hunted they were
scurrying upstream when bogoru the
fisherman walked out on his sampan
landing he looked at the unruffled sur-
face of the bay and then looked upward
quickly at the lane of tall kenari trees be-
tween the stockade and government build-
ings on an elevation a short distance back
of the town the spindly tops of the
trees pointed heavenward with the rigid-
ity of church spires

   there will be no chaetodon sold at
the visschersmarkt fishmart to-day he
observed kismet

  with a patient shrug of his shoulders
he went back to his hut and made sure
there was a plentiful supply of sirih and
cooling limes on hand

  in the fruit market tagotu the fruit-
erer set out a tempting display of man-
gosteen durian dookoo and rambootan
pineapples and pomegranates jars of
agar-agar bowls of rice freshly cooked
and pitchers of milk

  the square was damp from the heavy
night dew when he set out the first
basket it was dry as a fresh-baked brick
when he put out the last the heavy
dust began to flood inward tagotu no-
ticed with dismay how thin the crowd
was that straggled about the market-
place chepang his neighbor came out
of his stall and observed

   the monsoon has failed again ju-
lungan will stay in his huts to-day

   it is the will of allah tagotu re-
plied patiently putting aside his offer-
ings he lowered the shades of his shop
and composed himself for a siesta

  on the hill above the town where the
rude fort and the government buildings
gravely faced the sea the heat also made
itself felt the green blinds of the milk-
white residency building that was pat-
terned as closely as tropical conditions
would permit after the quaint architec-
ture of rural overysel vvere tightly closed
the little cluster of residences around it
the controlleurs house and the homes of
marinus blauwpot and wang fu the

leading merchants of the place were sim-
ilarly barricaded for  amsterdam
the residential suburb of bulungan village
was fighting the same enemy as  rotter-
dam the town below an enemy more
terrible than dyak blowpipes and poi-
soned arrows the bornean sun

  like bogoru the fisherman and ta-
gotu the fruit vendor cho seng myn-
heer mullers valet and cook had seen
the threat the sunrise brought the suns
copper disk was dyeing the purple and
blue waters of the bay with vermilion
and magentas when he pad-padded out
on the veranda of the controlleurs house
he was clad in the meticulously neat
brown jeans that he wore at all times and
occasions except funeral festivals and in
wicker sandals with a single sweep of
his eyes he took in the kenari-tree-lined
lane that ran to the gate of the stockade
where a sleepy sentinel hunched against
a pert brass cannon nodded his head
drowsily the road was tenantless he
shot another glance down the winding
pathway that led by the houses of mari-
nus blauwpot and wang fu to the town
below that also was unoccupied step-
ping off the veranda he crossed over to an
unshaded spot directly in front of the
house and looked intently seaward to
where a junk lay at anchor the brown
jeans against the milk-white paint of the
house threw his figure in sharp relief

  cho seng waited until a figure showed
itself on the deck of the junk then he
shaded his eyes with his arm the china-
man on the deck of the junk must have
observed the figure of his fellow country-
man on the hill for he also shaded his
eyes with his arm

  cho seng looked quickly to the right-
to the left there was no one stirring
the sentinel at the gate drowsed against
the carriage of the saucy brass cannon
shading his eyes once more with a quick
gesture cho seng walked ten paces
ahead then he walked back five paces
making a sharp angle he walked five
paces to one side then he turned ab-
ruptly and faced the jungle
the argus

pheasant



  the watcher on the junk gave no sign
that he had seen this curious perform-
ance but as cho seng scuttled back into
the house he disappeared into the bowels
of the ugly hulk

  an hour passed before cho seng re-
appeared on the veranda he cast only a
casual glance at the junk and saw that it
was being provisioned after listening
for a moment to the rhythmic snoring
that came from the chamber above-
mynheer mullers apartment-he turned
the corner of the house and set off at a
leisurely pace toward the tangle of man-
groves banyan bamboo cane and ferns
that lay a quarter of a mile inland on the
same elevation on which the settlement
and stockade stood

  there was nothing in his walk to indi-
cate that he had a definite objective he
strolled along in apparent aimlessness as
though taking a mornings constitutional
overhead hundreds of birds created a ter-
rific din green and blue-billed gapers
shrilled noisily lories piped their matin
lays and the hoarse cawing of the tro-
gons mingled discordantly with the mel-
low notes of the mild cuckoos a myriad
insect life buzzed and hummed around
him and scurried across his pathway
pale white flowers of the night that lined
the walk shrank modestly into their green
cloisters before the bold eye of day but
cho seng passed them by unseeing and
unhearing nature had no existence for
him except as it ministered unto his phys-
ical needs only once did he turn aside
-a quick panicky jump-and that was
when a little spotted snake glided in front
of him and disappeared into the under-
brush

  when he was well within the shadows
of the mangroves cho seng suddenly
brightened and began to look about him
keenly following a faintly defined path
he walked along in a circuitous route
until he came to a clearing under the
shade of a huge banyan tree whose aerial
roots rose over his head after peering
furtively about and seeing no one he ut-
tered a hoarse guttural call the call the

great bird of paradise utters to welcome
the sunrise- wowk wowk wowk

  there was an immediate answer-the
shrill note of the argus pheasant it
sounded from the right near by on the
other side of a thick tangle of cane and
creeper growth cho seng paused in ap-
parent disquietude at the border of the
thicket but as he hesitated the call was
repeated more urgently wrenching the
cane apart he stepped carefully into the
underbrush

  his progress through it was slow at
each step he bent low to make certain
where his foot fell he had a mortal fear
of snakes-his nightmares were ghastly
dreams of a loathsome death from a ser-
pents bite

  there was a low ripple of laughter-
girlish laughter cho seng straightened
quickly to his right was another clear-
ing and in that clearing there was a
woman a young woman just coming into
the bloom of a glorious beauty she was
seated on a gnarled aerial root one leg
was negligently thrown over the other a
slender shapely arm reached gracefully
upward to grasp a spur from another
root a coil of silky black hair black as
tropic night lay over her gleaming shoul-
der her sarong spotlessly white hung
loosely about her wondrous form and was
caught with a cluster of rubies above her
breasts a sandal-covered foot dainty
delicately tapering its whiteness tanned
with a faint tint of harvest brown was
thrust from the folds of the gown at
her side in a silken scabbard hung a
light skilfully wrought kris the handle
was studded with gems

   good morning cho seng the wo-
man greeted demurely

  cho seng making no reply snapped
the cane aside and leaped through ko-
yala laughed again her voice tinkling like
silver bells the chinamans laborious
progress through the cane had amused
her she knew why he stepped so care-
fully

   good morning cho seng koyala
repeated her mocking dark brown eyes
	all-story weekly

tried to meet his but cho seng looked
studiedly at the ground in the affected
humility of oriental races

   cho seng here he announced

 what for um you wantee me he
spoke huskily a physician would instant-
ly have suspected he was tubercular

   koyalas eyes twinkled a woman she
knew she was beautiful wherever she
went among whites or malays chinese
or papuans she was admired but from
this stolid unfathomable menial china-
man she had never been able to evoke
the one tribute that every pretty woman
no matter how good demands from man
-a glance of admiration

    cho seng she pouted  you have
not even looked at me am i so ugly
that you cannot bear to see me 

   what for um you wantee me cho
seng reiterated his neck was crooked
humbly so that his eyes did not rise above
the hem of her sarong and his hands
were tucked inside the wide sleeves of his
jacket his voice was as meek and mild
and inoffensive as his manner

   koyala laughed mischievously

    i asked you a question cho seng
she pointed out

   the chinaman salaamed again even 
lower than before his face was imper-
turbable as he repeated in the same mild
disarming accents

    wrhat for um you wantee me
   koyala made a moue

    that isnt what i asked you cho
seng she exclaimed petulantly

   the chinaman did not move a muscle

 silent calm as a deep-sea bottom his
glance fixed unwaveringly on a little spot
of black earth near koyalas foot he
awaited her reply

   leveques daughter shrugged her shoul-
ders in hopeless resignation ever since
she had known him she had tried to sur-
prise him into expressing some emotion
admiration fear grief vanity cupidity
-on all these chords she had played
without producing response his imper-
turbability roused her curiosity his in-
difference to her beauty piqued her and

womanlike she exerted herself to rouse
his interest that she might punish him
so far she had been unsuccessful but that
only gave keener zest to the game ko-
yala was half dyak she had in her veins
the blood of the little brown brother who
follows his enemy for months sometimes
years until he brings home another drip-
ping head to set on his lodge-pole pa-
tience was therefore her birthright

   very well cho seng if you think i
am ugly- she paused and arched an
eyebrow to see the effect of her words
cho sengs face was as rigid as though
carved out of rock when she saw he
did not intend to dispute her koyala
flushed and concluded sharply

  -then we will talk of other things
what has happened at the residency dur-
ing the past week

  cho seng shot a furtive glance upward
 what for um he asked cautiously

   oh everything koyala spoke with
pretended indifference tell me does
your baas the mynheer ever mention
me

   mynheer muller belly much mad
belly much drink jenever gin belly
much say  damn-damn cho seng  the
chinaman grunted

  koyalas laughter rang out merrily in
delicious peals that started the rain-birds
and the gapers to vain emulation cho
seng hissed a warning and cast appre-
hensive glances about the jungle but ko-
yala mocking the birds provoked a hub-
bub of furious scolding overhead and
laughed again

   theres nobody near to hear us she
asserted lightly

   mebbe him in bush cho seng
warned

   not when the southeast monsoon
ceases to blow koyala negatived
 mynheer muller loves his bed too well
w-hen our bornean sun scorches us like
to-day but tell me what your master
has been doing

  she snuggled into a more comfortable
position on the root cho seng folded his
hands over his stomach
the argus pheasant



   morning him sleep he related la-
conically  him eat him speakee

the position of the sun in late afternoon

 does he ever mention me koyala
asked her eyes twinkled coquettishly
 plenty say nothing said cho seng
koyalas face fell  he doesnt speak
of me at all

cho seng shot a sidelong glance at her
 him no speakee koyala him plenty
drink jenever plenty say  damn-damn
cho seng  he looked up stealthily to
see the effect of his words

  koyala crushed a fern underfoot with
a vicious dab of her sandaled toes
something like the ghost of a grin crossed
the chinamans face but it was too well
hidden for koyala to see it

   how about kapitein van slyck
has he missed me koyala asked  it
is a week since i have been at the resi-
dency he must have noticed it

   kapitein van slyck him no speakee
koyala the chinaman declared

  koyala looked at him sternly i can-
not believe that cho seng she said
 the captain must surely have noticed
that i have not been in amsterdam you
are not telling me an untruth are you
cho seng 

  the chinaman was meekness incar-
nate as he reiterated

   him no speakee koyala
displeasure gathered on koyalas face
like a storm cloud she leaped suddenly
from the aerial root and drew herself up-
right at the same moment she seemed
to undergo a curious transformation the
light coquettish mood passed away like
dabs of sunlight under a fitful april sky
an imperious light gleamed in her eyes
and her voice rang with authority as she
said

   cho seng you are the eyes and the
ears of ah sing in bulungan-

  the chinaman interrupted her with a
sibilant hiss his mask of humility fell
from him and he darted keen and angry
glances about the cane

   when koyala bintang burung speaks
it is your place to listen cho seng ko-
yala asserted sternly her voice rang
with authority under her steady glance
the chinamans furtive eyes bushed
themselves in his customary pose of irre-
proachable meekness

   you are the eyes and ears of ah sing
in bulungan koyala reaffirmed speak-
ing deliberately and with emphasis  you
know that there is a covenant between
your master your master in batavia and
the council of the orang kayas of the sea
dyaks of bulungan whereby the chil-
dren of the sea sail in the praus of ah
sing when the hanu token come to ko-
yala on the night winds and tell her to
bid them go

  the chinaman glanced anxiously about
the jungle fearful that a swaying cluster
of cane might reveal the presence of an
eavesdropper

   s-ss-st he hissed

  koyalas voice hardened  tell your
master this she said  the spirits of
the highlands speak no more through the
mouth of the bintang burung till the eyes
and ears of ah sing become her eyes and
ears too

  there was a significant pause ah
sings face shifted and he looked at her
slantwise to see how seriously he should
take the declaration what he saw un-
doubtedly impressed him with the need
of promptly placating her for he an-
nounced

   cho seng tellee mynheer muller ko-
yala go hide in bush-big baas in ba-
tavia say muchee damn-damn give
muchee gold for koyala

  the displeasure in koyalas flushed
face mounted to anger

   no you cannot take credit for that
cho seng she exclaimed sharply
 word came to mynheer muller from

	a-s


all-story weekly

the governor direct that a price of many
guilders was put on my head

  her chin tilted scornfully  did you
think koyala was so blind that she did
not see the gunboat in bulungan harbor
a week ago to-day

  cho seng met her heat with oriental
calm

   bang-bang boat him come six-seven
day ago he declared  cho seng him
speakee mynheer muller koyala go hide
in bush eight-nine day

   the gun-boat was in the harbor the
morning mynheer muller told me ko-
yala retorted and stopped in sudden
recollection a tiny flash of triumph lit
the chinamans otherwise impassive face
as he put her unspoken thought into
words

   kapitein him bang-bang boat come
see mynheer muller namiddag after-
noon he said indicating the suns posi-
tion an hour before sunset  mynheer
muller tellee koyala voormiddag 
forenoon he pointed to the suns
morning position in the eastern sky

   that is true koyala assented
thoughtfully and paused  how did
you hear of it

  cho seng tucked his hands inside his
sleeves and folded them over his paunch
his neck was bent forward and his eyes
lowered humbly koyala knew what the
pose portended it was the chinamans
refuge in a silence that neither plea nor
threat could break she rapidly recalled
the events of that week

   there was a junk from macassar in
bulungan harbor two weeks-no eleven
days ago she exclaimed  did that
bring a message from ah sing

  a startled lift of the chinamans chin
assured her that her guess was correct
another thought followed swift on the
heels of the first

   the same junk is in the harbor to-
day-came here just before sundown last
night she exclaimed  what message
did it bring cho seng

  the chinamans face was like a mask
his lips were compressed tightly-it was

as though he defied her to wedge them
open and to force him to reveal his secret
an angry sparkle lit koyalas eyes for a
moment she stepped a pace toward him
and her hand dropped to the hilt of the
jeweled kris then she stopped short a
fleeting look of cunning replaced the an-
gry gleam a half-smile came and van-
ished on her lips almost in the same in-
stant

  her face lifted suddenly toward the
leafy canopy her arms were flung up-
ward in a supplicating gesture the
chinaman watching her from beneath
his lowered brow looked up in startled
surprise koyalas form became rigid a
galatea turned back to marble her
breath seemed to cease as though she was
in a trance the color left her face left
even her lips strangely enough her very
paleness made the dyak umber in her
cheeks more pronounced

  her lips parted a low crooning came
forth the chinamans knees quaked
and gave way as he heard the sound his
body bent from the waist till his head al-
most touched the ground

  the crooning gradually took the form
of words it was the malay tongue she
spoke-a language cho seng knew the
rhythmic beating of his head against his
knees ceased and he listened eagerly with
face half-lifted

   hanu token hanu token spirits of
the highlands whither are you taking
me koyala cried she paused and a
deathlike silence followed suddenly she
began speaking again her figure swaying
like a tall lily stalk in a spring breeze her
voice low-pitched and musically mystic
like the voice of one speaking from a far
distance

   i see the jungle the jungle where the
mother of rivers gushes out of the great
smoking mountain i see the pit of ser-
pents in the jungle-

  a trembling seized cho seng

  -the serpents are hungry they have
not been fed they clamor for the blood
of a man i see him whose foot is over
the edge of the pit he slips he falls he
the argus pheasant



tries to catch himself but the bamboo
slips out of his clutching fingers-i see
his face - it is the face of him whose
tongue speaks double it is the face of-
a horrible groan burst from the china-
man he staggered to his feet

   neen neen neen neen he cried
hoarsely in an agonized negative  cho
seng tellee bintang burung-

  a tremulous sigh escaped from ko-
yalas lips her body shook as though
swayed by the wind her eyes opened
slowly vacantly as though she was awak-
ening from a deep sleep she looked at
cho seng with an absent stare seeming
to wonder why he was there why she was
where she was the chinaman made
voluble through fear chattered

   him junk say big baas gouverneur
speakee muchee damn-damn no gambir
no rice no copra no coffee from bulun-
gan one-two year sendee new resident
bimeby belly quick

  koyalas face paled

   send a new resident she asked in-
credulously  what of mynheer mul-
ler

  the look of fear left cho sengs face
involuntarily his neck bent and his fin-
gers sought each other inside the sleeves
there was cunning mingled with malice
in his eyes as he looked up furtively and
feasted on her manifest distress

   him chop-chop he announced la-
conically

   they will kill him koyala cried
the chinaman had said his word
none knew better than he the value of
silence he stood before her in all hum-
bleness and calmly awaited her next
word all the while his eyes played on
her in quick cleverly concealed glances

  koyala fingered the handle of the kris
as she considered what the news portend-
ed her face slowly hardened-there was
a look in it of the tigress brought to bay

   koyala bimeby mally him mynheer
muller go hide in bush cho seng ven-
tured the question was asked with such
an air of simple innocence and friendly
interest that none could take offense

  koyala flushed hotly then her nose
and chin rode high with pride

   the bintang burung will wed no
man cho seng she declared haughtily

 the blood of chawatangi dies in me
but not till bulungan is purged of the
orang blanda white race- she whipped
the jeweled kris out of its silken scabbard 
 when the last white man spills his
heart on the coral shore and the wrongs
done chawatangis daughter my mother
have been avenged then koyala will go
to join the hanu token that call her call
her-

  she thrust the point of the kris against
her breast and looked upward toward the
far distant hills and the smoking moun-
tain a look of longing came into her
eyes the light of great desire almost it
seemed as if she would drive the blade
home and join the spirits she invoked

  with a sigh she lowered the point of
the kris and slipped it back into its
sheath-

   no cho seng she said  mynheer
muller is nothing to me no man will
ever be anything to me but your mas-
ter has been a kind elder brother to
koyala and like me he has had to
endure the shame of an unhappy birth
her voice sank to a whisper  for his
mother cho seng as you know was a
woman of celebes

  she turned swiftly away that he might
not see her face after a moment she
said in a voice warm with womanly kind-
ness and sympathy

   therefore you and i must take care
of him cho seng he is weak he is un-
truthful he has made a wicked bargain
with your master ah sing which the
spirits of the hills tell me he shall suffer
for but he is only what his white father
made him and the orang blada must
pay her lips contracted grimly  aye
pay to the last drop of blood you will
be true to him cho seng

  the chinaman cast a furtive glance
upward and found her mellow dark-brown
eyes looking at him earnestly the eyes
seemed to search his very soul


all-story weekly

   ja ja he pledged

   then go tell the captain of the junk
to sail quickly to macassar and send word
by a swift messenger to ah sing that he
must let me know the moment a new
resident is appointed there is no wind
and the sun is high therefore the junk
will still be in the harbor hurry cho
seng

  without a word the chinaman wheeled
and shuffled down the woodland path that
led from the clearing toward the main
highway koyala looked after him fix-
edly

   if his skin were white he could not
be more false she observed bitterly
 but he is ah sings slave and ah sing
needs me so i need not fear him-yet

  she followed lightly after cho seng
until she could see the prim top of the
residency building gleaming white through
the trees then she stopped short her
face darkened as the dyak blood gath-
ered thickly a look of implacable hate
and passion distorted it her eyes sought
the distant hills

   hanu token hanu token send a
young man here to rule bulungan she
prayed  send a strong man send a
vain man with a passion for fair women
let me dazzle him with my beauty let
me fill his heart with longing let me make
his brain reel with madness let me make
his body sick with desire let me make
him suffer a thousand deaths before he
gasps his last breath and his dripping
head is brought to thy temple in the hills
for the wrongs done chawatangis daugh-
ter hanu token for the wrongs done

  with a low sob she fled inland through
the cane

chapter v

sachsens warning

electric tapers were burning dim-
ly in governor-general van schou-
tens sanctum at the paleis that
evening as peter gross was ushered in

the governor was seated in a high-bac 
elaborately carved mahogany chair before
a highly polished mahogany table be-
side him was the omniscient the indis-
pensable sachsen the two were talking
earnestly in the dutch language van
schouten acknowledged peter grosss en-
trance with a curt nod and directed him
to take a chair on the opposite side of
the table

  at a word from his superior sachsen
tucked the papers he had been studying
into a portfolio the governor stared
intently at his visitor for a moment be-
fore he spoke

   mynheer gross he announced
sharply  your captain tells me your
contract with him runs to the end of the
voyage he will not release you

   then i must fill my contract your
excellency peter gross replied

  van schouten frowned with annoyance
he was not accustomed to being crossed

   when will you be able to take over
the administration of bulungan myn-
heer

  peter grosss brow puckered thought-
fully  in three weeks-let us say thirty
days your excellency

   bonder en bliksem the governor
exclaimed  we need you there at
once

  l that is quite impossible your ex-
cellency i will need help men that i
can trust and who know the islands such
men cannot be picked up in a day

  you can have the pick of my
troops

   i should prefer to choose my own
men your excellency peter gross
replied

   eh how so mynheer the gov-
ernors eyes glinted with suspicion

   your excellency has been so good as
to promise me a free hand peter gross
replied quietly  i have a plan in mind
-if your excellency desires to hear it

  van schoutens face cleared

   we shall discuss that later mynheer
you will be ready to go the first of june
then
the argus pheasant



   on the first of june i shall await
your excellencys pleasure here at bata-
via peter gross agreed

   nu that is settled the governor
gave a grunt of satisfaction and squared
himself before the table his expression
became sternly autocratic

   mynheer gross he said  you told
us this afternoon some of the history of
our unhappy residency of bulungan you
demonstrated to our satisfaction a most
excellent knowledge of conditions there
some of the things you spoke of were-
 may say-surprising some touched
upon matters which we thought were
known only to ourselves and to our privy
council but mynheer you did not
mention one subject that to our mind is
the gravest problem that confronts our
representatives in bulungan perhaps
you do not know there is such a problem
or perhaps you underestimate its serious-
ness at any rate we deem it desirable
to discuss this matter with you in detail
that you may thoroughly understand the
difficulties before you and our wishes in
the matter we have requested mynheer
sachsen to speak for us

  he nodded curtly at his secretary

   you may proceed sachsen
sachsens white head that had bent
low over the table during the governors
rather pompous little speech slowly lifted
his shrewd gray eyes twinkled kindly
his lips parted in a quaintly humorous
and affectionate smile

   first of all vrind pieter let me
congratulate you he said extending a
hand across the table peter grosss big
paw closed over it with a warm pressure

  and let me thank you vrind sach-
sen he replied  it was not hard to
guess who brought my name to his ex-
cellencys attention

   it is hollands good fortune that you
are here sachsen declared  had you
not been worthy vrind pieter i should
not have recommended you he looked
at the firm strong face and the deep
broad chest and massive shoulders of his
protege with almost paternal fondness

  to have earned your good opinion
is reward enough in itself peter gross
asserted

  sachsens odd smile that seemed to find
a philosophic humor in everything deep-
ened

   your reward vrind pieter he ob-
served  is the customary recompense of
the man who proves his wisdom and his
strength-a more onerous duty bulun-
gan will test you severely vrind friend
do you believe that

   aye peter gross assented soberly

   pray god to give you wisdom and
strength sachsen advised gravely he
bowed his head for a moment then
stirred in his chair and sat up alertly

   nn as to the work that lies before
you i need not tell you the history of
this residency for sachsen to presume
to instruct peter gross in what has hap-
pened in bulungan would be folly as
great folly as to lecture a dominie on
theology

  again the quaintly humorous quirk of
the lips

   if peter gross knew the archipelago
half so well as his good friend sachsen
he would be a lucky man peter gross
retorted spiritedly

  sachsens face became suddenly grave

   we do not doubt your knowledge of
conditions in our unhappy province vrind
pieter nor do we doubt your ability
your courage or your sound judgment
but pieter-

  he paused the clear gray eyes of
peter gross met his questioningly

   -you are young vrind pieter

  the governor rose abruptly and
plucked down from the wall a long-
stemmed dutch pipe that was suspended
by a gaily colored cord from a stout peg
he filled the big china bowl of the pipe
with nearly a half-pound of tobacco
touched a light to the weed and returned
to his chair there was a pregnant si-
lence in the room meanwhile

   how old are you vrind pieter
sachsen asked gently

   twenty-five mynheer peter gross


all-story weekly

replied there was a pronounced em-
phasis on the  mynheer

   twenty-five sachsen murmured
fondly twenty-five just my age
when i was a student at leyden and the
gayest young scamp of them all he
shook his head  twenty-five is very
young vriend pieter

   that is a misfortune which only time
can remedy peter gross replied dryly

   yes only time sachsens eyes
misted  time that brings the days
 when strong men shall bow themselves
and the grinders shall cease because they
are few and the grasshopper shall become
a burden and desire shall fail i wish
you were older vrind pieter

  the old man sighed there was a far-
away look in his eyes as though he were
striving to pierce the future and the
leagues between batavia and bulungan

   vrind gross he resumed softly  we
have known each other a long time
eight years is a long time and it is eight
years since you first came to batavia
you were a cabin-boy then and you ran
away from your master because he beat
you the wharfmaster at tanjong priok
found you and was taking you back to
your master when old sachsen saw you
old sachsen got you free and put you
on another ship under a good master
who made a good man and a good
zeeman seaman out of you do you
remember

   i shall never forget peter grosss
voice was vibrant with emotion

   old sachsen was your friend then
he has been your friend through the
years since then he is your friend to-
day do you believe that

  peter gross impulsively reached his
hand across the table sachsen grasped
it and held it

   then to-night you will forgive old
sachsen if he speaks plainly to you more
plainly than you would let other men
talk you will listen and take his words
to heart and consider them well pieter
 speak sachsen

   i knew you would listen pieter

sachsen drew a deep breath his eyes
rested fondly on his protege and he let
go grosss hand reluctantly as he leaned
back in his chair

   vrind pieter you said a little while
ago that old sachsen knows the people
who live in these kolonien colonies
his knowledge is small-

  peter gross made a gesture of dissent
but sachsen did not let him interrupt

   yet he has learned some things it
is something to have served the state
for over two score years in the nether-
lands east indies first as controlleur
then as resident in celebes in sumatra
in java and finally as secretary to the
gouverneur as old sachsen has in those
years he has seen much that goes on in
the hearts of the black and the brown
and the yellow and the white folk that
live in these sun-seared islands much
that is wicked but also much that is
good and he has seen much of the
fevers that seize men when the sun waves
hot and the blood races madly through
their veins there is the fever of hate
and the fever of revenge the fever of
greed and the fever to grasp god but
more universal than all these is the fever
of love and the fever of lust

  peter grosss brow knit with a puzzled
frown  what do you mean sachsen
he demanded

  sachsen smoothed back his thinning
white hair

   i am an old old man vrind pieter
he replied  desire has long ago failed
me the passions that our fiery java
suns breed in men have drained away
the light that is in a comely womans
eyes the thrill that comes at a touch of
her warm hand the quickened pulse-beat
at the feel of her silken hair brushing
over ones face-all these things are ashes
and dust to old sachsen slim ankles
plump calves and full rounded breasts
mean nothing to him but you vrind
pieter are young you are strong as a
buffalo bold as a tiger vigorous as a
banyan tree you have a young mans
warm blood in your veins you have the
the argus pheasant



poison of youth in your blood you are
a mans man peter gross but you are
also a womans man

  peter grosss puzzled frown became a
look of blank amazement  what in the
devil are you driving at sachsen he
demanded forgetting in his astonishment
that he was in the governors presence

  sachsen leaned forward hiseyes search-
ing his proteges

   have you ever loved a woman
pieter he countered softly

  peter gross appeared to be choking
the veins in his forehead distended

   what has that to do with bulun-
gan he demanded  youve known me
since i was a lad sachsen youve known
all my comings and goings why do you
ask me such-rot

  a grimly humorous smile lit the gov-
ernors stem visage

    let the strong take heed lest they
fall  sachsen quoted quietly  since
you say that you love no woman let
me ask you this-have you ever seen
koyala

  the little flash of passion left peter
grosss face but the puzzled frown re-
mained

   koyala he repeated thoughtfully
 it seems to me i have heard the name
but i cannot recall how or when
think think sachsen urged lean-
ing eagerly over the table  the half-
white woman of borneo the french
traders daughter by a native woman
brought up and educated at a mission
school in sarawak the dyaks call her
the bintang burung ha i see you know
her now

   leveques daughter chawatangis
grandchild peter gross exclaimed
 of course i know her who doesnt
his face sobered  the unhappiest
avoman in the archipelago i wonder
she lives

   you have seen her sachsen asked
peter grosss eyes twinkled reminis-
cently  aye that i have

   tell me about it sachsen urged
with an imperceptible gesture to the

governor to say nothing he leaned for-
ward expectantly

  peter gross cocked an eye at the ceil-
ing  let me see it was about a year
ago he said  i was with mccloud
on the brig mary dietrich mccloud
heard at macassar that there was a settle-
ment of dyaks at the mouth of the abbas
that wanted to trade in dammar gum and
gambir and didnt ask too much balas
tribute money we crossed the straits
and found the village wolang the-chief
gave us a big welcome we spend one
ciay palavering these natives wont do
anything without having a bitchara first
the next morning i began loading up
while mccloud entertained the orang
kaya wolang with a bottle of gin

   the natives crowded around pretty
close particularly the women anxious to
see what we were bringing ashore one
girl quite a pretty girl went so far as
to step into the boat and one of my men
swung an arm around her and kissed her
she screamed

  the governor took his pipe out of his
mouth and looked up with interest

 the next minute the mob of dyaks
parted as though cut with a scythe down
the lane came a woman a white woman
he turned to the secretary you
have seen her sachsen

    ja pieter

   then you can guess how she keeled
me over peter gross said  i took her
for a white woman a pure blood she is
white the brown in her skin is no deeper
than in a spaniards she walked up to
me-i could see a hurricane was threat-
ening-and she said

    you are english go back to your
ship now dont wait a minute or you
will leave your heads here

    madam i said  the lad was hasty
but meant no harm it will not happen
again i will make the lady a present

   she turned a look on me that fairly
withered me  you think you can buy
our women too she said fairly spitting
the words  go go dont you see my
dyaks fitting arrows in their blowpipes


all-story weekly

   mccloud came running up with chief
wolang  whats this he blustered but
koyala only pointed to the sea and said
the one word

  go

   mccloud spoke to wolang but at a
nod from koyala the chief gave an order
to his followers fifty dyaks fitted
poisoned arrows into their sumpitans
mccloud had good judgment he knew
when it was no use to bitchara and show
gin we rowed back to the ship without
the cargo we expected to load and set
sail at once not an arrow followed us
but the last thing i saw of the village
was koyala on the beach watching us
dip into the big rollers of the celebes
sea

  she is beautiful sachsen suggested
softly

   aye quite an attractive young fe-
male peter gross agreed in utmost
seriousness the governors grim smile
threatened to break out into an open
grin

  sachsen looked at the tabletop thought-
fully and rubbed his hands  she lost
you a cargo he stated  you have a
score to settle with her

  the secretary flashed a keen glance at
his protege

   by god no peter gross exclaimed
he brought his fist down on the table
 she was right eternally right if a
scoundrelly scum from over the sea tried
to kiss a woman of my kin in that way
id treat him a lot worse than we were
treated

  van schouten blew an angry snort that
cut like a knife the huge cloud of to-
bacco-smoke in which he had enveloped
himself peter gross faced him trucu-
lently

   we deserved what we got he as-
serted  when we whites get over the
notion that the world is a playground
for us to spill our lusts and vices on and
the lower races the playthings we can
abuse as we please well have peace in
these islands our missionaries preach
morals and christianity our traders like

that damned whelp leveque break every
law of god and man between the two
the poor benighted heathen loses all the
faith he has and sinks one grade lower
in brutishness than his ancestors were be-
fore him if all men were like brooke
of sarawak wed have had the east indies
christianized by now the natives were
ready to make gods out of us-they did
it with brooke-but now theyre looking
for a chance to put a knife in our backs
-a good many of them are

  he checked himself  here im
preaching i beg your pardon your
excellency

  van schouten blew another great
cloud of tobacco-smoke and said nothing
through the haze his eagle-keen eyes
searched peter grosss face and noted
the firm chin and tightly drawn lips with
stern disapproval sachsen flashed him
a warning glance to keep silent

   mynheer gross the secretary en-
treated  let me again beg the privileges
of an old friend is it admiration for
koyalas beauty or your keen sense of
justice that leads you to so warm a
defense

  peter grosss reply was prompt and
decisive

   vrind sachsen if she had been a hag
id have thought no different

   search your heart vrind pieter is
it not because she was young and comely
a woman unafraid that you remember
her

   women are nothing to me peter
gross retorted irritably  but right is
right and wrong is wrong whether in
batavia or bulungan

  sachsen shook his head

   vriend pieter he declared sadly
you make me very much afraid for you
if you had acknowledged  the woman
was fair a fair woman stirs me quickly
i would have said  he is young and has
eyes to see with but he is too shrewd
to be trapped but when you say  the
fault was ours we deserved to lose the
cargo then i know that you are blind
blind to your own weakness pieter
the argus pheasant



clever wicked women make fools of such
as you pieter

  one eyebrow arched the merest trifle
in the direction of the governor then
sachsen continued

   vriend pieter i am here to-night to
warn you against this woman i have
much to tell you about her much that is
unpleasant will you listen

  peter gross shrugged his shoulders

   i am at your service sachsen

   will you listen with an open mind
will you banish from your thoughts all
recollection of the woman you saw at the
mouth of the abbas river all that you
know or think you know of her fancied
wrongs and hear what old sachsen has
to say of the evil she has done of the
crimes the piracies aye even rebellions
and treasons for which she has been re-
sponsible what say you vrind pieter
peter gross swallowed hard words
seemed to be struggling to his lips but
he kept them back his teeth were
pressed together tightly the silence be-
came tense

   listen sachsen he finally said his
voice was studiedly calm  you come
from an old conservative race a race
that clings faithfully to the precepts and
ideals of its fathers and is certain of its
footing before it makes a step in advance
you have the old concept of woman that
her lot is to bear to suffer and to weep
i come from a fresher newer race a race
that gives its women the same liberty of
thought and action that it gives its men
therefore there are many things concern-
ing the conduct of this woman that we
look at in different ways things that
seem improper aye sometimes treasonable
to you seem a perfectly natural protest
to me you ignore the wrongs she has
suffered wrongs that must make life a
living hell to her you say she must be
content with the place to which god has
called her submerge the white blood in
her and live a savage among savages
peter gross pulled his chair nearer the
table and leaned forward his face glowed
with an intense earnestness

   great scott sachsen think of her
condition half white aye half french
and that is as proud a race as breathes
beautiful - beautiful as the sunrise
taught in a missionary school brought
up as a white child among white children
and then when the glory of her woman-
hood comes upon her to learn she is an
illegitimate a half-breed sister to the
savage dyaks her only future in their
filthy huts to kennel with them breed
with them-god what a horror that
revelation must have been

  he raked his fingers through his hair
and stared savagely at the wall

   you dont feel these things sachsen
he concluded  youre dutch to begin
with and so a conservative thinker then
youve been ground through the routine
of colonial service so many years that
youve lost every viewpoint except the
states expediency thank god i havent
that is why i think i can do something
for you in bulungan-

  he checked himself  common sense
and a little elemental justice go a long
long ways in dealing with savages he
observed

  sachsens eyes looked steadily into pe-
ter grosss sachsens kindly smile did
not falter but the governors patience
had reached its limit

   look you here mynheer gross he
exclaimed  i want no sympathy for that
she-devil from my resident

  an angry retort leaped to peter grosss
lips but before it could be uttered sach-
sens hand had leaped across the table
and had gripped his warningly

   she may be as beautiful as a houri
but she is a witch a very jezebel the
governor stormed  i have nipped a
dozen uprisings in the bud and this
koyala has been at the bottom of all
of them she hates us orang blandas
with a hate that the fires of hell could
not burn out but she is subtler than the
serpent that taught mother eve she
has bewitched my controlleur see that
she does not bewitch you i have put a
price on her head your first duty will


all-story weekly

be to see that she is delivered for safe-
keeping here in batavia

  the governors eyes were sparkling fire
there was a like anger in peter grosss
face he was on the point of speaking
when sachsens nails dug so deeply into
his hand that he winced

   mynheer gross is an american
therefore he is chivalrous sachsen ob-
served  he aims to be just but there
is much that he does not understand if
your excellency will permit me-

  van schouten gave assent by picking
up his pipe and closing his teeth viciously
on the mouthpiece

  sachsen promptly addressed peter
geoss

   vrind pieter he said  i am glad
you have spoken now we understand
each other you are just what i knew
you were fearless honest frank you
have convinced me the more that you
are the man we must have as resident of
bulungan

  peter gross looked up distrustfully
van schouten too evinced his surprise
by taking the pipe from his mouth

   but sachsen continued  you have
the common failing of youth youth
dreams dreams it would rebuild this sorry
world and make it paradise before the
snake it is sure it can with age comes
disillusionment we learn ive cannot do
the things we have set our hands to do
in the way we planned we learn we
must compromise once old sachsen
had thoughts like yours to-day -he
smiled tenderly- he has the beginnings
of wisdom that is he has learned that
god ordains do you believe that vrind
pieter

   aye of course peter gross ac-
knowledged a trifle bewildered  but-
 now concerning this woman sach-
sen cut in briskly  we will concede
that she was wronged before she was
born we will concede the sin of her
father we will concede his second sin
leaving her mother to die in the jungle
we will concede the error if error it was
to educate koyala in a mission school

among white children we will concede
the fatal error of permitting her to return
to her own people knowing the truth of
her birth

  his voice took a sharper turn as he
continued

   but there are millions of children
born in your own land in my land in
every land with deformed bodies blind
perhaps crippled with faces uglier than
baboons why because one or both
of their parents sinned now i ask you
he demanded harshly  whether these
children because of the sin of their pa-
rents have the right to commit crimes
plot murders treasons rebellions and
stir savage people to wars of extermina-
tion against their white rulers what is
your answer

   that is not the question peter gross
began but sachsen interrupted

   it is the question it was the sin
of the parent in both cases leveque
sinned his daughter koyala suffers
parents sin everywhere their children
must suffer

  peter gross stared at the wall thought-
fully

   look you here vrind pieter sach-
sen said  learn this great truth the
state is first then the individual always
the good of the whole people that is the
state first then the good of the indivi-
dual thousands may suffer thousands
may die but if the race benefits the cost
is nothing this law is as old as man
each generation says it a new way but
the law is the same and so with this
koyala she was wronged we will admit
it but she cannot be permitted to make
the whole white race pay for those wrongs
and halt progress in borneo for a genera-
tion she will have justice his excellency
is a just man but first there must be
peace in bulungan there must be no
more plottings no more piracies no
more head-hunting the spearheads must
be separated from their shafts the krisses
must be buried the sumpitans must be
broken in two if koyala will yield this
can be done if you can persuade her
wages of virtue



to trust us pieter half your work is done
bulungan will become one of our fairest
residencies its trade will grow the pi-
racies will be swept from the seas and
the days of head-hunting will become a
tradition

  peter gross bowed his head

   god help me i will he vowed

   but see that she does not seduce you
vrind pieter the old man entreated
earnestly  you are both young she is
fair and she is a siren a vampire hold

fast to your god to your faith to the
cath you take as a servant of the state
and do not let her beauty blind you-
no nor your own warm heart either
pieter

  sachsen rose there were tears in his
eyes as he looked fondly down at the
young man that owed so much to him

   pieter he said  old sachsen will
pray for you i must leave you now
pieter the governor desires to talk to
you

to be continued next week dont forget this magazine is issued weekly and that
you will get the continuation of this story without waiting a month

alice nodded with grim approval

 shell pay now she told her-
 self  shell pay about time
too a woman cant expect to carry on
as she has always tisnt natural or
right that she should

  she began to get her things together
pretty soon the train would run into the
terminal and she would alight she
would give the slip bearing hesters ad-
dress to a cab-driver-yes she would
take a cab and arrive in state to show
hetty how virtue prospered

  poor- hetty her days of prosperity
and defiance were about over she was
getting on no use trying to blink that
fact time was when her youth and

beauty had ousted beldings fading wife
the hour had come when she too must
step aside she was nearly forty hetty
of course would wail indeed her letter
held a tone to make one waste no time
there was no telling what she might do
in her first despair she had always been
intense

  seated at last in an ancient four-
wheeler she wondered whether it wouldnt
have been better to take one of those mo-
tor vehicles they seemed to be just the
thing but no doubt this mode of con-
veyance lent more dignity suited better
her black silks and graying hair she
smoothed out her skirts with sudden
critical scrutiny her clothes looked

rather rusty in this city glare somehow
her gloves positively shabby altogether
she hardly fitted into the scheme of things

  she began to wish shed had time to
get something fresh to wear but the
winter had been hard funds were low-
funds were always low with her well
never mind her things were honestly
come by and shed her own place too
hetty wouldnt turn up her nose now
shed wager shed have a chance at last
to learn what it meant to work and earn
her living

  how she used to hate work this or
that was always too hard or too stupid
or not worth doing  how can you spend
your life cooking for people who have to
be fed all over again in a couple of
hours shed say  you never get any-
where how would hetty like a cham-
ber - maids place now she wondered
well she wouldnt be too hard on her at
first

  alice andrews checked the smile that
came at the thought of that impatient
eager-faced girl who had seemed some-
how to concentrate all available sunlight
on her face and hair who had seemed
always to be holding out her hands to
life

   she wont look like that now she
reminded herself placidly  i wonder
how she does look anyway too fat of
course she was always the plump one
and that hair of hers will be drab now-
 sunshine he used to call her or per-
haps it will be dyed like that montvale
womans her color will be faded like
mine only worse of course she is
younger but think of the life shes led
out all hours ill warrant-city life too
oh shell show what shes been through
-conviction of sin remorse-

  the splendor of the apartment hotel
dazzled her small-town eyes confined so
many years to boarding-house kitchens
 shell have to forget all this she
thought with a certain satisfaction after
all hetty had lain on beds of ease while
she had kindled early fires in many a
shivery dawn groping about the kitchen

with sleep-burdened eyes and sluggish
brain

  she resented being obliged to go into
this house which sheltered hetty even
now people were looking at her-all these
fine-looking lavishly dressed ladies-
speculating on her purpose out of coun-
tenance- she hung her head as she stam-
mered her sisters name to the elevator
boy ofcourse he knew all about her

  if so he did not condemn her appar-
ently for he smiled broadly hospitably

   miss andrews you mean dr an-
drews i guess second floor step right
in please

  dr andrews she wondered she
hadnt had three letters from hetty in fif-
teen years they had broken definitely
she knew hetty had been the doctors
assistant-hetty always had the deftest
fingers she would be invaluable passing
him his dental instruments sterilizing
things they made such a fuss over that
business now - not that she knew very
much about it she couldnt afford to

  from the moment that she had entered
the building found herself graciously re-
ceived mingled with these ladies who ra-
diated such an atmosphere of buoyant
well-being she had felt suddenly and in-
explicably easy happy-gay almost as
if she herself cramped as she had been
all her life by poverty and toil had be-
gun chameleonlike to reflect the com-
fort and brightness about her her heart
beat higher her thin cheeks burned she
found enjoyment in the good looks and
apparent freedom of the other women

  as she moved forward at the call
 second however colliding with a man
who drew aside to let her pass a haggard
face stared wistfully at her from a nar-
iow strip of mirror in the elevator panel-
ing contrasted with the bright self-
indulgent faces round her it seemed in-
credibly old and worn immediately the
glow that had warmed her chilled

    why i look as if i ought to be in my
bed she thought amazed  i guess
that crazy letter of hettys and the long
trip upset me more than i thought
wages of virtue



  at her ring the door opened she saw
a tall graceful young woman daintily
dressed the young womans back was
to the light so she could not see her face
very well she was good to look at how-
ever with bright soft hair about her
smooth temples and a round white throat
the westering sun picked out a lot of
little curls about her ears and the well-
rounded outlines of her bare forearms
caught the light a vague fragrance came
from her soft garments

   does a miss andrews- alice began
timidly

 the young woman threw up both
hands with a quick cry

  alice alice this cant be you
she peered into her face as if to discover
something maliciously hidden  heav-
ens then grasping her by the shoul-
ders  come here to the window

  the two women faced each other

  for alice at least no doubts now re-
mained her delinquent sister stood be-
fore her miraculously young miraculous-
ly lovely of course she had changed-
but not much and that all for the better

  her rather formlessly chubby face had
gained in subtlety and expression her
fair hair was darker but shining and
well nourished the staring pink and
white of her complexion had softened
she was a little tanned by the sun and
there was a healthy outdoor glow on her
smooth cheeks the few faint character
lines seemed but to accentuate the firm-
ness of her flesh her figure was as
straight as ever and more muscular-look-
ing yes this was hester

  with an effort she gave heed to her
sisters crowding words

  oh alice youve been ill youve
been poor youve suffered all these
years how you must have suffered
why didnt you let me know i would
have done anything to help you for all
you cast me off so bitterly here let me
take your things sit down ill get you
something to drink quickly deftly
she possessed herself of alices wraps and
hat bundled her into a deep chair

  then as she swung away with her
spoils she suddenly halted as if hypno-
tized she stood gazing at the miserable
little rusty black hat with its forlorn
broken feather tears gathered in her
eyes

   whats the matter with you alice
demanded sharply after all she was
virtue triumphant though she did not
look very triumphant just now  i
didnt leave my house and trapes way
on here to have you cry over my feather
that feathers good enough for me i
want you to know and bought with
honest money here give it to me and
i dont want anything to drink in this
house of his

    house of his  hester queried
blankly

   quick now tell me why you sent me
such a help-or-i-perish letter thought
id find you on your last legs but it
seems to me you look pretty good for a
woman of your years come lets have
it over with and get out of this place you
can start home with me to-night now
that hes cast you off im glad ive a
roof to offer you sit you down there and
get to the point

  hester andrews stood motionless for a
moment returning her sisters gaze
then with a graceful shrug of her fine
shoulders dropped into a chair

   as you will alice she replied in a
voice that contrasted sharply with the
others harsh accents she even smiled
showing beautiful white teeth alice
would have sworn they were false but for
well-remembered and piquant irregular-
ities

   its all over between you

   all over

  you dont look as if you were break-
ing your heart

  hester hesitated

   well hardly only idle women break
their hearts

   but i thought you were in love with
him alice insisted with the confirmed
sentimentality of one who knows nothing
of love

   as to that-well weve been just
good friends for years all the same

hoped-

ing woman yet if you are all of thirty-
eight you dont look a day over twenty-
five why i looked older when i was

   youd advise him to make another
marriage-of convenience you saw how
the first worked out

   but after the way he treated you-
 i dont complain of his  treatment

from a disfigured life see this was the
original formation of the jaw look at

 what do you think of that occlusion
perfect his parents are my lifelong
friends and but for vincent what
would have been my life a maids cap
or a butler for a husband

  alice gasped

  her sister bending over her frowned
with professional intentness

   my dear how youve neglected your
teeth theyre in a frightful condition

   look here now i didnt come
here-

   never mind alice theres a good old
girl ill fix them up for you and it
wont cost you a cent some ill fill and
some ill crown you wouldnt believe
what a difference it will make in your
health

   ive managed to get along a good
many years without such new fangles i
wont begin now

   but a ice-

   listen to me now why did you
send for me you made out you were
in such a bad way i packed up and left
a house full of good - paying lodgers
goodness knows i cant afford such
jaunts

  hester sighed

   well if you must have it alice im
not in any bad way but i had to make
the letter pretty strong or youd not have
come of course i was disappointed
when i found vincents plans for the fu-
ture didnt include me after all you
know were used to each others ways i
could be a help to him by way of repay-
ment id like to repay him but when
i came to think it over i saw he was
right

   its all over - that young madness
you cant bring it to life again so why
hamper our new free friendship with
empty vows besides no one has ever
questioned us weve escaped - miracu-
lously-all suspicion-oh we were very
careful an alliance now would start up
all sorts of doubts then just lately-
alice dont be hard on me-

  hesters color rose her eyes fell to a
little ring which she turned again and
again on one of her slender supple fin-
gers her voice was low her words halt-
ing

   you know vincents an old man
now alice - over sixty sixty sixty
ive been trying to think of him as you
must see him still-straight and strong
and compelling those black eyes of his
wages of virtue



how they used to glow how his wife
must have loved him he was very
young when she married him she was
much older-and rich forgive me alice
but i used to think you were half in love
with him yourself-with his good looks
and gay disarming smile-for all your
severity perhaps you didnt realize it
you were too strict with yourself to ad-
mit such a possibility

   but i remember how your eyes used
to follow him round if he came into your
kitchen and how sharply you watched me
when i waited on the table my i was
almost afraid of you then the night
you met us coming through the wood i
heard you take him to task for it the next
day in the library i listened at the door
he laughed at your scared daring and i
heard him say

    there are girls quite as pretty as
you alice and twice as wise you know
if you want to get anything out of life
you must meet it half-way

  well both leave this house you
cried

    she wont he laughed  ask her
and dont imagine you are doing her a
kindness she wont lose anything by me
my good girl

   and he laughed at you again in that
daring way he had i thought you were
going to strike him and that night
when you thought i was asleep you bent
over me and looked and looked at me
i didnt dare to move  quite as pretty
you kept murmuring  and twice as wise
 then you began to cry after that
we had our-quarrel and you went
away

  alice remained motionless her eyes
fixed on her sisters fair face

   and he-how happy i was all life
that had seemed so achingly empty so
mean and gray and toil-filled-why he
made it bloom for me i had a little
place of my own good books long talks
music-love at once i came to help
him in his office his wife liked me-
never seemed to guess why i was his
valued assistant well paid respected-i

who had been a maid in his wifes em-
ploy

   she used to rally me on being with
him more than she was-all day waiting
on him anticipating his needs learning
every minute at first i just wanted to
show him how smart i was-what a help
i could be but soon i was interested in
the work itself inside of a year he said
  you can go further than this i
cant have you waste yourself sterilizing
instruments

 he had me take courses evenings
and holidays he helped me our work
together came to be our strongest bond
hester drew a long breath stared off
into vacancy

   and he w-as such a lover-more than
i had ever hoped or wished or dreamed
of in the spring we used to go out into
the country and walk and walk - over
hills through woods sometimes we
would spend the night outdoors thered
be moonlight and hed be like a boy
 hester he used to say  youve given
me back my youth

   and now he says hes too old for me
hes finished and i- she stretched
her fine arms over her head  why ive
time and energy enough to live a com-
plete life yet you know our people
have always been noted for their phy-
siques - the women particularly you
know they have alice her eyes sought
alices beseechingly  why ive ten
good years yet-fifteen remember aunt
claras second family of ten

   so vincent said  why dont you
send for your sister its time you two
made it up shell forgive us by this time
what a tigress she was but a mighty
fine figure of a woman at twenty-five
hard though and cold and intolerant of
little follies well shell have learned
tolerance from the years lifes a great
conciliator thats what he said

   so i sent for you i am lonely in
spite of friends i long for folks - my
own kin and alice theres another man
a man my own age with  round strong
arms like cleopatras young antony

and when he comes you can chaperon
me for i mean to marry this time

  she leaned forward and put an urgent
hand on alices black-clad knee

   alice we can help each other youre
tired and im lonely what do you say
a free sheltered life new strength and
well-being-what do you say have you
had enough of small-town lodging-houses
-enough of hot stoves and greasy pots
though thats all by the way we need
each other

  graceful free from self-consciousness
she held out her beautiful arms the
gesture was that of a woman not ashamed
of or unused to endearments

   you will stay

  there was a silence the older wo-
man in her rusty black so angular and
faded with her recovered hat in her lap
dangling its broken feather looked cold
and hard although she was really trem-
bling she sat up with a sudden catch
of breath as her sister had said she
had been visualizing the doctor as he had
been in his mature prime-adventurous
gallant compelling well it was finished
now for him-all finished just as it was
for her only he had had his joys his
successes her own bare life repassed
before her-the longings of years denied
the wooing beauty of dead seasons the
gradual stifling of desire in toil

  she jammed on her shapeless hat and
sprang from her chair pushing jside the
white rounded arms that sought to hold
her

   dont you touch me she cried sav-
agely  let me get out of this house-
it stifles me

   but theres no train to-night stay
till to-morrow anyway dont leave me
like this where will you go

  alice tore herself free and stalked to
the door

   where i guess theres places open
to respectable people ive the price

   alice- 

  the closing door cut short hesters
appeal

  with whirling senses alice made her

way out of the building in the street
she looked about her blindly no cab
now nothing to suggest luxury com-
promise she bethought herself of a
rooming - house known in earlier days
she had stayed there several times when
new tt  the states and looking for  a
place it had been cheap but clean and
respectable

  she was near the end of her forces
when she dragged herself up the steps and
asked for a room the house had changed
hands she found it was dingy-looking
run-down she did not mind its very
poverty was in her spartan eyes a virtue
the unaired chamber the gray - white
spread the peeling wall-paper-all these
she found in pleasing contrast to hesters
sunny daintily ordered apartment

  declining supper she stripped off her
black clothes at the sight of her bony
arms and yellowed throat in the blurred
bit of mirror she smiled with grim satis-
faction after hesters curved whiteness
they seemed in some fashion decent
commendable she was almost resentful
at the length and thickness of her fast-
graying hair

  in the hard bed at last she felt a sud-
den weariness engulf her how deadly
tired she was well she had been tired
before most of her life she had been
tired that was nothing new to-mor-
row she would start home the round
would begin all over again well she
might as well get to sleep a grateful
numbness spread over her consciousness
lapsed

  she slept perhaps an hour then sud-
denly woke an unbearable awareness of
misfortune flooded her an inappeasable
sense of loss life seemed all at once
tragic bitter unendurable it was as if
some awful calamity against which she
had always succeeded in armoring her
waking hours had sprung upon her now
relaxed in the weakness of sleep a
great sob rose in her throat

  she saw pass before her long-banished
figures heard forbidden words that
chance which the adventurous hester had
wages of virtue



seized-opening all doors of opportunity
to her eager touch-that chance had been
hers first and hester had never guessed
let hester talk of her clever hands her
quickness ah she had been no match
for her older sister either in brains or
beauty-though who would believe that
now confronted with this toil-hardened
maker of beds and sweeper of floors but
she had refused to compromise

  hester with her profession her money
her position more than that hester
with her youth-still-and her beauty
her new undeserved love if she had
once been his she would never have
known of another mans existence turn
away from him with his gay caressing
smile she brought herself up short
but he was old now and  past desire 
-like herself it was all over for both
of them only he had lived and she had
not

  she envisaged the future no change
no choice no possible respite she saw
herself old and broken still haggling with
relentless dealers still bewailing  bad
bills how mean and poor her erstwinle
adequate house looked how steep its
narrow stairs how damp and dark its
basement kitchen and she would live
and work there-until the end and die
among strangers she saw herself dying
alone fear possessed her fear of pain
and weariness and solitude she turned
over and stifled her sobs in the pillow

  in the morning things bore a more en-
durable face her old habit of indomitable
courage and uncompromising rectitude
asserted itself regrets or not she was
not the woman ever to have yielded to a
course at variance with her convictions
or having yielded to possess her soul in
peace her vigorous constitution bore
her up even against the fatigues of mind
and body under which she labored and
capable housewife that she was her busy
mind bustled about its usual preoccupa-
tions that new family who wanted to
eat at her house fair-spoken prosperous
people she felt sure she could suit them
and their money was good they-

     	a-s

  a hurried groping foot in the hall a
knock at the door

   who is it she called already half-
clad

	 hester let me in

  she opened the door and her sister
burst in and caught both her hands in a
desperate grip through her elaborate
veil alice noted signs of a sleepless night
the bright eyes were dull and dark-shad-
owed the round face pale and drawn

   alice you cant leave me like this
youll spoil the rest of my life

   i hows that

   he knew you were coming yesterday
-he thought to stay he came up in
the elevator with you

   he your new one

   yes he heard you ask for  miss 
andrews he wondered at that won-
dered at your appearance though recog-
nizing the resemblance between us

   resemblance 

   its unmistakable then amazed
and knowing we were to meet for the first
time in years-i oughtnt to have told
him so much-he felt he mustnt intrude
so he waited my god he waited and
in less than ten minutes you dashed out
looking like a fury and rushed away
our first meeting in years remember and
he knew that why was i such a fool as
to let you come here

   i wont be here long to bother you
 i mean i should have gone to you
but i didnt expect-

   id look like this how did you
know i was in this house

   he followed you-felt he must you
looked desperate then he came back
and-well he wanted to understand of
course one cant wonder

   youve not told him about vincent
 you cant tell things like that to a
man whos idolized you cornered id
the wit to manufacture a quarrel but
youll have to come back at once or it
wont hold water alice she grasped
her sister  youve got to come back
and stay if youd acted like a sane
woman yesterday-why hes been in tor-


all-story weekly

ture you can see-the difference in our
circumstances the expense of my educa-
tion-and he comes of people whose
women-folk have always been irreproach-
able-didnt need to be anything else
the cruelty of it she crossed to the
merciless clouded mirror and lifted her
veil  you can see what this nights
done to me and indeed she looked as
one stricken with a deadly illness

  still alice mechanically dressing did
not answer

   alice you dont know what it means
to me and i thought nothing could
touch me i had my health my friends
my profession why should i sicken for
any mans love but now it seems as if
i couldnt go on without him alice 
alice adjusted her skirt-belt

   you must explain what you mean
you expect me to pretend theres no se-
cret in your life-nothing youre not free
to tell everybody why you ought to
know i never could do it-play a part
like that everything i did and said
would point the finger at us i couldnt
hold my head up in a house of yours
dont you know it

   oh alice

   how could i outface an honest man
and pretend to him my sister-why id
be a stone round your neck cant you
see that she pinned on her collar
primly  my speech too compared to
yours my looks my ways constantly
reminding him-perhapsyouve told him
were nearly the same age

  hester groaned

   i did oh i did why was i such a
fool still you might have been ill

   and you did not nurse me alice
returned with unexpected logic

   we were estranged

   for what reason-so long and so ter-
ribly

 oh oh

   my hands my clothes-

   i can get you clothes

   he saw me

  they were both silent a long minute
then hester spoke calmly as one utterly

betrayed by fate and resigned to the be-
trayal

   yes and he saw how you looked
when you rushed out yesterday from our
long-deferred reunion

   why dont you tell him the truth
he might forgive you more likely to
now that hes seen me that will show
him-

   the extenuating circumstances the
alternatives i faced

   it  show him what youd have come
to if thats what you mean what youd
have left now to offer him

   no use hes led a sheltered exist-
ence he doesnt know life another man
would understand but i wanted him
alice was putting on her rusty hat now
with its dangling feather

  lots of usve wanted things i guess
she said without bitterness  still you
might try if youre as badly off as you
think

  hester rose and pulled down her veil
with finality her face had taken on the
decision her movements the very deter-
mination that characterized her older sis-
ter one saw that though fired in a dif-
ferent furnace they had been cast in the
same mold

   you dont understand hester went
on  theres another side to it even
if i dared make a clean breast of it
theres not a word i could say that
wouldnt implicate vincent he knows
him and i should never do that even
if it was of any use and i know it isnt
so you see where i stand ill have to
keep quiet and let him think whatever he
may she caught her breath sharply
 all my life ive had to  keep quiet
sometimes it comes over me in the
night- she stopped abruptly

  alice picked up her battered bag

   it dont pay to give too much atten-
tion to how you feel nights she declared
sagely  next day things look evened
up somehow

   oh you of course hester broke in
 youve nothing to conceal your lifes
an open book
wages of virtue



   you mean you repent demanded
alice with her ready orthodox vocabu-
lary

  hester jerked her head up impatiently
 i dont know if its repentance some-
thing-it follows you-looks at you out
of mirrors - and childrens eyes your
best days your biggest hours carry re-
minders-you cant imagine she was
silent a moment embarrassed by her un-
expected need of sympathy

  calm again she regarded her sister
with almost resentful curiosity

   at least youve made no surrender
 ive been an honest woman alice
asserted proudly then with sudden
softening she voiced one of the greatest
and most pitiful of truths  but perhaps
ive never been tempted as sore as some
the two sisters looked at each other 
they were nearer mutual understanding
than at any time in their lives alice put
out a timid hand

   will you take breakfast with me
though im afraid you-
breakfast

   i know but you have to eat

  they moved toward the door con-
strainedly

   youll go back to-day i want to
pay your expenses

   no alice declined  the trips
done me good ill be glad to get back
to my kitchen its a real nice kitchen
and a fine stove

  they went down the stairs at the
front door hester turned

   well good-by

   good-by replied alice awkwardly
 i am in a way sorry hetty though i
never thought to say that

  hester smiled a wan little smile like a
child imploring commendation then not
offering hand or cheek went out and
closed the door behind her

in the plaza at antigua

now the siesta hour was at an end
and the shadows lengthened on
eastern sides of the buildings and
in these shadows sat sundry caballeros
some in purple and silks and others out-
at-elbows but all brave-hearted gentlemen
ready for a jest or a joust a guzzle of
wine or the flashing look of admiration
from the dark eyes of some senorita new-
come from spain

  twas pleasant weather for this little
town of santa maria de antigua del
darien on the west coast of the gulf cf
uraba a blue arm of the ever-sparkling
caribbean twas a pleasant time also

the governor newly gone to seville his
legs trembling in his boots because he
knew king ferdinand would propound
queries for which he had no satisfactory
answers

  wherefore dice now rattled and men
roared with laughter at each luckless cast
and the bottoms of many flagons of wine
were seen quickly after those flagons had
been filled here was a momentary joy in
antigua frowned upon by certain cabal-
icros who for years had followed vasco
xunez de balboa and who now thought
of their illustrious chief on the banks of
the rio sabanas where it flowed into the
great south sea he had found trying to
build him some ships from rotten timbers
that had been hauled through the jungle
wilderness to the cost of some thousands
of native slaves

  these were the ones in rags their uni-

with the new governor and his following
loose of purse and free with supplies and
not exacting of labor to such an extent as
the jungle trail



forms in tatters their metal body-casings
tarnished-but their swords ever bright
and easily slipped from scabbards as
they diced they watched the gentlemen
who recently had come with the governor
and now flaunted their gorgeous raiment
ready to act if they saw a curling lip

  on the day when the ships arrived
there had been divers combats because
these gentlemen preferred to sneer at the
tatters forgetting for the time the blood
flowing in the bodies the tatters clothed
and recently because he had lost three
good friends in this manner the new
governor had issued an edict anent brawl-
ing promising all manner of evil conse-
quences to any caballero who used his
blade save for the profit of said governor
and the glory of spain

  hence a truce to a certain extent yet
the gentlemen of gorgeous raiment did not
need force combat to demonstrate what
they fondly believed to be their superi-
ority they paced the plaza with their
noses in the air expressing scorn for these
others who had spent some years in the
wilderness and spoke among themselves
in tones easily overheard of how a time
away from civilization had caused some
men to forget birth and breeding

  yet always did they cease at the line of
safety for there were certain hot-headed
ones who might forget the governors edict
in their anger and the wilderness more-
over had taught these ragged men courage
and persistence and skill with a blade

  now one sefior pasqual garabito
strode by arm-in-arm with a friend de-
pressing the hilt of his rapier with the
one hand while with the other he flicked
a dainty handkerchief as he made gestures
both graceful and elegant

   tis the truth you speak he said to
his companion but in a voice all near
could hear  tis no less than a shame
to our governor that such ragamuffins be
termed spanish gentlemen ha by the
saints it would be well if all them were
sent with their ragged leader of a de bal-
boa to some far quarter from whence
theyd neer return to plague us

  one of the dicers arose from his place
next the wall and stepped before the fas-
tidious garabito

   were that done caballero he re-
plied  no doubt the ragged de balboa
as you term him would discover yet an-
other sea for the glory of spain i have
yet to hear of any fair deed that will link
the name of pasqual garabito with some
famous page of history

   some of them doubtless are misfits
in their own families garabito said
bending toward his friend and so ignoring
the ragged dicer  i take it many a
proud father in seville thanks the saints
daily that an unworthy son remains across
the seas

   caballeros  call upon you to witness
the truth of the words  spoke but yester-
day cried the other  did i not say
that each ship from spain fetched a worse
cargo than the one before

  u well spoken rodrigo ruiz it is in-
deed true another dicer called

   of a truth though said this same
rodrigo ruiz  we fail to keep abreast
the times here in the wilderness how can
a man know the latest manner of twirling
a handkerchief tis i understand to be
done so at this day-

  he tore a tatter from his ragged gar-
ment and twirled it merrily in imitation of
ascjual garabitos handkerchief while
the dicers roared with raucous laughter
and the face of garabito turned almost
purple because of his fury yet he would
not admit the presence of rodrigo ruiz
on the earth

   could i prevail upon our worthy gov-
ernor to renounce his edict he explained
to his friend  it would be a great pleas-
ure to teach some of these ragged ones
good manners

   a man must have knowledge before
he may dispense it observed ruiz to no
one in particular  could i prevail upon
our governor to remove said edict it would
be a great pleasure to rip some new gar-
ments with the point of my blade yet
the governor will not he must protect his
friends


all-story weekly

   careful rodrigo another dicer
warned in a low voice  nothing would
please certain gentlemen more than to
make a cry of high treason

   i fear me for my good friend bar-
tolmeo botello ruiz went on his back
now turned to garabito  he has issued
certain orders i understand and may be
forced to see them carried out edict or no
edict

  now the face of pasqual garabito
turned purple again and this time he did
not reply as if speaking to his friend but
grasped his companion by the arm and
turned to one side toward the shore of the
gulf

   let us hasten good friend before i
forget myself in my anger and disobey the
governors new regulation he said  this
thing is not to be endured for long without
action

  ruiz roared with his companions and
as garabito and his friend departed he
sat down again in the shadow of the wall
and picked up the dice

   what is that one asked l concern-
ing bartolmeo botello

   you do not know ruiz queried in
surprise hah twas but yesterday
and you should have seen it

   yesterday caballero i was in the
midst of the wilderness seeking a native
thief

   i had forgotten it was a royal hap-
pening know then that bartolmeo bo-
tello my good friend and friend to vasco
nunez de balboa arrived from the coast
of the great south sea some ten days ago
with certain reports

   we all know that seiior
 allow me sufficient breath to tell this
tale in my own manner he arrived ten
days ago as i have said a month after the
last ships came from spain and on his
first day here this bartolmeo-may the
saints prosper his suit-meets the spark-
ling eyes of senorita inez malpartida-
whom may the saints preserve an
admirer interrupted

   did i ever see infatuation at first
glance i saw it then ruiz continued

 my friend bartolmeo being of a blood
immediately sought the senoritas father
and by some manner of means obtained
an introduction to the lady i doubt not
that within two suns he had held speech
with her outside the range of her duennas
ears ah that bartolmeo

   tis a fair romance bif what has it to
do with this pasquai garabito the other
asked

   softly friend allow me breath this
same pasqual you have named long has
been eager to claim favor of the lady
standing even in the good graces of her
father but once she had set eyes on bo-
tello she would have none of garabito
because of this garabito urges his suit
with fervor to the distaste of the fair inez
and bartolmeo botello you follow
seiior

   si and for too great a distance come
to the point of the tale good ruiz has it
a point 

  it has a myriad points my friend
bartolmeo botello being a cabalero true
would be courteous to a rival of a cer-
tainty and take no undue advantage but
it transpired that he had heard three days
ago of a certain dusky native maid who
had listened to the smooth speech of this
pasquai garabito it enraged my good
friend that a man who would mistreat a
native maid would at the same time pay
court to a senorita of family and breeding
wherefore he issued him his order

   the order man before t slay you

   twas yesterday at this hour that
bartolmeo botello met this pasqual gara-
bito face to face in the shadow of the
church yonder in tones that could be
heard all over the plaza he informed this
pasqual garabito that he knew of his little
indiscretions and that such a man should
not presume on his birth and name to
mingle with honorable folk pasqual
garabito said my good friend was at
liberty to take the air of the plaza during
the night or in the early morning hours
but should not presume to allow himself
to be seen by honest folk in afternoon or
evening-
the jungle trail



   hah forbade him the plaza

   you have guessed it forbade him
the plaza after the siesta hour and prom-
ised dire consequences did this pasqual
garabito dare disobey

   and he has disobeyed

   he has had he not he would have
been termed craven since all antigua
heard botellos words

   and to follow-

  to follow there comes a row else t
mistake my good friend ruiz admitted
 and a row means the disfavor of the
governor and possibly punishment no
spanish gentleman should be forced to
undergo and were my good friend bo-
tello in the midst of a dark plot his
chances for happiness could not be more
ill for there is yet another angle to the
affair

   this is news half a dozen cried

   there is another fair maid of spain
who came by the recent ship  refer to
senorita carlotta bonilla it does not be-
come me to speak of a young lady save
in terms of courtesy and respect but i
must allow  like not the look in the
senorita bonillas face too much char-
acter shines forth from her dark eyes-
character of the wrong sort

   true another said  i would not
be her enemy

   this same carlotta bonilla has set
eyes upon my friend botello tis not
discourtesy to tell it since the senorita
herself openly shows the state of her affec-
tions yet botello being infatuated with
senorita inez cannot observe the good
qualities of senorita carlotta the affair
is now plain to you comrades

   not as yet one answered

   why carlotta loves bartolmeo bo-
tello who loves inez who is sought by
pasqual garabito put it not past the
seiiorita carlotta to join forces with this
pasqual for the purpose of keeping bar-
tolmeo and inez from each others arms
gladly would garabito see botello cold in
death and gladly would this senorita car-
lotta also did he spurn her love which
most certainly hell do one must be in

seville and at court to perceive romance
eh hah  think it not

   one woman can cause trouble enough
for any man -may the saints preserve the
caballero who has two on his trail a
dicer wailed  let us on with the game
and await the meeting of botello with this
fine pasqual garabito

  now a soft breeze came up from the
gulf to stir the foliage and make more en-
durable the heat of the afternoon and
now the great doors of the governors dom-
icil were thrown open by native slaves
and more caballeros gorgeously dressed
fared forth into the plaza his excellency
among them

  they fawned at his feet these cabal-
leros for already they had discovered that
here far removed from seville the word
of the governor carried much weight and
also they hoped to profit by their friend-
ship with him since there was yet gold to
be torn from some of the indian tribes

  ladies came into the bright sunshine of
the plaza too some on the arms of their
husbands or fathers the senoritas with
their grim duennas trailing after them
as a bad dream haunts a man

  the seiiorita inez matpartida was the
first of these-a dainty bit of femininity
with tiny feet twinkling beneath silken
skirts and tiny hands grasping the folds of
her mantilla and black eyes that sparkled
and dimples that played about a perfect
chin and black hair in a mass a high
comb glittering in the back of it she
smiled upon the caballeros upon the ser-
vile natives at the trees and the buildings
and the gulf-smiled upon life in the con-
crete with the optimism of twenty years

  her progress across the plaza toward
the church was in the nature of a proces-
sion by royalty for men ranged themselves
on either sides in rows and bowed until
they almost touched the ground rising
quickly in the hope of getting a look di-
rect from her flashing eyes

   there is character for you ruiz
whispered to a comrade  soft as silk
she is artd dainty but for the man she


all-story weekly

loved she would endure hardships you
can read it in her eyes

  those eyes were roaming over the plaza
now in a manner for sehorita inez did
not dare betray too much anxiety else her
father to whose arm she clung might
notice or her duenna observe and give re-
buke at a later hour v hen she failed 
see the broad shoulders of bartolmeo bo-
tello her pretty lips formed in a pout for
an instant but soon she was smiling again

   the governor stopped before the church
to chat with a fray and the caballeros
grouped around him and others in the
procession drew up then the governor
went back to his house with a few close
friends for he had letters to write to
spain and the ladies held court in turn
while caballerosicrowded forward

  thus it happened that inez malpartida
and carlotta bonilla came face to face
under the eyes of their fathers and were
forced to observe the conventionalities of
good breeding though it pained them to
keep back the angry words and prevent
eyes flashing hatred though no speech
had passed between them on the subject
nearest their hearts yet woman-wise
both understood and they would have
avoided each other

   a beautiful day sehorita malpartida
carlotta observed just the suspicion of a
sneer upon her lips

    rarely beautiful i thank you seiior-
ita inez replied bending her head
graciously for an instant

   have you seen my new bauble of
gold senor garabito asked permission of
my father to present it me as a souvenir
of this land of wilderness

  carlotta extended a shapely arm upon
which a bracelet dangled

    tis rarely pretty inez said neither
too much admiration nor any disparage-
ment in her voice

   senor garabito as you know is a
wealthy caballero to whom such a bauble
is as nothing carlotta went on  he
purchases them by the score as gifts for
his friends in spain you are fortunate
sehorita to have such a man for adorer

   i care not to hear praises of senor
garabito inez said  and some men
are courageous enough to go into the
wilderness and gather such baubles for
themselves  believe id prize one ob-
tained in that way vastly more any with
money may purchase

  now the fathers of the two sehoritas
had stepped aside to discuss certain mat-
ters of local politics and the girls were
alone for their duennas were some dis-
tance away on the steps of the church
content to remain sitting there in the
shade as long as no caballero approached
their charges thus masks could be
dropped for a moment and words spoken
that might have been held back had any
other been close enough to overhear

   what you say is true carlotta spoke
softly yet with a hard expression in her
face  i have commissioned a caballero
to gather me such a bauble with his own
hands he has promised to take it from
the very person of a native cacique even
the head cacique of the great wilderness
 indeed inez purred

   as a mark of devotion he will do it
mayhap it will be necessary for me to
hide it from my duennas prying eyes yet
a girl always can protect a love-token i
hope to have it soon i believe you have
met the caballero he is one of vasco
nunezs men senor bartolmeo botello

   i have met him inez admitted
smiling faintly

   when he protested his devotion at a
time my duenna was asleep in her chair i
asked him for a token then it was he
promised to get me the bauble though he
suffer wounds in the getting of it is it
not rare to be loved by such a courageous
man

    it will take as great courage seiiorita
for you to face your father confessor after
that statement inez suggested

   you doubt it then

   so much that  term it a falsehood
deliberately given inez replied

black eyes flashed into black eyes
carlotta bonilla bit her pretty lips an in-
stant then held her head high and would
the jungle trail



have started away to rejoin her father but
the low voice of inez malpartida reached
her ears again

   since you have shown me your bauble
allow me to show you mine she purred
 you may observe it beneath my sleeve
it came from the breast of an indian
cacique senorita even the great cacique
of the wilderness and is set with gorgeous
pearls

   indeed

   seiior bartolmeo botello gave it me
mayhap it is the one he intended giving
you and changed his mind upon more
mature reflection

  senorita carlotta bonilla did turn away
now and hurried to her fathers side beg-
ging him to take her straightaway to their
house walking so swiftly beside him
while he asked whether she had a sudden
illness that her duenna struggled to keep
them in sight

  and senorita inez malpartida her heart
singing a little song smiled eloquently
and turned to her own father to cling to
his arm and acknowledge the greetings of
such caballeros as came forward who were

chapter ii

 another tatter

senorita inez malpartidas
eyes continually roamed the plaza
and after a time her face flushed
prettily and she began talking swiftly
about nothing much at all to cover her
confusion for now she observed the
broad shoulders of bartolmeo botello as
they were thrust through the crowd once
she met his eyes and then there were men
between them again and she turned to
hold conversation with those nearest
knowing well botello would approach
after a time and greet her as if it were
merely a pleasant duty trying hard to
hide the love in his eyes and hoping for a
word with her alone yet knowing he would
not get it

  and then she saw senor garabito ap-

  proaching from the opposite direction for
he had been walking along the shore with
his friend and a dark look came into her
face she knew this garabito had been
in the good graces of her father and if he
approached now- her father would see that
she held conversation with him while bar-
tolmeo botello would be forced to wait in
the distance that would mean that bo-
tello would have time for nothing more
than the smallest greeting for already the
moment approached when her father
would return her to the house

  but to her wonder her father turned
and witnessed the approach of garabito
also and calling inezs duenna to her
duty stepped a few paces away to meet
the man

  a greeting to you senor malpartida
garabito called i i am coming to pay
my respects-

   a moment said malpartida in a
stern voice  it has come to my ears
that certain things have been said con-
cerning your relations with a native
maid

   primarily senor the words were
spoken by an out-at-elbows follower of
the ragged de balboa who likes me not
in the second instance cannot a caballero
amuse himself now and then with a likely
looking bronze wench

    this is not seville seiior where in-
trigues are smiled at and kept under
cover this is the wilderness where but
a few of us reside and where a man may
make no ulterior move without it becom-
ing known you have done me the honor
to seek permission to pay your court to
my daughter seiior and i have looked
upon your suit with some favor but
now that your name has been upon every
tongue-

   on the tongue of a ragged scape-
grace garabito interrupted hotly

   yet men have heard his words and
have failed to hear your denial of their
truth seiior

  would you have me utter falsehood
asked garabito

   i would have vou so conduct vourself


all-story weekly

that there would be no need of uttering
falsehood

   what are your wishes in -the matter
senor malpartida garabito asked
something of anger in his tone

    this ragged scapegrace as he is in
your words is a caballcro of good birth
schor even though he is not well clothed
and he has said-

   pardon senor are you so blind
that you do not see this senor botello
looks with favor upon your fair daughter
and so seeks to malign me

   he mentioned no ladys name senor
as i regret you have done he said i
understand that you were to refrain from
approaching respectable folk

   and you subscribe to that sentiment
senor 

   only in so far as my own family is
concerned caballero allow me to suggest
that you drop this indian maid-give her
gold and send her away-

   gold she has more than i have
 anything to get her away conduct
yourself for a time as a pattern of virtue
when this matter has been forgotten it
will be time for you to consider my
daughter again

   and in the mean time this ragged
senor botello will pay his court eh
senor old malpartidas voice
trembled with anger as he spoke the
word and for an instant he touched the
hilt of his rapier which he wore as a
matter of style rather than for service
for it had been some years since senor
malpartida had drawn blade in offense or
to repel attack

  your pardon garabito was quick
to say  i am angered beyond proper
speech goaded into forgetting my breed-
ing by this follower of de balboa who
has seen fit to attack me with his sneers
did not our governor forbid id run
blade through the lying braggart
several caballeros heard that state-
ment for garabito had raised his voice
rodrigo ruiz heard it and he half drew
his blade from its scabbard to defend the
reputation of his friend but a comrade

grasped him by the arm and whispered
two things-that the governors edict was
still in force and that bartolmeo botello
desired to handle his own quarrels

  moreover botello himself heard it
even as he stepped before seiiorita inez
and bowed his best and wished her an ex-
cellent day his face did not change color
and his hand did not touch the hilt of his
weapon only by a quick narrowing of
the eyes did he show that he had ob-
served the words and the speaker

  so when old malpartida turned his
back on senor garabito and faced his
daughter again it was a smiling and cour-
teous botello who spoke to him bowed
low and stepped back and malpartida
his daughter clinging to his arm and wish-
ing she dared look back and with the
duenna tripping along behind walked
across the plaza toward the governors
house his head held high like the gran-
dee he was in reality

  botello turned aside with ruiz not
once looking in garabitos direction for
there remained some ladies in the plaza
and it was not the proper time to settle
differences or pick a quarrel near one
end of the church wall they stood to
watch men flinging the dice botello
laughing as loud as any at the mishaps of
the unlucky ones

   did you not hear ruiz asked
under his breath

   i heard my friend botello an-
swered

   with what result

   we shall see that presently

   it is a pretty pass bartolmeo here
he has dared defy you and you cannot
call him to account for it without defy-
ing the governor ruiz said

   perchance he thought of that when
he dared show himself in the plaza
moreover he is one of his excellencys
closest friends to quarrel with him may
go hard with you

   yet there must be some justice even
in such a governor as this we have this
is the year fifteen hundred and fifteen
my friend an enlightened age
the jungle trail

   i pick no quarrel with the age bar-
tolmeo but there be men living in it-
 who should cease to live-i agree
with you

  youd not dare-

   the pretty caballero has gone too
far i vow lying braggart eh by the
saints-

   but if you run him through-

   it remains to be seen what may hap-
pen good rodrigo let us not concern
ourselves with it until after all the ladies
have left the plaza

  rodrigo ruiz glanced around and then
plucked quickly at his friends tattered
sleeve

   the cowardly knave has taken ad-
vantage of that also he said u first
he believes himself safe because of his ex-
cellencys edict and now he knows you
will start no quarrel while there are ladies
near so he swaggers across the plaza
toward the governors house timing him-
self to arrive as the last of the ladies are
leaving the plaza he can say he defied
you and suffered no harm not even a
word

   hah botello roared and whirled in
turn ruiz he saw had spoken truth
garabito was swaggering across the plaza
affecting nonchalance and he would
reach the doors of the governors house as
the last of the seiores and seiio-itas dis-
appeared

  now botello sprang forward and
walked with great strides to intercept his
foe and men ceased throwing the dice to
watch and from all quarters caballeros
sauntered forward anticipating a sensa-
tion and a break in the monotony of an-
tigua

   a moment senor garabito botello
called

  garabito looked over his shoulder
slackened his stride stopped with his
hand on the arm of his friend for such a
loud summons could not be ignored un-
less a charge of cowardice stood

   well senor  he asked his lip curl-
ing in a sneer and still twirling the silk
handkerchief

   i apprehend you seiior botello
said in a smooth voice  to change my
orders somewhat yesterday i told you
to remain away from the plaza at any
hour when decent folk were abroad now
i must request that you remain in it at
least until the ladvfolk have entered their
houses

   indeed seiior and wherefore

    that it will not be necessary for me
to call you to account in the presence of
gentle nerves that cannot endure a quar-
rel also to prove to these caballeros and
myself that you are not purposely quit-
ting the plaza too quickly to avoid any
consequences that may be coming to
you

   you question my courage seiior 
garabito thundered

   i do not admit seiior that you have
any to question

   this is not to be endured

   yet perforce you endure it

   tis beneath my dignity as a cabal-
lero and a friend of his majesty ferdi-
nand-whom god preserve-to exchange
words with such as you in seville-

   tis not seville seiior but antigua
that is cursed with your presence at this
time were it not that i feel called upon
to protect honest folk it would be be-
neath my dignity to address you

   dignity-in rags garabito scoffed
si seiior dignity in rags there
you may mark the true caballero when
his dignity is to be observed through his
rags-not that i seek to praise myself
but to damn you more i count it dig-
nity seiior to have followed the intrepid
de balboa across the jungle to the great
south sea which i believe you never
have set your eyes upon my tatters
were gained in the service of spain seiior
and that same king whom you but now
wished god to preserve what hard
spots are on my hands came from wield-
ing blade perhaps and not from twirling
a handkerchief

   you are modest concerning your-
self garabito observed

   there was a method in it senor


all-story weekly

self praise is repugnant to me but i
could think of no other subject quickly
my oratory you will observe has served
to hold you here until the last of the la-
dies are gone if you look about you
will see that the plaza is free of femi-
ninity now my object has been served
garabito snarled as a rapid glance
around the plaza proved the truth of bo-
tellos words

   now - to business senor  botello
went on  yesterday i told you not to
show your face on the plaza at this hour
you have seen fit to disobey my orders
 where get you authority to issue
such orders senor are you governor by
any chance

  the saints forbid i have useful
work to do

   is this treason

   let us not change the subject bo-
tello persisted  i say you disobeyed
my orders

  there was silence then for a moment
while garabito sputtered in his sudden
burst of rage for he could restrain him-
self no longer before this man

   were it not for his excellencys edict
id run you through for the fool you are
he exclaimed

   his excellencys edict serves to pro-
tect his excellencys friends i observe
i never yet have been run through senor
it would be a new experience

   boaster

   merely another score to settle-that
why did you disobey my orders

   i failed to see your authority to issue
them garabito said and since i have
disobeyed what you please to term your
orders what is your pleasure in the mat-
ter

   for disobeying a tweak of the nose
is enough to show how i regard you
senor 

  even as he spoke botello reached for-
ward quickly and grasped pasqual gara-
bitos prominent nose between his strong
fingers he tweaked garabitos head
was jerked forward and tears sprang into
his eyes he shrieked his rage as bo-

tello released him and he fell backward
and again his hand went to the hilt of his
rapier botello stood before him arms
folded across his breast waiting and
ready

   for that ill slay you as i would a
mad dog garabito roared were i
not a loyal man and follower of the laws
id do it at the present moment i shall
beseech the governor this night to remove
his edict for a day that i may cross
blades with you-though i lower myself
to do it

  	youll be lowered properly if you at-
tempt it rodrigo ruiz exclaimed
laughing loudly  be lowered even to
the ground and stretched there while
priests mumble

   i cannot endure such rabble gara-
bito exclaimed to his friend  and this
fellow-this botello-to push a quarrel
in furtherance of his suit for a lady-
 hah botello roared springing for-
ward again  no lady has been men-
tioned save by your lips and those
same kps of yours are too foul senor-
 when his excellency removes his
edict garabito promised and he
whirled on one heel to continue across the
plaza

   a moment senor  botello called
 the tweak on the nose was for disre-
garding my orders there is another
score

   indeed senor 

   but yes sometime since in con-
versation with another man you termed
me a lying braggart did you not
eavesdropping eh senor 

   your words were loud enough for
half the jungle to hear you said it-did
vou not

   if i did-

   it would be an insult to de balboa
my leader to let such a statement pass
without resentment senor it were time
you admitted to all here that when you
spoke you were beside yourself with an-
ger and had small regard for the truth
 you scarcely can expect such a thing
seiior  garabito said sneering again
the jungle trail



   then suppose caballero that you let
your friend hold that dainty handkerchief
of yours and draw blade

  now rodrigo ruiz hurried forward
and plucked at botellos sleeve whisper-
ing what it would mean to urge a quarrel
and for an instant botello turned his
head to tell his friend to go about his
own business in that instant garabito
whipped out his rapier and lunged for-
ward a foul stroke while half a score
caballeros cried out their warnings to
botello

  botello whirled in time to dodge the
darting weapon though it ripped through
his clothing

   another tatter eh he cried draw-
ing blade in turn

  he knocked garabitos sword arm
aside and struck his foe across the cheek
with the flat of his hand

  that for a man of your stamp he
cried  as foul with blade as you are
with speech and in mind and actions eh
tis a disgrace to our king if you draw
such sword in his cause on guard se-
nor you fight for life now

  garabito knew it and now that the
issue was at hand he entered into the
combat with zeal for garabito was no
mean swordsman other men sprang
back to give them ample room and be-
cause they feared interruption there was
no voice no sound save that of the ring-
ing blades the shuffling of feet on the
hard-baked earth and the heavy breath-
ing of the combatants

  thus for the space of five minutes
without advantage to either and then
botello took a step forward and began to
force the fighting his blade darting in
and out like the tongue of a snake gara-
bito gave ground for he was growing
weak already and his wrist was tiring
and he was haunted by the knowing
smile of botello that expressed how this
combat was to end

   too much high living senor  bo-
tello taunted  already your wind is
gone your wrist tires hah i almost
reached you then say your prayers

senor while yet there is time-but say
them swiftly if you would have them
done before your eyes glaze hah

  his blade ripped through garabitos
sleeve and garabito gave ground again
the men were cheering the combat now
for it was a sight in the presence of which
they could not keep silent they did not
notice that garabitos friend had darted
away

  and now he returned and with him
came the governors lieutenant and two
of the guard and they charged across
the plaza shrieking cries to the combat-
ants to stop in the name of his excellency
and the king

  botellos eyes narrowed and the smile
left his face he attacked furiously for
he would have an end of this affair before
interruption came foot by foot gara-
bito was forced to retreat doing his best
to put up what defense he could knowing
that relief was near once more botellos
blade slashed at his arm and this time
caused a scratch that brought blood to
the surface

  another furious drive and garabito
all but turned to flee but his excel-
lencys lieutenant was at hand now and
his drawn sword crashed against those of
the combatants and attempted to hold
them up

  but botello could not be stopped that
easily now he knocked the lieutenants
blade aside and again he lunged forward
determined to make an end of it the
two guards rushed in botello dodged
them both and was after his adversary
again

   caballeros i command your assist-
ance here-in the kings name the
lieutenant called

  it was treason to refuse to obey yet
some of the caballeros hesitated but
botello had no intention of bringing trou-
ble to his friends he stepped back as
garabito withdrew behind one of the sol-
diers and allowed the lieutenant to take
his sword from his hand

  another time senor garabito he
called


all-story weekly

   at your pleasure senor  the answer
came

  but it came in breathless gasps

chapter iii

the stockade

his excellencys lieutenant knowing
upon which side his maize cakes
were greased in a manner of
speaking made no effort to detain senor
pasqual garabito nor to take from him
his disgraced sword but allowed that
fine caballero to flick the dust from his
sleeves right his disarranged attire
sheathe his blade and stalk across the
plaza with his back to the sneers and re-
marks of scorn that were hurled after
him

  bartolmeo botello knowing it would
avail naught entered no protest to this
proceeding moreover he had anxieties
of his own for he found himself in peril-
ous straits not only had he broken the
governors new law but also he had
broken the skin on the right arm of the
governors near friend a transgression
far more dangerous

  he could expect no mercy therefore
when hailed before his excellency yet he
determined to enter what defense he
could trusting to the good fortune that
generally followed him to extricate him
from his present entanglement

  there were caballeros outspoken at this
state of affair but the lieutenants glow-
ering looks were enough to silence their
tongues for the time being since none
who had followed de balboa ranked high
with the new governor and all such were
fair quarry for his thrusts

  only when the officer would have
bound botellos hands behind his back
was there loud protest so loud that the
lieutenant desisted for it was traveling a
long way toward perdition to so outrage
one of good blood before a trial botello
was a surrendered prisoner and would
attempt no escape before his hearing

  he walked across the plaza slowly be-

tween the two soldiers the lieutenant
some paces in advance and a throng of
caballeros and natives bringing up the
rear a fray knowing the story of the
native girl gave botello a passing bless-
ing with his eyes and other men spoke
their sympathy and allegiance without
the use of tvords pasqual garabito by
this time had entered the residence of
the governor like an honored guest to be
first at executive ears with the story

  before his excellencys house the lieu-
tenant hesitated and so did the crowd
knowing that here the officer must make
a decision for one way led into the house
and the other to the stockade with a
small adobe hut inside it-a sort of tem-
porary prison where indians were housed
when they had broken the laws

  the caballeros crowded close and the
lieutenant looked into their faces then
hammered at the door of the governors
residence with the hilt of his sword until
a slave threw it open he conducted his
prisoner inside and left him just within
the door the two guards with him while
he went ahead to report

  outside the crowd waited silently yet
with some impatience scarcely knowing
what to anticipate inside bartolmeo
botello stood against the wall with his
arms folded across his breast scorning to
hold conversation with the two soldiers
who regarded him wrathfully since they
were the new governors men and had not
seen much experience in the wilderness

  then the lieutenant returned two
more guards with him

   conduct him to the stockade and
guard him well he ordered  he will
have his hearing within two hours by
his excellencys order it will be plenty
time enough then his excellency dines
now and cannot be disturbed

  botellos face went white for an in-
stant and then he turned toward the door
without a word and it was thrown open
and he marched out in the midst of the
guards

  fall back caballeros fall back
the lieutenant ordered
the jungle trail



   what do you with him demanded a
voice from the throng but the officer re-
fused an answer

  the guards turned to the right with
their prisoner and at this the mutterings
increased for to the right was the stock-
ade rodrigo ruiz from the midst of the
crowd made a sign but botello shook
his head negatively not desiring an at-
tempt at rescue at this time

  the gate of the stockade was reached
and one of the guards stepped forward
with thongs and indicated that botello
was to place his hands behind his back

  try it dog botello exclaimed
and the guard fell back

   prisoner the lieutenant asked
 will you give me your word of honor
as a caballero that you will make no
attempt to escape before being fetched
before his excellency for trial

   you could have had that senor
without putting me in the stockade
botello replied

   it is his excellencys orders

   i understand senor you but do
as you are told you have my word i
am as interested in waiting for this trial
as any man in all antigua

  the heavy gates closed behind him
and botella stretched his great arms and
walked slowly around the interior of the
stockade while sundry caballeros placed
their eyes to knot-holes and observed
him and wondered much at his manner
and what he would attempt for those
knowing bartolmeo botello anticipated
that he surely would attempt something

  depart good friends he called
 you only annoy my guards and can
be of no service to me at the present
moment

   only say the word- ruiz cried

   careful my friend else you get into
trouble along with me the stockade
is large enough to accommodate more
men let us await the governors trial
of us tis to be a model of justice-
rendering i doubt not

 he walked around the tiny adobe
shack and to the other side of the stock-

ade away from those who watched
aware that on the outside a guard trailed
him and after a time he sat on a rock
at the side of the adobe and looked at
the sinking sun

  now over the jungles head the west-
ern sky was bathed in red and orange
and botello thought of de balboa and
his comrades on the shore of the great
south sea and would have wished to
be with them save for the presence here
in antigua of a black-eyed senorita who
had exchanged vows of love with him
while her duenna nodded

  it had worried botello a bit that he
had not gone to her father and asked
permission to pay his court as a cabal-
lero should but he knew the answer he
would have received and in addition
love makes men and maids do strange
things for both these reasons too had
senorita inez spoken behind her duen-
nas back and for none other for the
senorita inez malpartida was a proper
young person carefully reared yet strong
enough to answer the urgent and true
call of her heart when it came

  so botello watched the orange and
red in the sky and wished that he was
in de balboas camp and inez his bride
with him that being the fairest wish he
could devise for in de balboas camp
he knew he would be safe from his ex-
cellency the governor since de balboa
had a manner of protecting his loyal
men and true

  yet here he was in his excellencys
stockade due soon for trial with the
scales of justice already balanced against
him through favoritism he knew he
had broken the law and so was entitled
to punishment yet he felt that his
cause had been just and that to punish
him the governor also must punish pas-
qual garabito else show himself an
unjust man

  the orange and red disappeared in a
flash even as chalk is wiped from a
siate with a sponge and the deep dusk
came a moment that remained while
the soldiers lighted a huge torch at the


all-story weekly

gates and lights appeared in the build-
ings around the plaza and the breeze
freshened and then it was deep tropical
night without moon - so deep that it
seemed to smother the earth and hush
the noises of the jungle and soften the
dashing of the surf against the shore

  botello heard a guard pass along the
stockade in front of him and wondered
whether the governor had finished his
evening meal and then he heard a
hiss so low that it scarcely reached his
ears and of such nature that any other
man would have ignored it but bo-
tello knowing what it meant arose and
walked slowly toward the fence of the
stockade making no noise with his feet

master-here the hiss came again
botello followed the sound of it and
finally reached the fence he knew
there was a knot-hole there but he could
not locate it in the dark

  si he whispered

   it is tarama master i have heard
how the governor had you locked up
as soon as it grew dark i came t have
here a rope made from vines which ill
throw over the fence master you may
fasten an end of it there and draw your-
self up if the guard comes near ill
give warning

   thanks tarama good native but
your master has no wish to escape at
this time

   they may punish you senor-you
one of the great de balboas men

   you do not quite understand tara-
ma i have given my word as a cabal-
lero to remain here until called forth
for trial would you have me a per-
jurer

   xot so master

   thanks then for your intentions
watch well tarama for i may have
need of your services later - mayhap
immediately after they have tried me
 i understand master ill be near
always

  the hissing ceased botello heard not
the slightest sound on the other side of
the high fence yet he knew that even

by now tarama was far from the stock-
ade moving like a shadow into ftie
jungle to reappear on the opposite side
of the plaza

  botello smiled to think of the eager-
ness with which this tarama had sought
to free him it restored a part of his
former belief in human nature tarama
was a native first had been a slave to
botello and later a companion on tramps
through the wild jungle botello and a
fray with de balboas party had taught
him proper speech and a few things re-
garding religion and now this tarama
followed his master like a hound ready
always to serve him for the pure joy of
doing service-which is by far the best
sort of service after all

  now botello walked back to the rock
against the adobe and sat down again
looking occasionally toward the gate and
wondering how long it would be before
the governor sent for him minutes
passed and hunger gnawed at him for
he had eaten nothing since morning and
wanted meat and then he heard another
call from the stockade fence this time
in the low sibilant tones of a woman
senor botello senor botello

  he walked swiftly to the fence again
careful to make no noise and when he
reached it he hekl breath for a moment
to be sure the guard was not approach-
ing there was no sound of steps and
he spoke

   si

   i have risked maidenly modesty
senor to approach you in this manner
slipping from the house like some light
woman-hence you may well appreciate
my effort

   it is appreciated senorita

   there may be a chance of escape for
you no doubt it may be arranged

   softly senorita-the guard-

   is bribed and will not interrupt
schor

   it were too much senorita for you
to do that the risk is too great men
may use their tongues to mouth your
name ah it is too much
the jungle trail



   then you think of that senor you
surely have some feeling for me then
you appreciate what  have risked to
hold speech with you here and in this
manner

   i am not worth it sehorita

   i choose to think differently i
fear you have affronted our governor
greatly by your attack on his friend he
may be inclined to make use of harsh
measures were you freed of all blame
yet banished to de balboas camp
would you accept the sentence if-if-i
vent with you-as bride

   sehorita he whispered hoarsely
  yet that cannot be-

   ah senor there are more ways than
one of arranging things perchance if
the governor ordered it-

  he would not there is your
father

   who will do as the governor orders
schor in all things

   i cannot see how it may be done
   do you wish it possible senor

   by the saints so much true hap-
piness for such an unworthy man-

   you wish it much

   with my whole heart sehorita
 you will give me love that never
will turn cold

   i safely can promise that sehorita
 and will you strive to carve your
name on page of history even as has
your leader

   with my last strength for your
sake loved one but how can you ac-
complish such a thing i will not have
you place yourself in a position where
men will think ill of you you have
risked much to speak to me in this way
 leave the method all to me senor
be not surprised at anything you may
hear at your trial every move i make
shall be made with care and regard for
your good name

   ah sehorita he whispered  could
i but see your face now touch your
hands your lips could i but hear your
voice free and fair without the guise of
whisperings

      	a-s

  	soon schor-soon but give me
your honorable word as to this affair
schor i may not tarry here longer

   do you need my good word that ill
stand by such a bargain i am re-
ceiving the great favor not granting it
ah inez beloved-

  a gasp stopped him silence for a
moment then the whispering again but
in a new tone

   inez say you i am no inez
senor would the fair inez you men-
tion risk her reputation and her good
name to approach you like this

 i-i did not recognize your voice-
am i sc sure of that senor did
you not rather let me go on with my
talk offer myself to you like some
bronze native girl cheapen me-

   sehorita would i treat any wo-
man so

   inez so it was inez you were
promising to love and cherish with
whom you were willing to live in de
balboas camp on the shore of the great
south sea i have loved you senor
botello enough to forget my breeding
and lower myself by this indiscretion
but i can hate as well as love schor
no man relishes carlotta bonilla as an
enemy 

  sehorita you

   i can make arrangements one way
as well as another senor-to punish as
well as to save

   i have done nothing sehorita to
merit your love i have had no thought
of you

  this is an insult added

   forget this scene sehorita as i will
forget it my knowledge of your indis-
cretion will not be spread return to
your fathers dwelling i beg of you and
attempt no more night affairs of this
sort let the proper man seek you
out-

   now you would give me rules of
conduct-duenna she cried

  she hissed the last word but botello
had no time to search for insult in it
he was cursing himself for having be-


all-story weekly

trayed his love without ascertaining his
visitors identity first

  i-ie had no delusions regarding car-
lotta bonilla though he spoke her fairly
it was common knowledge that her
character was not of the best though
she was of a proud family here in the
new world her father had fallen on
evil days in an attempt to repair his
shattered fortunes it was whispered
that the price of his present affluence
and standing with the governor was his
daughters favor in time his purse
full he would go back to seville and
by virtue of that full purse see his
daughter wedded to a courtier in the
mean time his excellency saw to it that
bonilla and his daughter were not
snubbed by other folk though they
were treated distantly

  that was what carlotta had meant
perhaps by her intimation of influence
the governor would pardon botellas
transgression and send him away to
exile in de balboas camp if she asked
it he would marry botello to his cast-
off glad to be rid of her of them both
perhaps already she had arranged it
that was another score to settle with
the governor

  and now that she had failed to gain
his consent would she not turn against
him would not her influence with the
governor obtain for him a severe
sentence

  had he seen her now he would not
have doubted it like a shadow
senorita carlotta bonilla crept to the
jungles edge where an indian girl
awaited her and they hurried behind
the buildings and so around the plaza
and to the rear of the governors house
where she had been dining that evening
with her father

  through a rear door they crept and
to the room set apart for the use of
senorita carlotta and there she whis-
pered a message in the ear of the indian
maid and sent her away

  she sat beside the open window then
looking out into the black night and

waiting for the native girl to do her
errand her breasts were rising and
falling rapidjy as she breathed in anger
and she bit her lower lip until the blood
came and clenched her two tiny fists
until the nails cut into the palms

  minutes passed and a shape ap-
proached outside the window to come
to a stop beneath it

   seiior she whispered

   senorita

   the girl sent you

   si senorita in what manner may
i serve you

   there is need of little speech be-
tween us senor garabito you desire a
certain woman who has eyes for another
man i have desired a certain man who
has eyes only for that other woman

   have desired senorita

   you speak correctly senor well
not go into details please just let me
say that you can hate him no more
than i do at this moment you have in-
fluence with his excellency see stern
justice given the man in the stockade
scfior and accept my thanks were i
able to get the governors ear t would
forget myself enough to ask it in per-
son no doubt his excellency would
grant my request as a courtesy to his
friend my father

  it was well for seiior garabito that
she could not see the smile that flashed
across his face then

   i believe it may be arranged
senorita he said

   adios senor

   adios

chapter iv

in the governors house

garabito slipped away through
the darkness and still he smiled
and he was smiling when he
reached the front doors of the governors
house but he changed the expression of
his countenance there to express rage
and hatred
the jungle trail



  before the doors groups of caballeros
had gathered and garabito passed
through their midst in a silence that
was more of a rebuke than any words
could have been for all in antigua knew
by this time of the foul lunge he had
made

  from the stockade came botello in
charge of the lieutenant and four guards
garabito hurried inside the house and
to the big council chamber where the
governor transacted all business of an
official nature and there he got his ex-
cellencys ear for a time and afterward
sat down to one side to wait

  botello and the uards reached the
doors exclamations greeted the pris-
oner some expressive of hope others di-
rected against the man who had accused
him he waved a hand toward them to
show that he had not been bound and
passed inside and the crowd rushed for-
ward to enter at his heels

  but there they were balked for the
lieutenant threw up hand for silence
and as the guards started to shut the
heavy doors he faced the throng

   this is not to be a public hearing
senoresi he said and then the doors
were closed before him and they heard
the heavy bars drop into place

  not a public hearing they knew
what that meant bartolmeo botello
was to have a sample of his excellencys
despotism without a chance to offer wit-
nesses in his own behalf when half a
hundred men were ready to swear that
garabito had drawn blade first and
made a foul stroke

  in the plaza they grouped before the
door of the governors house and spoke
in low tones sure that the guards were
not near enough to overhear and so
charge treason afterward things were
far from right in antigua said they
when ferdinands representative forgot
justice and remembered only his friends

  botello had heard the lieutenants
words and they conveyed the proper
meaning to him but he only held his
head higher and his shoulders straighter

and walked ahead along the corridor to
turn off presently into the council room

  it was a monster that room some hun-
dred feet long by fifty wide a big apart-
ment in a big house that sprawled over
the ground like a great spider with its
many wings and large patio slaves had
erected it under the whips of cruel
overseers for the present governor had
deemed the old executive mansion not
fine enough

  at one end of the room was a raised
platform in the center of which stood
a big chair carved from solid rock by
slaves and now covered with silk robes
here sat his excellency a squat man of
little dignity scowling in an effort to
borrow for the moment the dignity he
knew he lacked

  garabito sat on one side half a score
elderly gentlemen stood around among
them senor bonilla and senor malpartida
-the latter also having dined that eve-
ning at the governors house with his
daughter

  it was a stage setting for the hearing
of a man who had plotted against the
life of royalty itself and botello knew
he could expect no justice or mercy here
but only could offer what defense came
to his mind and have it counted as
naught

   bartolmeo botello stand forth the
clerk intoned and botello advanced to
the platform and saluted the governor
gravely

  his excellency looked down at the cul-
prit assuming a stern expression

   you are bartolmeo botello he
asked

   si came the answer  bartolmeo
botello your excellency caballero of
spain and loyal subject of king ferdi-
nand-whom may god preserve-

   you are loud in your loyalty now
eh know then senor botello that i
am his majestys accredited representa-
tive here in antigua and in all darien
and when i speak it is as if his majesty
spoke through my lips

   i never have denied it senor


all-story weekly

   some time since i issued an order
that there was to be no more brawling
or dueling you knew of this

    si senor

   yet to-day you violated that order
 i have witnesses your excellency in
my behalf

   witnesses are not necessary just now
senor answer my question did you
violate that order

   i am here for justice your excel-
lency botello evaded  i stand on my
rights

   has a man rights remaining to him
when he opposes constituted authority

   there are such things as extenuating
circumstances your excellency

   for instance-

   i quarreled with one pasqual gara-
bito when my head was turned he
drew blade and made a foul lunge at me
could i do less than defend mvself after
that

   i scarcely can credit pasqual gara-
bito with doing anything so base the
governor said

   yet there are ample witnesses if your
excellency chooses to call for them

   xor could  credit your witnesses 
fear me they are mostly de balboas
men are they not

   they are senor-brave gentlemen
who have been tried and found true

   i care not to hear eulogies of de
balboas ruffians

   senor botello cried nor cared that
it was the governor he addressed in this
fashion  these ruffians as you term
them are gentlemen of spain and if they
are out at elbows at this time it is be-
cause their sovereign has not seen fit to
reward them when they merit reward
how is this you speak treason
 i speak no treason the reason for
his majestys neglect is no fault of his
majestys it is rather because his ma-
jestys representatives have not seen fit
to report truthfully regarding matters
here in antigua

   you charge that i have been untruth-
ful senor the governor demanded

    am not here to make charges but
to defend myself against them senor if
a boot pinches the foot of a man then
he should not wear it

   by the saints this impudence
passes endurance you have no defense
to make regarding this charge then

   when your excellency calls my wit-
nesses

  it is unnecessary senor i have
heard already the truth of the matter
did you not order pasqual garabito to
remain away from the plaza during cer-
tain hours

     did seiior

   by what authority do you issue or-
ders here in antigua

   by the authority of a spanish gentle-
man who does not wish to see a scape-
grace mingle with respectable folk senor
garabito snarled at that and would
have left his chair to make reply but
the governor signed for him to remain
quiet

   senor botello you are free with your
accusations of a gentleman of my good
acquaintance he said  i will not in-
sult him by asking that he defend him-
self against these accusations

   he has no defense your excellency
there is a certain native girl who may be
called-

   silence the governor cried  i will
hear no more i have said brawls must
cease and order be preserved am i to
have my life made miserable by de bal-
boas swaggering fellows

   send me back to de balboa your
excellency i can ask nothing better
than that the air on the shore of the
great south sea is untainted compared
to that l find here

   again-silence i have determined
to make an example of you caballero i
find it necessary when gentlemen of
spain forget their blood and breeding and
turn ruffians they must be brought to
account my sentence-

  he stopped an angry expression
flashed into his face he looked the length
of the great room and all turned swiftly
the jungle trail



to see senorita inez malpartida walking
toward them

  her head was held high and her step
was proud but neither smiles nor dimples
showed in her face she appeared a young
person with a purpose and all wondered
what it was except botello who guessed
and wished there was a chance to dis-
suade her but he had no chance here
and now

   your pardon senorita the governor
said trying to smile and before her
father could find words to address her
 but this is a private meeting having
to do with the proper government of
darien

  she had reached the foot of the plat-
form by now yet there was no confusion
in her face when she heard the governors
words inez malpartida had not un-
wittingly stumbled into a private meeting

  now her father started toward her to
conduct her from the room and ready
to apologize for her intrusion but she
waved him aside

   your excellency i have come to beg
a favor she said  you know my father
and my family my blood and how i have
been reared you can appreciate then the
true meaning of all i do now often
there comes a time in the life of a woman
when what she holds dearest is at stake
and then she may put breeding aside and
fight for her lifes happiness

    beg of you senorita- the governor
began

   a moment your excellency-and you
my father i have been listening at the
farthest doorway and am not ashamed
to say it earlier this evening i acci-
dentally overheard some conversation
your excellency and i know the cruel and
unjust thing you would do and believe
that you would not after mature reflec-
tion you already have arranged to put
upon this man who stands accused in-
dignities no caballero could endure and
live he has done well instead of ill-

   senorita the governor cried angrily
and then- what interest can you have
in this senor botello

   such interest as a woman may have
who loves him dearly your excellency
girl old malpartida cried now
despite the governors frown  have
you no shame do you disgrace your
noble name and lineage love this man
he has not even asked to pay his court-
 because permission would have been
denied him my father when a man and
woman love truly they think naught of
others we have spoken our hands have
touched-it is enough my heart and
soul are his if he asks them i know
you think ill of me for acting thus but
 have done no evil thought no evil if
i break accepted rules of conduct what
matters it when love is at stake

   in truth senorita- the governor
began again

  she interrupted him once more and
rushed on and botello who would have
spoken and tried to save her in some
measure found himself unable to do so

   this pasqual garabito would have
courted me having my fathers permis-
sion she said  senor botello became
aware of wrongs pasqual garabito had
done i heard it to-day from a duenna
who did not know i listened to protect
me from associating with such a man even
for an instant senor botello ordered pas-
qual garabito to remain away from the
plaza he should be rewarded for that
not condemned else your excellency con-
dones such things as this pasqual gara-
bito has done

   a false statement- garabito began
 it is no fake statement seiior-the
look in your face proclaims it truth and
this afternoon your excellency when
seiior botello called him to account
senor garabito attacked him foully
there are half a hundred witnesses to
it senor you would not call them
wherefore i am here speaking in place
of them could senor botello do less
than defend himself when foully attacked
 knew also that senor botello would not
speak entirely in his defense not wishing
to voice my name before you in this place
and so i made bold to speak for him


all-story weekly

   and have put yourself on a common
level old malpartida cried  by the
saints what crime have  committed
that such a daughter should be mine

   am i less a good woman my father
because i speak the truth she asked

   to defend a man openly-

   a caballero of spain of good blood
my father with whom i have exchanged
vows of love and now your excellency
i ask you to set senor botello free we
will be wedded and will cross through the
jungle wilderness to the shore of the
great south sea there we can live our
lives and youll not have to endure our
presence i beg it of you your excellency
-it is not much for you to grant but to
us it will be as everything would you
by hesitating humiliate me more than i
have humiliated myself already

  now the governor waved the trembling
old malpartida aside and looked down
at the girl and then at botello and
finally at garabito scowling on his chair

   this is almost past belief his ex-
cellency said  did  not know your
father and family senorita surely would
 believe ill of you knowing them how-
ever i am like to think that you are
not yourself for the moment perhaps
a touch of the jungle fever-

  thank the good god malpartida
exclaimed

   we shall look at the affair in that
manner his excellency continued  and
let the few of us in this room forget what
has happened and immediately re-
garding this matter i believe i can find
an instant solution i believe it is your
wish senor garabito to take as wife
this fair seiiorita

   it has long been my wish excellency
 even after her avowal here of love
for another man

   as your excellency has said-a touch
of fever-

   and you senor malpartida my old
friend would gladly see her the wife of
senor garabito eh after all this

   and thank him for taking her mal-
partida exclaimed

   then what is more simple we shall
wed seiior garabito and seiiorita mal-
partida as soon as it is possible and in
loving her husband she will forget this
present malady that afflicts her let us
understand the matter settled

   you you- inez gasped recoiling
a moment then running to the foot of the
platform again  rather than be wife
to such a man-

  but malpartida the father had his
way now for he seized her by an arm
and forced her to walk aside

  silence girl he cried his ex-
cellency has seen fit to save your good
name and seiior garabito is caballero
enough to claim you as his bride when
perhaps none other would-

   another would and i have done no
wrong

   you are beside yourself be silent
and now her courage began failing and
she seemed on the verge of tears his
excellency did not relish this scene and
so made haste to end matters he looked
down at botello even more angrily

  he saw a man whose face failed to
betray what emotion he felt it was like
a mask but behind the mask a mental
conflict raged botello had made his
decision now no woman should be
sacrificed to such a man as pasqual gara-
bito if he could prevent it least of all
the woman he loved and who loved him

   bartolmeo botello the governor
said  it is not necessary to call wit-
nesses as i said before this interruption
 adjudge you guilty of violating my
order regarding brawling we must
make an example in order that others
of de balboas throng will learn that
law has come to darien you shall be
confined in the stockade until morning
when you shall be taken to the plaza
and there publicly whipped after that
you are to be exiled from antigua and
may rejoin your comrades on the great
south sea if you wish so that you remain
away from this place

  an instant of deep silence while bo-
tello seemed to grow inches taller
the jungle trail



   you would dare he cried then
 you would have a caballero whipped in
public and who will be brave enough
to lay on the lash excellency

  enough i have sentenced seiior
malpartida take your fair daughter home
and guard her well until to-morrow when
we may make plans concerning her mar-
riage

  malpartida started with inez toward
the corridor hurrying her along so that
she could make no further plea gara-
bito arose and stepped close to his enemy
and once he sneered and botello would
have sprung upon him even in the gov-
ernors presence had not the soldiers
seized him

  away he cried and thrust them
from him  you do not bind my hands
 have endured enough-

  take him away take him away
the governor thundered

  the guards made haste to obey but
they tried not to bind his hands now
botello himself walked ahead into the
corridor and down it after malpartida
and inez ahead of them other
guards threw open the doors caballeros
thronged the plaza awaiting the verdict
their torches cast a lurid glare over the
wide entrance to the governors house

  one moment seiior botello the
lieutenant called as the door was reached

   back you do not bind me with
my bare hands-

  it is orders-

   my parole is ended the trial is
ever

  they were in the doorway for an
instant inez turned and her father
whirled to prevent any leave-taking
the lieutenant pushed one of the soldiers
aside and stepped close to his prisoner
believing that this view of the senoritas
sweet face might soften the heart of bo-
tello so that he would submit to bonds
without display of violence

  a dusky shape flitted along the front
of the building tarama slipped a rapier
into his masters hand and was gone like
a shadow

  a sudden brawl seemed to break out
in the crowd rodrigo ruiz struck an-
other caballero so that he was hurled
against the lieutenant and old senor mal-
partida almost upsetting them

  adios bartolmeo ruiz called

  and in that moment bartolmeo botello
clasped a willing inez in his arms then
swept his rapier menacingly in semicircle
before him then darted around the cor-
ner of the building with soft arms en-
circling his neck and the shrieks of the
pursuing guards ringing in his ears

  jungle darkness swallowed the fugi-
tives

chapter v

in the hut of fray felipe

rtwas but a short distance from the
i corner of the governors house to
the jungles edge and bartolmeo
botello took it in half a dozen great leaps
with inez malpartida clasped in his arms

  here was black night where not even
the faint light of the stars penetrated
and tangled undergrowth that made prog-
ress difficult and curling roots ever ready
to trip a foot

  yet the matter of escape at the present
moment was a mere trifle could botello
and his lady gain half a decent start of
their foes for they could progress some
distance before the soldiers procured
torches and sounded an alarm and began
searching the jungle for a trail the real
danger would come later when the search
had been organized properly

  with the soft arms of inez still clasped
around his neck and her whispered en-
treaties to make good escape in his ears
botello moved slowly once he was under
cover of the darkness so as to make
little noise

  far to the right there was a sudden
crashing in the brush a series of grunts
and the cries of the governors soldiers
as they charged in that direction

   that is tarama the good native
decoying them in an opposite way bo-


all-story weekly

telio whispered  i had anticipated such
a move for tarama is quick to think and
act now we have less to fear

  but he moved slowly for all that fear-
ing to stumble on some soldier who had
strayed from his fellows and knowing the
slightest noise would attract guards their
way inez malpartida was on her feet
now and walking beside him while with
one arm he pushed branches from before
her and with the other held her close

   the journey will be long and peril-
ous loved one he breathed  this is
but the start of it day after day night
after night we must be on our guard
they will pursue knowing we are making
for the camp of de balboa we will be
unable to follow even the uncertain jungle
trail for fear of discovery and there
are natives who are hostile when they
find one or two men of spain abroad in
the great wilderness mayhap it were
wrong to take you with me

   where love is there can be no fear
she whispered in answer  and would
you have me remain behind when my
love is yours and they would wed me to a
man unworthy

   not so seiiorita that is why you
walk beside me now

   with you for guide well win
through

   yet it is a perilous journey for a
tender lady he said  many strong
men have quailed before it there may
be much suffering before we reach the
end

   then must we suffer together cabal-
icro death even self-inflicted would
be better for me than marriage to such
a man as pasqual garabito

   once started we may not turn back
seiiorita here is one caballero who never
will have lash laid across his naked back
by order of any man whatsoever and
you must escape a hateful marriage
wherefore we must turn our faces to-
ward the great south sea and win
through though perils by the score con-
front us tarama good native always
will be near he will be guide and guard

for us for the wilderness is his hearth-
stone

  xow they had reached the bank of a
tiny but turbulent stream and botello
picked his lady up in his arms again and
waded through the water and on the
other side he put her on her feet and
they continued through the black jungle

  far behind them were choruses of cries
as soldiers of his excellency beat the
jungle and once they saw a great light
in the distance and guessed that a huge
fire had been built in the plaza to illumi-
nate the edge of the wilderness and aid
the guards in their work of searching

  the brush before them cracked and
botello stopped and drew his rapier put-
ting inez quickly behind him

   master came a hiss

   i am here good tarama

   i have thrown them off and circled
master yet they will be on the trail
before long mayhap there are natives
loyal to the governor who know the wil-
derness as well as  and can pick up a
trail other men would not see

   go ahead tarama to the hut of
fray felipe and tell him we come and
wherefore

   si master

  tarama was gone even as he answered
they waited a moment in silence listening
then followed him

   for the last time seiiorita you be-
lieve there can be nothing for you except
this perilous journey botello asked

   unless my being in your company-
wili hinder you senor and so delay your
escape

   your presence will give me twice the
usual cunning he said  a few more
steps and you may not turn back
sehorita think well i beg of you i
would have no regrets

   you have said that you love me
senor

   with all my heart

   then there can be no regrets-un-
less at some time you cease to love

   xever fear for that

  onward then she commanded in
the jungle trail



a whisper  we must not fail to win
through

   one stop we must make botello
said  yet that will take us but a short
time unless my old friend fray felipe
proves to be unreasonable

   i understand senor

   and are willing

   can you ask it seiior did i not
love you enough to wed would i have
risked maidenly modesty before his ex-
cellency by making plea for you

   it were too much senorita i am
unworthy of it

   say not again that you are un-
worthy that casts poor reflection on
my personal judgment

   your pardon dios was there
ever man so pursued by good fortune
 and also by bad soldiers seiior
she reminded him

  he clasped her closer and chuckled
and hurried forward now at better speed
here and there was a cleared space and
they hurried boldly across making every
effort to gain time they circled away
from the jungle trail made by vasco
nunezs men and presently in the dis-
tance saw a tiny pin-point of light twink-
ling through the jungle

   fray felipe is in his home thank
the saints botello said i had been
half afraid he might be in the wilderness
on some mission to the natives now if
tarama has explained matters mayhap
more time will be saved to us

  they came to the edge of another
clearing now and ran across it hand in
hand like two happy children which they
were in their hearts despite the pursuit
as they reached the hut tarama glided
from a clump of brush and hurried to-
ward them and led them to the door
upon which he beat with his bare fist
it was opened immediately and they
slipped inside

  it was not more than ten feet square
that hut made of logs and vines and
clay in one corner was a bunk in an-
other a chair in a third a table in the
last corner of all were things having to

do with religion before the bunk stood
fray felipe who raised his hand as they
entered and tarama closed the door
behind them and glided behind the bole
of a palm outside to watch for enemies

  a man of fifty was fray felipe and
of ordinary stature cities and towns
were not to his liking-even such a ham-
let as antigua so here at the edge of
the wilderness he had built his hut and
here he lived for the greater part of the
time his work was his own having to
do with the natives and he walked
abroad through the wilderness without
fear of harm since all natives were his
friends

  now he stood straight before them
with his arms folded across his breast
his head bent forward slightly and his
gleaming eyes shining from beneath
shaggy brows

   you know botello asked

   tarama has told me son

   well fray

    it is wrong to break a law my son-
that we all know but there may be
times when it were worse to obey the
law tarama has told me you acted in
defense of your life

   the man made a foul stroke

   i doubt it not knowing senor gara-
bito as i do nor do i blame you my
son for ordering him to keep away from
decent folk knowing facts about the
subject yet it had been a demonstra-
tion of fortitude had you accepted the
punishment ordered you

   fray you would have a caballero
of spain whipped across his back like a
native thief

   the priest spoke a moment ago
tray felipe said then his face softened
by a smile  now let felipe the man
speak you are right seiior no cabal-
lero especially an honorable man as
yourself should be whipped and dis-
graced in such a manner especially by
order of such an unjust man as the pres-
ent governor of darien i blame you
not

   then- botello cried eagerly


all-story weekly

   a moment my son you perceive
it is the priest speaks to you again now
even as priest i counsel you to make
good your escape and join your com-
rades at the great south sea out at
elbows they are and half-starved at
times yet they are gentlemen true who
always have been god-fearing and
courageous and loyal i hope to rejoin
them myself soon for i find this spot
by far too near the tainted air of
antigua

   i thank you fray

   rut this lady - high born and
gentle-

    a true woman fray

   i doubt it not it were unseemly
for her to be with you so however

   our love is strong fray botello
replied  at my farce of a trial she
risked reputation by stepping forward
and making plea for me for that she
would have been punished

   punished this senorita

   by the governors order she was to
have been wedded to this same pasqual
garabito could i leave the woman i
love and who loves me to such a fate
fray

   i cannot counsel that any woman
should be wife to such a man

   then what else to do but flee to-
gether that brings us to the subject
nearest our hearts fray the pursuit is
close behind some one may think of
this hut and make an investigation here
we would be wed and have your bless-
ing and then be on our way to the camp
of vasco nunez de balboa

  now fray felipe bowed his head on
his breast and paced back and forth
two short steps in either direction think-
ing deeply it was irregular this that
senor botello wished and held some-
what of danger in it since his excellency
the governor would seek to punish any
man who thwarted his plans yet twas
not of the danger the fray thought most
but of the irregularity

   there is scant time fray botella
reminded him

   i like it not my son

   we may not turn back now fray
to do that means disgraceful punish-
ment for me which does not matter so
much but it means also marriage to an
unworthy man for the senorita and
surely you would not have us begin our
long and perilous journey without being
joined in wedlock

  my son

   there you have the situation fray
now fray felipe stepped forward a
pace his head held high again and took
the hands of inez between his own

   you wish this my daughter

   more than i have wished for any-
thing in all my life good fray i love
senor botello truly and know him for
an honorable man and will be a good
wife to him

   the dangers you will have to face-
 will be as nothing if i am bv his
side

   si you will make a rare wife the
fray said  then ill do as you desire
and give you my blessing and pray that
all will be well with you

  botello gave a glad cry and stepped
forward but now the door was thrown
open quickly ani tarama rushed in
and slammed it shut behind him

  master master they are at hand
he whispered hoarsely  on every side
they crept forward catching me off my
guard they have surrounded the hut
the native dropped on his knees be-
fore botello half sobbing seeming to beg
for forgiveness because he had failed in
his duty botello felt no censure for
him since his task had been difficult
for in the blackness of the jungle it had
been an easy matter for foes to approach
near before being seen especially since
native guides were with them

  inez malpartida gave a little cry of
disappointment and fear botello half
drew his rapier from its scabbard but
fray felipe sprang quickly to the table
and snuffed the light on it and then
they heard him fumble at the door and
a heavy bar drop into place
the jungle trail



 son daughter he whispered
to me - here in the dark of night
you must be wed for it appears the only
way now yet may your hearts and souls
be illuminated by your love tarama
crouch you here behind me and be si-
lent

  now they could hear the voices of
men outside the hut gradually growing
louder and light came in between the
logs some soldier battered at the door
with the haft of his pike yet the heavy
bar held securely

  within there fray a stentorian
voice called

  more battering at the door while
tarama crouched against the wall more
in fear for his master than for himself
and botello scarcely could take hand
from the hilt of his rapier so certain
was he that all things ended here

   the door will hold until we have
accomplished our purpose fray felipe
whispered as if he had read their
thoughts  forget your weapon my
son and have thought of nothing save
your lady and what true marriage means
be of good courage daughter

  and then he began the service there
in the dark whispering the words and
directing their whispered responses
while tarama knelt behind the fray re-
alizing that this was a moment of great
seriousness for his beloved master and
friend

  whereupon getting no response from
inside the hut those soldiers outside set
up a clamor to wake jungle life pound-
ing at the door and against the heavy
log walls and threatening the torch

   open fray in the name of his ex-
cellency roared an officer we know
you are within having seen the native
enter and your light go out open lest
we tear down your hut and bury you
beneath its logs

  but fray felipe in a low whisper
went on through the ceremony never
faltering not making even the least
haste pronouncing each word slowly and
with due regard for its meaning and

botello and inez gave their responses in
quivering whispers for inez feared her
happiness would be lost now as soon as
found and botello was almost beside
himself with dread of what might hap-
pen when the soldiers ultimately battered
down the door

  inez would be his wife and so gara-
bito would be balked of getting her but
that he would be separated from his
bride he did not doubt and perhaps even
punished in such manner that he would
be ashamed to hold up his head among
caballeros

   for the last time fray-open

  but fray felipe was done now and
he whispered a last prayer and blessed
this new husband and wife ard in the
darkness senor botella clasped inez in
his arms and kissed her lingeringly upon
her lips little doubting it would be the
last kiss for some time to come if not
forever

   smash in the door the officer com-
manded now and the soldiers began
hammering at it earnestly with their
weapons while others attacked the walls
again

   stand back now fray-and you my
beloved botello whispered it is
time to draw blade and have at these
noisy ones there is small chance we
may win through yet it is well worth
the trying tarama to my side and
do not hesitate to use your knife if you
have love for me

  but even as he started to draw the
rapier from his scabbard fray felipe
clasped him by the arm and drew him
close beside inez whispering so that
arama also could hear

   be not despondent so soon my son
he said  there is a way out of the
trap follow closely

  he went to the rear wall of the hut
and there he toiled for an instant until
a section of a log was pulled away

   by crawling through there you enter
the hollow bole of a giant tree he said

  i discovered it while erecting my poor
hut and thought it might have a use one
c

all-story weekly

day beneath the great roots of the tree
is a tunnel through the earth washed
there by the heavy rains as the water
swirled around the roots in the soft
ground crawl through and you emerge
on the bank of a stream you may have
to dig with poniard for the tunnel never
has been used its entire length and it
has been some moons since i have ex-
plored it go quickly and bless you-
bless you all three

   all three and you botello
asked

   fear not for me  go to deal with
these rogues quickly that i may re-
place the log before they batter down
the door mayhap i will join you some
day in de balboas camp

  he stooped and kissed inez on the
forehead and thrust botello and tarama
from him

   i like this not-deserting you bo-
tello whispered

   go my son while yet there is time
your first duty is to your fair wife

  so tarama entered the blackness of
the giant trees bole first and inez after
him and botello crawled in last his
poniard gripped in his hand and fray
felipes last words whispered in his ear
 should the passage be closed re-
main in it until i fetch you word that
all is safe

chapter vi

both priest and man

fray felipe replaced the section
of log in the wall so that it fitted
perfectly and then he who had
been playing the man the last few min-
uves became the priest again and turned
slowly toward the table

   batter it down men he heard the
officer shrieking outside tear the hut
to pieces

  frav felipe made a light and when
it showed through the cracks in the sides
cf the hut there were exclamations out-
side and presently the battering ceased

  open fray came the command
again

  fray felipe crossed the tiny room and
removed the bar from the door and
hurled it open the light from many
torches struck against him and men with
naked blades in their hands thrust him
aside and plunged into the hut until it
would hold no more the governors lieu-
tenant and pasqual garabito leading
them

   how is this fray felipe demand-
ed in a loud and stern voice  you
violate my poor dwelling at night senor
lieutenant with weapons held ready as
if for a foe you care naught if you
disturb a man at prayers

   we seek fugitives desired by his ex-
cellency the lieutenant answered

   and you expect to find such folk
beneath my humble roof there is but
the one apartment to my dwelling senor
and it is not so large but a clear-
sighted man may penetrate the furthest
corner of it with his eyes look your
fill and then tell me whether you can
find fugitives here

  stand back there is scant room
the officer cried to his men and his
soldiers fell back until only the lieu-
tenant and garabito and two guards
were inside the hut

  fray felipe stood back against the
wall looking at this scene the smoke
from the torches almost stilling him

  well they seem not to be here
the lieutenant exclaimed after he had
glanced around the room

   are you a fool seiior garabito
cried  did we not see the native enter
the hut before the light went out
where then is the native we saw
where is the native the officer de-
manded of fray felipe facing him now

   there is no native here seiior the
fray replied

  any man with eyes can see that
where did he go what have you done
with him

   do you find any hiding-place in my
poor hut
the jungle trail



  garabito sprang forward angrily to
within half a pace of the fray and glared
into his eyes

  answer fray and do not evade
he cried  this is a serious business
 i do not recognize any authority
here to question except that of the offi-
cer felipe replied  when he ques-
tions i answer and for none other

   well then have you seen our fugi-
tives the lieutenant asked hotly

   their names officer

   bartolmeo botello and the senorita
inez malpartida

   indeed and why are they fugitive
seiior

  garabito rushed forward again

   can you not see lieutenant that the
fray but plays for time to let them
escape he cried  have an immediate
answer out of him by the saints
answer me fray the officer or-
dered  you have seen them

   si seiior

   hah now we get at it

   often have i seen them seiior
senor botello is an old friend of mine
and as for the senorita i have observed
her in the plaza and at his excellencys
residence-a fair and sweet young lady
of whom-

  no-no silence do not play
longer with us have you seen them
here-to-night

  hah that is your meaning is it
have i seen them here and this very
night

  answer dog garabito shouted
fray felipes eyes suddenly blazed
and he took a step forward almost at
the point of turning from priest to man
in a twinkling and garabito retreated
across the room

   i like not your words and manners
senor the fray said

   have done with this nonsense and
ycu seiior garabito keep out of this
the lieutenant ordered  bv the saints
it were duty enough to hunt down such
people without having meddlers at my
heels

   a meddler-i garabito cried
stalking forward again

  now fray felipe smiled as at two
small boys quarreling and raised one
hand

   it is not seemly to quarrel in a frays
poor hut seiiores he said  if quarrel
you must repair to the plaza of antigua
where there is ample room and a surgeon
is near

  the fray speaks truth we quarrel
and so delay matters garabito shouted
at him again lieutenant make him
give us a proper answer

  the lieutenant walked across the room
again and stopped before the fray his
fists on his hips to put the question
direct

  but there came another interruption
for old seiior malpartida rushed in at
the door breathlessly hurling common
soldiers to right and left

   where is my daughter you have
found her he shouted

   we are trying-

   trying dios can you do noth-
ing but talk

   softly seiior i am about to put a
question to this fray

  seiior malpartida sputtered his wrath
and stepped back and now the lieu-
tenant faced fraj- felipe again this
time with hot determination in his
manner

  answer me straight he ordered
 have you seen the two i mentioned
here to-night

   the two you mentioned here to-
night seiior si often in the
plaza-

   no no no silence fray you
take a wrong meaning of my words
have they been here to-night

   they have fray felipe answered
  hah how long since

   since what seiior

   since they departed may the
saints blast you-

   seiior the saints are not to be
mentioned in such tones surely your
religious training-


all-story weekly

  garabito groaned and turned away
and old senor malpartida sputtered
again

   youve thrown him off the track
once more garabito screeched let
me at him

   fray said the lieutenant now
ignoring the others  this is a very
serious business evade no longer but
give me the direct answer how long
since they departed

   not so very long fray felipe an-
swered

   tell me what you know of this
matter

  hah xow we get at it senor
lieutenant they came to me through
the jungle some time since senor botello
and the lady seiiorita inez malpartida
a comely and well-mannered-

   come to the point fray

   senor botellos native guide had
come before telling me the storv of the
schors arrest and trial wherefore i
allowed the senor and his lady to enter
and after a short time here they departed
again with the native

   why came they here to get food
and drink to carry with them on a jour-
ney

   they asked for neither food nor drink
officer for the native being in their com-
pany they could not lack for those things
in the wilderness

   they said where they were going

   i believe the schor intimated it was
his intention to go to de balboas camp
on the shore of the great south sea

   i knew it-i feared it senor mal-
partida cried  i am disgraced my
daughter alone with that man 

   you are not disgraced schor the
stern voice of fray felipe rang out
 she has a right to be with senor
botello

   a right a right say you how
in the name of all the saints can you
make that statement fray

   she has the right of every wife to be
with her husband

   her husband

  malpartida and garabito and the lieu-
tenant cried it in a breath

   but yes schores because they
wished it and because they said they
would make the journey at any rate i
married them here in my hut but a few
minutes ago

  you-married them malpartida
gasped  you-

   had i not the right fray felipe
demanded  i knew of no reason-

   you must have known there was
something irregular

   si-irregular schor but would you
want me to let them take a long journey
alone without being wedded

   youll answer for this to the gov-
ernor fray garabito declared furiously

   that may be true-but not to you
senor i fail to see where vou enter this
affair

   i was betrothed to seiiorita inez

   but not by her wish schor afid you
are a man unworthy-

   fray

   i repeat it senor the caballero who
has besmirched his name by mistreating a
native maid-

  a falsehood one of this botellos
falsehoods 

   i had it not from senor botello but
from the maid herself who has not sense
enough to make up a lie your falsehoods
avail you naught with me schor

  xow senor malpartida thrust garabito
aside and stepped up beside the lieuten-
ant

   we are wasting time he complained
 let us after them-let us take them
into custody that i may see my daughter
incarcerated for the remainder of her life
in some holy house and this senor botello
whipped like the cur he is

   senor malpartida your new son-in-
law is a clean courageous and dignified
gentleman fray felipe stated  you
should be proud to acknowledge him

   enough of this the lieutenant cried
 you married them eh then it must
have been done in the dark we saw
your light go out we saw that native
the jungle trail



of botellos enter here and he has not
departed

   then he must be here yet find
him the fray suggested

  the lieutenant went swiftly around the
room again thrusting his sword at the
logs and on the outside soldiers at his
command walked around the hut but
could find no trace of the fugitives nor
could the native guides find a trail they
had made leaving the place puzzled men
reported so to their officer and a puzzled
lieutenant once more faced the fray

   this is all you have to tell me he
asked

  it is all senor you know where to
find me if his excellency wishes to inter-
view me about this business

   we are wasting time-wasting time
old malpartida shrieked  leave the
fool fray to his hut back to antigua
and make up a force to pursue them
get natives and track them down are
we fools to linger here longer

  he rushed frantically through the
door tumbling the soldiers aside and the
lieutenant thinking malpartida spoke
sense ordered his men to collect and
prepare to hasten back to the plaza
seiior pasqual garabito went forward
and now when he stood before fray
felipe his countenance was white from
anger

  this has been your doing fray he
accused  you are a near friend of this
out-at-elbows botello you shall be made
to suffer for performing this marriage and
for casting insults upon me when there
were other men present to hear you-
unworthy the holy robe that you wear
as he finished speaking he touched the
robe-grasped it and jerked it as if to
tear it away from fray felipes shoul-
ders and then the fray became the man
again

  his eyes blazed he stood erect sudden-
ly and straightened his shoulders his two
arms shot forward and his hands grasped
the arms of seiior garabito he shook
the cabellero as a terrier shakes a rat

   honorable caballero-you he cried

 wrecker of girls lives gambler wine-
guzzler court dandv worthless shape of
a man the natives open their simple
hearts to me seiior and i who have
heard whisperings say this-treason is
neither creditable to a man nor a safe way
to prolong his life 

  garabitos face went ashen at the frays
words and he grew limp in his adversarys
arms as if all fight suddenly had been
taken out of him if it had not been be-
fore

   out-out of my poor house which
shelters only honest men the fray cried
 think twice hereafter before you term
me unworthy

  he whirled garabito around conducted
him swiftly to the door and hurled the
caballero sprawling far from the hut in
the midst of a group of startled soldiers

  the door was slammed shut again
once more the heavy bar dropped into its
place fray felipe went to his knees in
that fourth corner of the room and asked
pardon because for a time he had forgot-
ten the cloth he wore and had succumbed
to an unholy passion the man had
become the priest again

chapter vii

in the great wilderness

now the dense jungle was filled
with its usual early morning noises
as its denizens went about the se-
rious business of obtaining breakfast and
at the same time seeing to it that they
did not themselves furnish a breakfast for
stronger beasts and now the note of the
monkey-chatter changed in an instant
and little bodies flew through the trees
as the tiny animals hurried away birds
of gay plumage shrieked their warnings
as they flashed their gorgeous wings and
took flight and danger cries arose on
every side

  the din increased as the birds circled
above the jungle and the monkeys de-
manded of one another which had given
the first warning and the reason for it


all-story weekly

  and then at the crest of a hill the
brush was parted and the head of tarama
showed for an instant-rather only the
two eyes of him-and from safe distances
the mqjjkeys shrieked their taunts and
demanded in monkey language why he
had invaded their particular stretch of
country

  a moment of watching and listening
and then tarama stepped into the open
and bent back to part the brush and
bartolmeo botello came into view
holding his bride in his arms

   here is the little cave master
tarama said in a low voice and he led
the way toward it

  it was scarcely a cave little more than
a hole in the side of the rocky mountain
yet so placed that a man could defend it
for a long time against heavy odds had he
the valor before it botello put inez
down upon her tiny feet touched her lips
with his and tried hard to smile at her
but it was only the poor semblance of a
smile that he gave and she made no
effort to respond to it

    water botello whispered aside and
tarama took the gourd from his belt and
slipped into the jungle in search

  now inez was sitting on a rock at the
caves mouth and as botello turned
toward her she looked up and gave him
a weary smile with so much of fatigue in
it that he went down on his knees beside
her and clasped her in his arms and held
her close her face against his breast

   it grieves me he said and would
trust himself to say no more and her
answer came to him in a faint voice from
which all the tone he loved had gone

   be-of good courage - bartolmeo
mine well win-through

  five days and nights they had fought
their way through the jungle eluding the
pursuit subsisting on what food tarama
found in its wild state afraid to kindle a
fire alert for hostile natives and snakes
and jungle beasts fighting thick vines
that barred the way and curling roots that
looped beneath dead vegetation ready to
trip a foot

  this was not the inez who had been
so brave in the governors house at
antigua gone was her finery now she
was dressed in the cast-off clothing of an
indian girl which tarama had stolen for
her the second night

  her throat and arms were bare stung
by insects burned by the sun touched
here and there by stinging poison vines
thick leaves had been plastered about her
feet with mud and bound there with
creepers-and such things served as
shoes

  botello feared too that the jungle
fever of which his excellency had made
a jest would appear in reality now and
they had covered less than half the dis-
tance to the camp of de balboa on the
shore of the great south sea

  yet she smiled as well as she could and
her eyes sparkled when they looked into
botellos and always her heart sang
young loves song her condition she
knew pained botello more than it did
her and it would be a matter of tri-
umph to win through despite these ob-
stacles and hardships-such a triumph
as love delights in and one to cement her
closer to her husband

   here we must rest beloved botello
said now  a night a day and another
night and then we urge forward again
your feet must heal beloved and you
must have rest and food and water yet
it grieves me-

  inez raised a hand and put it over his
lips

   say it not she implored  i would
not have things otherwise my bartolmeo
love can conquer even the jungle trail

  tarama returned with the water and
she drank and then botello made her a
bed just inside the cave and soon she
was asleep as she slept botello and
tarama held counsel tarama would slip
away it was decided for here botello and
his bride would be safe for a time without
the native tarama would use what skill
he possessed in discovering the where-
abouts of the pursuit and conditions in
the country ahead that night and the
the jungle trail



following day he would remain in the
jungle and during the second night he
would return

  there followed muttered words of cau-
tion and advice a hand-clasp as between
man and man and tarama was gone

  the night passed the day the second
night that last night botello sat before
the mouth of the cave and looked down
the side of the mountain into the depths
of the black jungle while inez slept
inside to botello some hint of premo-
nition had come and as the hours passed
it grew upon him

  and when the first streak of dawn
scattered the jungle blackness and
tarama had not come he arose with a
heavy sigh and turned back into the cave
but tried to smile bravely when he found
inez awake and looking up at him

  now botello began the playing of a
game even the hardest game of all which
is for a man to keep from the woman he
loves all hint of the dread he feels

   the good native has but been de-
layed he would say often  what is
another night and a day in this spot
beloved it means more rest for you
regular food when once we set our
faces toward the great south sea again
well make better speed because of these
few days of resting also it may throw
our enemies off the track

  he slipped down the side of the
mountain and picked gorgeous blossoms
for her and found the sorts of food he
knew to be harmless and spoke in the
manner of a lover until the roses were
blooming in inezs cheeks and the smiles
and dimples played about her face again

   see what the rest is doing for you
loved one he said  every man in de
balboas camp will envy me my bride

  and then the jungle darkness came
again and once more botello sat at the
door of the cave and it seemed that the
jungle darkness entered his soul after a
time he slept but he was awake an hour
before the dawn searching the myriad
night sounds of the jungle for one that

     	a-s

would speak of the approach of a human
being

  they ate a morning meal and then
botello was forced to confess that he felt
some fear

   death lurks in every corner of the
jungle he said softly tf even a native
cannot escape always an ancient enemy
a hostile band the sting of a deadly ser-
pent-

   you think tarama will not return
she asked

   i would stake my life on taramas
faithfulness he replied  if he does
not return it is because he is unable else
something of great moment is keeping him
away

   and we must remain here

   we must go forward at another
dawning he said u we are not half
through our journey beloved yet it
would have been easier had we tarama
with us

  the dawn came again and they left
the cave and descended the side of the
mountain to begin their fight against the
jungle here was difficult work for
botello must help his lady continually
slash vines and creepers from their path
leaving behind a trail that any man might
read but one that he found necessary

  throughout the day they fought their
way westward and that night he made
a shelter and while inez slept he watched

  another dawn and again they went
forward and presently reached the bank
of a turbulent stream and here botello
decided to follow the waters edge-he
would leave a trail but he would make
better speed

  and now he saw signs that told him
human beings were about he could tell
it by the way the monkeys acted and
once he found the remains of a camp-fire
and some discarded arrows

  he redoubled his caution now stopping
now and then for minutes at a time to
listen to the sounds of the jungle he
was forced to go slower too for the
journey was telling on inez again

  and then at midday creeping around


all-story weekly

a ledge of rock they came face to face
with a native botello held his naked
blade in his hand for he had been cutting
vines with it and at sight of the native
he stopped and thrust inez behind him
the next instant he was smiling and
holding up his left hand in the peace sign
for the native was one he had met before
a man friendly to de balboa and his fol-
lowers

  but there came no answer to the sign
instantly the native crouched and an
arrow sped past botellos head he
called out then thinking the man had
been taken by surprise and had not rec-
ognized him but to his wonder the
native fitted arrow to bow again

  botello moved without hesitation now
for he realized that the man was hostile
purposely again he dodged an arrow
and then he was upon the native and his
rapier darted forward and back and at
his feet twisted and twitched that which
had been a man looking around he saw
that inez had turned away unable to
endure the sight of violence and death
and now he went back and led her into
the jungle and away from the rushing
creek so that she would not have to look
upon the corpse

  they did not speak of the matter as
they circled through the dense under-
growth but it gave botello ample food
for thought he knew that he had been
recognized yet attacked for all that and
he wondered what significance there might
be in the fact that the friendly indian
had turned against him

  now he found other traces of human
beings and as the day neared an end he
went deeper into the jungle until he found
a place of comparative security and there
he planned a retreat for the night they
had raw food and berries for they dared
build no fire

  and this night as the exhausted inez
slept botello sat beside her looking into
the blackness listening intently feeling
that there were enemies near

  to dodge a determined pursuit was
enough were the natives suddenly turned

hostile he found himself in a serious pre-
dicament for he had been depending upon
friendly indians to help him through
perhaps the hostility of the one he had
encountered accounted for taramas ab-
sence too he thought since all natives
knew tarama for a man who had attached
himself to the spaniards

  about the time of false dawn the brush
cracked before him and in an instant
botello was upon his feet his rapier held
ready scarcely daring to breathe for he
knew the noise was made by a human
he saw fronds of the ground palms
waving saw a giant creeper swung aside
the undergrowth swayed toward him and
with his back against the bole of a tree
botello waited feeling that an instant
later he would be fighting for his life
and that of his bride

  in the dim light he saw a ghostly
shape he heard a mans breath expelled
he heard the quick alarmed whisper of
inez behind him and knew she had
been awakened and was alert the brush
swayed again and snapped back striking
the face of the man who approached-
and then botellos ears caught a whis-
pered spanish oath

  now the blood raced madly through
botellos veins so it was not a native
then with whom he had to deal but a
white man-perhaps one of those pursuing
him if they were this close to his trail
there seemed to be little hope left

  in that instant botello saw a picture
of himself undergoing ignoble punish-
ment of inez being carried away from
him forever he gripped the hilt of his
rapier and made ready determined to
fight his best while fight remained in him
perchance this was some soldier who had
strayed from his fellows and could
botello but slay him before he gave an
alarm there might be a chance of escape

  then the other stepped into the tiny
clearing and caught sight of botellos
form and in the faint light they engaged
immediately the newcomer apparently
startled to find a man here and crossing
blade with him
the jungle trail



  thej fought furiously and not a word
did either speak which mystified botello
some lor he had expected the other to
call for help and bring up his comrades
he gave ground a little to gain better
footing and inez cried out thinking he
was being outfought

  her cry reminded him of many things
chief of which was that inez might find
herself in sorry straits were he vanquished
now and his conqueror proved to be a
renegade instead of honorable caballero
and he assaulted again with redoubled
fury

  back inez he hissed at her fear-
ing she would approach too close in that
faint light and receive a wound

  he sprang forward and then to his
wonderment his adversary darted to one
side and lowered the point of his blade

   botello you he screeched and
he seemed not to care if all the jungle
heard  put up your blade man
would you puncture the tough hide of
your best friend

  ruiz ruiz botello exclaimed in
answer  another instant and i would
have slain you

 mayhap-mayhap ruiz cried
 well settle that matter some other
time my friend when there are not
common enemies to be fought and we
need practise with the blade

  and then they were in each others
arms laughing together and even inez
found herself caught up from the ground
and given a bearlike hug by her husbands
friend

   i took you for a soldier ruiz ex-
plained  and would give no cry fearing
id bring your companions down upon
me

   i thought the same botello said
laughing still  but why should you
fear his excellencys soldiers good rod-
rigo

  hah why should i by the saints
there is ample reason i was not many
hours behind you in quitting antigua
his excellency deemed me too good a
friend of yours to be allowed liberty i

made certain remarks if i remember
rightly concerning his treatment of you
that gained for me a warning from his
excellencys lieutenant

   and you did not heed it eh

   st  spoke no more treason but
there was another matter after you
escaped the hut-and that has caused
some mystery in antigua my friend-
seiior garabito and the others returned
immediately to the plaza where pursuit
was organized and certain soldiers sent
forth this fine seiior garabito did get
in my path while i was walking with
swift stride i merely hurled him aside
and the imbecile saw fit to draw blade-
 you slew him rodrigo

   i always was tender in the heart i
but raked his ribs scarcely starting the
ruby flood yet he gave a cry that could
have been heard half-way to seville on
a calm night and immediately there was
a certain turmoil and bellowings from his
excellency-who happened to be in the
plaza-to seize upon my sacred person
wherefore i sought the depths of the
jungle

   iiah-

   a moment good bartolmeo-give me
breath despite my predicament i re-
mained in the vicinity of the plaza with
eyes open and ears uncorked came the
dawn and with it fray felipe it had
been supposed the good fray had sought
the depths of the jungle himself to escape
the governors wrath for having married
you yet here he was voluntarily seeking
audience with his excellency-and he
made talk until it was granted him

   while yet he was in the governors
house garabito rushed violently around
organizing a second pursuit saying he
would accompany it himself seemingly
in haste to be gone after you that is
the last i saw deeming it time to start on
my own journey

   i would have no trouble come to the
good fray for having aided me botello
said

  trust the fray good bartolmeo he
can care for himself in wilderness or


all-story weekly

palace forget the fray and give thanks
that i have overtaken you

   your arrival is excellent fortune
tarama is gone-left us to spy out the
land and did not return and i have met
a native once friendly who drew bow
against me and forced me to slay him
i was beginning to fear my friend-for
some of the natives may be hostile when
they find one man and one woman alone
and the pursuit must be near and the
journey is tedious for the lady

  l tedious ruiz exclaimed ll it is a
polite word you use say rather that
the journey is hades for the tender lady
-as no doubt it is but here are two
of us now my good bartolmeo and often
have we combined blades against foes
and always with success tis a com-
bination hard to overcome as for the
pursuit-mayhap it is far ahead of us
by now we have but to use a certain
amount of caution and urge forward
and for the love of the saints let us
be more than merry about it 

  he whispered that last sentence out
of one corner of his mouth and botello
caught its significance here was a
diversion a reason for allaying inezs
fears in part and he welcomed it

  it was growing light in the jungle now
and they built a tiny fire and broiled a
parrot and though they spoke always in
low tones yet their conversation was
lively and punctuated with hearty laugh-
ter

  while inez bound fresh leaves upon
her feet botello and ruiz walked aside
a short distance as if to get water to
carry with them and once more ruiz
spoke in a whisper

   i also met a native good bartolmeo
who in the past had been friendly to me
i was forced to slay him there are evil
whisperings in the jungle my friend that
i cannot understand we must make all
haste to the great south sea we face
a difficult time if we have to fight off a
pursuit and the natives too i had
thought that tarama of yours would
prove loyal

  i would have staked my life on it
botello replied  i cannot think he de-
serted purposely either he has been slain
else by some other means prevented from
returning to us and i am exceedingly
glad that you stand beside me now my
friend 

chapter viii

the symbol ol- the great cacique

that day there were no encounters
nor did they catch sight of human
being and the night they passed in
safety one of the men always on watch
and when the dawn came again they
started on through the jungle only now
they were high in the hills and starting
down the long slope that ended on the
shore of the great south sea

  again they saw trails made by natives
and crept through the dense undergrowth
as noiselessly as they could stopping
frequently to listen for minutes at a time
and so they reached the crest of a hill
and looked down upon a tiny green val-
ley through which wound a wide trail
like some great serpent

  to their ears now came the sounds
of shouting from natives throats hiding
in the undergrowth they watched scarce-
ly daring to breathe or to think what the
sounds might portend and then they
saw

  around a bend in the valley came a
group of natives some half a hundred
and in their midst strode senor pasqual
garabito his arms were not bound be-
hind him the natives did not crowd close
to his side there was no indication that
he was being held captive it looked
rather that he was being conducted in
all honor to a native camp

  a gasp from inez caused them to
glance at the bend again and then
despite the danger in it both botello and
ruiz cried out exclamations that might
have been heard at least fifty yards
away

  conducted as had been garabito with
the jungle trail



every evidence of honor came senor
bonilla and his fair daughter carlotta

   by the saints ruiz exclaimed
 what have we here garabitos pres-
ence needs no explanation but why do
senor bonilla and the haughty carlotta
endure the perils of the jungle trail
and why are they not attacked a single
native attacks a white man and a woman
yet two score of them fear to handle one
woman and two men

   perhaps it is discretion on the part
of the natives my good friend botello
replied  no doubt his excellencys sol-
diers are in the immediate neighborhood
it would be native wile to greet these
with acclaim and slay them later as they
slept

   this thing needs some investigation
ruiz said  do you remain here in
hiding and protect the senora while 
go forward and use my eyes

  he slipped away before botello could
leply and for some time the latter and
his bride watched the valley below the
two men the woman and the native es-
cort passed from view around another
bend the cries of the indians died away
in the distance-and ruiz returned

   it is as you said he announced

	his excellencys soldiers are in the
neighborhood

   then we risk capture

   not so my friend those of his
excellencys soldiers  set eyes upon will
capture nothing in this world they are
dead

   dead botello and inez cried in a
breath

   five of them- know the fellows and
recognized them as having been in the
first squad sent in pursuit of you they
are scarce a quarter of a mile away be-
side a well-marked trail from the back
of each sticks an arrow they have been
dead at least two days

   natives slay white men in force
botello asked scarcely giving the news
credit  what is the meaning of that
good ruiz

   the meaning is a mystery i take

it ruiz replied conveying to botello in
a glance the fact that he did not wish
to speak fully in the presence of inez

   and garabito-bonilla

  ruiz shrugged his shoulders indicating
that he possessed no knowledge regarding
what was to become of them and cared
little

    but the seiiorita inez asked in a low
tone

   hah there is your mystery ruiz
said  why does the dainty seiiorita
carlotta endure the perils and hardships
of the jungle trail she has no love for
a new-gotten husband to urge her on no
escape from his excellencys wrath to
make it must be a dire extremity to
bring her here

   yet we cannot stand idly by and
see them slain botello said almost in
a whisper l must we face danger at
this juncture in an attempt to rescue
those who have been our enemies-

   what would you do ruiz asked

   were we alone good rodrigo id
suggest we slip upon the encampment
and ascertain the truth of things may-
hap a rescue in the dead of night-did
they survive that long-

  ruiz shook his head and glanced to-
ward inez but he did not take into
consideration some of the excellent quali-
ties that botellos bride possessed

   am i to allow my presence in your
company to send three persons to death
she demanded  senor garabito is not
a proper man yet he is of white blood
and senor bonilla is old

   and the sehorita though in her char-
acter are empty places that should be
filled is after all a sehorita and entitled
to escape these savages botello put in

   then we attempt a rescue ruiz
asked

   perchance a rescue is not needed
those natives appeared overfriendly to
the three botello answered  but we
must make sure at least we can ap-
proach the native encampment and in-
vestigate by using all the caution we
possess we may get close enough to seek


all-story weekly

solutions of those things which now
mystify us

  yet they made slow progress when
once they had started for it was neces-
sary to make a detour and so evade the
trails that led to the native village they
kept as near the crest of the hill as pos-
sible and after a time reached a point
directly above the encampment

  botello knew that village it was per-
manent yet small and now there were
thrice the usual number of natives about
it and new huts had been erected there
seemed a scarcity of women and children
but warriors strutted across the open
spaces or engaged in feats of strength
or howled to one another from the fringe
of the jungle

   this looks like trouble ruiz ob-
served and even as he spoke trouble
descended upon them

  there came a shout from their rear a
chorus of shrieks the rushing of half a
score of arrows over their heads botello
and ruiz whirled to find twenty warriors
bearing down upon them through the
undergrowth and to either side were
more and in front was only the precipice
where a man could not descend

  it was a time for action rather than
words with one arm botello swept his
bride to one side and down between two
huge boulders where the arrows could
not strike her then he and ruiz stood
side by side before her their backs to
the rocks and prepared to withstand the
assault

  no more arrows flew a chieftain
shouted orders they could not understand
and the warriors dropping their weapons
rushed in

   they mean to take us alive ruiz
gasped  here is another mystery my
friend

  and then he ceased his talk for a time
and swept his rapier before him even
as botello was doing and drew it back
red to send it forward again like the
tongues of snakes the two blades darted
here and there always thrusting home
shrieks of pain and fear came from sav-

age throats and again the chieftain bel-
lowed his orders and again his mer
rushed

  there was no way to approach save
from the front and no way of doing that
except by running risk of getting a blade
between ribs some of them fenced with
spears trying to ward off the rapiers but
making no attempt to thrust

  hah ruiz shrieked attack hu-
man beings will you dogs hah by
the saints i perspire-it is hot work
have you lost count my friend i have
by the saints where did all these curs
grow to maturity is the new world
so large hah

   ware the left botello shrieked

   thanks for your caution good friend
-i have run the scoundrel through by
his decorations he is a big man of his
tribe hah-infidel dogs

  they retreated again they rushed
now botello and ruiz found their foes
pouring in upon them so fast that rapiers
could not be withdrawn from bodies in
time to meet the next comers in a
smother of naked natives they went down
their blades hurled aside their poniards
biting deep into flesh and bone on the
ground they struggled voiceless now
stabbing and slashing trying to prevent
the natives binding them

  but such a state of affairs could not
endure for long against the side of
botellos head a club crashed and the
darkness came to him just as he heard
ruiz give a choking gasp and inez cry
out in despair

  he regained consciousness to find that
his arms had been bound behind him with
tough vines and strips of skin half a
score of paces away ruiz was sitting on
the ground also bound inez was stand-
ing between them her hands fastened
before her and the natives were seem-
ingly giving her scant attention

   we live good friend ruiz called
 had you not put up such a tough com-
bat youd have escaped that knock on
the side of your skull this is indeed a
mysterious happening when natives get
the jungle trail



white men down and fail to run them
through we must have been saved for
some greater honor

  botello read the meaning between his
friends words and his face blanched he
remembered how the savages had tortured
certain of de balboas followers who had
been caught in the jungle alone tarama
had explained to him that the natives had
a wholesome fear of the spaniards yet
took vengeance when they found one or
two who could be overcome and now
did botello determine to slay his bride
with his own hands if given the oppor-
tunity before he would allow her to be
prisoner of these savages held for tor-
ture or to grace some caciques hut

  there was scant time now for thinking
of these things for he felt himself lifted
bodily and placed upon his feet and saw
that ruiz was being treated in similar
fashion tall natives grasped their arms
and urged them forward inez between
them they did not touch her as long
as she went where they directed and
even allowed her to walk close by botellos
side

   this may be the end beloved he
whispered  it were cruel to lead you
from antigua to the jungle to meet a
tragic fate

   the end of hope is not yet she
said

   you do not understand-

    know all you would say my bar-
tolmeo if it proves necessary inez
your wife will know what to do and will
not be afraid

  they were descending the side of the
hill now a difficult task with hands tied
and the warriors assisted all three

   such solicitude overwhelms me ruiz
said  they are passing kind

  he lurched against one of the natives
and sent him spinning down the slope
but there came no reprisal a half-wit
could have told that these savages were
acting under orders not to slay

  then they reached a broad trail that
wound down the valley and now- faster
time could be made soon they were

within sight of the encampment and a
runner went ahead to give notice of their
coming from the distance came shouts
and shrieks as he delivered his message
what women and children remained inthe
village crowded forward to leer at these
white captives and especially at the white
woman this was a day of wonders for
them-two white women had they seen
and never before had they set eyes upon
one

  in the center of the village was the big
hut of the cacique a building of vines
and mud and logs more than fifty feet
square their captors stopped them be-
fore the door and one went inside pres-
ently he returned and indicated that the
prisoners were to be taken within

  ruiz went first and then inez and
botello was last two giantlike warriors
gripping him by the arms the interior
was stilling with smoke and dust and
coming from the bright sunshine a man
scarcely could see botello blinked his
eyes rapidly to accustom them to the dim
light he heard ruiz give an exclama-
tion and looked up over inezs shoulder

  on a raised dais sat the cacique frown-
ing down upon the prisoners beside him
sat pasqual garabito an honored guest
on the other side was seiior bonilla and
behind him his daughter and these were
the three botello and ruiz had feared
they would have to rescue

   this is the woman the cacique was
asking

   si garabito responded

   but there are two men seiior which
is your enemy

   the taller garabito replied  say
rather that he is your enemy noble one
iis as i said-if he escapes all plans
fail already he has done much to op-
pose us the other man is his close com-
panion and it would serve your purpose
best to slay both of them at once

  inez gave a little cry at that and
botello took a step nearer her and the
frowning cacique looked down at her ter-
rified face

   and the woman the cacique asked


all-story weekly

   i shall deal with the woman gara-
bito said meaningly

  now botello and ruiz both snarled
their rage and inez recoiled a little so
that the native guards stepped closer to
prevent any attempt at violence

   what is tne meaning of this senor
garabito botello demanded  you
league yourself with natives eh to gain
your ends you seek aid from any and all
instead of fighting your own battles as a
man should you consort with savages
and make war on women-

   silence him garabito cried and the
warriors moved closer  as for you
senor botello he went on  here ends
your opposition to me i am master
here

  l you master here ruiz cried

  	i have said it senor

   the native maid you wronged must
have been the daughter of a cacique
have you wedded her and been adopted
into a tribe

  silence garabito snarled that
remark will gain a minute more of tor-
ture for you senor i know how to at-
tend to my enemies i have said i am
master here senor botellos quarrel with
me and his subsequent flight precipi-
tated matters some had it not been for
that and the meddling of that fool of an
old fray felipe youd not have died for
half a moon yet-and then youd have
gone to the world beyond together with
all other whites in darien save for senor
bonilla his daughter and myself you
have disrupted my plans somewhat but
you die the sooner because of it

   is this treason ruiz thundered

   hali garabito laughed  no con-
spiracy is called treason unless it fails
senor and this will not fail

   you-his excellencys friend-

   friend only to serve my own pur-
poses senor think you for any other rea-
son id be friend to such an ignorant toad
his excellency and his followers soon will
pay the price for misrule tis a pretty
scheme wherein those who have oppressed
the natives die both in antigua and in

de balboas camp we save a few sail-
ors who are in league with us we get
a cargo of gold and precious stones for
delivering these good natives from the
yoke of the spaniards we take the one
ship now in the harbor at antigua and
sail away-

  u hah and when you get to seville
 merely a little tale of a native up-
rising and we were the only ones to
escape such a tale as will make us
heroes-you perceive senor is it not
a pretty plot

   such a one as id expect from you
cried botello  and you-cacique are
you an imbecile that you let this man
fool you so you have met the span-
iards before eh think you that you
can win can you not see that this man
uses you to further his own designs
hah  marvel at your stupidity

   the senor fails to understand re-
plied the cacique slowly for he was
not quick with the white mans speech
 this plan is so broad it cannot fail we
no longer fear de balboa on the one side
or the governor on the other our good
friend the senor here has shown us how
to accomplish our ends

   and your good friend the senor there
never has been into the jungle before as
i happen to know

   he has dealt with us through natives
that could be trusted

   and does the head cacique of the
great wilderness approve of your plans
botello demanded  he is a friend of the
intrepid de balboa dare you make
attack on the spaniards without the great
caciques sanction will he not punish
you and your tribesmen with death
the cacique showed some nervousness
at that and garabito opened mouth to
reply but the native chieftain got out
his words first

   our friend the senor here has ob-
tained the sanction of the great cacique
he said

   he brought you a token i suppose
the great cacique comes with his men
to aid you botello persisted
the jungle trail



   the token even now is on its way
by a trusted messenger the seiior informs
me we do not need the aid of the great
caciques men in this undertaking if
we have need of more warriors then he
will furnish them

   you are taking this seiior garabito
on faith cacique mayhap he has made
fools of your messengers and but leads
you into a trap

  let this nonsense end garabito
thundered  cacique have these two
men slain and the woman taken to my
hut seiior botello it is fitting you die a
lingering death for the troubles you have
caused us your determination to claim
a lady as bride aroused fray felipe who
knew some things of this conspiracy
straightway toward his excellency hur-
ried the fray wherefore i was forced to
hasten into the jungle with seiior bonilla
and his daughter else even now the three
of us would be hanging by our necks
you should pay for our discomforts

  i warn you cacique botello cried
ignoring garabito  harm us not until
you are certain of the truth if you dis-
please the great cacique-

  the chieftain bellowed an order and
the big and dirty hand of a warrior
stifled botellos words in his throat an-
other order and botello and ruiz were
forcibly conducted into the open air inez
being led after them just outside the
door they were halted and out of the hut
streamed the natives the cacique walk-
ing between garabito and bonilla and
the seiiorita carlotta keeping a little in
the background as one who dreads what
is to come

  now the cacique looked at his prison-
ers again and garabito stepped close and
whispered in his ear

   let it be as the seiior wishes the
cacique said then  the two men shall
be sent to the stake and the woman
forced to watch after that take the
woman to the hut of the seiior garabito
the warriors who grasped botello and
ruiz by their arms now forced them
backward and started to lead them away

but inez broke from those who held her
and went down on her knees to the
cacique holding up her hands in suppli-
cation beside herself with fear for her
husband and dread of her own future

   cacique cacique she cried  be-
ware what you do beware how you
obey the orders of the man who stands
beside you

  the cacique looked down at her-at
her tear-stained face her extended arms
something on one of those thorn-
scratched arms caught and reflected the
light of the sun the cacique took a
quick step forward and looked closer
and grasped her by a wrist botello
snarled as the savage touched his bride
and tried to get forward but his captors
held him back yet there was no need
for his alarm

  look-look the cacique was cry-
ing to a lesser chieftain who stood behind
him

  he held inezs arm in a viselike grip
the fingers of his other hand grasped at
the bracelet botello had given her before
their marriage the love token inez had
used in her rebuke of carlotta bonilla
that day in the plaza at antigua

  look he cried again it is a
token-it is the symbol of the great
cacique 

  and in that instant botello remem-
bered that indeed it was and had been
given him on a day a year or more before
by the great cacique himself as a mark
of favor he had not thought at the
time that there was special significance
in the gift nor was he sure of it now yet
his heart sang because the cacique be-
lieved it to be so

  i warned you cacique he cried
now and he stood straight and looked
the chieftain in the eyes  lead us on
to death if you think it well-your own
punishment will be the greater

  the bewildered cacique looked at the
bracelet again the bauble of gold that
bore in scratchings a mystic symbol he
lifted inez to her feet and with his own
hands removed her bonds he cried an

order and women came running and
were told to get fresh clothing for the
seiiora and food-anything she desired
 what do you garabito thundered
 as to the men i am not sure the
cacique replied  but as to this woman
she bears the symbol of the great
cacique and hence must be under his
protection in this village she receives
naught but respect and honor you have
no word to say now regarding her seiior
she has been treated too cruelly already
 it is a trick garabito stormed

   i am not sure the cacique replied
 at least we honor her until we have
word from the great cacique that it is a
trick i am not mistrusting you senor
garabito and neither am i allowing a
woman who wears the great caciques
sign to be molested or slaying men who
may possess his friendship

   you would release these spaniards
garabito cried

   xo nor slay them now senor we
shall hold them as prisoners until we are
certain of all things

  now hope was born anew in botellos
heart and in the hearts of ruiz and inez
for dead men are but dead men-but
prisoners always have the chance of
escape

chapter ix

carlotta speaks

their prison hut was a poor one
especially for two men and a wo-
man who might be friends of the
great cacique but inez had insisted that
she be placed with the other two and the
chieftain was anxious to do as she de-
sired this was the only vacant hut that
would serve and inez had accepted it
the cacique making long apologies be-
cause it was not better

  it was no more than ten feet square
its walls were constructed of mud and
rocks and vines and had been baked
long in the tropic sun hence were almost
as granite there were no windows but

there was an aperture in the top to allow
the escape of foul air and smoke and
there was a low narrow door the dirt
floor was filthy but the cacique had skins
and palm fronds scattered upon it and
if the hut was poor the service was not
for the chieftain made up in food and
supplies what he lacked in residence

  in the hut they sat as the quick tropi-
cal night descended inez and botello side
by side and ruiz across from them and
ate the food the cacique had furnished
before the door two native guards were
on watch

   it could have been far more serious
botello said  yet it is bad enough as it
is we live but are close prisoners the
chieftain no doubt already has sent run-
ners to the great cacique and in a short
time he will learn we have no right to su-
perior protection then will our end
come in short order

   wherefore said ruiz it behooves
us to make escape at the earliest possible
moment and continue our journey to the
camp of de balboa

  i our duty lies in more directions than
one botello reminded him  we must
escape to save life-si we must escape
also to give the warning of this uprising
else renegades triumph and good span-
iards die this hut stands in the center
of a large clearing thirty feet from the
door is a roaring fire before that door
are two sturdy native guards we can-
not burrow through the walls and there
are no windows we have neither rapier
nor poniard the fine senor garabito
also watches to see we do not escape and
also for a chance to poison us had he the
courage and the means it may be called
a predicament

    we live ruiz reminded him  vio-
lence will avail us naught here and now
especially since we have no weapons with
which to practise it but wit and strategy
remain thank the saints

  botello drew inez closer to him and
touched with his lips the bauble of gold
that had gained them respite

   and we have love also and incen-
the jungle trail



tive therefore to make good our escape
he said softly

   having seen true wedded love these
last two days i have decided to get me a
wife if ever i escape this entanglement
ruiz said laughing were there a
younger seiiorita malpartida as beautiful
and good as this one you have won my
friend-

  he laughed at the blushes that suffused
inezs face and got up to walk to the
open doorway and look out at the guards
a torch burned in one corner of the hut
and they made no effort to extinguish it
for darkness would avail them nothing
now and might cause their guards to be
suspicious and moreover the light from
the big fire streamed into the room

  they might have whispered certain
plans then and taken counsel but there
came an interruption two figures ap-
proached across the clearing and one of
the guards went forward to meet them
there was a parley and the guard re-
turned with the other two one-a na-
tive warrior - remained standing a few
feet away the other approached and
stood in the doorway

  botello got to his feet and helped inez
up also for he did not know what the ar-
rival of this stranger might portend a
long robe of woven grass was thrown
aside and the firelight played over the
features of seiiorita carlotta bonilla

  for a moment none spoke and then
ruiz took a step forward as if to inquire
her business but stopped when he heard
botellos voice

   so you have come to gloat seiiorita
he asked  i would be charitable to a
lady yet you make it difficult

   no doubt senor replied a tremu-
lous voice  i merit your ill thoughts i
merit no doubt the ill thoughts of every
honest and loyal man and woman hear
me i beg of you before you speak fur-
ther

    we are listening sehorita botello
said inez drew closer to his side not
speaking at all and ruiz leaned against
the opposite wall but when she spoke

it was in a low tone that the native guards
could not overhear and so ruiz ap-
proached nearer

  t i have come to help as i may she
said  wait sehor-do not turn away
what i have done may not be forgiven
by loyal persons yet perchance there will
be forgiveness elsewhere in time i am
glad that by a subterfuge you have been
spared for the present i doubt whether
you can make escape but if you should
there are certain things you should
know

  she stopped but none of them spoke
merely stood looking at her and waiting
for her to continue

   you are making it difficult she said
 but i merit that too i suppose mes-
sengers have gone to the great cacique
and when they return with denial of your
protection the chieftains first intent will
be carried out whether senor garabito
really has the sanction of the great
cacique on his enterprise i do not know
perchance he has - and perchance not
but this local chieftain will not wait for
that fearing all his plans will go amiss
 what then ruiz demanded

   because garabito has told him those
at antigua know of the conspiracy the
chieftain has decided to visit de balboas
camp first the natives will catch de
balboas scattered men off guard and slay
them all then they may turn toward
antigua and fight the governors forces
knowing that de balboa cannot attack
them in the rear they will avoid being
between two fires

  hah botello cried  de balboa
and his brave men-my comrades-hon-
orable caballeros to be slaughtered be-
cause of a renegade

   listen sehor and do not interrupt
for i have scant time here the cacique
allowed me to come since i told him it
would be proper to show such a courtesy
to a sehora who wore the great caciques
symbol he will be suspicious if i linger
long

   proceed sehorita

   the plans are made the natives


all-story weekly

start for de balboas camp at dawn un-
less the men on the shore of the great
south sea are warned nothing can save
them were they warned they could pre-
pare and make good defense

   what of us ruiz asked

   at dawn you are to be taken deep
into the jungle to a secluded place and
there kept under close guard until the
chieftain returns from the raid on de
balboa by that time messengers will
have returned from the great cacique
and disposition will be made of you there
i can tell you this yet i cannot aid you
to escape

    you would were it possible botello
asked

   si senor  she responded  i re-
gret many things i have done i do not
regret what love i had for you but that
it made me do unmaidc-nly things i re-
gret what animosity i had for the woman
you have taken to wife most of all i
regret that i turned traitor with others
 why these regrets now senorita 
botello asked scarcely believing in her
sincerity

   in antigua my thoughts were
wrong she said  my mode of living
was wrong i have been my fathers
daughter and he always is in the midst
of intrigue i looked forward to riches
and place i did not think seiior of how
they would be gained of how men would
die out here in the wilderness things
appear differently somehow i realize
here senor with what sort of persons i
am allied can you not understand am
i the first woman whose real soul did not
awaken to better things until after she
had been lost forever

   senorita i am sorrowful that it is
so botello said  tf now you are
speaking truth-

  inez stopped him for she went for-
ward now and put out her hand wo-
manlike she could read woman better
than a man

   i believe you seiiorita she said
 we are in dire extremity here yet i
would not change places with you may

the future hold something of good for
you and yours

   and you forgive me my words and
acts senorita carlotta asked of botello

   against me and mine seiiorita i
cannot forgive you that you turned your
back upon your king that is the un-
pardonable sin

   you are a soldier-hence i under-
stand she replied softly  yet it is
good to be forgiven some things escape
if you can my good wishes go with you
escape and warn de balboa and his
men

   and you- inez asked

   i remain with my father to the end
i am as guilty as he is seiiora i know
now that failure is coming the good
saints would not let such an enterprise
succeed the pride born in my blood has
recalled me to honesty too late per-
chance but it will at least teach me to be
brave when all is lost there will be no
escape carlotta bonilla did not know
how to live-she will know how to die
seiiorita i beg of you- ruiz began
but she had wrapped the robe around
her and hurried from the hut they saw
her join the native and walk back across
the clearing her head bent on her breast

chapter x

in paradise

now it was black midnight without
moon the torch glowed feebly
the fire in the clearing had been re-
kindled and its light flooded the hut
botello and ruiz spoke in whispers while
inez silting between them listened

   escape we must ruiz said  warn
de balboa we must were we free now
wed have but a few hours start of them
 but how- botello asked

   here is where wit and strategy come
in good friend i have studied natives
somewhat they are curious individuals
do you stand at one side of the door
good bartolmeo and be ready to do your
part at the proper time
the jungle trail



  botello stood at one side of the door
ruiz went to the doorway and looked
out one of the native guards was asleep
the other paced back and forth ten feet
away

  down upon his knees in the dirt of the
doorway went ruiz and his hand fum-
bled at his belt the guard stopped pac-
ing to watch ruiz removed his hand
chuckled-and two dice fell at his feet

  now he bent forward paying no atten-
tion to the guard and cast the dice he
chuckled again picked them up cast
again the guard walked closer and bo-
tello kept to the shadows the light of
the fire showed the guard that here was
an insane spaniard playing with some-
thing the like of which the native never
had seen before perchance it was bad
medicine the spaniard was making per-
haps kneeling in the dirt and hurling lit-
tle white cubes and chuckling was a re-
ligious rite an invocation to the span-
iards gods to assist him and deliver him
from the heathen

  the guard stepped nearer and voiced
guttural phrases but ruiz did not even
look up at him he cast the dice again
stretched forward and regarded them
gravely then he chuckled once more
this time in an excited manner and for
the first time looked up at the guard and
then pointed down at the dice

  the guard bent over to see and bo-
tello sprang

  long before botello had guessed ruizs
plan and when he sprang his hands
clasped the natives throat and pressed
with all their strength and his knee went
into the small of the savages back and
remained there a wrench and the guard
was inside the hut another moment of
choking and he was unconscious bo-
tello took his spear and stone knife

   quickly my friend ruiz whis-
pered

  he grasped inez by the hand with
ruiz in the lead they sprang from the
hut into the bright light of the clearing
there was quick action now as botello
dashed with inez to the edge of the jun-

gle ruiz caught the spear from his hand
he ran to the sleeping guard and thrust
the weapon home taking his spear

  it was less than a hundred feet to the
blackness of the jungles edge yet it
seemed leagues to the fugitives every
second they expected an uproar behind
them swift pursuit breathlessly they
ran over the rough ground stumbling
over roots and creepers ready for quick
work if they encountered a native senti-
nel on and on-and then the refuge of
the blackness was reached

  there was no time now to move forward
with caution and keep far from the trails
botello and ruiz shielded inez between
them as they fought the undergrowth
and presently they came to the main jun-
gle trail and hurried along it the trail
was narrow overgrown in places-it was
a continual struggle to keep in it and
make progress in time they reached the
crest of a slope and paused for a moment
to look back in the distance was the re-
flection of the fire and it seemed they
could hear savage shouts

  nor was there any sparing of inez
now de balboa was to be saved and
none could be spared in the saving when
the dawn came they had gone some dis-
tance yet not so much that they felt sat-
isfaction there always was danger of
meeting hostile natives and the band
behind them they knew would make
such speed through country familiar to
them that they would gain rapidly

  so on they went through the morning
not stopping to rest or eat drinking water
from their gourds when they must the
perspiration streaming from them hands
and faces scratched by thorns and rough
brush feet sore and weary at times bo-
tello carried inez in his arms and at
times he let ruiz carry her at the top
of every hill they looked behind as far as
possible searching for signs that would
tell them a large body of men was passing
through the jungle

   perchance they have not sent runners
out after us ruiz said  they may
think we went toward antigua


all-story weekly

   garabito would know better than
that replied botello

   then they would not believe we
would keep to the trail theyd think
we penetrated the jungle to hide

   yet once on the trail they will make
all speed possible they must strike de
balboa the cacique knows before the en-
thusiasm of his savages dies

  now they struck a stretch of bad coun-
try where the trail scarcely could be fol-
lowed through it they toiled carrying
inez half the time and by mid-afternoon
they reached the crest of another slope
there they paused to rest and to look
backward again

   dios ruiz cried

  a mile behind them the jungle grass
waved as if driven by a hurricane and
there was not a breath of wind the
sun flashed from the tips of spears the
grass ripples ran forward toward the slope
-here and there natives appeared lead-
ing the tribe spying out the land

   they must have traveled like the
wind ruiz said

   and so must we

  even as he spoke botello picked inez
up again and ran down the slope be-
fore them was a narrow valley almost
free of tropical growth and beyond that
was another hill where the dense jungle
began again to reach the side of the
hill was their endeavor and there to bear
away to one side and seek a hiding-place
it seemed impossible for them to main-
tain the lead of the savages and reach
de balboa in time to warn him at least
they had tried-it was honorable to think
only of saving themselves now

  the bare valley was half a mile wide
and they rushed across it as speedily as
possible breathing in gasps their hearts
pounding at their ribs before they
reached the jungles edge they heard a
chorus of cries behind them and look-
ing backward saw that they had been
observed there seemed but a small
chance of escape now yet there was some
hope left once in that dense under-
growth they could turn either to right

or left and there were a multitude of
places where three could hide

  they reached the protecting growth
and there they paused a moment to
glance behind they saw the tribesmen
gathering in the valley saw them stop
and collect in groups and then begin to
maneuver

   what means that botello ex-
claimed

  the answer came from the other direc-
tion-came from half a thousand savage
throats-and down the side of the hill
through the brush came painted warriors
rank upon rank

  we are trapped ruiz cried i
know those tall fellows good bartolmeo
they are the great caciques men they
are here to form junction with these oth-
ers and aid in exterminating de balboa
we are done comrade-we are between
the two forces we can but die like
men

  again they stood with backs against a
rock and inez crouching at their feet be-
hind them nearer and nearer the great
caciques men approached and those in
the valley held their positions the junc-
ture of the two forces was to be made
there in the open they supposed spears
in hand they stood ready to sell their
lives as dearly as the god of battle willed
they had exchanged glances regarding
inez and that was enough - she would
not be left to grace the hut of a cacique

  the great caciques first line of war-
riors was within fifty yards now botello
glanced around again but there seemed
no way to escape to a hiding-place

  the brush to one side cracked-they
whirled with spears uplifted the head
of a native appeared a gasp sounded

  master master a voice called

  the native fell at botellos feet it was
tarama

  to see you again-and the sehora-
and your friend he cried you did
not think ill of me master i did what
i thought was best-as you had instruct-
ed me to do
the jungle trail



   tamara what mean you botello
demanded with all trust in the native
though ruiz held spear ready  quick
you have scant time to tell your story
perchance you can die with us as be-
comes a brave man

   die master you are safe-do you
not understand

   speak-speak

   when i left you i was taken captive
master i heard then of a conspiracy
it was two days before i could escape
and then i knew you would have con-
tinued your journey and what had you
told me often master you had said a
good soldier thinks always of the great
majority had you not that the army
the kings cause came before relatives or
friends or even life so i carried the
warning master-

   the warning- botello cried

   first to the great cacique who is
friendly with de balboa he knew
naught of the conspiracy and sent his
warriors to punish these other tribesmen
and stop it and then i hurried on to
the camp on the great south sea hence
the great caciques warriors have come
in time to save you

   hah and if they had not-

   yet would you have been saved mas-
ter mine for-look to the right master
what see you there has tamara done
well

  and then the cry of botello rang out
so that it could be heard by the savages
in the valley below and the cry of ruiz
echoed his and inez clapped her hands
for sudden gladness thinking of no other
immediate way to express it

  for to the right the sun tried hard to
glisten from the tarnished breastplates of
good men of spain caballeros in tatters
and rags but with blades clean and sharp
and at their head strode one like a king
who threw wide his arms in greeting and
smiled beneath his great mustache at sight
of bartolmeo botello

   hah comrade thrice welcome
and what is it i hear told of how you
stole a bride

  then the great de balboa held a
laughing sobbing begrimed and weary
caballero in his strong arms

  a sunset of red and gold

  bartolmeo botello stood beneath a
giant palm inez clasped in his arms be-
low them were the scattered huts of de
balboas men and his ship-yard on the
shore of the rio sabanas where it flowed
into the great south sea the leader had
found in the distance that sea gleamed
in the dying sun

   it was my wish to be here at this
time beloved botello said in a low
voice  i was spared the killing of him
yet once he was an honorable caballero
and i could not watch him swing on the
gallows even for treason

  he stooped and touched her lips with
his glad to see that the smiles and dim-
ples already were coming back into the
face he loved so well three days had
they been in de balboas camp and al-
ready she was beloved of all

  and when he raised his head again he
saw a man toiling up the slope toward
him botello bent forward and shaded
his eyes against the dying sun

  tis felipe- he cried tis fray
felipe beloved now is my cup of hap-
piness full

  the fray raised his hands in blessing

   i am glad my son that you have
been spared together with your bride and
your friend he said  honorable men
generally win through i find i have but
come from listening to the pleadings of a
dishonorable one for mercy in the wil-
derness i found the bodies of senor bo-
nilla and his daughter-suicides such
is the end of treason the governor sent
me out to stay this uprising since i have
some small influence with the natives i
have worked hard first with the tribes
near to antigua and so was delayed
reaching the great south sea i was
overjoyed when they told me you were
here and made haste to greet you for
i bear messages-


all-story weekly

   messages botello asked

   two senor one is from his excel-
lency who bids me tell you he will wel-
come you royally to antigua his one
regret he says is that you did not slay
senor garabito when you had your little
duel the other is from an old man
senor malpartida  tell my daughter
and my new son that my arms are open
and awaiting them he said  i wait the
day of their return 

  fray felipe was making his way slowly
back down the hill the dusk was deep-
ening on the bank of the river a fire
had been lighted

the

  it seems we have been in peril for an
age beloved botello said

  he looked down upon the mean huts
at the neighboring swamp at the dense
jungle dank and dirty it looked after
seville - even after antigua but he
knew brave and loyal hearts were there
though the buildings were but huts with
floors of earth and food was not of the
best and there was small comfort for
either man or tender woman dirty and
dank it looked and yet-

   xow we are in paradise he affirmed
and clasped his bride to him again

  which shows that everything depends
upon the view-point after all

i have always worshiped courage i
   possess it myself i am a waiter

      it takes courage to become a wait-
er i can see you raising superficial eye-
brows and in that very fact lies one of
the compensations of my vocation for
having waited consistently enough to
climb into the more polite circles  know
offhand the definition of  superficial
whereas you may have to look in the dic-
tionary for it

  pardon this digression inspired by a
passing thought of many men t help daily
into their coats who know less than 

the knowledge of this fact  am obliged
by the ethics of my profession to stu-
diously conceal from them herein lies
proof that it takes courage to remain a
waiter after becoming one my tongue
is locked i can only look my superiority
to such patrons

  such men probably regard us as hard-
ly human i mean the men who snap
 here to me and growl  check at
the close of their gorging but if their
brains had attained to the dignity of
thinking they could not but emulate me
in the acquirement of culture this if
it meets no better purpose may at least
serve as a cloak for ignorance for mark
courage



me i treat these fellows as if they were
human

  i have always worshiped courage even
as a boy in my teens in the little up-
state village i haunted the public li-
brary i devoured the  lives  of na-
poleon of wellington and of andrew
jackson i read and reread carlyle on
i heroes and piero worship and wept
over the pulsing pages of stephen cranes
deathless  red badge of courage

 with contemporaneous events i was
also in sympathy i thrilled in reading
of theodore roosevelts charge up san
juan hill to my reverent and idealistic
eyes the eyes of youth in the dawn a
rough rider hat was a sort of first cousin
to the flag when the news came of
deweys victory at manila i remember
that i went behind the house and stood
on my head for two consecutive minutes
and in the act i felt a solemn exaltation
a welling patriotism born of the convic-
tion that somehow i was doing it for my
country

  nor was my vision restricted to the
examples of physical courage i read too
of those wonderful struggles through
which genius has ever passed to win rec-
ognition and i did mental obeisance to
this moral courage reveling in the ac-
counts of these men i fully recognized
the force of the poets lines

  the heights by great men reached and kept
   were not attained by sudden flight

  but they while their companions slept

were toiling upward through the night

  and thinking on these things my soul
invoking courage as an armor stretched
on tiptoe like a wistful dancer that much
closer to the stars

  so imagining dreaming studying i
grew toward manhood in the little town
just after i had graduated from the high
school my parents died and my future
maintenance was for my own solving in
this crisis the lorelei of cities seemed to
call me to fortune and to fame

  i arrived in new york with a bag and
a worn trunk the trunk contained some

     	a-s

modest water-colors done by my own
hand which sketches i had thought to
sell the trunk still contains them

  i shall never forget the chill which
froze the marrow at the words of the first
dealer to whom i offered the efforts
there was no second

  said he  young man you might pos-
sibly paint a fence but its a cinch you
would never be paid for the job

  it took courage not to believe him yet
this i contrived i retained faith in my-
self i still believe in those sketches
whether anybody would agree with me-
i am indifferent to that nobody has
ever seen them since that momentous
day and because i am busy with other
matters there is no need of disturbing
them

  i carried the sketches back to my
room and went out to think this was
a necessary function i had my clothes
of country make and five dollars only
these and nothing more

  suddenly i saw a sign in a restaurant
window  waiter wanted

  right then and there i proved for my
lifes span my title to the highest cour-
age within me there began a struggle
which wielded me strength to put aside
the dreams of my youth in that hour i
became a man

  i walked around the block several
times revolving the situation fusing my
forces to decide my problem could 
put away my beautiful dreams that lured
me to the peaks of life the way thereto
was one of struggle this i knew not
only did the books i had read accentuate
this fact but the unfeeling words of the
art-dealer who refused to see my genius
these further emphasized the grisly truth
many a man who was later recognized
as a power had early almost starved to
death in a garret

  but my plight if i followed the beck-
oning finger of the higher ambition
might be even worse it was evident
from the caustic words of the dealer that
it would be long before my incipient
mastership was discovered and in the


all-story weekly

interim i would be likely to quite starve
to death

  had  any right to consider what
amounted to a form of self-destruction
rather was it not my duty to take my
place if need be in an humbler niche in
the scheme bravely putting aside my
dreams and honestly and consistently
climbing in the lesser realm of effort

  i knew that i could satisfactorily per-
form the duties which fall to a waiter
i had always helped my mother with the
dishes and i had helped her wait on table
when there was company i had trained
a naturally retentive memory through
learning many poems also  spartacus to
the gladiators for mental profit and for
public recitation so i knew that i could
take a whole tableful of orders without a
slip in communicating them to the chcj

  so resolutely thrusting away the
dreams of sellish gain my spirit was girt
with courage for the subsequent service
of humanity i lifted my chin and en-
tering the restaurant applied for that
waiting job

  it had been taken while i was circling
the block making my momentous de-
cision

  but my will is adamant when roused
i had resolved to become a waiter i
walked till i found on the east side an-
other restaurant window bearing the sign
of  waiter wanted i obtained the job

  immediately i began a liberal educa-
tion in terms which in politer circles
since i have all but forgotten yet in
my memory they retain a certain dim
picturesqueness all pointing to the con-
stant metropolitan trend of saving syl-
lables  watch step and  le m out
howls the guard in the subway  com-
bination yelps the man in the white
jacket behind the lunch counter in which
four syllables he has saved four words
namely  ham and egg sandwich

  you will see therefore that i began
waiting at the bottom i studied my art
as had i elected to climb toward the
stars i would have studied painting or
music or sculpture and this is why i

have been for a dozen years now at one
of the best-known restaurants in manhat-
tan where patrons thank god have
never heard of the anti-tipping move-
ment this fact by the way allowing me
to exercise less concern over the high cost
of living than is felt by some of the pa-
trons

  through attention to business and to
thrift i have a pleasant home in yon-
kers to would-be humorists who in-
quire tritely  what are yonkers i
respond that they are a real home town
there my wife and children live in com-
fort that new yorkers would esteem lux-
ury my boy and girl are in high school
they will go later to yale and yassar
respectively

  i have also a bank-account of quite
respectable proportions i have for years
served several wealthy financiers they
have never yet given me anything but
straight tips

  i have spoken of my courage you
now know that i possess it yet in my
studies-through all these years of wait-
ing i have pursued them-i have noted
with infinite regret one fact books i
have studied and those far more vivid
documents men and i have sorrowed to
find that always with the reddest of
heroism there is inevitably mixed some-
thing of the orange of fear

  i frankly confess that i possess it my-
self i who had strength to put away my
dreams and forge to affluence in a menial
position and with me very subtly and
sneeringlv and mockingly it lies coiled
within my heart and sometimes in the
night it questions me asking

   would you dare to resign your post
to-morrow and walk as a free man into
the restaurant next day to be served by
others while you debated with yourself
what new start vou would make in the
world

  and i have to confess that so dear have
the fleshpots won by waiting grown to me
that i could not summon the courage to
do this

  therefore knowing so well mine own
courage



weakness i have not scorn but pity for
that of others recognizing the great hu-
man family for the divine mixture it is
of substance and bluff in equal portions
i have in fancy beheld the soul of man
as a double entity in which the siamese
twins of bravery and fear are always
wrestling and only that mystery which
we call circumstance can reveal the win-
ner

  so my eyes have been alert for that
fate which should reveal the man of gal-
lant seeming as a coward and the march
of the years had made me much of a
cynic until-

  and here after much of speaking of
myself-for which you must forgive me
since the practise of my profession is con-
ducive to the development of egoism-i
must get to my story one that will re-
main deathless in my memory for it
digs to the very roots of values and holds
them bared for the world to see

  all my life though knowing through
observation that the warp and woof of
truth and error are as weirdly mixed as
some of the cocktails which  serve to my
up-to-date patrons i had sought the per-
fect hero though without expecting to find
him

  he had come to my mind to be as
misty as splendidly nebulous as a super-
man that dream of the future that can
come only when mens destructive pas-
sions are chloroformed by right thinking
and a day of one hundred per cent con-
structive efficiency is possible

  vet having in the beginning laid aside
all my other dreams i had a right to this
one especially as it held nothing of self
seeking but only wistfully sought a rara
avis that would supply the brightest gem
in the crown of humanity

  so only last night there came to me in
quest a supernal exaltation and my spirit
lifted as if on wrings

  it was a little dinner given by a re-
turned war hero to five of his new york
friends the prospect brought to me no
preliminary tingling of the pulses yvher
the head-waiter assigned me to the pink

room and told me of the identity of the
diners  smiled a slight ironic smile

  these hero dinners were all alike
stuffy important old bluffers with
chests thrown out like those of physical-
culture teachers eager to exaggerate
their exploits in circumstances wherein
they had been lucky enough not to reveal
the fear that was in them i was so tired
of them naturally i looked for a repe-
tition of history

  but how different how refreshing how
welling was the pleasure that came to me
and to the others whom i served

  i	permitted myself a discreet stare of
amaze when i realized the hero in that
group was the youngest freshest-faced
most boyish of them all captain hugo
lynn son of a new york millionaire and
a member of the american flying squad-
ron of bjrdmen fighting for france had
been wounded in action and was home
on furlough he proposed to sail back
to france in a fortnight

  four of the guests at the table i gath-
ered were his club friends the fifth
was a french lieutenant a comrade of
his on the somme who had been wound-
ed at the same time lynn had received
his injuries lynn had persuaded him to
accompany him back to america till he
was fit for service again

  hugo lynn who still had but little use
of his left arm and hand had a fascinat-
ing personality blond with quiet blue
eyes and thick brown hair he possessed a
physique which clearly revealed why he
had been chosen by camp as all-ameri-
can football tackle for three years during
his university career this combined with
the perfect coordination of nerve and
muscle that was later to distinguish his
work in the air as on the gridiron

  his face-you have all seen it in the
newspapers but such cuts tell nothing
i who have seen it at close range can
sum it for you in a sentence his was a
face that men and women and little chil-
dren could trust and it was set against
hero worship

  now from the first of the little dinner


all-story weekly

i who have seen so many of them pro-
gress from bluepoints and cocktails to
cheese and crackers and liqueurs noted a
peculiar difference from previous func-
tions of the same character i learned
early from the conversation that his
friends had wished to give him the dinner
before his return and to invite many
others in order that they might laud him
upon this plan he had vigorously set his
foot and had instead tendered the din-
ner himself only inviting  the nearest
anti dearest and had taken this plan ex-
pressly to avoid the hero truckling which
his soul abhorred

  so when lieutenant francois darcy
his brother in arms forgot his vigorous
instructions prior to the event and
warmed by champagne started an enthu-
siastic description of the air battle which
had brought to lynn international fame
he was squelched with savage emphasis
by his host and when the others sought
from time to time to bring this stirring
episode into the conversation the cap-
tains manner became like that of a cave-
man

    dont talk shop he roared once his
right hand clenched in his masses of hair
and his blue eyes glaring as once they
glared into those of opposing linemen on
football fields  so help me if you fel-
lows dont shut up on that stuff theres
going to be a free-for-all lets talk
about the epworth league bryan-any-
thing but that

  and he guided the conversation into
new channels no that is not the proper
word he grabbed it by the neck
dragged it about a block and then kept
it there by main force his laugh rang
like a boy he talked of politics of
finance of golf he was so unlike the
usual hero smugly accepting homage
that i moved about my duties in deepen-
ing amaze and hungrily listening to the
conversation

  but at last a summons came for him to
the telephone-booth he excused him-
self

   the governor was going to call me

from buffalo gentlemen he said  i
will return shortly

  the moment he had left lieutenant
francois darcy triumphantly pounced
upon the company there was a look of
triumph in his black eyes

   our friend he has-what you call-
gagged me messieurs he exclaimed
 but here that he is gone-thank the
good god-i will give you the grand re-
cital all france she knows that he is
the hero arnericain magnifique

  lieutenant francois should have been
an actor in a moment he was out of
that dining-room and we were with him
we stood with him and the french on the
battle-ground of the somme gazing up at
a gray sky and we saw the drama of
the sky of which we had previously mere-
ly read

  we beheld the two black beetles of
death winging from the german lines
we heard the purr of lynns machine
we saw the long run on the ground the
flight into the air high above we saw
the three winging stabbing piercing
heard the reports of the machine guns

  down came one german machine then
the other to chaos and finality then
with a concerted gasp of horror we saw
lynns machine swoop downward as he
lost control saw it righted a quarter-mile
above the earth and sweep to safety in a
long curving flight saw lynn alight
calm smiling unperturbed with one arm
hanging useless

   ah messieurs cried lieutenant
darcy his eyes raised heavenward and
in his voice a passionate thrill  it was as
if he had returned from a walk of peace
with a dog frolicking at his knee while
we shouted till we were hoarse and
sought to carry him on our shoulders he
turned red like a boy that is spanked and
said he  give me a cigarette and quit
your-what you call kidding it was
an exhibition of the courage supreme
adorable absolute

 you would do it wouldnt you
hugo lynns voice was a knife cutting
the spell that bound us all i in my cor-
courage



ner transfixed like the rest turned almost
stupidly transferred in a flash from the
far battle-field to this room in a new
york restaurant it was uncanny this
resolving of the masked hooded gaunt-
leted figure of death traversing ether
like an eagle to the stalwart form in
evening dress his blond face crimsoned
and sheepish as that of a boy caught
throwing paper wads in school

  amid absolute silence he closed the
door through which he had come in time
to hear the last of the lieutenants story
and resumed his seat at the table facing
my corner in his manner was now that
same strained awkward self-conscious-
ness that marred it whenever his gallantry
was mentioned in his hearing he glared
at darcy

   we are nearly through here he
growled  then i can take you outside
and quietly kill you

  darcy spread his hands with a re-
signed gesture and elevated his eye-
brows

  	as you will man ami he said  but
with my last breath  shall protest that
i have told the truth you little one
are afraid of nothing

  now there was in the party a wag
named billy land in this moment he
made history

    lieutenant darcy is almost right
he qualified  but theres one thing as
a new yorker born and bred that he
dare not do

  captain lynns qul eyes flashed dan-
gerously he rose to the bait as land
intended

   what is that he demanded almost
fiercely

  land bent forward with a whisper au-
dible only to those sitting around the
table but to me standing in my corner
the words were as distinct as if they had
been shouted for  am expert in lip-
reading

  lands challenge was a deadly one

   ill bet you new hats for the crowd
you dare not leave this restaurant with-
out lipping the waiter

  captain lynn stared then he
frowned while the others watched him
eagerly after a moment he drew a long
breath

   youre on he assented quietly

  he had met the test the acid test of
courage i had difficulty in retaining my
professional calm i felt a wild impulse
to shout my approval my delight at find-
ing the perfect hero but impulses are
not for the men of my profession i re-
mained as i was

  for the remainder of the dinner cap-
tain lynn was gay there were sparks
of malice in his eyes whenever he gazed
at either billy land or me there was
about him an air of the ultimate assur-
ance one could tell that anything under-
taken by him even this would be carried
out with a firm hand  was so proud of
him

  they rose to leave i watched them
go captain lynn absolutely ignoring
me was in the rear i started to pick up
the things i was whistling a little tune
popular when i was younger  my
hero

  by captain lynns plate was a gold
cigarette-case just as i espied it there
was a step at the door the captain en-
tered hurriedly

   ah said he noting the case in my
hand  i thought i left it here

  crossing to me he took it and thrust-
ing a crumpled something in my hand
turned away

  an instant i stood stunned looking
down at those twisted bills my face
must have been a living pain the last
of my dreams that splendid illusion of a
perfect heroism tumbled in chaos about
my ears

  gathering myself i leaped like an an-
telope i caught him at the door pull-
ing him back before his waiting friends
could see him  pressed his money in
his hand

   i beg you i implore you to take it
back i whispered  youd have to tell
them-and only god and you and i know
-that you are a coward

chapter ix

crime

entering the owner of frys
imperial liniment had been
justifiably annoyed twenty
seconds after entering marys obvious
excitement had caused the annoyance to
give place to not very interested wonder
but now mary had claimed all his at-
tention and the annoyance was all gone
indeed as a quantity to claim ones
whole attention mary had been a success
from the very beginning

  anthony fry then scowled flitting
incredulity at her and the absurdity of
being incredulous of one who panted
and shook as did mary becoming at once
apparent anthony paled somewhat

   i cannot-believe that such an
astonishing coincidence- be began

   what you believe or dont believe
doesnt interest me mary said swiftly
 did i hear him talking about that
wretched fight last night

   er-yes

   he was there

   of course

  well its the same robert vining
mary whispered  get him out of
here 

   but-

   dont argue about it get him out
of here said mary  do you suppose
i want him to come wandering down
this way and find me

   he will not do that because-

   how do you know whether he will
or not mary demanded hotly  why
did he have to come here its all his
fault-the whole things his fault if he
hadnt refused to take me to that beastly
old fight and made such a time about it
id never have made up my mind to go
anyway

   so thats what happened anthony
muttered

   that is what happened now get
him out of here mary directed  and
do it quickly

  after all the unlucky little coincidence
was not nearly so serious as she seemed
to think anthony smiled quite calmly

   he will not stay very long said

this story began in the all-story weekly for january 


opportunity	

he  and when he is ready to go i will
not detain him of course but i cant
very well go in and order him out you
know

  mary bosom heaving still looked
straight at him with burning eyes

   mr fry she said solemnly  ive
always lived too much out doors and
boxed and shot and paddled and ridden
too much to be given to hysterics the
only time i ever had hysterics was the
night they thought dad had been killed
-but that night once id started the
neighbors came out on the street two
blocks away to see what was the matter

   i dont understand

   you will mary said controlling
herself with visible difficulty  youve
made me stand enough since last night
and there are some things i cannot-
some things i will not even try to stand
i tell you honestly that if bob isnt out
cf this flat in two minutes im going into
a fit of hysterics that will have the re-
serves piling into this sanctified hotel just
as surely as the sun is shining

  miss mary -  faltered anthony
fry

  marys hands clenched in the most
peculiar manner

   hadnt you better make the best of
those two minutes she asked breath-
lessly

  his quiet smile was gone now lines
appeared in anthonys countenance as he
looked at her - and then wasting no
further time in aimless comment he
turned and tottered into the corridor
mary meant just what she said

  robert yining and johnson boiler
were sprawling in the deep chairs op-
posite one another smoking comfortably
and giving every evidence of having set-
tled down for a considerable session
young mr vining grinned through the
smoke at his older friend

   sit down anthony said he
 were just going over the thing round
by round to see if either of us can re-
member a worse fight for the money
were working on round two just now

  anthony smiled strangely and laid a
dramatic hand upon his brow

   i will not join the discussion he
said

   eh whats the matter robert
asked sitting up

   headache one of the-er-head-
aches that make my life a burden
anthony groaned

   i never knew you had em young
mr yining said with a mystified smile

   neither did i johnson boiler con-
tributed healthfully

   did you have it before you talked
to wilkins there pursued robert who
owned a really keen mind

   er-it was just coming on

   no bad news old chap vining
said crossing his legs the other way

  anthony shook his head and smiled
again indicating suffering that was not
all simulated

   no just the - er - headache he
said  comes on suddenly you know
and settled in the back of my head and
neck there is only one thing that can
be done for it and that is a steady
massage perhaps youd do that for me
johnson

   sure said johnson boiler whose
eyes shot two questions to the second
 sit down and we can go on talking
while i rub

   well i have to lie down for this
anthony explained  on the bed you
know and its-well it is likely to take
an hour or more you wouldnt care to
wait around bob

  mr yining gazed steadily at him
no refined intuition was necessary to tell
anthony that it was not his morning for
tactful dismissals this effort evidently
had carried the delicate touch of a blow
from a baseball bat for robert flushing
slightly spoke with unpleasant crispness
 no i couldnt wait im sure and
while i dont understand it of course
im sure im sorry to have intruded
good-by

  you - havent intruded anthony
cried  only-


all-story weekly

   well dont bother explaining said
young mr vining  i beg your pardon
for breaking in and-good morning
wherewith he stalked out to the cor-
ridor removed his hat from the rack
without the assistance of wilkins and
opening the door himself closed it after
him with a careful lack of force that
was more expressive than any slam

   gone off mad johnson boiler said
 i cant help it anthony said
miserably

    nice chap too too bad to offend
him that way mr boiler pursued
meditatively  friends are few and far
between in this sad old world anthony
and a queer dick like you-rich or poor
-has trouble hanging on to the few he
makes oh  dont mean to be nasty
you know im just telling you well
come and have your head rubbed
anthony collapsed into his chair

   theres nothin wrong with my
head he said  that was the first lie
i could think of johnson to get him
out of here he had to go

   why

   she said so anthony informed him
with a ghastly little smile  shes en-
gaged to him

   to bob vining

  yes

  johnson boiler whistled softly and
elevating his eyebrows thrust his hands
into his trouser pockets and looked at
anthony with new commiseration

  too bad that said he too
bad for you that it should have been a
chap of the vining type

  what does that mean

   well sooner or later he may find
out just what youve done to that girl
boiler went on contemplatively  its
just about as she says too if he was
a fool you could fool him one way or
another or if he was a little snide an-
thony you could talk him off or bribe
him off-but it  never be like that with
bob hell never take any account of
the circumstances hell just snatch out
the gun and let fly

   rot anthony said thinly

  johnson boilers face grew grave and
more grave he sighed and looked over
anthonys head for a little and then
reaching a decision he looked at him
suddenly

   old chap he said kindly

   well

   i dont want to worry you but per-
haps it is better for you to know-now
and i wish you wouldnt mention it
because bob told me once two years
ago and showed it to me in a sort of
burst of confidence

   showed you what

   down at the base of his thumb bob
vinings got the murderers cross
johnson boiler said huskily

  nonsense anthony said sharply

   its a fact the little mark is there
clear as if it had been drawn in with a
knife said mr boiler and for an-
other fact - i dont know whether you
know this or not but virtually every
murderer who has been executed in the
isst twenty years in this state has shown
that cross in some form and-

  he stayed the pleasant flow abruptly
from the direction of davids doorway
a rustle was coming very softly and
cautiously yet quite distinctly it
paused in the corridor while mary drew
aside a corner of the curtain and looked
in-and then mary was with them and
asking

   is he gone

   yes anthony sighed

   was he excited while he was here
   not at all apparently

   then he doesnt know yet that ive
disappeared mary said calmly return-
ing to her place at the cleared fable
 isnt he a darling

   he is - a very charming fellow
anthony muttered thinking of the mur-
derers cross

   did your man take my coffee away
mary pursued

  silently anthony rang for his servitor
silently wilkins brought back pot and
cup and the little plate of toast and
opportunity



mary a very pleasing little figure indeed
sipped and munched and asked

   well have you determined how im
to leave

  anthony merely stared moodily at her
at first johnson boiler though found
his sense of humor overcoming him
again he gazed at anthony hair
rumpled eyes fogged with anxiety such
as he rarely knew and presently john-
son boiler was vibrating again one
merry little wheeze escaped and earned
a glare from anthony another followed
it - and after that johnson boiler sat
back and haw-hawed frankly until an-
thony spoke

   so far i have been thinking of the
ways in which you cannot leave he ad-
mitted tartly  if youd consent to try
my clothes and-

   umum said mary shaking her
head no no

   then frankly i dont know what to
suggest said the master of the apart-
ment  youre not invisible you can-
not walk through the office without being
seen miss mary - and once you have
done that be sure that your face will be
registered in the memory of the em-
ployees you have no idea of moving
from new york i take it

   hardly

   then since you will be about town
for years may i point out that each
man who sees you will remember also
for years that you left one of these
apartments and-

  he paused partly in distress and part-
ly because it seemed to him that wil-
kins was whispering to somebody he
sat up then because wilkins was talk-
ing and there was another voice he could
not at first place he had heard it be-
fore many times and it was very calm
very clear very determined and now
wilkinss tone came distinctly and re-
signedly

   well of course if hes expecting
you sir-

  the door closed steps approached
the living-room and with mary sitting

  at the table coffee-cup in hand furnish-
ing just the homelike touch a bachelor
apartment must normally lack hobart
hitchin was with them

  one glance settled the fact that the
amateur detective had attained a high
state of nervous tension behind his
spectacles the keen eyes flashed about
like a pair of illuminated steel points
his face seemed tired but the rest of him
was as alive as a steel spring and his
right hand held a fat brief-case

  had he been more intimately ac-
quainted with hobart hitchin anthony
fry would have trembled as it was he
felt merely keen annoyance - and then
utter consternation because hitchin had
stopped with a jerk and was looking
straight at mary

   i-er-didnt know he said

  poor little mary be she whom she
might was in a decidedly ticklish posi-
tion however perfectly her outward calm
were preserved everything that was
chivalrous in anthony surged up and
told him to protect her and coming out
of the nowhere at the very last second
merciful inspiration reached his brain
and he stared so fixedly so warningly at
johnson boiler that that gentlemans
chronic quiver ceased

   only - ah - mrs boiler  anthony
said quietly  my dear mrs boiler-
mr hitchin one of our neighbors here

  johnson boiler himself started out of
bis chair gripping his arms and then
the general sense penetrating his cranium
dropped back with a puff his mouth
opened as if to protest his eye caught
the eye of anthony fry with a gasp
and a flush mr johnson boiler subsided
for the time and anthony was saying
suavely

   mr and mrs boiler were with me
overnight you know - decorators have
captured their place and they were good
enough to take the edge off my loneliness
for a little

 i never knew you minded it tve
heard you say you liked it hobart
hitchin smiled as he took marys hand


all-story weekly

and favored her with his drill-point stare
 but when you are alone again im
quite sure that youll know how lonely
you are my dear mrs boiler i am
honored

  mary after one startled and one
thankful glance at anthony dimpled
charmingly mr hitchin dropped her
hand and ceased his inspection and im-
mediately he turned more tensely solemn
than upon his entrance

   ah-fry said he  i suppose we
can have a few minutes chat

   an hour if you like anthony
smiled quite happily too because he
was rather proud of his quick-wittedness

  hobart hitchin gazed straight at
mary

   and mr boiler will remain with
us

  i whats the mystery johnson
poller asked

   there is not i fear much mystery
hitchin said looking straight at an-
thony  but there is a little matter id
like to discuss with-er-you two gen-
tlemen

  mary rose hastily

   id better go she smiled

   if it would not inconvenience you
dear lady hitchin said unsmilingly and
with a stiff bow

  chin squared he stood in silence until
she had vanished down the corridor he
crossed the room and listened intently
dramatically he held up the curtains
and looked for the sliding doors which
had been taken out five years before

   xo way of shutting up this room
fry he asked crisply

   xo need of shutting it up either
said anthony  there is no one to
listen what seems to be the trouble
hitchin

  hitchin wheeled suddenly and turned
his remarkable eyes upon anthony

   you dont know eh he shot at
him

   im sure i do not

   and whether he does or not what
do you think youre doing johnson

boiler asked impatiently  acting a
moving picture or-

   mr boiler may i trouble you to
keep out of this for a little the crime
student asked amazingly  later on i
may wish to ask you a question or two
and if you will answer them it will serve
me and-mr fry just now suppose
we draw up around the table here so
that it will not be necessary to shout
anthony was there already scowling
johnson boiler with a grunt shuffled
over and took a chair because this
hitchin creature on the face of him was
the mornings latest full-blown freak
and johnson boiler did not wish to miss
anything

  also if the chance came he meant to
inform hitchin that mary was not mrs
boiler at all if it could be contrived
without casting too much of a slur on
mary - although that could wait until
they learned the cause of hitchins pale
cheek and his keen excited eye

  hitchin however had relaxed in the
most curious fashion he was smiling
whimsically at anthony now and al-
though his eye was across the room one
felt that it could turn with one one-
thousandth of a seconds warning and
peer through anthonys soul

   fry he said thoughtfully u i have
been interested in crime for a good many
years i have as it were dabbled in it
partly for the love of the thing and
partly because on one occasion or an-
other it has been possible for me to ex-
tend help that would not otherwise have
been extended

   thats a mysterious statement an-
thony said

   crime-some of it-is mysterious
smiled mr hitchin  motives are usual-
ly more mysterious mistaken motives-
motives formed under misapprehension-
are most mysterious of all but the con-
scquences of crime said mr hitchin
whirling suddenly on anthony  are in-
evitable inescapable as the rising of the
sun

  johnson boiler shook his head the
opportunity



man had always been queer now over-
night he too had gone crazy anthony
who was largely nerves this morning
asked  what the devil are you talking
about anyway im not trying to be
unpleasant hitchin but im not myself
this morning and this rambling discourse
about crime is rather trying

   you are not yourself this morning
hitchin repeated slowly with a smile

   no

   why are you not yourself this
morning fry

  what because i lost some sleep
last night i suppose

  ah hitchin cried softly and
why did you lose some sleep last night

  anthonys patience snapped

  see here hitchin he cried i
like to be polite and hospitable as pos-
sible but why i should sit here and an-
swer your foolish questions i cannot see

  hobart hitchin laughed a low rip-
pling sinister laugh that chilled the
hearer without giving a clue to the rea-
son for the chill

   shall i show you why it were better
for you to answer fry he purred

   no

   oh but id better insisted the
crime student  fry let us go back a
few hours you returned home last night
about midnight i think-fifteen or
twentv minutes before the hour

  yes

   there was with you a young man
named david prentiss

    of course

   then here is the reason for my ques-
tions cried hobart hitchin and his
whole personality seemed aflame  an-
thony fry where is david prentiss

chapter x

the web

just the manner of the man startled
anthony and caused him to hitch
back in his chair and stare johnson
boiler was not so affected

   say whats the matter with you
hitchin he asked  are vou a plain
nut

  hitchin snapped his fingers at him
angrily and continued his stare at an-
thony fry

   well he said tensely

  well upon my soul hitchin an-
thony stammered  i believe boilers
right

   oh no you dont hobart hitchin
said quietly  you know a great deal
better and boiler knows a great deal
better but he has a good deal more self-
control than you have fry where is
david prentiss

  gone home of course- anthony
snapped

   when did he go

   what last night 

   and can you give me an idea of the
hour

   oh-half past twelve perhaps

   at half past twelve last night david
prentiss left this apartment he went
down in the elevator

   i suppose so

   and-just be patient fry hitchin
smiled disarmingly  did the young
man wear from this apartment the
clothes he wore into this apartment

  it was perfectly apparent to anthony
that the wretched fool had taken what
he fancied to be a scent of some sort it
was equally clear that in his present
state of mind anthony would answer
perhaps three more questions and then
losing himself completely would smash
the flower-vase over hobart hitchins
shining bald head solely as a salve for
his nerves

  doubtless the long coat and the down-
pulled cap had started him off - they
were sufficiently mysterious - looking to
impress a less sensitive imagination than
hitchins but whatever troubled the
crime specialist david prentiss would
have to be lied out of here in detail lied
home and lied to bed

   hitchin said anthony  heaven
alone knows what concern of yours it


all-story weekly

can be but the prentiss boy - the son
of an old friend of mine who has seen
better days - came back here with me
last night for some things cast-offs i
had promised his unfortunate father
we met him on the street on the way
home

   just around the corner supplied
johnson boiler who was growing steadily
more anxious to speak his mind to an-
thony about the mrs boiler matter

   and having come up-stairs with us
and having selected the things he thought
his father would like best anthony
went on  they were wrapped in a bun-
dle of ordinary brown paper tied up
with ordinary non-mysterious crime-
proof string and carried out by david
who i have no doubt at all reached
home within half an hour gave the
clothes to his father said his prayers
ard went to bed without further ado
if there is anything else youd like to
know ask

  hobart hitchin had not blinked now
he smiled strangely and shrugged his
shoulders

   at least said he  you have per-
fected the storv havent you

   i

   and now mr hitchin oroke in in-
cisively  let us consider the facts we
will take them one by one and i beg
that you will listen item one i sat in
the lobby down-stairs until seventeen
minutes of one oclock this morning fry
no david prentiss passed me going
out nobody left this hotel with a bun-
dle or a bag

   you didnt see him anthony said
 because he was not there listen
please and do not interrupt fry i
like jou or i should not be here i wish
to help you if such a thing be possible
or i should have gone at once to the
police said the remarkable mr hitchin
 you like many a man before you for-
get perfectly plain details in this case
you have forgotten that my apartment
is directly beneath yours-that the ele-
vators here have latticed gates so that

one can see from any floor whoever may
be passing in one of the cars-that sound
travels perfectly in this building when
the street is quiet as at night so to
get to item two about two oclock this
morning there was the sound of a heavy
fall in this very room

  johnson boiler was grasping the trend
more rapidly than was anthony and he
was growing less comfortable

    i fell  he said

   did you really asked the demon
detective  yet-youre in that room i
take it yet you got out of bed im-
mediately after and walked in here i
heard your step dont flush boiler
it takes practice to carry out a thing of
this kind and whatever the motive may
have been you gentlemen are not old
hands and so to item three it must
have been about four when a policeman
came to this door why

   there was supposed to be a burglar
here it was a false alarm anthony
said less collectedly

  hitchin lighted the pipe he had filled
and smiled

   that is the tale they tell in the of-
fice he said  i confess that that de-
tail puzzles me and as yet i havent had
time to get inside information from my
good friend our police captain how-
ever we can well call this detail imma-
terial and pass to item four

  he gazed into the blue cloud of smoke
and smiled again

  the woman in the case he said in
a deep bass voice

  there was no woman anthony
exploded  and-

  the french woman fry hitchin
corrected

   well she-

   dont explain her said hobart
hitchin  let us see just what hap-
pened when she was about she came
after daylight she passed through the
office down-stairs so suddenly that no-
body was able to stop her and she knew
w-here to come she was in the elevator
and naming her floor to the man-who
opportunity



supposed her to have been passed by
the office - perhaps two seconds after
she entered the house itself she came
directly to this apartment fry and al-
most immediately she burst into hys-
terical weeping

  his eyes were boring again and ho-
bart hitchin also pointed the stem of
his pipe accusingly at anthony

 fry he said  what did that girl
see evidently at the end of the corridor
which produced that outburst of grief-
nothing anthony said thickly

   there was nothing to cause her
acute grief

   no and-

  wait she wept all the way down
in the elevator i saw her myself she
wept so violently when she reached the
street that an officer approached her-
and she fled from him and disappeared
it was high time to say something
and to say it well dignity had always
served anthony and while it was an
effort he eyed hobart hitchin coldly

   hitchin said he  it would be
quite possible believe me to soothe
your feverish mind by telling you the
perfectly simple errand on which that
gill came but im damned if ill do it
some things are too ridiculous and
youre one of them if there are any
further questions you wish to ask about
my personal affairs will you please leave
tiiem unasked and if there are other
things over which you wish to rave dont
let me detain you here

  he fastened his best majestic gaze
on hobart hitchin yet hitchin only
laughed his low sinister laugh

   youre a curious customer fry he
said leaning back comfortably  i had
hoped before this that your nerve would
have broken and-however listen to this
little theory of mine the boy knew
something i cant say what about you
something which had to be suppressed
at any cost you brought him here i
cant say on what pretext but the boy
fancied that all was well perhaps you
promised him money im inclined to be-

lieve that for the girl came evidently
by appointment ready to travel
doesnt take much deduction to guess
that they were going to be married with
the money you gave him does it she
came and she saw what had happened
and then-

   well what had happened an-
thony almost shouted

   thats what im waiting for you to
tell me so that i can give you a helping
hand said the crime student  and
while im waiting and while youre still
plainly convinced that i know nothing
at all let me ask one question again
did the prentiss boy leave here with the
clothes he wore when he entered-
yes anthony said wearily

  with a sudden startling slap the fat
brief-case was placed upon the table and
its straps undone and there was an-
other slap and hobart hitchin cried
then explain these fry explain
these

  there can be no denying that an-
thonys mouth opened and that his eyes
grew reunder before him spread upon
the table lay davids trousers

   well those-those- he stammered
 where did you get them

   from the dumbwaiter where you
placed them so very quietly so very
cautiously so very early this morning
said hobart hitchin with his devilish
laugh  you even went so far as to run
the thing down so that it would be
emptied at once didnt you but you
didnt happen to look down you
didnt see me take the whole suit from
the dumbwaiter as it passed my door
he leaned back triumphantly and
puffed his pipe and for a little there was
a thick tangible silence in anthonys
living-room

  more than once like most of us john-
son boiler had wondered just what he
would do if accused of a murder of which
he was entirely innocent in a fond and
confident way he had pictured himself
sneering at the captain of police im-
pressing him despite himself as johnson


all-story weekly

boiler not only established his alibi in
a few crisp sentences but also directed
the stupid detective force toward the
true criminal

   at present however he discovered that
he was downright scared unless one of
them rose up and told about mary and
then called her in to verify the truth it
seemed that hobart hitchin idiot though
he might be had established something
of a case and instead of sneering john-
son boiler grew redder and redder until
hitchin said

  ah you know all about it eh i
had wondered

 well cut out your wondering john-
son boiler said roughly  because-
 i wouldnt talk now if i were you
said hitchin kindly enough  im de-
voting myself to fry well fry

  as yet anthony had not found the
proper line of speech

   the boy a stranger comes here at
midnight hitchin purred relentlessly
 there is a heavy fall at two there is
weeping before seven the weeping of a
strange woman there are the boys
clothes-the rest of them are down-stairs
so once more-where is david prentiss
he waited and anthony fry drew a
long breath all his life he had been
painfully addicted to the truth it was
part of his cherished and spotless reputa-
tion all his life he had shunned fiction
and was therefore ignorant of plot tech-
nique so he did fairly well in smiling
sourly and saying calmly enough

   so far as i know david is about
starting for his work hitchin the thing
had slipped my mind altogether but i
remember now that the boy took a suit-
a blue suit-for himself and changed into
it while here that outfit was decidedly
shabby after that he left and as to the
french girl you may theorize and be
hanged for she happens to be none of
your infernal business and she has no
connection with david

   none eh

   none whatever

  mr hitchin grinned without humor

and examined the trousers in silence
thinking and later humming to himself
he smoothed them out and then folded
them carefully finally replacing them in
his brief case after that he looked at
anthony

   if i were you fry i should tell the
truth and let me help you you know
and i know that the boy never left this
apartment well

  t well snapped anthony

   and you know and i know that what
remains of him is still here and-

   are you accusing me of murder
anthony demanded savagely

   i have been doing that for some
time

   hitchin youre the most utter ass
that ever breathed you-

   doubtless but at the same time mur-
der is murder and murder will out fry
the extraordinary crime student said
steadily as he arose  now hear me
quietly i shall do nothing-you under-
stand nothing - until afternoon unless
circumstances render action imperative
you know where we stand i know where
we stand i want to help you to come to
the unfortunate end quietly if nothing
else i shall be in my apartment all
morning think it over talk it over
with boiler then when you have de-
cided that you need help come and see
me he took up his case and faced
anthony squarely  at least i can see
that you obtain a privilege or two in the
local prisons he concluded  good-
by

   good lord breathed anthony fry

   and in going said hobart hitchin
 let me leave just one caution behind
me fry have nothing shipped from
this apartment until we have talked
again

  then mr hitchin courageously turn-
ing his back upon the pair moved out of
the flat leaving johnson boiler and his
oldest friend in a state of partial pa-
ralysis anthony recovered in perhaps
three seconds

  that-that infernal idiot said an-
opportunity



thony  why the lunatic asylums have
saner people in strait-jackets 

   maybe they have johnson boiler
said hoarsely  but all the same many a
good man has sat in the electric chair on
the strength of circumstantial evidence
not nearly so good as he made out

   well are you afraid of sitting there
anthony snapped

  johnson boiler mopped his brow

   maybe not he said  but with the
thing hes pieced together he can go to
the police and have em around here in
ten minutes that son-of-a-gun can have
you and me locked up without bail and
-that d be nice huh

   he can do nothing of the sort

   he can unless you show him a david
prentiss mr boiler urged he can
unless we have the girl out and tell him
the truth and have her corroborate it
are you going to do that

  anthony fry hugged his head for an
instant it was really aching now

   no he said

   its better than being jugged an-
thony suggested johnson boiler  you
know ive got some reputation as well as
you and-say what did you mean by in-
troducing her as my wife

   was there anything else to do

   why not as your sister

   because hitchin knows perfectly well
that i havent a sister of course dont
fume and thresh around like that john-
son it bothers me

   but if my wife ever hears of it-

   she never will said anthony with-
out great concern  unless you have
hitchin for dinner some night and ask
him to tell about it

   and wilkins-he heard it too

   well i shall instruct wilkins not to
mention it later on anthony sighed
 now quiet down will you and let us
think how-

   have you decided how to get me out
of here mary asked brightly entering
without a sound

  anthony stayed the bitter words that
were in his very throat

   we have been accused of murdering
david prentiss he said

   really

   very really indeed 

   isnt that funny mary laughed
 isnt it perfectly ridiculous

  its a scream said johnson boiler
 about the time we both get pinched it
may be up to you to-

  tell the truth mary said quickly
   just that

  ill never do it the girl cried pas-
sionately  no not even to save both
of you im not here through any fault
of my own and-and-why a man who
could suggest such a thing-

   hes not suggesting it hes just ex-
cited anthony said miserably  now
suppose we try just once more to sit
down sanely and devise the way of get-
ting you safely home miss mary

  and soon said the girl somewhat
feverishly  if i could have gotten home
while it was dark felice could have smug-
gled me in and-and lied about it if nec-
essary but it isnt night any longer its
nine oclock or past nine and-

  she said no more lips parted and
eyes all in an instant thoroughly horri-
fied she stood and listened and from the
door of anthonys apartment a noisy
thumping sounded once more and a voice
said

  hurry up open that door

   robert again mary gasped

   is that possible anthony gasped
bouncing to his feet

  it was not only possible it was the
solid fact for wilkins muttering as he
fumbled at the latch was mentioning mr
vinings name and bidding him be pa-
tient for an instant-and mary with a
little scream had made another of her
projectile disappearances down the corri-
dor - and into the room came robert
vining

  he was far from being the same col-
lected young man his whole person
seemed to have been towsled by some
overwhelming excitement his eyes be-
longed in the head of a madman and his

hands waved irresponsibly as he rushed
at anthony fry and clutched his coat
and panted

   fry youll have to help me

   help you-how

   you know more people than i-you
know people everywhere anthony
youll have to help by calling them up
and having them call up their friends
you know that - that may do some
good i-i dont know i dont know
what im talking about anthony i feel
as if id gone crazy

   you act very much that way an-
thony said quietly  whats wrong
robert yining gaped at him and then
laughed quite insanely

 wrong he shouted wrong
marys disappeared 

  mary-

   you dont know mary-no of course
not young mr vining rushed on
 she-shes the girl im going to marry
anthony yes im engaged although it
hasnt been announced yet ive been
engaged for a week now and we-great
heaven i cant think i-why an-
thony i was talking to her even at dinner
last night and there was never a hint that
she even meant to go out of the house
in fact when we parted she seemed
rather bored at the idea of staying home
and-why not a soul knows even when
she left the house shes gone fry
shes just gone 

  a coarse nature ever johnson boiler
winked at anthony and turned his back

  mary why my little mary out
alone at night- young robert choked
 shes just twenty anthony-a delicate
beautiful girl like that disappearing from
the most beautiful the happiest home in
all new york why from the day she
was born dalton never spared a penny
to--

   eh what dalton anthony asked
suddenly

   what theodore dalton of course
hes her father - dalton the patent
medicine man anthony you must have
met him you know theodore dalton

  curiously fortunately enough sheer
nervous tension jerked him away from
anthony fry just then and set him to
pacing the floor a man distracted a man
unseeing a man who recked of nothing
on earth beyond his terrible and imme-
diate grief

  and this was very well indeed for an-
thony was certainly making himself con-
spicuous

  anthony took three backward steps
and looked at the unconscious robert
much as if the young man had branded
himself a leper he looked at johnson
boiler too although his eyes were blank
-and then one hand on his head an-
thony staggered straight out of the room
and into the corridor and having gone
that far he turned and staggered down to
the window at the end and the window-
seat where he collapsed much as if the
bones had been whisked from his long
slender legs

  here johnson boiler following found
him five seconds later mr boiler who
was beginning to feel downright peculiar
himself with vining threshing about the
living-room and babbling incoherent
agony shook his old friend with no gen-
tle hand as he demanded

   say you what is it now what
in blazes got you that time anthony
are you going to have a fit

  johnson anthony said feebly
clutching coldly at mr boilers plump
hand  oh johnson

   what 

  her father shes the daughter of
theodore dalton johnson shes the
daughter of the man they call the lini-
ment king

   yes queried johnson boiler not
understanding the connection

  the icy hand closed tighter about his
own rousing something almost akin to
sympathy in johnson boilers bosom and
causing him to lay a soothing hand on
anthonys shoulder-for so do men cling
to a raft in mid-ocean

   johnson anthony fry said piteous-
ly  ive kidnaped the daughter of the
opportunity



only man in ihe world who can ruin me
and now hell do it

chapter xl

the other lady

it was plain enough to johnson boiler
anthony poor devil was raving at
last since there was no one likely to
ruin anthony the strain had developed
the illusion that-or was it an illusion
anthony had calmed these last few sec-
onds clinging childlike to his friend his
eyes denoted the general state of mind of
a hunted doe but there was nothing more
abnormal

   say kid johnson boiler began
kindly  you-

   you dont understand anthony said
hoarsely but more quietly  ive never
told you about the dalton matter be-
cause ive tried my best to forget the in-
terview-but dalton is the man who con-
trols virtually the whole proprietary lini-
ment market barring only frys imperial
my-my liniment said anthony and
there was an affectionate note in his voice
which johnson boiler had never heard
before in connection with the imperial
 is the only one he has failed to acquire
 yes said johnson boiler with ris-
ing interest

  anthony smiled wanly dizzily

   well dalton came to the office one
day about five years ago having made an
appointment to meet me personally there
he wanted to buy us out and  wouldnt
hear of it-partly sentiment and partly
because he didnt want to pay enough
then he tried his usual tactics of threat-
ening to drive imperial off the market
and i sat down and pointed out to him
just what it would cost and what it would
gain him hes a hard devil johnson
and he was pretty angry yet he saw the
reason in what i told him

   go on said johnson boiler

   we parted on rather curious terms
groaned anthony  one might call it an
armed truce i suppose he seemed to
 a-s

be willing to let matters rest as they were
and he has done just that ever since but
he told me in so many words that if ever
i tried to break into his particular mar-
kets if ever for any cause i offended
him in any way hed sail in and adver-
tise me out of business

   can he do it

   he can do it anthony said with
pained conviction  he can do it be-
cause hes able to spend a million where
i spend ten thousand and once he starts
frys imperial liniment is as dead as
julius ctesar and when he learns about
this thing-

   he-he might never learn johnson
boiler said but without conviction

  anthony laughed forlornly

  hell learn im done for said he

  its as good as done and over with now
johnson almost every cent i have in
the world is invented in the firm you
know and once that goes to pieces -
why great heaven johnson ill have
to get out and work for a living

  johnson boiler for a little said noth-
ing at all coming from another man
he would have fancied the statements
largely exaggeration and imagination
coming from anthony he knew that they
were mostly solid truth

   well i told you in the first place that
kid meant trouble he muttered

   you have a prophetic soul anthony
sighed

  trouble isnt the word mr boiler
mused further  if you tell the truth
according to your figuring the old gen-
tleman will ruin you-but that doesnt
matter much because when youve told
the truth its a dead sure thing vining
will let the daylight through you so that
youll have no need for money anyway
and if you go on trying to keep it all
dark and succeed in doing it that hitch-
in idiot will have us both jailed for mur-
der-and icell have to produce a david
prentiss before we get out 

  anthony gazing fixedly at him felt
hope that hardly dared to be creeping
into his eyes


all-story weekly

   johnson could we get hold of a boy
somewhere and bribe him he asked

   to do what

   to go into a police court and swear
that he was david prentiss and that he
came here last night and left again about
half past twelve said the model citizen
without even reflecting that it involved
perjury  if we could manage that it
might be best of all to let hitchin go
ahead

   stick you and me in jail johnson
boiler asked harshly

  	better that than risk-

   i dont see it the less chivalrous
gentleman snapped  theres nothing
inside urging me to go to jail for any-
bodys sake even overnight and another
thing ive got a wife anthony just
consider where this would put me with
beatrice-and how dead certain it would
be with hitchin airing his views and con-
clusions that hed mention the lady you
introduced as mrs boiler 

  -	but-

  but nothing johnson boiler said
his personal trouble coming uppermost
again  thats the worst break youve
made so far anthony that mrs boiler
business is likely to cause me-

  he shut his teeth on the end of the
sentence wilkins white and distressed
was coming down the corridor with what
looked rather like kangaroo leaps he
came to davids door and stopped turn-
ing the knob lie entered -and immedi-
ately he left the room again and sped to
anthony

   she wishes to see you again sir

  anthony jerked obediently to his feet
and laid a cold hand on johnson boilers

   gel up there and keep yining busy
he said  thats all hurry

  johnson boiler shuffled back to the
living-room where the unfortunate rob-
ert paced up and down and wrung his
hands anthony waiting tremulously
until he heard both their voices hurried
into marys room - and looked at her
with a new dreadful terror she was no
longer a merely unfortunate unknown

young woman whose good name he had
placed in considerable jeopardy mary
by now had become the potential slick
of dynamite that bade fair to blast him
out of the lasaode out of his regular
life out of everything but the chance to
sally forth and hunt a job

   well well she asked swiftly

   yes

   is he gone is he gone mary
cried

   he will go shortly anthony said
thickly  you- you are theodore dal-
tons daughter

   so youve discovered that 

  he-in a business way  anthony
muttered vaguely

   yes that was my reason for coming
here mary said cheerfully enough

  ive heard him speak of you -oh no
not very flatteringly i dont think he
likes you ive heard him say that some
day hed wreck you when he was ready
and i was very curious indeed to see
what sort of man you were and whether
you were nice enough to plead for if he
ever started i dont like dad to wreck
people

  anthony nodded

   and that was another reason why i
was afraid to tell the truth last night
said mary  if you were business en-
emies- bitter ones i mean and you
found out that you had fathers daughter
here well that has nothing to do with
getting bobby away has it

   hell go presently

   presently isnt soon enough mary
informed her captor  i sent for wilkins
to teil you that he must go now

   but the boy is distracted and

   about me

   yes

   is he really suffering mary asked

   i think so

  the girl considered very thoughtfully
indeed

  	maybe id better go out there and
quiet him poor little boy she said
staggeringly  hell believe me if i tell
him the truth and-
opportunity



    i wouldnt do that anthony ex-

	ploded  hes wildly excited now and
  the truth might not appeal to him as
  reasonable

     again mary hesitated causing his blood
  to congeal

     very well then get rid of him now
  she said sharply if he ever came down
  here and found me all the explaining in
  the world would never help

     he will not anthony said impa-
  tiently  bob isnt the sort to stray about
  ones apartment and-

    and from the corridor came

     shes gone boiler johnson shes
  gone

    and steps came in their direction too
  and while mary dalton turned to flame
  anthony fry turned to ice he was com-
  ing and coming steadily and the door was
  open fully two inches he was abreast
  of them now and faithful johnson boiler
  apparently was with him for they heard-
   well i wouldnt go wandering around
  like that old man come back and sit
  down ancl well talk it over

    ill sit here on the window-seat
  robert vining panted

      dont do that mr boiler protested

  	xo not there bobby thats weak
  and likely to go down in a heap with
  you

    the steps ceased through ten terrible
  seconds anthony fry and lovely mary
  stood listening to the panting of the af-
  flicted youth then

    my god johnson he cried wildly

    -i want to look over the whole world
  at once for her  want to look into every
  room in xew york  want to look into
  every room in this place and then tear
  out and look-

     yes but you couldnt do that
  johnson boiler assured him soothingly

  	xow cut out the madhouse talk old
  man and come back have one of an-
  thonys good strong cigars and ill dig
  out that brandy he keeps for his best
  friends dont go nosing around these
  rooms said johnson boiler and simul-
  taneously they caught the shiver in his

voice and saw the door move as vinings
hand landed pn the knob  just control
yourself and come back

  robert yining laughed hideously and
helplessly

    i	suppose im making an ass of my-
self said his weak voice  i cant help
it on my soul i cant help it give
me a shot of the brandy though and
maybe ill steady a bit

  something iike one hundred years
passed then the hand slid from the door
and they could hear johnson boiler lead-
ing the sufferer gently away from the
shock of his whole lifetime mary her
eyes closed for a moment gripped her-
self and spoke very softly

   mr fry if if you dont get that
boy out of here and then find a way of
sending me home-if you dont do it in-
stantly im going out there to bob and
tell him that you brought me here and
kept me here all night against my will
after that whatever happens-well it
just happens

  life returned to anthonys frozen legs
  will go he managed to say and
he went

  the brandy was already within robert
yining yet it seemed to have made small
difference in his condition the young
mans eyes were wild and rolling they
rested on anthony for a moment as it
they had seen him before but could not
quite place him

   you youve been telephoning he
said

   xot yet said anthony  but if
youll run along and do your share ill
think up ways of helping you

   my share yining echoed

  mentally he was not more than half
himself anthony fry therefore grew
very firm and very stern pleasantly cer-
tain that robert was paying no heed to
his pallor or the uncontrollable shake
that had come to his hands

   if the girl has really disappeared
he said steadily  your part is not to be
sitting here and whining for help robert
why dont you get out and hustle and

see if you cant get track of her have
you gone to all her friends

 eh no

  then go now said anthony fry

	you know her girl friends get after
the most intimate at first and get about
it

  here he scowled and robert vining
rising shook himself together

   youre right anthony he said
 im an ass ive lost my head com-
pletely this last hour i i caught it
from her father  think the mans going
about like an infuriated bull swearing to
kill everybody in the world if mary isnt
returned and but youre right old chap
thank you for steadying me robert
concluded bravely  wheres my hat
ive been wearing it all this time eh
good-by anthony good-by johnson

  he tried to smile at them and he fled
this time it was johnson holler who
turned weak at his going mr holler
smiling at his old friend in a sickly green-
ish way dropped into a chair and mopped
his forehead

   narrow squeak anthony

  yes anthony agreed with some
difficulty

    was never so scared as that in all
my life johnson holler went on faintly
  thought sure id have to watch it and

  anthony it turned me so sick i could
hardly stand on my feet

   what did

   the idea of seeing you shot down
there mr boiler said with a shudder
 gad  could picture the whole thing
anthony i could see him start and look
at you both- i swear t could see him pull
a gun from his pocket and shoot  could
see the blood spurting out of your fore-
head anthony and hear the chicken
screech and it turned me so infernally
sick-

   didnt think of any of my sensations
did you anthony asked caustically

   as a matter of fact no i
didnt muttered johnson holler with
another great shiver  what do your con-
founded sensations matter anvwav this

whole affair is your fault not mine
you deserve whatever you get i dont
 ouve got nobody in the world to worry
over you but ive got a uije anthony

  -	you have mentioned it before

  	and im likely to mention it again
said mr boiler savagely u you know
anthony im about through with this
thing im a nervous man and  can
stand about so much suffering of my own
but  dont see the idea of taking on
yours as well and what is more this
thing of introducing the girl as my wife
is-

   well what is it mary herself
asked very crisply appearing in her dis-
concerting and silent fashion

  johnson boiler smiled feebly

    its very flattering in some ways miss

  miss dalton but for a man like me
who loves his wife you know and all
that sort of thing-

  his voice thinned out and died before
the decidedly cold light in marys eye
it seemed to johnson boiler that she had
a low opinion of himself and when she
looked at anthony he noted that she had
a low opinion of anthony as well

   have you settled it yet she snapped

   the- er- -means of getting you out

   is there anything more important

   ah- decidedly not anthony said
wearily  several times i think weve
attempted a council of war and we may
as well try it again there will be no
interruptions this time i think and if
we all put our minds to it

  that was all as on several other
similar occasions he halted because of
sounds from the doorway it seemed to
anthony indeed that he had heard wil-
kins muttering at the telephone a moment
ago too and now the faithful one was
at the door and working over the latch

  marvs eyes were preternaturally keen
too marv had acquired a way of stand-
ing erect and poising every time sounds
came from that door she did it now
remaining on tiptoe until the oddest little
giggle brought anthony and johnson boi-
ler to their feet also
opportunity



  thats a womans voice mary
whispered

  and she looked about wildly and
since there was no hope of escape unseen
by the corridor her eyes fell upon the
pen door of johnson boilers room
mary with a bound that would have
done credit to a young deer was across
the room and the door clicked behind her
just a wilkins smiling in a perturbed
and mystified way appeared to announce
 a lady sir who--

  then the lady had passed him moving
with a speed almost equal to marys own
-a lovely lady indeed with great dash-
ing black eyes and black hair- a lady
all life and spirit her face suffused just
now with a great joy wilkins perceiving
that neither gentleman protested after
gazing at her for one second backed away
to regions of his own and the spell on
johnson boiler broke and his soul found
vent in one great glad cry of

   bee

   pudgy-wudgy  cried the lady and
flew directly into johnson boilers arms

  anthony lry steadied himself mentally
and physically and the little smile that
came to his lips was more than half sneer
because johnson boiler and his lovely
wife were hugging each other and bab-
bling senselessly and the best that an-
thony could make of it at first was some-
thing like

  and was it lonely oh pudgy-
wudgy was it lonely-

  whereat johnson boiler burbled
lonely sugar-plum lonely sweetie
oh beetie-girl if pudgy-wudgy could tell
you how lonely-

  here they kissed again three times
four limes five times

   hell said anthony fry

   and did it come back the imbecile
that had been johnson boiler gurgled

  the dark exquisite head burrowed deep
on boilers shoulder

  oh pudgy a muffled voice pro-
tested almost tearfully  i couldnt do
it  thought  could but i couldnt
sweetest 

  	and so it came back to its pudgy-
wudgv johnson boiler oozed ecstatical-
ly  so it turned around and came back
to its pudgy

  mrs boiler regarded him solemnly

   at some awful awful place north of
albany she said  i couldnt go any
farther and i-i was going to wire you
to come for me pudgy and then i
thought id stay at their terrible hotel
and come down and surprise you and you
werent home and they said youd come
here

  yes johnson boiler agreed

   how could you leave our home
pudgy-wudgy his darling asked reprov-
ingly

  if  had stayed there another hour
without my little chicky-biddy id have
shot myself said pudgy-wudgy ask
anthony and here he looked at an-
thony and demanded  aint we silly
like a couple of kids

   you certainly are anthony fry
rasped

   you dont have to screw your face
all up when you say it mr boiler in-
formed him disengaging himself

  beatrice laughed charmingly

   youll overlook it mr fry said
she  weve never been separated be-
fore in all the-

    six months beamed johnson boiler
that weve been married finished
his wife squeezing his hand

  followed a pause anthony had noth-
ing whatever to say after witnessing an
exhibition like that he never had any-
thing to say for an hour or more that a
lady could hear he stood a cold stately
disgusted figure surging innally thank-
ing every star in the firmament that he
had never laid himself open to a situation
of that kind-and after a time the inim-
ical radiations from him reached beatrice
for she laughed uneasily

   may i-may  fix my hair she
asked  and then well go home
pudgy

    es my love purred johnson boi-
ler


all-story weekly

   which is your room pigeon-boy 
his bride asked

  so far as concerned johnson holier
mary had been wafted out of this world
all aglow with witless happiness he point-
ed at the door as he said

   that one beetie-chicken

  beatrice turned and ten thousand volts
shot through anthony and caused his
hair to stand on end llis laugh coming
simultaneously was a loud weird thing
splitting the still air

  your bedroom johnson he cried
 she means your bedroom

  	well-of course beatrice replied

   well thats down at the end of the
corridor dear madam anthony smiled
wildly and went so far as to stay her in-
laying hands on her arm  right down
there-see the open door thats
johnsons room

  beatrice distinctly startled glanced at
him and nodded and left anthony draw-
ing the first real breath in a full minute
glared at his friend in silence but the
mornings dread situation had slid from
johnson boilers shoulders as a drop of
water from a ducks back for a second
or two he had been slightly jarred at the
magnitude of the break he had made
but that was all over now

   my mistake old scout he chuckled
softly  you saved the day what are
you glowering about

   clod gasped anthony

  clod your necktie johnson boiler
said airily  well did you ever see the
like of it did you ever see anything
like the little squeezicks anthony shes
back bless her little heart she couldnt
stand it

   cmph said his host

   and so im let out of it mr boiler
chuckled on  well just scoot along to
the little dove-cote old vinegar-face and
see how she looks after all this time 
can get my things later on well im
sorry to leave you with the problem on
your hands you know

  dont let it disturb you anthony
snapped

   but at that you know fates doing
the kind just thing by snatching me out
mr boiler concluded earnestly and vir-
tuously  it wasnt my muddle in the
first place and somehow  feel that you
havent acted just on the level with me
about any of it

  anthonys mouth opened to protest
yet he did not protest instead he
jumped just as one jumps at the unex-
pected explosion of a fire-cracker-for
down the corridor a scream shrill and
sharp echoed suddenly

  and after the scream came a long
choking gasp so that even wilkins ap-
peared in the doorway and johnson boi-
ler darted forward to learn what had over-
taken his only darling he was spared
the trouble of going down the corridor
however even as he darted forward
beatrice had rejoined them and having
looked at her just once johnson boiler
stood in his tracks rooted to the floor

  because beatrice the lovely the loving
beatrice of the melting eyes and the high
color had left them the lady in the
doorway was white as the driven snow
and breathing in a queer strangling way
and whatever her eyes may have ex-
pressed melting love for johnson boiler
was not included

  for this unpleasant condition the hat
in her hand seemed largely responsible
it was a pretty little hat expensively
simple but it was the hat of a lady

  and looking from it to johnson boiler
beatrice finally managed

  this this this hat

  johnson boiler moved not a muscle

   who is the woman beatrice cried
vibrantly   ho is shet

  and still neither anthony nor johnson
boiler seemed able to canter up to the
situation and carry it off with a blithe
laugh anthony was making queer
mouths johnson boiler was doing noth-
ing whatever even now and when three-
seconds had passed beatrice whirled ab-
ruptly on the only other possible source
of information present which happened
to be wilkins
opportunity



  you were here she said swiftly
 you answer me who was the woman
 the-the woman maam wilkins
repeated

  beatrice came nearer and looked up at
him and there was that in her eyes which
sent wilkins back a full pace

  you-you creature beatrice said

	what woman was in this apartment
last night

  now as it chanced wilkins was far
more intelligent than he looked give
him the mere hint to a situation and he
could lumber through somehow only a
little while ago when hobart hitchin
came upon them he had caught the key
to this affair- so he smiled quite confi-
dently and bowed

   there was no woman here last night
maam said wilkins  only mrs boiler
the wife of that gentleman there

chapter xi

tk ckasii

now it was the turn of beatrice to
become rigid

she did not even wink those first
few seconds she looked straight at wil-
kins searching his soul and wilkins
pleasantly conscious of having done the
right thing well preserved his quiet re-
spectful smile and wondered just which
lady this newest might be

  he was telling the truth lie was tell-
ing the horrible the incredible truth -
and although those eyes of mrs boilers
might have suggested that she was capable
of passionate murder if goaded far enough
they belied her actions just now one
slim white hand went to her throat for
a moment as if to ease her breathing but
when she spoke her tone was very low
very quiet indeed

   mrs boiler was here

  yes madam wilkins responded in
round tones

   all last night

   er-yes madam she-

johnson boiler returned to life john-

son boiler with a thick senseless shout
hounded forward and landed directly be-
tween wilkins and his beloved as he
mi a rled

  say you- you lying dog you-
let him alone his wife said quickly
permit him to tell me the truth

    hes not telling you the truth cried
johnson boiler  hes lying he-
why wilkins lll smash your face into
so many nasty little pieces that-

   beg pardon sir wilkins said
hastily  the-the lady that was here-
 there was no lady here mr boiler
shouted

  wilkins put up his hands

    well the lady that was eating break-
fast sir after a manner of speaking he
stammered  her that was introduced as
mrs boiler which caused me to take it
sir that she-

   say l said there was no lady here
and there was no lady here get that
you putty-faced idiot johnson boiler
cried frantically for he was beyond rea-
son  what do you mean by standing
there and lying and babbling about some
woman-

   again wilkinss intelligence manifested
itself to be a perfect servant ones teeth
must remain in place and ones face must
lx- free from bruises wilkins after a
brief intent look at johnson boilers fists
turned and fled

   so this said mrs johnson boiler
with deadly calm  is what happens when
you think ive gone away

  her husband turned upon her and
threw out his hands

  beatrice he cried  swear to
you-

    dont touch me vou filthv creature
                      -

said his beatrice  i-i couldnt have
thought it you seemed different from
other men

   this woman  johnson boiler floun-
dered and then caught anthonys cold
eye it was an amused eye too and the
sneer was in it and johnson boiler point-
ed at its owner suddenly and said  if-
if there was a woman here blame him


all-story weekly

  beatrice boiler looked anthony fry
up and down and her lips curled

  i do a little she said bitterly
 fve never cared very much for you
mr fry but- oh why did you do that
you know as well as  know that johnson
isnt thal that sort of a man if he
wanted to come here and stay with you
couldnt you have been just for once
decent

   madam thundered anthony fry
when breath came to him

  there was no music in beatrices laugh
an ungreased saw goes through hardwood
more sweetly

   spare yourself the effort of that
righteous rage she said  i know your
saintly type of man so well and fve
begged johnson to have nothing to do
with you

   and i give you my word  johnson
boiler began

  	that he brought the woman here
his wife asked

   yes

  and you remained finished john-
son boilers better half  where is she

  she isnt here now came almost
automatically from anthony

  once more beatrice laughed

  	isnt she though said she  that
son doesnt leave a twenty-dollar hat be-
hind mr fry - nor a bag worth perhaps
five times as much she hail moved in
quite cozily hadnt she if i hadnt ap-
peared her trunk would have been along

-	or perhaps it is here now if 
hadnt  mrs boiler continued and her
voice broke as the unearthly calm splin-
tered and departed

   where is she and her whole
mien altering in an instant mrs boilers
hands clenched tightly and her face flamed
with outraged fury  where is she

  johnson boiler looked around wildly
and helplessly

     tell you she isnt here he began
 you see-

    and i tell you that thats a lie said
his wife  ill find her and when i do
find her johnson boiler some one will

pay on the spot for the home fve lost
dn you hear ill suffer -suffer for it
perhaps but shell pay

  the spanish grandmother had risen
in beatrice and declared herself cold-
blooded assassination shook the air of an-
thonys rpartment his head spun he
wondered hysterically if there would be
much screaming before it was all over-
if the police and the lasande employees
would break in before the ghastly finish
of the affair there would lie just one
finish and it was written in those flaming
eyes written more clearly than any print

  and afterward well there would be
no afterward for anthony he under-
stood that perfectly yet he was too numb
to grieve just now fifteen minutes after
the worst had happened the lasande
would present him with a check covering
the balance of his lease and would re-
quest him to go such was the procedure
here and it had proved court-proof al-
together he could afford to laugh at them
he had merely to sit down and wait until
the news had traveled a bit marys father
or robert vining would attend to the
rest and there would be the end of an-
thony frys stately contented existence

  beatrice was gone

  flaming eyes heaving bosom pathetic-
little hat all ha vanished together but
they had vanishes down the corridor and
life leaped sudde lly through anthonys
veins even now there was a chance
faint and forlorn but still a chance to
save marys life at least he turned
did anthony fry just as johnson holler
fiew after his demented spouse and
glided into johnson boilers bedroom

  mary very white indeed was waiting

   where is she now she panted

   you heard

   of course i heard 

   miss mary said anthony  im
afraid that the time has come when well
have to stop planning and act the lady
is er -essentially crazy just now it is
painful enough but youll have to leave
as you are yes even without a hat
for she has that simply leave
opporitxtty



   and if im recognized

    it is unavoidable

  mary stamped her fool

   well it isnt and i think youre the
stupidest old man  ever knew she said
flatteringly as she sped to the closet
 here give me a hand with it

  with what

   the wardrobe trunk of course ive
been looking at ii and trying to get it
open but i cannot do it in there im
going out in that trunk

   eh said anthony tugging at it
quite stupidly

   open it mary commanded

   yes theres room and to spare if
youll lake out those drawers and things
the girl said quickly xo pile them
in the closet neatly shell look in there
xow about your man is he strong

   very i believe

   get him here quick said mary

  she seemed to have taken matters into
her own hands more she seemed to know
what she was about anthony after an
instant of blank staring pushed four
times on the button of johnson boilers
room which signal indicated that wilkins
was needed in a hurry

  some four or five seconds they stood
breathing hard both of them and listen-
ing for the sounds of disaster which miht
echo any minute from the corridor t ley
had not echoed when wilkins appea ed

  	you wilkins is your name mary
said  wilkins im going to get into the
trunk have you grasped that

   why -yes miss

   and you instantly are going to take
the trunk with me in it to my home
you know where that is you dont of
course well load the trunk into a taxi
and tell the man to go across to west end
avenue 

   and the corner of eighty-umpth
street anthony supplied

   exactly said the girl  go to the
side door and take in the trunk through
the yard of course and say that it is for
felice-felico moreau my maid have
vou the name wilkins

   felice moreau miss yes miss
said the blunderer

   and then take it to her room and
get out mary concluded  dont lock
the thing load it into the back of the
cab with yourself and try to get it open
a little so that ill have air when weve
started

  saying which mary dalton who knew
a really desperate situation when she saw
one and who also inherited much of her
fathers superb executive ability in a gen-
uine emergency mary gathered her
skirts and stepped into the trunk hud-
dling down as prettily and gracefully as
if it had been rehearsed for weeks

  she looked at wilkins and wilkins
with a sweep had closed the lid and
with a great emotional gulp wilkin-
looked at his master and said

    y rye sir a bit of all right that
mr fry

  anthony fry nodded quickly and
thrust several bills into his hand

   dont stand there talking about it
he said  get your hat and hustle wil-
kins take the first taxi you see and -
and handle her gently felice moreau
wilkins-remember that

    i shall indeed sir said the faithful
one and delicate consideration in every
finger he lifted the trunk and walked
into the living-room while anthony fry
held his breath and followed every move
with fascinated eyes

  through the room then went wilkins
and trunk together and to the door the
sober black felt affair he had used these
three years was on wilkinss head now
and he lugged the trunk onward -turned
in the outer hall and lugged it to the
freight elevator and now as anthony
watched from the doorway of his lately
peaceful home onto the freight elevator

  the door closed on the little car the
door closed on anthonys apartment with
anthony inside-and again he was that
stately dignified reticent and austere be-
ing the anthony fry of yesterday

   a trifle stiffly perhaps he moved to his
pet armchair and into it he sank with an


all-story weekly

undeniable thud grasping the arms fond-
ly as one might grasp a friend returned
from a long and perilous journey and
staring straight ahead

  amazing more than that dumfound-
ing five minutes back he had been se-
riously resigned to ruin and death now
he was quite utterly all right once more

  anthony looked about at all the fa-
miiiar things it seemed to him that he
had not seen them for a long long time
and that they stretched out welcoming
hands to him weakly he smiled and
rested his head in the well-worn spot on
the back

  what a wonderfully capable little per-
son she was why had none of them
thought of a trunk before or-what
matter if none of them had so that mary
had gained the inspiration she had
saved herself and she had saved anthony
-bless her little heart she had saved
everything because she was gone

  and she was perfectly safe in wilkinss
hands wilkins faithful powerful soul
would carry her tidily into the room of
the maid felice wherever that might lie
in daltons absurdly ornate pile and be-
tween felice and mary a story would be
arranged to cover everything momen-
tarily anthony frowned for he disap-
proved of mendacity in any form-but
there are some lies so much better than
the truth that shortly he smiled again
and hoped from the bottom of his heart
that marys lie would be a winner

  and now that all was well-anthony
sat upright quite abruptly all was not
exactly wtell as yet johnson boiler and
his wife were coming down the corridor
and almost as he heard them the lady
passed him

  she said nothing beatrice had passed
the talking stage cheeks white again
and eyes blazing she threw open the door
of anthonys chamber and shot inward
one fell the pause as she looked around
one heard the door of the closet open-
and then the door of the other closet
then one saw the pleasing beatrice again
as she shot out hat still in hand

  one lightning searing glance whizzed
over the calm anthony and the purple
perspiring johnson boiler then beatrice
had turned and hurtled into johnson boi-
lers room itself and johnson boiler
dropped into the chair beside anthony
and whined

    tts over said he  its over

   oh no- anthony said

    and you listen  this johnson boi-
ler thundered suddenly sitting up and
pointing one pudgy finger at his friend
 the poor kids crazy i cant stop her
shell kill the little skirl as sure as theres
a sky overhead and shell go to the chair
for it laughing and when she has gone
fry when its all over im going to shoot
you full of holes and then kill myself
get me this world isnt big enough for
you to gel away from me now i swear
to you-

   you might better dry up said an-
thony with his incomprehensible calm

  boiler turned dully beatrice was with
them again and yet there had been no
scream no crash there was about
beatrice nothing at all to suggest a wo-
man who has tasted the sweets of revenge
white lips shut she sailed past them on
her way to wilkinss pantry and his hum-
ble bedroom beyond

   didnt she find her choked boiler

   she didnt

   why not

    she isnt there

  	whered she go

  anthony smiled cynical condescension

   once in a while im able to manage
these things if im left alone he said
assuming much credit to which he had no
title

   well is she out of this flat johnson
boiler asked hopefully

   she certainly is you poor fool said
his host

  beatrice had finished her unlovely
hunt even again she was with them
and now she looked straight at johnson
boiler ignoring the very existence of an-
thony fry

   i havent found her said beatrice
opportunity



 shes hidden somewhere or else she
with other friends in this wretched sanc-
timonious hole

   beatrice- johnson boiler began
with a great hopeful gasp

   but i will find her the lady assured
him  and when i do im going now

   home

  momentarily beatrices eyes swam ii
seemed a good sign and johnson boiler
rose hurriedly the eyes ceased swim-
ming and blazed at him

   i am never going there again
beatrice informed him with the old chill-
ing calm  i shall go to a hotel and
later i hope back to father and mother
you will hear from my lawyers johnson
within a day or two

   but beatrice- johnson boiler pro-
tested that doesnt mean that youre
crazy enough to-to try divorcing me

    i am not crazy and there will be very
little trouble about it johnson the lady
said gravely  that is what it means
good-by

  a moment she paused before johnson
boiler looking him up and down with a
scorn so terrible that innocent or other-
wise he cringed visibly another mo-
ment her eyes seemed to soften a little
for they were deep and wonderful mad-
deningly beautiful but millions of miles
from the unworthy creature who had
once called them his own this appar-
ently was beatrices fashion of saving an
eternal good-by to one she had once loved
-for having looked and thrilled him she
moved on and the door closed behind
her

  she means it  croaked johnson
boiler

   shell cool down said anthony

  she will not and --she means it-
cried his friend wrath rising by great
leaps  shes going to sue me for di-
vorce- me that never even looked a
chicken in the eye on the street shes
going to bust up our happy little home
anthony and its your fault

   poppycock said his host

  that be damned stated johnson

boiler and this time lie actually howled
the foul words  thats what she wants
to do and i dont blame her but sheli
never do it anthony your reputations
all right-its unfortunate for the girl of
course but im going to stop her

    itow-

  	im going to tell the cold truth and
make the girl back it up

   hey

   i owe something to myself and to
beatrice and i dont owe anything to you
or the dalton girl wheres my hat

  anthony gripped him suddenly

   are you cur enough said he angri-
ly to sacrifice miss dalton simply to-

   you bet i am said johnson boiler
 if it comes down to that the truth cant
hurt her and any little odds and ends of
things that happen before all hands un-
derstand the truth will happen to you -
not me

  anthony smiled wickedly

   just listen to me a moment before
you start he said curtly

   listen to what

   something i have to say which will
interest you very much this trifling
family affair of yours isnt nearly so se-
rious as you fancy in a day or two or a
week or two it will all blow over- and if
it doesnt you may thank your lucky stars
to be rid of a woman so infernally unrea-
sonable said anthony  but im
hanged if ill permit you to sacrifice that
girl

   ho said johnson boiler derisively
 how are you going to stop it

   in just this way anthony con-
tinued suavely  you breathe just one
word of the truth johnson and  will
tell a story which involves you and while
there will not be a word of truth in it it
will get over in great shape because
everybody knows that im a man whose
word is as good as his bond ill tell such
a story about you as will raise the very
hair on your head and have an infuriated
mob after you before the papers have
been on the street for twenty minutes
do you understand


all-story week ly

   the mysterious woman will be an in-
nocent country girl i think who came
here to make a living and lift the mort-
gage on the old farm and whom you ap-
proached on the street and finally daz-
zled with a few lobster palaces shell
be beautiful and virtuous johnson and
i think shell tell me in tears how you
fed her the first cocktail she ever tasted
shell-

  wait johnson boiler said in a
hoarse voice

   that is the merest outline of the
story  shall tell and when ive had time
to work out the details ill guarantee
that beatrice will never even consent to
live in the same city with you-even if
you bring sworn proofs of the storys fal-
sity ill represent you to be a thing ab-
horred by all half-way decent men and
even shunned by self-respecting dogs
dont think im bluffing about it either

johnson  mean to protect mary dal-
ton

  there is a vast difference between the
coarse rough character however bluster-
ingly impressive he may be and the truly
strong one frequently the one is mis-
taken for the other but under the first
real stress the truth comes out

  johnson boiler for example looking
into his friends coldly shining eye did
not draw himself up and freeze anthony
with his conscious virtue he did puff
out his cheeks defiantly to be sure and
mutter incoherently but that lasted for
only a few seconds

  then the eye won and johnson boiler
dropping into his chair again likewise
dropped his head into his hands and
groaned queerly

  anthony looking contempt at him
fancied thathe wept

  anthonv sneered and smiled

to be concluded next week dont forget this magazine is issued weekly and that
you will get the conclusion of this story without waiting a month

charley elske leader of the
band and orchestra of wards
magnificent minstrels at break-
fast in the troupes private car stirred his
coffee and gazed out the window heisty
varin comedian sat across i he table
two or three minutes went by and fiske
still gazed heisty stood it as long as he
could

  come out of it charley he said
 whats ihe matter -homesick

    not me replied the leader smiling
 i was just thinking of jimmy kagan
our last seasons solo tenor to-morrows
town is greenville isnt it

   it is said heisty  hut what of it
did jimmy come from greenville

   yes he used to be a clerk in a
hardware store there he had a wonder-
ful tenor voice and did a lot of singing
around in amateur shows and for clubs
one night about six years ago ward and
his bunch attended a social session of the
elks at greenville and ward heard jim-
my sing next day he joined the tenor
out with the minstrels

   thats the way he got me in peoria
said heisty  only i was in a cafe

   ill never forget about jimmy
fiske went on  he was in love with a
greenville girl but he had a rival whose
father was wealthy jimmy wasnt earn-
ing more than ten a week when the min-
strels dropped into town when ward
offered him fifteen and cakes to sing tenor
solos with the troupe he went to the girl
and without mentioning the show propo-
sition asked her to tell him if she intend-
ed to marry him she said she cared a
whole lot for him but didnt think he
could support her as befitted her station
in life can you beat that a station
in life in greenville

   turned him down eh

   flat it broke jimmy all up he
found ward without delay and joined out
with the show most of the details were
learned bv the boys after the new tenor
had become acquainted with the bunch
and had become confidential

   say but that boy could sing and
believe me or not the turn-down the girl
gave him mellowed his voice and made
him throw his heart into his work tie
used to try to forget her except when he
was singing his solo then it seemed he


all-story weekly

appeared to be singing to her he ad-
mitted to me once that he pictured her in
his mind when he sang he had a solo
called  theres nobody just like you
and every time he spilled it tears would
come in his eyes

   sentimental guy eh

   l should say so

   what about the girl

   she married the other fellow a month
after jimmy quit greenville they set-
tled down and got along all right  guess
all greenville knew about the turn-down
of jimmy

   the next season when we went back
to the town a dozen people asked me
about jimmy and they w-ere all disap-
pointed to learn he wasnt with us that
year they told me they really believed
the girl loved jimmy but then - you
know how people in small towns talk i
used to see the girl at the show every
time we played the town she always
sat in the right stage-box and i used to
kid myself into the idea that she attended
in the hope that jimmy might appear

   fagan only stayed with the troupe
one season i understand

   he was with us that one season and
then went to baltimore to live he got
a job singing in a big church there but
he came back last season he hadnt
been in greenville for four or live years

   last season we approached jimmys
home from the south a couple of days
before we struck it who should bob up
but jimmy he walks up to the crowd
while were giving our street concert in
guthrie and almost disrupts the whole
affair with his hand-shaking and old-
home stuff more than a dozen of the
boys knew him from his first season and
everybody was tickled to see him

   ward asks him what hes doing and
jimmy says hes figuring on joining out
with the show again ward was delight-
ed the result was when we left guthrie
that night jimmy fagan was in his old
berth on the car and was on the program
for a tenor solo his voice was just as
good as ever

   next morning he handed me the or-
chestration of a new song entitled  i
love you still and told me he was
going to use it in the first part it was a
pretty ballad-one a fellow as senti-
mental as jimmy could make stick out
anywhere jimmy said it wasnt pub-
lished and i didnt ask him any more
about it  rehearsed the orchestra in it
and by the time we reached greenville
jimmy was ready to sing it

   wed ail forgotten about jimmys
romance being pretty busy it didnt
occur to me at first that greenville was
jimmys old home and the home of his
lost love he didnt say a word about
it but  was reminded of it that after-
noon when  saw people greeting the
tenor on the street and again later when
i saw him walking past the home of the
girl and looking at it in what  thought
was a wistful way

   lie was across the street and appar-
ently so nervous he was almost tiptoeing
along i was passing in an automobile
accompanied by a local man and he
pointed out the girls house and told the
old story of the tenors romance just
about that time i noticed jimmy and it
immediately occurred to me that jimmy
hadnt forgotten by a whole lot

   at supper time in the car i ventured
to remark that id seen him near his old
llames home but he passed it off with a
grin it didnt appear to me that he was
bothered much

   but listen heistv that night at
the show jimmy set the whole town talk-
ing the fact that he was with the com-
pany had spread all over town it also
became noised about that the girl was to
sit in the right stage-box at the evening
performance accompanied by her mother
greenville was all worked up by  pm
everybody wondered if jimmy had for-
gotten ward afterward told me the cu-
riosity on the part of the people to see
how jimmy and the girl would act added
two hundred dollars to the gross receipts

   the boys in the company whispered
jimmys romance all through the dress-
jimmy i-agans lost loyf



ing-rooms before the curtain went up
and when billy mahan the clog-dancer
looked through the peep-hole and saw the
girl in the box the troupe was a mass of
subdued excitement all but jimmy he
was as cool as a cucumber and pretend-
ed not to hear the conversation flying
around

   jimmy had the red on and all in all
he was a mighty pretty picture for a girl
to look at when the curtain was lifted
jimmy sat in his chair in the semicircle
only about seven feet from the girl so
far as we could see he didnt look at her
once until his turn came to sing then
he looked you bet your life

    i take great pleasure said i lari
wells the interlocutor stepping to the
lootlights  in announcing that jimmy
fagan a native of this city will next fa-
vor us with a tenor ballad entitled  
love you still 

   starting the first verse jimmy
looked squarely at the girl and -sav boy
but he sang it seemed as though he was
trying to rebuke her with his art if thats
a good way to put it he threw his heart
and soul into the song and tears appeared
in his eyes the audience was absolutely
noiseless as though spellbound jimmy
shot that little love-ditty straight at her
as for the girl-well she sat there like a
bump on a log

   the chorus was real love stuff it
went like this

     i love you still  love you still

    no powr on earth my love ran kill

    whereer you arc vvhateer you be

    you still are all in all to me

   that was the sort of sentiment the
song contained and jimmy poured it
into that girls ears laden with what
seemed to be the heartaches of a lost
love the people in the audience looked
from him to her and back again the
girl grinned and seemed a bit uneasy

   when jimmy sat down the applause
was a riot he took three bows but
that didnt satisfy the crowd so he
sang a third verse and concluded with
the chorus all the while shooting his

gaze across the footlights into- the eyes
of the girl in the box

   when the audience finally quieted
down jimmy slipped out of his chair
and went to his dressing-room we
didnt see him any more until we reached
the car there we found him asleep in
his berth next morning he appeared
to be as happy as ever nobody men-
tioned the girl or the way he sang to
her as everybody feared hed be em-
barrassed

    we werent due to leave greenville
until i i am about io oclock jimmy
and i strolled up-town and into the post-
office to see if there was any mail for
the troupe a group of about fifteen
o the townspeople was there when
they saw jimmy curiosity began work-
ing on them finally an old fellow with
white whiskers decided to quiz the tenor
a bit he approached jimmy with the
rest of the gathering at strict attention

  	howdy jimmy he said

  why howdy mr barnes the
tenor replied

    um-er you ben away from town
about four and a half year now aint
you

     something like that

     um-er well  heered you sing last
 night

  you did

  yep um-er nice song that

    the townspeople were edging closer
each one was at attention

     you liked the song eh came from
jimmy

     great said the old man  it jest
 seemed to-er fit the occasion

     it did

    yep i bet you wrote that song
verself

     no i didnt jimmy replied  i
received it from baltimore four days ago

     well who did write it

     my wife

back a pace amazed

     oh h- he exclaimed

   jimmy had told the truth too

chapter xvi

dancer and dignity

id you carry her that way all
the way home

frances asked the question ab-
ruptly like one throwing down some
troublesome and heavy thing that she had
labored gallantly to conceal it was the
first word that she had spoken since they
had taken refuge from their close-pressing

thi story began in the all-story weekly for january 



 pursuers in the dugout that some old-
 time homesteader had been driven away
 from by chadrons cowboys

   macdonald was keeping his horse back
 from the door with the barrel of his rifle
 while he peered out cautiously again
 perplexed as to why dalton had not led
 his men against them in a charge

     xot all the way frances she rode
 behind me till she got so cold and sleepy
 i was afraid shed fall off
the holy scare



   yes ill bet she put on half of it
she said spitefully  she looked strong
enough when you put her down there at
the gate

  this unexpected little outburst of jeal-
ousy was pleasant to his ears above
the trouble of that morning and of the
future which was charged with it to the
blackness of complete obscuration her
warrant of affection was like a lifting
sunbeam of hope

   i cant figure out what dalton and
that gang mean by this said he the
present danger again pressing ahead of
the present joy

    saw a man dodge behind that big
rock across there a minute ago she
said

   you keep back away from that door
-dont lean over out of that corner
he admonished almost harshly  if you
get where you can see you can be seen
dont forget that

  he resumed his watch at the little hole
that he had drilled beside the weight-
bowed jamb of the door in the earth front
of their refuge she sat silent in her
dark corner across from him only now
and then shaking her glove at the horses
when one of them pricked up his ears and
showed a desire to dodge out into the
sunlight anti pleasant grazing spread on
the hillside

  it was cold and moldy in the dugout
and the timbers across the roof were bent
under the weight of the earth it looked
unsafe but there was only one place in
it that a bullet could come through and
that was the open door there was no
way to shut that the original battens
of the homesteader lay under foot broken
apart and rotting

  well it beats me said he his eye
to the peep-hole in the wall

  if id keep one of the horses on this
side it wouldnt crowd your corner so
she suggested

   it would be better only theyll cut
loose at anything that passes the door
theyll show their hand before long

  he enlarged the hole to admit his rifie-

     	a-s

barrel she watched him in silence
which was just as well for she had no
words to express her admiration for his
steadiness and courage under the trying
pressure of that situation her confi-
dence in him was so entire that she had
no fear it did not admit a question of
their safe deliverance with him at her
side this dangerous grave matter seemed
but a passing perplexity she left it to
him with the confidence and up-looking
trust of a child who does not fully under-
stand

  while she understood the peri of their
situation fear doubt had no place in her
mind she was under the protection of
man macdonald the infallible

  xo matter what others may think of
a mans infallibility it is only a danger-
ous one who considers himself endowed
with that more than human attribute
macdonald did not share her ease of mind
as he stood with his eye to the squint-
hole that he had bored beside the rotting
jamb

   how did you find her where was
she she asked her thoughts more on
the marvel of xolas return than her own
present danger

   i lost thorns trail that first day
he returned  and then things began to
get so hot for us up the valley that 
had to drop the search and get those
people back to safety ahead of chadrons
raid yesterday afternoon we caught a
man trying to get through our lines and
down into the valley he was a half-
breed trapper who lives up in the foot-
hills carrying a note down to chadron
ive got that curious piece of writing
around me somewhere-you can read it
when this blows by anyway it was
from thorn demanding ten thousand
dollars in gold he wanted it sent back
by the messenger and he prescribed some
picturesque penalties in case of failure on
chadrons part

   and then you found her

   i couldnt very well ask anybody else
to go after her he admitted with a
modest reticence that amounted almost


all-story weekly

to being ashamed  after i made sure
that we had chadrons raiders cooped up
where they couldnt get out i went up
and got her thorn wasnt there nobody
but the indian woman the  breeds
wife she was the jailer a regular wild-
cat of a woman

  that was all of it it seemed as far
as macdonald was concerned me had
the hole in the wall at which he had
worked as he talked to his liking now
and was squinting through it like a tele-
scope

   xola wasnt afraid to come with you
she said positively

   she didnt appear to lie frances

   xo she knew she was safe no mat-
ter how little she deserved any kindness
at your hands  know what she did
j know how she-how she-struck you
in the face that time

   oh said he as if reminded of a
trifle that he had forgotten

   did she-put her arms around your
neck that way many times while you were
carrying her home

   she did not many times why
she didnt do it even once

    oh at the gate i saw her

  he said nothing for a little while only
stood with head bent as if thinking it
over

    well she didnt get very far with it
he said quite seriously  anyway she
was asleep then and didnt know what she
was doing it was just the subconscious
reaching up of a falling or dreaming
child

  she was not a little amused in a quick
turn from her serious bent of jealousy
at his long and careful explanation of
the incident she laughed and the little
green cloud that had troubled her blew
away on the gale of her mirth

  oh well said she from her deep
corner across the bright oblong of the
door tossing it all away from her  do
you think theyll go away and let us
come out after a while

   i dont believe theyve got any such
intention if it doesnt come to a fight

before then i believe well have to drive
the horses out ahead of us after dark
and try to get away under the confusion
you should have gone on frances when
i told you

  the horses were growing restive mov-
ing stamping snorting and becoming
quarrelsome together macdonalds little
range animal had a viciousness in it and
would not make friends with the chestnut
cavalry horse it squealed and bit and
even tried to use its heels at every friend-
ly approach

  macdonald feared that so much com-
motion might bring the shaky rotten
roof down on them a hoof driven
against one of the timbers which sup-
ported it might do the trick and bring
them to a worse end than the waiting
bullets of dalton and his gang

   fll have to risk putting that horse
of yours over on your side he told her
 stand ready to catch him but dont
lean a hair past the door

  he turned the horse and gave it a slap
as it crossed the bar of light falling
through the door a shot cracked among
the rocks the bullet knocked earth over
him as it smacked in the facing of the
door the man who had fired had shot
obliquely there being no shelter directly
in front and that fact had saved the
horse

  macdonald peered through his loophole
he could not see the smoke but he let
them know that he was primed by de-
livering a shot at random the answer
was a volley a bullet or two striking the
rear wall of the cave

  after that they waited for what might
come between then and night they said
little for each was straining with unpleas-
ant thoughts and anxieties and put to
constant watchfulness to keep the horses
from slewing around into the line of fire
every time a tail switched out into the
streak of light a bullet came nipping in
sometimes macdonald let the shots go
unanswered and again he would spring
up and drive away at the rocks which
he knew sheltered dalton and his men
the holy scare



almost driven tothe point of rushing out
and trying to dislodge them by storm

  so the day wore by they had been
in the dugout since a little after sunrise
sunset was pale on the hilltops beyond
them when macdonald his strained and
tired eyes to the loophole saw dalton
and two of his men slipping from rock
to rock drawing nearer for what he ex-
pected to be the rush

    can you shoot he asked her his
mouth hot and dry as if his blood had
turned to liquid fire

   yes i can shoot she answered
steadily

  he tossed one of his revolvers across
to her dimly seen now in the deepening
gloom of the cave and hung a handful
of cartridges after it

   theyre closing in on us for the rush
and im going to try to stop them keep
back there where you are and hold your
horse under cover as long as you hear
me shooting if  stop first call dalton
and tell him who you are i believe in
that case liell let you go

   im going to help you she said
rising resolutely  when you-stop
shooting  she choked a little over the
words her voice caught in a dry little
sob-then ill stop shooting too

   stay back there frances do you
hear-stay back

  somebody was on the roof of the dug-
out under his weight clods of earth fell
and then with a soft breaking of rotten
timber a booted foot came through it
was on francess side and the fellows
foot almost touched her saddle as her
frightened horse plunged

  the man was tugging to drag his foot
through the roof now earth and broken
timber showering down macdonald only
glanced over his shoulder as if leaving
that trapped one to her he was set for
their charge in front she raised her
revolver as the other leg broke through
and the fellows body dropped into the
enlarged hole at that moment the men
in front fired a volley through the gaping
door frances saw the intruder drop to

the ground torn by the heavy bullets
from his companions guns

  the place was full of smoke and the
turmoil of the frightened horses and the
roise of quick shots from macdonalds
station across the door she could not
make anything out in the confusion as
she turned from the dead man to face
the door only that macdonald was not
at his place at the loophole now

  she called him but her voice was noth-
ing in the sound of firing a choking
volume of smoke was packing into the
cave she saw macdonalds horse lower
its head and dash out with a whip of its
tail like a defiance of her authority then
in a moment everything was still out
there with a fearful suddenness

  she jlung herself into the cloud of
smoke that hung in the door sobbing
macdonalds name she stumbled into
the fresh sweet air almost blind in her
anxiety and the confusion of that quickly
enacted scene her head bent as if to run
under the bullets which she expected

  she did not see how- it happened she 
did not know that he was there but his
arm was supporting her his coo hand
was on her forehead stroking her face
as if he had plucked her drowning from
the sea

   where are they she asked only
to exclaim and shrink closer to him at
the sight of one lying a few rods away
in that sprawling limp posture of those
who fall by violence

   there were only four of them- there
the other two go he pointed down the
little swale where the tall grass was still
green macdonalds horse had fallen to
grazing there his masters perils and es-
capes all one to him now it threw its
head up and stood listening trotted a
little way and stopped ears stiff nostrils
stretched

   theres somebody coming she said

   yes-chadron and a fresh gang
maybe

  he sprang to the dugout door where
francess horse stood with its head out
inquiringly


all-story weekly

  jump up-quick he said bringing
the horse out  go this time frances
dont hang back a second more

   never mind alan she said from
the other side of the horse  its the
cavalry-i guess theyve come after me

  major king was at the head of the
detail of seven men which rode up horses
a lather of sweat he threw himself from
the saddle and hurried to frances his
face full of the liveliest concern mac-
donald stepped around to meet him

   thank heaven youre not hurt th
major said

   xo but we thought we were in for
another fight she told him offering him
her hand in the gratefulness of her relief
he almost snatched it in his eagerness
and drew her toward him and stood
holding it in proprietory way  mr
macdonald-

   the scoundrels heard us coming and
ran we got a glimpse of them down
there chadron will have to answer for
this outrage the major said

   major king this is mr macdonald
said she firmly breaking down the high
manner in which the soldier persisted in
overlooking the homesteader

  major kings face flushed he drew
back a hasty step as macdonald offered
his hand in the frank and open manner
of an equal man who raised no thought
nor question on that point

   sir fve been hearing of the gallant
rescue that you made of another young
lady this morning he said with sneering
emphasis  you are hardly the kind of
a man  shake hands with

  the troopers sitting their blowing
horses a rod away made their saddles
creak as they shifted to see this little
dash of melodrama macdonalds face
was swept by a sudden paleness as if a
sickness had come over him he clenched
his lean jaw hard the firmness of his
mouth was grimmer still as his hand
dropped slowly to his side frances
looked her indignation and censure into
major kings hot eyes

   mr macdonald has defended me like

a gallant gentleman sir those ruffians
didnt run because they heard you com-
ing but because he faced them out here
in the open single-handed and alone and
drove them to their horses major king
the troopers were looking macdonald
over with favor they had seen the evi-
dence of his stand against chadrons men

   youre deceived in your estimation
of the fellow miss landcraft the major
returned red to the eyes in his offended
dignity  i arrived at the ranch not an
hour ago detailed to escort you back
to the post will you have the kindness
to mount at once please

  he stepped forward to give her a hand
into the saddle but macdonald was
before him in that office urged to it by
the message of her eyes from the sad-
dle she leaned and gave him her hand

   your men need you mr macdonald
go to them she said  my prayers
for your success in this fight for the right
will follow you

  macdonald was standing bareheaded at
her stirrup her hand lingered a moment
in his her eyes sounded the bottom of his
soul major king with his little up-
rising of dignity was a very small matter
in the homesteaders mind just then al-
though a minute past he had fought with
himself to keep from twisting the arrogant
officers neck

  she fell in beside major king who
was sitting his saddle grim enough in
his way now and they rode away mac-
donald stood hat in hand the last sun-
beams of that day over his fair tangled
hair the smoke of his conflict on his face
the tender light of a mans most sacred
fire in his eyes

chapter xyit

boots and saddles

when major king delivered fran-
ces-his punctilious military ob-
servance made her home-coming
nothing less-to colonel landcraft they
found that grizzled warrior in an elec-
the holy scare



trical state of excitement- he was mov-
ing in quick little charges but with a
certain grim system in all of them be-
tween desk and bookcases letter files
cabinets and back to his desk again he
drew a document here tucked one away
there snipped an elastic about others
assembled on his desk and clapped a
sheaf of them in his pocket

  major king saluted within the door

   i have the honor to report the safe
return of the detachment despatched to
alamito ranch for the convoy of miss
landcraft he said

  colonel landcraft returned the salute
and stood stiffly while his officer spoke

   very well sir said he then fling-
ing away his official stiffness he met
erances half way as she ran to meet him
and enfolded her to his breast just as if
his dry old heart knew that she had come
tc him through perils

  breathlessly she told him the story
leaving no word unsaid that would mount
to the credit of alan macdonald colonel
landcraft was as hot as blazing straw
over the matter he swore that he would
roast saul chadrons heart on his sword
and snatched that implement from the
chair where it hung as he spoke and
buckled it on with trembling hand

  king interposed to tell him that chad-
ron was not at the ranch and begged
the colonel to delegate to him the office
of avenger of this insult and hazard that
erances had suffered at the hands of his
men for a moment colonel landcraft
held the young officers eye with thankful
expression of admiration then he drew
himself up as if in censure for wasted
time saluted took a paper from his desk
and said

   it must fall to you major king to
demand the reparation for this outrage
that i shall not be here to enforce  am
ordered to washington sir to make my
appearance before the retiring board
the department has vested the command
of this post in you sir-here is the order
my soldiering days are at an end

  he handed the paper to major king

with a salute with a salute the young
officer took it from his hand an eager
light in his eyes a flush springing to his
pale face frances clung to her fathers
arm a little trembling moan on her lips
as if she had received a mortal hurt

   never mind never mind dear heart
said the old man a shake in his own
voice frances looking up with her great
pity into his stern set face saw a tear
stealing down his cheek toughened by the
fires of thirty years campaigns

   ill never soldier any more he said
 the politicians have got me theyve
been after me a long time and theyve
got me but there is one easement in
my disgrace-

   dont speak of it on those terms
sir implored major king more a man
than a soldier as he laid a consoling hand
on the old mans arm

  no no said erances clinging to
her fathers hand

  colonel landcraft smiled looking from
one to the other of them and a softness
came into his face he took major kings
hand and carried it to join francess and
she in her softness for her father allowed
it to remain in the young soldiers grasp

   there is one gleam of joy in the
sundown of my life the colonel said
 and that is in seeing my daughter
pledged to a soldier  must live in the
reflection of your achievements if i live
beyond this disgrace sir

   i will try to make them worthy of
my mentor sir major king returned

  frances stood with bowed head the
major still holding her hand in his ardent
grasp

  its a crushing blow to come before
the preferment in rank that i have been
led to expect would be my retiring com-
pensation the colonel turned from
them sharply as if in pain and walked
in marching stride across the room
frances withdrew her hand with a little
struggle not softened by the appeal in
the majors eyes

   my poor wife is bowed under it the
colonel spoke as he marched back and

forth  she has hoped with me for some
fitting reward for the years of service i
have unselfishly given to my country sir
for the surrender of my better self to the
army ill never outlive it  feel that
ill never outlive it

  colonel landcraft had no thought apart
from what he felt to be his hovering
disgrace he had forgotten his rage
against chadron forgotten that his
daughter had lived through a day as
hazardous as any that he had experienced
in the apache campaigns or in his bleak
watches against the sioux he turned to
her now where she stood weeping softly
with bowed head the grime of the dug-
out on her habit her hair its bonds
broken straying over her face

   i had counted pleasurably on seeing
you two married he said  but some-
thing tells me i shall never come back
from this journey never resume command
of this post he turned back to his
marching stopped three or four paces
along turned sharply a new light in his
face  why shouldnt it be before i
leave-to-night within the hour

    oh father said frances in terrified
voice lifting her face in its tear-wet love-
liness

   i must make that train that leaves
meander at four oclock to-morrow morn-
ing i shall have to leave here within -
he flashed out his watch with his quick
nervous hand- within three-quarters of
an hour what do you say major king
are you ready

   i have been ready at any time for
two years major king replied in trem-
bling eagerness

  frances was thrown into such a mental
turmoil by the sudden proposal that she
could not at that moment speak a fur-
ther protest she stood with white face
her heart seeming to shrivel and fall away
to laboring faintness colonel landcraft
was not considering her fie was think-
ing that he must have three hours sleep
in the hotel at meander before the train
left for omaha

  t then we shall have the wedding at

once just as you stand he declared
i well have the chaplain in and-go and
tell your mother child and-oh well
throw on another dress if you like
frances found her tongue as her dan-
ger of being married in that hot and hasty
manner grew imminent

   im not going to marry major king
father now or at any future time said
she speaking slowly her words coming
with coldness from her lips

   silence you have nothing to say
nothing to do but obey colonel land-
craft blazed up in sudden explosion after
his manner and set his heel down hard
on the floor making his sword clank in
its scabbard on his thigh

   i have not had much to say frances
admitted bitterly  but i am going to
have a great deal to say in this matter
now both of you have gone ahead about
this thing just as if  was irresponsible
both of you-

   hold your tongue miss i command
you-hold your tongue

   its the farthest thing from my heart
to give you pain or disappoint you in
your calculations of me father she told
him her voice gathering power her words
speed for she was a warrior like himself
only that her balance was not so easily
overthrown  but t am not going to
marry major king

  heaven and hell said colonel
landcraft stamping up and down

   heaven or hell said she  and not
hell-if i can escape it

   ill not permit this insubordination
in a member of my family roared the
colonel his face fiery his rumpled eye-
brows knitted in a scowl ill have obe-
dience with good grace and at once or
damn my soul youll leave my house
 major king if you are a gentleman
sir you will relieve me of this unwelcome
pressure to force me against my inclina-
tion it is quite useless sir  tell you
most earnestly i would rather die than
marry you-i would rather die

   sir i have no wish to coerce the
lady- major kings voice shook his
the holy scare



words were low- as she seems to have
no preference for me sir miss landcraft
perhaps has placed her heart somewhere
else

   she has no right to act with such
treachery to me and you sir the colonel
said  ill not have it where else sir
-who

   spare me the humiliation of inform-
ing you begged major king with avert-
ed face with sorrow in his voice

   oh you slanderous coward frances
assailed him with scorn of word and look
colonel landcraft was shaking a trem-
bling finger at her his face thrust within
a foot of her own

   ill not have it youll not-who is
the fellow who

   there is nothing to conceal there is
no humiliation on my part in speaking
his name but pride-the highest pride
of my heart

  she stood back from them a little her
lofty head thrown back her face full of
color now the strength of defense of the
man she loved in her brave brown eyes

   some low poltroon some sneaking
civilian-

   he is a man father-you have grant-
ed that his name is-

  stop thundered the colonel
heaven and hell will you disgrace
me by making a public confession of your
shame leave this room before you
drive me to send you from it with a
curse 

  in her room frances heard the horses
come to the door to carry her father
away she had sat there trembling and
hot sorry for his foolish rage hurt by his
narrow injustice yet she had no bitter-
ness in her heart against him for she be-
lieved that she knew him best when his
passion had fallen he would come to her
lofty still but ashamed and they would
put it behind them as they had put other
differences her mother had gone to
share the last moments of his presence
and to intercede for her now frances
listened her hot cheek in her hand her
eyes burning her heart surging in fevered

stroke there was a good deal of coming
and going before the house men came up
and dismounted others rode away
watching her face against the cool pane
she did not see her father leave yet he
had not come to her and the lime for his
going was past

  tier heart was sore and troubled at the
thought that perhaps he had gone with-
out the word of pacification between
them it was almost terrifying to her to
think of that she ran down the stairs
and stood listening at his closed door

  that was not his voice that heavy
growl that animal note saul chadrons
no other her mother came in through
the front door weeping and clasped
frances in her arms as she stood there
shadowy in the light of the dim hall-
lamp

   he is gone she said

  frances did not speak but for the
first time in her life a feeling of bitter-
ness against her father for his hardness
of heart and unbending way of injustice
lifted itself in her breast she led her
mother to her own room giving her such
comfort as she could put into words

   he said he never marched out to sure
defeat before mrs landcraft told her
 ive seen him go many a time frances
but never with such a pain in my heart
as to-night

  and saul chadron was the man who
had caused his going frances knew a
new illumination having come over the
situation since hearing his voice in the
colonels office a few minutes past chad-
ron had been at meander telegraphing to
the cattlemens servants in washington
he had demanded the colonels recall
and the substitution of major king be-
cause he wanted a man in authority at
the post whom he could use

  this favoritism of chadron made her
distrustful at once of major king there
must be some scheming and plotting
afoot she went down and stood in the
hall again not even above bending to
listen at the keyhole chadron was talk-
ing again she felt that he must have


all-story weekly

been talking all the time that she had
been away it must be an unworthy
cause that needed so much pleading she
thought

   well hell not shoot i tell you king
hes loo smart for that hell have to be
trapped into it if youve got to have an
excuse to fire on them-and  cant see
where it comes in king damn my neck
if i can-weve got to set a trap

   leave that to me returned major
king coldly

   how much force are you authorized
to use-

  	the order leaves that detail to me
 sufficient force to restore order it says

   i think you ought to take a troop at
the least king and a cannon-maybe
two

    i dont think artillery will be neces-
sary sir

   well ill leave it to you king but
id hate like hell to take you up there and
have that feller lick you you dont
know him like i do i tell you hed lay
on his back and fight like a catamount

  	can you locate them in the night

   i think wed have to wait up there

somewheres for daybreak im not just
sure which canon it is

  there was silence erances peeped
through the keyhole but could see noth-
ing except thick smoke over bookcases
and files

   well well not want to dislodge them
before daylight anyway said king

   if macdonald can back off without a
fight hell do it chadron declared  for
he knows as well as you and i what it d
mean to fire on the troops and i want
you to git him king and make sure
youve got him

   it depends largely on whether the
fellow can be provoked into firing on us
chadron you think he can be so do i
but in case he doesnt the best we can
do will be to arrest him

  	what good would he be to me ar-
rested king i tell you i want his scalp
and if you bring that feller out of there
in a sack youll come back a brigadier i

put you where youre at well i can put
you higher just as easy but the purty i
want for my trouble is that fellers scalp
there was the sound of somebody
walking about in quick nervous strides
frances knew that major king had got
up from his usurped place at the desk-
place unworthily filled this low intrigue
with chadron aside she knew-and was
strutting in the shadow of his promised
glory

   leave it to me chadron ive got my
own account to square with that wolf of
the range

  a sharp little silence in which frances
could picture chadron looking at king in
his covert man-weighing way then
chadron

  	king ive noticed now and then that
you seemed to have a soft spot in your
gizzard for that little girl of mine well
ill throw her in to boot if you put this
thing through right is it a go

   id hesitate to bargain for the young
lady without her being a party to the
business king replied whether from
wisdom born of his recent experience or
through lack of interest in the proposal
frances could not read in his voice

   oh shed jump at you like a bull-
frog at red flannel chadron assured
him  i could put your uniform on a
wooden man and marry him off to the
best girl in seven states they never
think of lookin under a soldiers vest
 you flatter me mr chadron and
the uniform of the united states army
returned king with barely covered con-
tempt  suppose we aliow events to
shape themselves in regard to miss chad-
ron shell hardly be entertaining mar-
riage notions yet-after her recent expe-
rience

  chadron got up so quickly he over-
turned his chair

   by god sir do you mean to inti-
mate you wouldnt have her after whal
shes gone through well ill put a bul-
let through any man that says-

  oh hold yourself in chadron theres
no call for this
the holy scare



  kings cold contempt would have been
like a lash to a man of finer sensibilities
than saul chadron as it was frances
could hear the heavy cattleman breathing
like a mad bull

   when you talk about my little girl
king go as easy as if you was carryin
quicksilver in a dish you told me she
was all right a little while ago and i tell
you i dont like-

   miss chadron was as bright as a red-
bird when i saw her this afternoon king
assured him calmly  she has suffered
no harm at the hands of macdonald and
his outlaws

   hell dance in hell for that trick be-
fore the sun goes down on another day
 flis big play for sympathy fell flat
said king with a contemptuous laugh
 there wasnt much of a crowd on hand
when he arrived at the ranch

  silence a little shifting of feet a
growl from chadron and a curse

    but as for your proposal involving
miss chadron i am honored by it said
king

  any man would be chadron de-
clared

   and ve will just let it stand waiting
the ladys sanction

  that brightened chadron up he
moved about and there was a sound as
if he had slapped the young officer on
the back in pure comradeship and open
admiration

   whats your scheme for drawin that
feller into firin on your men he asked

   well talk it over as we go said
king as a bugle lifted its sharp electrify-
ing note in the barracks

   boots and saddles chadron said

   yes we march at nine oclock

chapter xviii

the trail of the coffee

ou done right to come to the mis-
y sion after me for id ride to the
gate-post of hell to turn a trick
agn saul chadron

  banjos voice had a quaver of earnest-
ness in it that needed no daylight to en-
force the pitchy night made a bobbing
blur of him as he rode his quick-stepping
little horse at frances landcrafts side

   yes you owe him one frances ad-
mitted

   and ill pay him before mornin or it
wont be no fault of mine that there
little ten-cent-size major hed a stopped
you if hed a known you was goin dont
you suppose

   im sure he would have mr gibson
   which said banjo

   banjo she corrected

   now that sounds more comfort-
abler he told her  i didnt know for
a minute who you meant that names
gittin to be a stranger to me

   well we dont want a stranger along
to-night said she seriously

    youre right we dont that there
horse youre ridin hes a good one as
good as any in the calvary even if he
aint as tall he was an outlawr till mis-
sus mathews tamed him down

   how did she do it-not break him
like a bronco buster

  i o she done it like she tames in-
juns and other folks by gentle words and
gentler hands some theyll tell you shes
sunk down to the ways of injuns clean
out of a white mans sight in the dirt and
doins of them dead-horse eatin rapa-
hoes but i know she aint she lets
herself down on a level to reach em and
git her hands under em so she can lift
em up the same as she puts herself 
my level when she wants to reach me or
your level or anybodys level mom

    her eyes and her soft ways tell you
that banjo as plain as any words

   shes done ten times as much as that
big-backed buffalo of a preacher shes
married to ever done for his own people
or ever will fles dim above em with
his educated ways the injuns ironed
out of that man you cant reach down
and help anybody up mom if you go
along through this here world on stilts
 not very well banjo


all-story weekly

   you need both of your hands to hold
your stilts mom you aint got even a
finger to spare for a low-down feller like
me

   youre not a low-down fellow banjo
dont be calling yourself names

   i was low-down enough to believe
what they told me about macdonald
shootin up chance dalton i believed it
till missus mathews give me the straight
of it one of them injun police fellers
told her how that job was put up and
how it failed to work

   a man named lassiter told me about
it

  they rode along in silence a tong time
after that then banjo

   well i hope we dont bust out onto
them calvary fellers too sudden and meet
a flock of bullets id never forgive the
man that put a bullet through my fiddle
 well go slowly and keep listening
i can tell cavalry from cowboys as far as
i can hear

   i bet a purty you can brought up
with em like you was

   theyll not be able to do anything
before daylight and when we overtake
them well ride around and get ahead
while theyre waiting for morning i
dont know where the homesteaders are
but theyll be sending out scouts to locate
them and we can watch

  they were following the road that the
cavalry had taken an hour in advance of
them listening now they rode on with-
out words xow and then a bush at the
roadside flipped a stirrup now and again
banjos little horse snorted in short im-
patience as if expressing its disapproval
of this journey through the dark night
was assertive in its heaviness but com-
municative of its mysteries in its wild
scents-the silent music of its hour

  there are those who on waking in the
night can tell the hour by the smell the
taste the elusive fine aroma of the quiet
air before midnight it is like a new-lit
censer in the small hours the smell of
old camp-fires comes trailing and the
scent of rain upon embers

  but frances landcraft was not afraid
of the night as she rode silently through
it with banjo gibson at her side there
was no shudder in it for her as there had
been on the night that nola was stolen
it could not have raised up a terror grim
enough to turn her back upon the road

  her one thought was that she must
reach macdonald before chadron and
king could find him and tell him that
the troops were coming and that he was
to be trapped into firing upon them she
knew that many lives depended upon her
endurance courage and strategy many
lives but most of all alan macdonalds
life he must be warned at the cost of
her own safety her own life if necessary

  to that end the troops must be fol-
lowed and a desperate dash at daylight
must be made into macdonalds camp
perhaps it would be a race with the cav-
alry at the last moment

  banjo said it was beginning to feel like
morning an hour past they had crossed
the river at the ford near macdonalds
place and the foothills stood rough and
black against the starry horizon they
were near them now so near that the
deeper darkness of their timbered sides
fell over them like a cold shadow

  suddenly she checked banjo with a
sharp word

   i heard them she whispered

  banjos little horse eager for the fel-
lowship of its kind as his master was for
his own in his way threw up its head and
whinnied banjo churned it with his
heels slapped it on the side of the head
and shut off the shrill call in a grunt but
the signal had gone abroad out of the
stillness before them a horse answered
and the slow wind prowling down from
the hills ahead of dawn carried the scent
of cigarettes to them as they waited
breathlessly for results

   theyre dismounted and waiting for
daylight she said  we must slip away
and ride around them

  they were leaving the road the low
brush rasping harshly on their stirrups-
as loud as a bugle-call it seemed to
the holy scare



frances-when a dash of hoofs from
ahead told that a detachment was coming
to investigate now there came a hail
frances stopped banjo behind her whis-
pered to know what they should do

    keep that little fool horse still she
said

  now the patrol which had stopped to
hail was coming on again banjos horse
was not to be sequestered nor his craving
for companionship in that lonesome night
suppressed he lifted his shrill nicker
again and a shot from the outriders of
cavalry was the answer

   answer them tell them who you are
banjo-they all know you-and ill slip
away good-by and thank you for your
brave help

   ill go with you-theyll hear one as
much as theyll hear two

   no no-you can help me much bet-
ter by doing as i tell you tell them that
a led horse got loose from you and thats
the noise of it running away

  she waited for no more words for the
patrol was very near and now and then
one of them fired as he rode banjo
yelled to them

    say you fellers stop that fool
shootin around here i tell you

   who are you came the answer

   banjo you darned fool and i tell
you right now pardner the first man
that busts my fiddle with a bullet  have
to mix with me

  the soldiers came up laughing frances
stopped to listen presently she heard
them coming on again evidently not en-
tirely satisfied with banjos story but
the parley with him had delayed them
she had a good lead now

   in a little swale where the greasewood
reached above her head she stopped
again to listen she heard the troopers
beating the bushes away off to one side
and knew that they soon would give it
up when they passed out of her hear-
ing she rode on slowly and with cau-
tion

  she was frontiersman enough to keep
her direction by the north star-colonel

landcraft had seen to that particular of
her education himself-but polaris would
not tell her which way to go to find alan
macdonald and his dusty men standing
their vigil over their cooped-up enemies
nothing but luck she knew could lead
her there for she was in a sea of sage-
brush with the black river valley behind
her the blacker hills ahead and never a
mark of a trail to follow anywhere

  she had rounded the cavalry troop and
left it far behind the silence which im-
mersed the sleeping land told her this
no hoof but her own mounts beat the
earth within sound no foot but hers
strained saddle-leather within miles of her
now she believed

  there was only one thing to do ride
slowly in the direction that she had been
holding with banjo and keep eyes ears
and nose all on the watch the ways of
the range were early if there was any-
body within a mile of her to windward
she would smell the smoke of his fire when
he lit it and see the wink of it too unless
he built it low

  hut it was neither the scent of fire nor
the red eye of it winking on the hill that
at length gave her despairing heart a fresh
handful of hope-nothing less than the
aroma of boiling coffee indeed it had
such a feeling of comfort and welcome
of domesticity and peace in it that she
felt as if she approached a door with a
friend standing ready to take her horse

  her horse was not insensible to the
cheer that somebody was brewing for
himself in that wild place she felt him
quicken under her and put up his head
eagerly and go forward as if he was
nearing home she wondered how far the
smell of coffee would carry and subse-
quent experience was a revelation on that
point

  she had entered the hills tracking back
that wavering scent of coffee which rose
fresh and sudden now and trailed away
the next moment to the mere color of a
smell now she had it now she lost it
as she wound over rugged ridges and
through groves of quaking asp and balm


all-story weekly

of gilead trees always mounting among
the hills her eager horse taking the way
without guidance as keen on the scent as
she

  it must have taken her an hour to run
down that coffee-pot morning was com-
ing among the fading stars when she
mounted a long ridge the quick striding of
her horse indicating that there was some-
thing ahead at last and came upon the
camp-fire the coffee and the cook all
beside a splintered gray rock that rose as
high as a house out of the barrenness of
the hill

  the coffee-maker was a woman and her
pot was of several gallons capacity she
was standing with the cover of the boiler
in one hand a great spoon in the other
her back half bent over her beverage in
the position that the sound of francess
coming had struck her she did not move
out of that alert pose of suspicion until
frances drew rein within a few feet of
her and gave her good morning when
the poor harried creature saw that the
visitor was a woman her fright gave place
to wonder

  frances introduced herself without
parley and made inquiry for macdonald

   why bless your heart you dont aim
to tell me you rode all the way from the
post in the night by yourself the
simple friendly creature said  well
mr macdonald and most of the men
theyve left to take them scounrels sent
in here by the cattlemen to murder all of
us over to the jail at meander

   how long have they been gone

   why not so very long f reckon you
must a missed meetin em by a hair

   ive got to catch up with them right
away is there anybody here that can
guide me

    my son can and hell be glad hes
just went to sleep back there in the tent
after guardin them fellers all night ill
roust him out

  the pioneer woman came back almost
at once and pressed a cup of her coffee
upon frances frances took the tin vessel
eagerly for she was chilled from her long

ride then she dismounted to rest her
horse while her guide was getting ready
and warm her numb feet at the fire she
told the woman how the scent of her
coffee had led her out of her groping like
a beacon light on the hill

   its about three mile from here down
to the valley the woman said  coffee
will carry on the mornin air that way

   do you think your son-

   hes a coinin the woman replied
the boy came around the rock lead-
ing a horse fie was wide awake and
alert barefooted bareheaded and with-
out a coat he leaped nimbly onto his
barebacked beast and frances got into
her saddle as fast as her numb limbs
would lift her

  as she rode away after the recklessly
riding youth she felt the hope that she
had warmed in her bosom all night paling
to a shadow it seemed that circum-
stances were ranging after a chart marked
out for them and that her own earnest
effort to interfere could not turn aside the
tragedy set for the gray valley below her

  morning was broadening now she
could see her guide distinctly even when
he rode many rods ahead dawn was the
hour for treacherous men and deeds of
stealth chadron would be on the way
again before now with the strength of
the united states behind him to uphold
his outlawed hand

  when they came down into the valley
there was a low-spreading mist over the
gray sage which lent a warmth to the
raw morning wind there was a sense of
indistinctness through the mist which was
an ally to chadron ten rods away even
in the growing morning it would have
been impossible to tell a cowboy from a
cavalryman

  here a haystack smoldered in what had
been a farmstead yard its thin blue
smoke wavered up in the morning in-
cense over the dead hope of the humble
heart that had dreamed it had found a
refuge in that spot at the roadside a
little farther on the burned ruins f a
cabin lay tt had stood so near the wheel-
the holy scare



track that the heat of its embers was
warm on francess face as she galloped
by the wire fence was cut between each
post beyond splicing or repair the shrubs
which some home-hungry woman had set
in her dooryard were trampled the well-
curb was overthrown

  over and over again as they rode that
sad picture was repeated destruction
had swept the country war had visited it
side by side upon the adjoining lines
many of the homesteaders had built their
little houses for the comfort of being near
their kind in the corner of each quarter-
section on either side of the road along
the fertile valley a little home had stood
three days ago now all were gone
marked only by little heaps of embers
which twinkled a dying glow in the
breath of the morning wind

  day was spreading now from the
little swells in the land as she mounted
them frances could see the deeper mist
hovering in the low places the tops of
tall shrubs and slender quaking asp
showing above it as if they stood in snow
the band of sunrise was broadening
across the east far down near the horizon
a little slip of lemon-rind moon was fal-
tering out of sight

  but there was no sight no sound of
anybody in the road ahead she spurred
up beside her guide and asked him if there
was any other way that they might have
taken no he said they would have to
go that way for there was only one ford-
able place in the river for many miles
he pointed to the road fresh-turned by
many hoofs and damped his lean thighs
to his bare horse galloping on

   well take a cut acrost here and
maybe head em off he said dashing
away through the stirrup-high sage
striking close to the hills again and into
rougher going

  the ache of the most intense anxiety
that she ever had borne was upon
frances hope was only a shred in her
hand she believed now that all her
desperate riding must come to nothing in
the end

  she never had been that long in the
saddle before in her life fler body was
numb with cold and fatigue she felt the
motion of her horse heard its pounding
feet in regular beat as it held to its long
swinging gallop but with the detached
sense of being no party to it

  all that was sharp in her was the pain
of her lost struggle for she expected
every moment to hear firing and to come
upon confusion and death at the next lift
of the hill

  in their short cut across the country
they had mounted the top of a long
slender ridge which reached down into the
valley like a finger now her guide pulled
up his horse so suddenly that it slid for-
ward its hoof plowing the loose shale

   youd better go back-theres goin
to be a fight he said a look of shocked
concern in his big wild eyes

   do you see them where-

   there they are he clutched her
arm leaning and pointing  and theres
a bunch of fellers cornin to meet em that
they dont see i tell you theres goin to
be a fight

chapter xix

l beat iiim to it

the last dash of that long ride was
only a whirlwind of emotions to
frances it was a red streak she
ciid not know what became of the boy
she left him there as she lashed her horse
past him on the last desperate stretch

  the two forces were not more than
half a mile apart the cavalry just mount-
ing at the ruins of a homestead where she
knew they had stopped for breakfast at
the well a little band of outriders was
setting off a scouting party under the
lead of chadron she believed macdon-
alds men their prisoners under guard
between two long-strung lines of horse-
men were proceeding at a trot between
the two forces the road made a loner
curve here it was bordered by brush-
wood that hid a man on horseback

 when frances broke through this
screen which had hidden the cavalry from
macdonald she found the cavalcade
halted for macdonald had seen her
coming down the hill she told him in
few words what her errand to him was
tom lassiter and those who rode with
him at the head of the column pressing
around

  the question and mystification in mac-
donalds face at her coming cleared with
her brisk words there was no wonder
in her being there to him any more it
was like her to come winging through
the night straight to him like a dove
with a message if it had been another
woman to take up that brave and hardy
task then there would have been marvel
in it as it was he held out his hand
to her silently like one man to another
in such a pass where words alone would
be weak and lame

   i was looking for chadron to come
with help and attempt a rescue and i
was moving to forestall him but we were
late getting under way they waving
his hand toward the prisoners  held out
until an hour ago

  you must think and think fast
she said  theyre almost here

   yes im going ahead to meet them
and offer to turn these prisoners over to
major king theyll have no excuse for
firing on us then

   xo no some other way- think of
some other way

  he looked gravely into her anxious
pleading eyes  why no matter erances
if theyve come here to-do that theyll
do it but this way theyll have to do it
in the open not by a trick

   ill go with you she said

   i think perhaps-

  -	ill go

  macdonald turned to lassiter in a few
hurried words she pressed to his side
as they two rode away alone to meet
the troops repeating as if she had been
denied

   ill go

  there was a dash of hoofs behind them

and a man who rode like a sack of bran
came bouncing up excitement over his
large face

   whats up macdonald-where re
you off to he inquired

  macdonald told him in a word riding
forward as he spoke he introduced the
stranger as a newspaper correspondent
from chicago who had arrived at the
homesteaders camp the evening past

   so they got troops did they the
newspaper man said riding forward
keenly  yes they told me down at the
city theyd put that trick through here
they come

  macdonald spurred ahead holding up
his right hand in the indian sign of peace
major king was riding with chadron at
the head of the vanguard they drew
rein suddenly at sight of what appeared
to be such a formidable force at mac-
donalds back for at that distance and
with the dimness of the scattering mist
it appeared as if several hundred horse-
men were approaching

  distrustful of chadron fearing that lie
might induce major king to shoot mac-
donald down as he sat there making over-
tures of peace frances rode forward and
joined him the correspondent coming
jolting after her in his horn-riding way
after a jirief parley among themselves
chadron and king together with three or
four officers rode forward one remained
behind and halted the column as it came
around the brushwood screen at the turn
of the road

  major king greeted frances as he rode
up scowling in high dignity chadron
could not cover his surprise so well as
major king at seeing her there her horse
in a sweat her habit torn where the
brambles had snatched at her in her hard
ride to get ahead of the troops he gave
her a cold good morning and sat in the
attitude of a man pricking up his ears as
he leaned a little to peer into the ranks
of the force ahead

  the homesteaders had come to a halt
a hundred yards behind macdonald
about the same distance behind major
the holy scare



king and his officers the cavalry had
drawn up across the road major king
sat in silence a moment as if waiting for
macdonald to begin he looked the
homesteader captain over with severe
eyes

   well sir said he

   we were starting for meander ma-
jor king to deliver to the sheriff fifty
men whom we have taken in the commis-
sion of murder and arson macdonald
replied with dignity  up to a few min-
utes ago we had no information that
martial law had superseded the civil in
this troubled country but since that is
the case we will gladly turn our prison-
ers over to you with the earnest request
that they be held collectively and in-
dividually to answer for the crimes they
have committed here

   thems my men king- theyve got
em there said chadron boiling over
the brim

   this expedition has come to the relief
of certain men attacked and surrounded
in the discharge of their duty by a band
of cattle-thieves of which you are the
acknowledged head replied major king

   then you have come on a mistaken
errand sir macdonald told him

    have come into this lawless country
to restore order and insure the lives and
safety of property of the people to whom
it belongs

   the evidence of these hired raiders
crimes lies all around you major king
macdonald said  these men swept in
here in the employ of the cattle interests
burned these poor homes and murdered
such of the inhabitants as were unable to
fly to safety in the hills ahead of them
we are appealing to the law the cattle-
men never have done that

   say mr soldier let me tell you
something the newspaper correspond-
ent to whom one mans dignity was as
much as anothers kicked his- horse for-
ward  these raiders that bloody-hand-
ed chadron sent in here have murdered
children and women do you know that

   who in hell are you chadron de-

manded bristling with rage whirling his
horse to face him

   this is chadron macdonald said
a little flash of humor in his eyes over
chadrons hearing the truth about him-
self from an unexpected source

  well im glad ive run into you
chadron ive got a little list of questions
to ask you the correspondent told him
far from being either impressed or cowed
 xeel is my name of the chicago sphere
ive-

   youd just as well keep your ques-
tions for another day youll send noth-
ing out of here said major king
sharply

  xeel looked across his nose at king
with triumphant leer

   ive sent out something mr soldier-
man said he  it was on the wire by
midnight last night rushed to meander
by courier and its all over the country
this morning its a story that  give
the other side of this situation up here
to the war department and it  make
this whole nation climb up on its hind
legs and howl murder huh murders
no name for it

  chadron was growling something below
his breath into kings ear

   fcrty-three men and boys- look at
them there they are-rounded up fifty
of the cutthroats the drovers associa-
tion rushed up here from cheyenne on
a special train to wipe the homesteaders
out xeel continued rising to consid-
erable heat in the partisanship of his new
light  five dollars a day was the hire
of that gang and five dollars bonus for
every man woman or baby that they
killed yes ive got signed statements
from them chadron and id like to know
what youve got to say if anything

   disarm that rabble said major
king speaking to a subordinate officer
 and take charge of the men they have
been holding

  sir i protest- macdonald began

   i have no words to waste on you
major king cut him off shortly

   id play a slow hand on that line


all-story weekly

king and a careful one if i were you
advised neel  if you take these mens
guns away from them theyll be at the
mercy of chadrons brigands  tell you
man i know the situation in this coun-
try

   thank you said king in cold
hauteur

  chadrons eyes were lighting with the
glitter of revenge he sat grinding his
bridle-reins in his gloved hand as if he
had the bones of the nesters in his palm
at last

   you will proceed with the rescued
party under guard to meander con-
tinued major king to his officer speak-
ing as if he had plans for his own em-
ployment aside from the expedition
 there mr chadron will furnish trans-
portation to return them whence they
came

   ill furnish- began hadron in
amazement at this unexpected turn

   transportation sir completed ma-
jor king in his cold way

   these men should be held to the
civil authorities for trial in this county
and not set free macdonald protested
indignant over the order

  major king ignored him he was still
looking at chadron who was almost
choking on his rage

  flell do you mean to tell me the
whole dam things goin to fizzle out this
way king i want something done 
tell you-i want something done 
didnt bring you up here

  certainly not sir snapped king

   my orders to you chadron flared

   im not marching under your orders
at-

  the hell you aint chadron ex-
ploded

   its an outrage on humanity to turn
those scoundrels loose major king
xeel said  why ive got signed state-
ments  tell you-

   remove this man to the rear ma-
jor king addressed a lieutenant who
communicated the order to the next low-
est in rank immediately at hand who

passed it on to two troopers who came
forward briskly and rode the protesting
correspondent off between them

  other troopers were collecting the arms
of the homesteaders a proceeding which
macdonald witnessed with a sick heart
frances sitting her horse in silence
through all that had passed gave him
what comfort and hope that she could
express with her eyes

   detail a patrol of twenty men ma-
jor king continued his instructions to his
officer  to keep the roads and disarm
all individuals and bands encountered

  that dont apply to my men de-
clared hadron positively in his face
there was a dark threat of disaster lor
major kings future hopes of advance-
ment

  it applies to everybody as they
come said king  troops have come
in here to restore order and order will be
restored

  chadron was gaping in amazement
that feeling in him seemed to smother
every other even his hot rage against
king for this sudden shifting of their
plans and complete overthrow of the
cattlemens expectations of the troops
the one little comfort that he was to get
out of the expedition was that of seeing
his raiders taken out of macdonalds
hands and marched off to be set free

  macdonald felt that he understood the
change in king the major had come
there full of the intention of doing
chadrons will he had not a doubt of
that but murder even with the faint
color of excuse that they would have con-
trived to give it could not be done in the
eyes of such a witness as frances land-
craft subserviency a bending of dignity
even could not be stooped to before one
who had been schooled to hold a soldiers
honor his most precious endowment

  major king had shown a hand of half
fairness in treating both sides alike that
much was t-  is credit at the worst but
he had not done it because he was a
high-souled and honorable man his eyes
betrayed him in that no matter how- stern
the holy scare



he tried to make them the coming of
that fair outrider in the night had turned
aside a great tragedy and saved major
king partly to himself at least and per-
haps wholly to his career

  macdonald tried to tell her in one long
and earnest look all this she nodded
seeming to understand

   youve double-crossed me king
chadron accused in the flat voice of a
man throwing down his hand  i
brought you up here to throw these nest-
ers off of our land

   the civil courts must decide the
ownership of that returned king sourly
 disarm that man he indicated mac-
donald and turned his horse as if to ride
back and join his command

  the lieutenant appeared to feel that it
would be no lowering of his dignity to
touch the weapons of a man such as mac-
donalds bearing that morning had shown
him to be he approached with a smile
half apologetic chadron was sitting by
on his horse watching the proceeding
keenly

   pardon me said the officer reach-
ing out to receive macdonalds guns

  a swift change swept over macdon-
alds face a flush dyeing it to his ears
he sat motionless a little while as if de-
bating the question the young officers
hand still outstretched macdonald
dropped his hand quickly as if moved to
shorten the humiliation to the buckle of
his belt and opened it with deft jerk at
that moment chadron ten feet away
slung a revolver from his side and fired

  macdonald rocked in his saddle as
frances leaped to the ground and ran to
his side fie wilted forward his hat fall-
ing and crumpled into her arms the
lieutenant relieved her of her bloody bur-
den and eased macdonald to the ground

  major king came riding back at his
sharp command troopers surrounded
chadron who sat with his weapon still
poised like one gazing at the mark at
which he has fired the smoke of his shot
around him

   in a second hed a got me but i

beat him to it -by god t beat him to
it he said

  macdonalds belt had slipped free of
his body with its burden of cartridges
and its two long pistols it lay at francess
feet she stooped a little sound in her
throat between a sob and a cry jerked
one of the guns out wheeled upon chad-
ron and fired the lieutenant struck up
her arm in time to save the cattlemans
life the blow sent the pistol whirling
out of her hand

   they will go off that way some-
times said the young officer with apol-
ogy in his soft voice

  the soldiers closed around chadron
and hurried him away a moment major
king sat looking at macdonald whose
blood was wasting in the roadside dust
from a wound in his chest then he
flashed a look into francess face that
had a sneer of triumph in it wheeled his
horse and galloped away

  in a moment the lieutenant was sum-
moned leaving frances alone between the
two forces with macdonald she did not
know whether he was dead she dropped
to her knees in the dust and began to
tear frantically at his shirt to come to
the wound tom lassiter came hurrying
up with others denouncing the treacher-
ous shot swearing vengeance on the cow-
ardly head that had conceived a so mur-
derous thing

  lassiter said that he was not dead and
set to work to stem the blood it seemed
to frances that the world had fallen auay
from her leaving her alone she stood
aside a little her chin up in her old im-
perious way her eyes on the far hills
where the tender sunlight was just strik-
ing among the white-limbed aspen-trees
put her heart was bent down to the dark-
ness of despair

  she asked no questions of the men who
were working so earnestly after their
crude way to check that precious stream
she stood in the activity of passing troop- 
ers and escorted raiders insensible of any
movement or sound in all the world
around her only when tom lassiter

stood from his ministrations and looked
at her with understanding in his old
weary eyes she turned her face back
again slowly resolute to see if he had
died

  her throat was dry it took an effort
to bring a sound from it and then it was
strained and wavering

   is he-dead

   xo miss he aint dead tom an-
swered but there was such a shadow of
sorrow and pain in his eyes that tears
gushed into her own

   will-will-

  tom shook his head  the lord that
give him alone can answer that he said

  the troops had moved on save the
detail singled for police duty these
were tightening girths and trimming for
he road again a little way from the spot
where macdonald lay the lieutenant
returned hastily

   miss landcraft i am ordered to con-
vey you to alamito ranch - under
guard said he

  banjo gibson held to be harmless and
insignificant by major king had been set
free xow he came up leading his horse
shocked to the deepest fibers of his sensi-
tive soul by the cowardly deed that saul
chadron had done

    it went clean through him he said
rising from his inspection of macdonalds
wound and then moved by the pain in
francess tearless eyes he enlarged upon
the advantages of that from a surgical
view  the beauty of a hole in a mans
chest like that is that it lets the pizen
dreen off he told her  it wouldnt
surprise me none to see mac up and
around inside of a couple of weeks for
hes as hard as old hickry

  well im not going to alamito ranch
and leave him out here to die of neglect
orders or no orders said she to the lieu-
tenant

  the young officers face colored he
plucked at his new mustache in embar-
rassment perhaps the prospect of carry-
ing a handsome and dignified young lady
in his arms for a matter of twenty-odd

miles was not as alluring to him as it
might have been to another for he was
a slight young man only a little while out
of west point but orders were orders
and he gave frances to understand that
in diplomatic and polite phrasing

  she scorned him and his veneration for
orders and turned from him coldly

    is there no doctor with your detach-
ment she asked

   he has gone on with the main body
miss landcraft they have several
wounded

   wounded murderers and burners of
homes well im not going to alamito
ranch with you sir unless you can con-
trive an ambulance of some sort and take
this gentleman too

  the officer brightened he believed it
could be arranged inside of an hour he
had tom lassiter around with a team
and spring wagon in which the home-
steaders laid macdonald tenderly upon a
bed of hay

  banjo waited until they were ready to
begin their slow march to the ranch
when he led his little horse around

   ill go on to the agency after the
doctor and send him over to alamito as
quick as he can go he said  and ill
see if mother mathews can go over too
shes worth four doctors when it comes
to keepin the pizen from spreadin in a
wound

  frances gave him her benediction with
her eyes and farewell with a warm hand-
clasp and banjos beribboned horse
frisked off on its long trip quite refreshed
from the labors of the past night

  frances was carrying macdonalds car-
tridge-belt and revolvers the confiscation
of which had been overlooked by major
king in the excitement of the shooting
the young lieutenant hadnt the heart to
take the weapons from her orders had
been carried out macdonald had been
disarmed he let it go at that

  frances rode in the wagon with mac-
donald a canteen of water slung over her
shoulders xow and then she moistened
his lips with a little of it and bathed his
the holy scare



eyes closed in pathetic weariness he
was unconscious still from the half-ton
blow of saul chadrons big bullet as
she ministered to him she felt that he
would open his eyes on this worlds pains
and cruel injustices nevermore

  and why had major king ordered her
virtually under arrest to alamito ranch
instead of sending her in disgrace to the
post  was it because he feared that she
would communicate with her father from
the post and discover to him the treach-
erous compact between chadron and
king or merely to take a mean revenge
upon her by humiliating her in xola
chadrons eyes

  he had taken the newspaper corre-
spondent with him and certainly would
see that no more of the truth was sent
out by him from that flame-swept country
for several days with her at the ranch
far from telegraphic communication with
the world nothing could go out from her
that would enlighten the department on
the deception that the cattlemen had
practised to draw the government into
the conflict on their side in the mean
time the drovers association would be
at work spreading money with free hand
corrupting evidence with the old dyes of
falsehood

  major king had seen his promised re-
ward withdrawn through her interven-
tion and had made a play of being fair
to both sides in the controversy except
that he kept one hand on chadrons
shoulder so to speak in making honest
men of those bloody rascals whom he had
sent there to burn and kill they were
to be shipped safely back to their place
where they would disperse and walk free
of all danger of prosecution afterward
out of that one service to the cattlemen
major king scarcely could hope to win
his coveted reward

  she believed that alan macdonald
would die it seemed that the fever
which would consume his feeble hope of
life was already kindling on his lips but
she had no tears to pour out over him
now only a great hardness in her heart

against saul chadron and a wild desire
to lift her hand and strike him low

  whether major king would make her
attempt against chadrons life or her in-
terference with his military expedition his
excuse for placing her under guard re-
mained for the future to develop she
turned these things in her mind as they
proceeded along the white river-road to-
ward the ranch

  it came noontime and decline of sun
the shadow of the moutains reached down
into the valley the mist came purple
again over the foot-hills the fire of sun-
set upon the clouds alan macdonald
still lived his strong harsh face turned to
the fading skies his tired eyelids closed
upon his dreams

chapter xx

love and death

maggie and alvino had the ranch
to themselves when the military
party from the upper valley ar-
rived mrs chadron and xola having
driven to meander that morning it had
been their intention to return that eve-
ning maggie said mrs chadron had
gone after chili-peppers and other things
but principally chili-peppers there was
not one left in the house and the mistress
could not live without them any more
than fire could burn without wood

  dusk had settled when they reached
the ranch and night thickened fast the
lieutenant dropped two men at the corral
gate-her guard frances understood-
and went back to his task of watching for
armed men upon the highroads

  cnder the direction of frances maggie
had placed a cot in mrs chadrons fa-
vored sitting-room with the fireplace
there macdonald lay in clean sheets a
blaze on the hearth and maggie washing
his wound with hot water groaning in
the pity which is the sweetest part of the
women of her homely race

   i think that lie will live miss she
said hopefully  see he has a strong

breath on my damp hand-i can feel it
like a little wind

  she spoke in her native tongue which
frances understood thoroughly from her
years in texas and arizona posts
frances shook her head sorrowfully

   i am afraid his breath will fail soon
maggie

   no if they live the first hour after
being shot they get well maggie per-
sisted with apparent sincerity  here
put your hand on his heart-do you feel
it what a strong heart he has to live so
well what a strong strong heart

   yes a strong strong heart tears
were falling for him now that there was
none to see them scalding their way down
her pale cheeks

   he must have carried something sa-
cred with him to give him such strength
such life

   he carried honor said frances
more to herself than to maggie doubting
that she would understand

   and love maybe said maggie with
soft word soft upward-glancing of her
feeling dark eyes

   who can tell frances answered
turning her head away

  maggie drew the sheet over him and
stood looking down into his white face

   if he could speak he would ask for
his mother and for water then and after
that the one he loves that is the way
a mans mind carries those three precious
things when death blows its breath in his
face

   i do not know said erances slowly

  there was such stress in waiting such
silence in the world and such emptiness
and pain reverently as maggies voice
was lowered soft and sympathetic as her
word frances longed for her to be still
and go and leave her alone with him
she longed to hold the dear spark of his
faltering life in her own hands alone
quite alone to warm it back to strength
in her own lone heart surely her name
could not be the last in his remembrance
no matter for the disturbing breath of
death

   i will bring you some food said
maggie  to give him life out of your
life you must be strong

  erances started out of her sleep in the
rocking-chair before the fire she had
turned the lamp low but there was a flare
of light on her face her faculties were
so deeply sunk in that insidious sleep
which had crept upon her like a bindweed
upon wheat that she struggled to rise from
it she sprang up her mind groping
remembering that there was something
for which she was under heavy respon-
sibility but unable for a moment to bring
it back to its place

  nola was in the door with a candle
shading the flame from her eyes with her
hand her hair was about her shoulders
her feet were bare under the hem of her
long dressing-robe she was staring her
lips were open her breath was quick as
if she had arrived after a run

   is he-alive she whispered

   why should you come to ask-what
is his life to you asked frances sorrow-
fully bitter

  oh maggie just woke and came up
to tell me mother doesnt know - shes
just gone to bed isnt it terrible
frances

  nola spoke distractedly as if in great
agony or great fear

   ffe cant harm any of you now
youre safe franees was hard and
scornful she turned from nola and laid
her hand on macdonalds brow drawing
her breath with a relieved sigh when she
felt the warmth of life still there

   oh frances frances nola moaned
with expression of despair  isnt this
terrible

   if you mean its terrible to have him
here i cant help it im a prisoner here
against my will i couldnt leave him out
there alone to die

  nola lowered her candle and stared at
frances her eyes big and blank of every-
thing but a wild expression that frances
had read as fear

   will he die she whispered
the holy scare



  	yes you are to have your heartless
way at last he will die and his blood
will be on this house never to be washed
away 

  why didnt you come back when we
called you- both of you xola drew
near reaching out an appealing hand
frances shrank from her to bend quick-
ly over macdonald when he groaned and
moved his head

   put out that light its in his eyes
she said

  xola blew out the candle and came
glimmering into the room in her soft
white gown

   dont blame me frances dont
blame any of us mother and i wanted
to save you both we tried to stop the
men and we could have held them back
if it hadnt been for chance chance got
three of them to go the others-

   they paid for that said frances a
little lift of triumph in her voice

  -i yes but they-

   chance didnt do it i tell you if
he says he did it he lies it was-some-
body else

   the soldiers

   xo not the soldiers

   i thought maybe-i saw one of them
on guard in front of the house as we
came in

   hes guarding me im under arrest
i tell you the soldiers have nothing to
do with him

  xola stood looking down at macdon-
ald who was deathly white in the weak
light of the low shaded lamp with a
little timid outreaching a little starting
and drawing back she touched his fore-
head where a thick lock of his shaggy
hair fell over it like a sheaf of ripe wheat
burst from its band

   oh it breaks my heart to see him
dying-it - breaks - my - heart  she
sobbed

   you struck him youre not fit to
touch him take your hand away
frances pushed her arm roughly xola
drew back drenched with a sudden tor-
rent of penitential tears

   i know it  know it she confessed
in bitterness   knew it when he took
me away from those people in the moun-
tains and brought me home he carried
me in his arms when i was tired and
sang to me as we rode along there in the
lonesome night he sang to me just like
 was a little child so i wouldnt be
afraid-afraid-of him 

   oh and you struck him you struck
him like a dog 

   ive suffered more for that than i
hurt him frances its been like fire in
my heart

   i pray to god it will burn up your
wicked pride

   we believed him mother and i be-
lieved him in spite of what chance said
oh if youd only come back then
frances this thing wouldnt have hap-
pened

   i cant see what good that would
have done said frances wearily  there
are others who dont believe him theyd
have got him some time just like they
got him-in a cowards underhanded way
never giving him a chance for his life
 we went to meander this morning
thinking wed catch father there before
he left we wanted to tell him about
air macdonald and get him to drop this
feud if we could have seen him i know
hed have done what we asked for hes
got the noblest heart in the world
whatever frances felt on the noble
nature of saul chadron she held unex-
pressed she did not feel that it fell to
her duty to tell xola whose hand had
struck macdonald down although she
believed that the cattlemans daughter
deserved whatever pain and humiliation
the revelation might bring for it was
as plain as if xola had confessed it in
words that she had much more than a
friendly feeling of gratitude for the foe-
rnan of her family

  her heart was as unstable as mercury
it seemed frances despised her for her
fickleness scorned her for the mean face
of friendship over the treachery of her
soul xot that she regretted major kins

nola was free to take him and make the
most of him but she was not to come
in as a wedge to rive her from this man

  let her pay her debt of gratitude in
something else than love living or dead
alan macdonald was not for xola chad-
ron her penance and her tears her
moanings and sobs and her broken heart
even that if it should come could not
pay for the humiliation and the pain
which that house had brought upon him

   when did it happen asked xola

   this morning early

   who did it-how did it happen
you got away from chance you said it
wasnt chance

   we got away from that gang yester-
day this happened this morning miles
from that place

   who was it why dont you tell
me frances

  they were standing at macdonalds
side a little spurt of flame among the
ends of wood in the chimney threw a
sudden illumination over them and
played like water over a stone upon mac-
donalds face then sank again as if it
had been plunged in ashes frances
rer- ained silent her vindictiveness her
hardness of heart against this vacillating
girl dying away as the flame had died
it was not her desire to hurt her with
that story of treachery and cowardice
which must leave its stain upon her name
for many a year

   the name of the man who shot him
is a curse and a blight on this land a
mockery of every holy human thought
ill not speak it

  xola stared at her horror speaking
from her eyes  fie must be a mon-
ster

   he is the lowest of the accursed a
coward frances said

  xola shuddered standing silently by
the couch a little while then  but i
want to help you frances if youll let
me

    theres nothing that you can do
im waiting for mrs mathews and the
doctor from the agency

   you can go up and rest until they
come frances ycu look so tired and
pale ill watch by him you can tell
me what to do and ill call you when
they come

   xo ill stay until-ill stay here

   oh please go frances youre nearly
dead on your feet

   why do you want me to leave him
frances asked in a flash of jealous sus-
picion she turned to xola as if to
search out her hidden intention

   you were asleep in your chair when
i came in frances xola chided her
gently

  again they stood in silence looking
down upon the wounded man frances
was resentful of nolas interest in him
of her presence in the room she was
on the point of asking her to leave when
xola spoke

   if he hadnt been so proud if hed
only stooped to explain things to us to
talk to us even this could have been
prevented frances

  what could he have said frances
asked wondering indeed what explanation
could have lessened his offense in saul
chadrons eyes

   if i had known him i would have
understood xola replied in a soft low
voice as if communing with herself

  you well perhaps-perhaps even
you would have understood

   look he moved 

  sh-h-h your talking disturbs him
xola lo to bed you cant help me any
here

   and leave him all to you

  the words flashed from xola as if
they had sprung out of her mouth before
her reason had given them permission to
depart

  of course with me hes mine

   if hes going to die frances cant i
share him with you till the end-cant i
have just a little share in the care of him
here with you

  xola laid a hand on francess arm as
she pleaded and turned her white face
appealingly in the dim light
the holy scare



  dont talk that way girl said
erances roughly  you have no part in
him at all-he is nothing to you

 he is all to me-everything to me
oh frances if you knew if you knew 
 what if i knew what frances
caught her arm in fierce grip and shook
her savagely

   dont-dont-hurt me frances
xola cringed and shrank away and lifted
her arms as if to ward a blow

   what did you mean by that tell
me-speak 

   oh the way it came to me the way
it came to me as he carried me in his
arms and sang to me so  wouldnt be
afraid moaned xola her face hidden
in her hands  i never knew before
what it was to care for anybody that
way-i never never knew before

   you cant have this man nor any
share in him living or dead i gave
up major king to you be satisfied
oh major king

   poor shadow that he is in comparison
with a man hell have to serve for you
living or dead  tell you this man is
mine xow go

  xola was shaking again with a sudden
gust of weeping she had sunk to the
floor at the head of the couch a white
heap her bare arms clasping her head

   it breaks my heart to see him die
she moaned rocking herself in her grief
like a child

  and child erances felt her to be in
her selfishness a child never denied and
careless and unfeeling of the rights of
others from this long indulgence she
doubted xolas sincerity even in the face
of such demonstrative evidence there
was no pity for her and no softness

   get up  frances spoke sternly  and
go to your room	

   he must not be allowed to die he
must be saved xola reached out her
hands as if to call back his struggling soul

   belated tears will not save him get
up-its time for you to go

  xola bent forward suddenly her hair
sweeping the wounded mans face her
lips near his brow frances caught her
with a sound in her throat like a growl
and flung her back

   youll not kiss him-youll never kiss
him she said

  xola sprang up not crying now but
hot with sudden anger

   if you were out of the way hed love
me 

    love you you little cat 

   yes hed love me-id lake him away
from you like ive taken other men hed
love me  tell you- hed love me

  frances looked at her steadily a mo-
ment contempt in her eloquent face  if
you have no other virtue in you at least
have some respect for the dying she
said

   hes not dying hell not die xola
hotly denied  hell live-live to love
me

   go this room-

   its my house ill go and come in
it when  please

    im a prisoner in it not a guest i ll
force you out of the room if i must
this disgraceful behavior must end and
end this minute are you going

   if you were out of the way hed love
me said xtola from the door spiteful
resentful speaking slowly as if pressing
each word into francess brain and heart
 if you were out of the way

you will get the conclusion of this story without waiting a month

next week - greatest drama of the year

the sin that was his

by frank l packard
      - a fistful of diamonds

it was slippy williams who pointed out
the owner of the diamonds to posh
luker he had taken him up to a
certain west end bar one afternoon for
that very purpose both slippy and mr
luker were in funds at the moment but
they felt slightly out of place among their
novel surroundings

  mr williams was smoking a large cigar
with a band around it and posh luker
was making his first acquaintance with
green chartreuse

   this is a real proper drink slippy
he remarked approvingly  it has such
a satisfying sort of grip to it i cant
help envying them as can afford to drink
it regular with all meals

   theres the chap i was talking
about slippy whispered suddenly
that big flash negro

  mr luker looked up and beheld a full-
sized negro entering the bar there was

no question about his bigness he must
have stood at least six foot four in his
socks his shoulders were of a surprising
bulkiness and his arms were noticeably
long his face to mr lukers prejudiced
fancy suggested the countenance of a
well-pleased orang-utan

   as for his costume it appeared to be
designed primarily to attract attention it
included a light tweed suit with a pattern
like a chess-board a bright-green felt hat
and patent leather boots with white cloth
uppers but it was his jewelry that really
caught and tried the eye

  upon his brown fingers were half a
dozen diamond rings his tie pin was a
glittering atrocity and his watch-chain
fairly made posh lukers mouth water

   that gentleman tells me that he only
wonders why the negro was not wearing
earrings and one or two diamonds stuck
through bis nose he is convinced that he
posh luker-his -memoirs



would surely have done so if he had
thought of it

   a fair knockout isnt he slippy
whispered

   he is pretty flash posh luker an-
swered judicially

   you watch him now slippy said
 he generally goes through the same
pleasing little performance

   the negro had reached the bar push-
ing his way offensively through the
crowd his manner suggested that he had
purchased the building and also that he
reveled in the notice he was attracting

  he called for refreshment in lordly
fashion and when it had been served he
thrust his hand into his trouser-pocket
and flung a glittering fistful upon the
counter and the eyes of mr luker
bulged with genuine wonder it was a
handful of loose diamonds mixed with
coins that the negro had chucked down

   great snakes exclaimed mr luker
 does he always carry about loose sparks
like that

   always slippy answered  he
likes to surprise people

   id like to surprise him posh luker
muttered  ive no real affection for
them fellows

  the colored man had picked out a coin
and paid for his drink but he left the
diamonds glittering upon the counter he
loudly addressed the girl behind the bar

   what do you think of them my
dear pretty aint they i guess there
aint many trashy white gentlemen that
can show you their sort often

  the girl treated him very haughtily

   ive seen them before she said with
a tired manner  id put them back in
my pocket if i were you

  the remark won approving nods from
every one about the bar except the man
to whom it was addressed he glared
round him viciously

   i could buy up this whole roomful of
white gentlemen without feeling it he
said  and id figit any pair of them
at once just to give me an appetite
thats what i think of white folk

  he always goes on like that slippy
remarked  he dont seem to like us
poor whites somehow

   i think theres going to be a blooming
row posh luker said

  it certainly looked like it the crowd
resented the negros remarks and several
of them said as much with great plain-
ness there was a menacing movement
toward him

  posh luker was hoping that the man
might be handled with some roughness
he considered that he had asked for it
the negro grinned pocketed his dia-
monds and put up his great fists he
seemed to desire trouble but at the
critical moment the manager confronted
him with a policeman at his heels

   i must ask you to go outside he said
firmly  you caused a disturbance here
yesterday if you do not go at once i shall
be compelled to give you in charge

  and the negro went after one calcu-
lating glance at the policeman who was
almost as generously built as himself
the crowd laughed and hooted as he made
for the door and he looked back and
snarled like a spiteful dog

   well said slippy  what do you
think of him

   he seems a nice cup of tea posh
luker answered  i dont like him at all
but i do like his jewelry it ud be worth
handling

   just what  think slippy agreed
 and i mean to have a shot at handling
it if youll stand in ive been making
some quiet investergations

 well you can tell me about it posh
luker said indulgently  were quiet in
this corner yes and ill ave some more
of that shartroose stuff now fire ahead
slippy obeyed

  he may be said to have risen in his
profession of late recently he had turned
his attention to higher matters than the
pilfering of articles from shops posh
luker admitted that he had the makings
of a very tidy cracksman except that his
nerve was always bad

  it had been spoiled once for all bv a re-


all-story weekly

tired prize-fighter whose profession he had
mistaken that was why he was always
glad to work with his present companion
mr luker had his weaknesses but want
of nerve was not among them

   that negros simply rolling in brass
slippy said  the sparks he wears aint
nothing to what es got li lives in a
big house down pockbourne way with a
high wall and garden all round it an
keeps no one but colored people there-
servants and friends and all

   and they gets up to some very queer
larks in that house  fancy but that
dont matter to us except that it makes
our job easier when every one in a house
is more or less half drunk

   it do agreed mr luker  im glad
to hear it youve investergated the
house slippy

   several times mr williams an-
swered  theyve got builders at work
just now and theres a ladder quite
handy whats wrong with you and me
running down this very evening posh
and popping in when theyre at dinner
mr luker was not accustomed to en-
gage upon a job at such short notice but
he approved of what he had heard of
slippvs plan especially the presence of
the ladder and the green chartreuse had
inspired him with a dashing confidence

   im on he said  but what about
tools i never move without my little
persuader as well you know

   ive got all else well want on me
slippy answered  we shant need much
them bedroom windows are quite simple
wed better be getting a move on theres
a train from charing cross which  land
us down about eight oclock

  and the sinful pair duly caught that
train it was a charming peaceful eve-
ning and all pockbourne seemed to be
asleep the lanes were quite deserted
a few minutes from the station slippy
halted beneath a high brick wall

   heres the crib he said  we must
nip over the wall ill give you a back
theres trees enough inside to give us
cover right up to the house

   are there any nasty dogs about
posh luker asked

  slippy paled visibly he hated dogs
and all violent risks

   there are three he answered
 orrid great brutes but they keep em
in a kind of cage well away from the
house at any rate thats where they
are during the daytime when ive been
here

   we must just trust to luck posh
luker said coolly  gimme that back

  and he was on the top of the wall in a
moment and pulled slippy after him
they dropped down inside and found
themselves in an extensive shrubbery

  slippy led the way and everything went
well there was no sign of dogs or
gardeners it was a huge garden but the
trees and bushes afforded convenient
shelter and the back of the house was
reached without mishap

   theres ie ladder slippy whis-
pered and it was lifted quietly and placed
against the house no lights were show-
ing above the ground floor posh luker
inferred quite correctly that dinner was
in progress he reflected cheerfully that
everything seemed to have been made for
them

  he went first up the ladder and the
fastenings of the window that he tackled
yielded promptly to his persuasive skill
they crept through into a bedroom which
appeared to be unoccupied judging by
the absence of clothes and other trifles

   its the best bedroom that we want
mr luker whispered  the big negros
own room 

  slippy was trembling with nervousness
but he motioned with his hand and mr
luker opened the door with caution anti
peeped out there was no one upon the
broad landing

   thats the door of his room i think
slippy whispered and he had made no
mistake

it was a fine large bedroom looking
from the front of the house but what
caught posh lukers eye at once and
warmed his heart with professional jov
posh llker-his memoirs



was something lying on the dressing-table
it was nothing more or less than a handful
of loose diamonds

  oh my aunt this is the real jam
mr luker muttered  i reckon the col-
ored gent left em there when he changed
is togs well theyre going in a decent
white mans pocket now

  and they were in his pocket without
delay mr luker is never one to linger
unduly when he has made what he con-
siders a fair working profit those
diamonds in themselves were as rich a
swag as any moderate-minded man could
ask for and every moment was of course
a danger

  slippy williams was positively twitter-
ing with anxiety but mr luker insisted
on opening one or two drawers and-
that negros taste in tie pins studs and
links proved to be characteristically ex-
travagant

  as mr luker told me

   mere precious metal werent no good
to that black man it was stones that
he liked big stones well that suited my
taste too ard slippys just then we
felt quite indulgent like toward that col-
ored gentleman

  they pocketed all that they could get
without waste of time and then prepared
for a brisk departure the landing was
still deserted so was the garden to all
appearance when they peeped out they
slid down the ladder replaced it carefully
and crept away light-heartedly among the
trees it seemed to mr luker that never
in his lengthy career had he cracked a crib
with such ease and gentility

  but as mr luker remarked to me
ruefully

   its just at a moment like that mis-
ter when everythink seems happy and
peaceful that things get up and hit an
honest man 

  -the pair were about half-way across
the garden and very near the safety of
the shrubbery when slippy looked round
gave one horrified gasp and dropped
plump down upon his knees

  mr luker looked too and echoed that

  gasp despite his far greater natural
courage

  three of the biggest dogs that he had
ever seen were making after them at full
gallop only twenty yards away

   what breed they was said mr
luker when telling me this story  i do
not know it was no moment mister
for natural istorv studies ive seen no
dogs like them before and  hope and
pray  never shall again except safely
behind bars they was as big as small
donkeys their nasty eyes was red as
rubies and they had teeth like crocking-
diles they came bounding along as fast
as greyhounds making no noise at all
except for a kind of ungrv gasping
sound

  escape was hopeless

  posh luker made a jump for the bough
of a tree but one of the dogs gripped his
coat-tail and had him down in a trice

  then he let go

  to posh iukers amazement they did
not make straight for their throats they
merely stood round those unfortunate
outlaws for a moment glaring at them
curiously some shadowy idea arose in
mr lukers resourceful mind of making
friends with them

  it is probable that slippy who was
groaning hideously never entertained it
for a moment and anyhow it proved
idle the dogs closed in and began with
their great heads and shoulders to thrust
their victims away from the shrubbery
and in a moment posh luker understood
their dire intention

  they were herding their captives hack
to the house

  the two went like lambs there was
nothing else to be done mr luker
greatly daring made one attempt to edge
away and the three dogs broke their
common silence with a simultaneous growl
of so savage a quality that even his stout
blood ran cold

  they just had to go right to the
back of the house the dogs drove their
prisoners and then lifted up their heads
and began to bay triumphantly they


all-story weekly

had done their work and now they were
summoning their masters to come and
see their bag of game

    should like mr luker told me
bitterly  to hire a lion-tamer to give
them dogs the hiding they deserved

  they had not long to wait a crowd
of people burst from the house headed
by the big negro there were men in
dress clothes and women garishly clad
and servants in bright livery and every
one of them was black or brown the
prisoners were the only white men
present

  the big negro seemed to take in the
situation with one glance  here we
have two burglars for a thousand dol-
lars he said like a man exhibiting wild
animals  two unpleasant white bur-
glars 

  some of the colored ladies appeared to
think it their duty to scream at this
stage in the proceedings so they duly
screamed

  we aint burglars posh luker de-
clared indignantly  were two decent
honest men assaulted quite wanton like by
these dangerous dogs of yours-

  the negro bent and patted one of the
creatures

  good boys he said  you dont
like white trash any more than i are
they honest tiger are they

  he pointed threateningly at the cap-
tives and the dog he spoke to gave one
growl and sprang straight at slippvs
throat mr williams hurled himself
backward a good ten feet with the howl
of a lost soul and the negro laughed and
caught tiger by the collar as he sprang

  only a man of his weight and strength
could have checked the brute

   down tiger down good boy he
said  we dont want to hurt these-
honest white gentlemen-yet he
turned upon mr luker with vicious sud-
denness  if you are honest men what
are you doing in this garden

   we got in here by accident- mr
luker began

   ah the negro said nastily  here

james and sam hold these two and
peter can go through their pockets they
may have something of an incriminatory
nature upon them

   i protest strongly agin being
searched mr luker said with honest
fury

  as for slippy he seemed past the
power of speech those dogs had cowed
him cruelly

  hold your tongue sir the negro
said ferociously  do you want the dogs
to deal with you

  well mr luker didnt two colored
servants held them securely and another
went through their pockets in workman-
like style and then of course the mur-
der was out the diamonds and the rest
of the jewelry were revealed the big
regro smiled with a cruel gleam of his
white teeth

   ah he said so theyve been in
the house this shall be looked into
but we need not stand my friends
thomas bring out chairs and coffee and
cigars we will go into the matter at
our leisure and decide upon the punish-
ment of these-honest men

  and the house party sat down in great
comfort no refreshment was offered to
the prisoners it is doubtful if slippy
could have swallowed anything but mr
luker felt a certain yearning for stimu-
lant

  he did not like the look of things at
all they were entirely in the power of
that big negro and he gave the experi-
enced mr luker the impression that he
was capable of anything except decency

   vow then the host began settling
himself in his chair and lighting an im-
mense cigar  how did you get into the
house i should-advise--you-to-
answer 

  it seemed to posh luker best to humor
the man

   we made use of that ladder over
there he replied sulkily

   just so his captor answered  it
may seem careless to have left it about
but as you have seen i can trust my
posh luker his memoirs



clogs and now - there is the little
question of your punishment  rather
value those diamonds and- - i do not
greatly love white people

  he turned to his friends

   i do not think we will call in the po-
lice he said  i think we will have a
little amusement with these - honest
white men 

  his guests voiced their approval with
hilarity they seemed to share their
hosts prejudice against white men posh
lukers anxiety deepened

   if its all the same to you i think
id prefer you to call in the police he
said politely

  as he reflected-you do know where
you are with the beastly police there
seemed to be no rules about this gang of
blacks

  and slippy groaned an agreement he
was in a mood when he would have em-
braced a policeman if he could only have
seen one

  the big negro turned upon posh luker
with a vicious growl worthy of one of
his dogs

   dont you dare to speak youve put
yourselves in my hands and by cripes i
mean to have my amusement out of you
you may be my guests for some little
while anyhow the night is young
xow what shall we do first ah i have
it we will have a little boxing--just to
begin with

   what do you mean posh luker
asked

  the negro pointed to one of his ser-
vants

   tim there was not unknown in the
professional ring a few years ago he
will put on the gloves now with each of
you in turn what do you say to the
proposal he is a far lighter man than
either of you if one of you bests him
you shall both go free

  tim stepped forward chuckling he
was only a lightweight and slippy and
mr luker were one hundred and seventy
and more but he looked a very likely
hand

   mr williams raised a shrill yell of pro-
test he had no use at all for any more
professional pugilists

   i aint going to box nobody he
screamed send for the police

  his tormentor spoke quite quietly

   you will do as you are told my man
if you refuse to face tim you will be
hogged into the ring do you under-
stand-

  mr williams answered that he did
the unfortunate man seemed to wish that
he was dead

   and what do you say asked the
negro turning to mr iuker

  that gentleman was made of sterner
stuff he saw that there was no choice
in the matter and he could use his hands
more than a little and anyway he was a
good three stone heavier than tim

   ill take my chance he answered

  the big negro leaned forward in his
chair and spoke in a voice which remind-
ed mr luker of a tiger purring at the
zoo

   suppose you say  sir when you ad-
dress me he suggested  when i was
in america t made a little vow that some
day or other white trash should say  sir 
to me

  mr luker began to understand why
that negro was so bitter against white
men

  he hesitated to use his own words

   i dunno that im a man of much silly
vanity but it did go agin the grain to
say  sir  to that black man

   if you dont his host put in  you
shall fight two of those dogs instead of
tim

   and that settled it

  i-m ready to have a little turn up
with tim-sir mr luker growled very
sullenly

   thats better the negro said with
an ugly smile  the lawn in front of
our chairs will do for the entertainment
get read i will act as referee and time-
keeper

  the three combatants removed their
superfluous clothing


all-story weekly

  mr williams was lo face tim first
the servants brought out boxing-gloves
two wooden chairs sponges and water
they marked out a square upon the lawn
for a ring the guests settled themselves
comfortably men and women lo enjoy
the fun

  it was poor fun for slippy williams

    time called the big negro and mr
williams got up from his chair like a too-
intelligent sheep going lo visit a butcher

  mr luker saw at a glance that tim
was very smart and quick with his hands
he was not in much condition but he
had been a boxer of class he played
lightly with slippy for a minute and
then he rapped home a left-hander upon
his nose

  it was not a knock-down blow by any
stretch of the imagination but mr wil-
liams snatched at the excuse he went
down with a howl and he stayed down
he had had more than enough of it he
did not mean having any more the big
negro counted him out with due solem-
nity and then he said very quietly

   bring a dog-whip

  ll is probable that slippy did not catch
the words he was lying flat upon his
face pretending to be  out  to the
world

   try and flog some pluck into that
miserable cur commanded the negro
when the whip arrived

  and one of his servants obeyed with a
will it made mr luker quite sore just
to hear the two cuts which slippy took
before he was on his feet again his
screams were quite alarming

   i told you to box my man re-
marked his tormentor  i didnt tell you
to lie down to the first tap

  so mr williams went in to fight wilh
desperation remembering that dog-whip
he did all he could swinging his long
arms wildly but he knew nothing of the
fine arts of boxing tim played with
him for two rounds just to please the au-
dience and then he hooked his left with
neatness tt took slippy upon the chin
and he went down and out in real earnest

it was two minutes before he knew what
had happened

  and then it was posh lukers turn

  he had made up his mind that there
should be no dog-whips for him he
went in to fight from the start

  tim was too quick for him but he had
the weight and the heavier punch he
managed to land one on tims body that
slowed him up considerably tims con-
dition was no better than his own

  anyhow mr luker kept going for
three bustling rounds and tim knew that
he had been in a fight at the end of the
third they indulged in an old-fashioned
rally each hitting for all he was worth
tim crossed posh luker with his right
on the jaw and he went peacefully to
sleep

  when lie came round he was given a
mouthful of brandy and felt little the
worse and a few minutes later the pair
were led once more before the owner of
the house

   considering what mean white trash
ou are you didnt shape so badly
against tim he said patronizingly lo
mr luker  you have afforded us some
little entertainment to-morrow night
you shall again amuse us i have not
quite made up my mind what you shall
do but i think you shall try your hands
at dog taming

  - at what  mr williams screamed
hoarsely

    said at dog taming you would
find that those three dogs of mine would
afford ample scope for your powers be
silent your screaming annoys me take
away the prisoners now thomas and
lock them up securely

  the unfortunate pair were led away
into the house and shut into a strong
room bread and water were given them
and they were left alone they held a
consultation slippy was almost hys-
terical

   to tame them horrible dogs posh
he kept moaning - id rather die than
try it

   im not keen on it myself mr lu-
posh luker-his memoirs



ker admitted  its revenge on that
buck negro that im really keen on

  and slippy spoke about the man at
great length and with striking violence
posh luker cut him short at last

   weve got to get out of here he
said thoughtfully

   yes before that dog taming begins 
slippy groaned  do you see your way
to getting out posh

  he spoke like a child turning to its
teacher as posh luker remarked mod-
estly to me

   l its these brains of mine that they all
lean on when their own ave failed

  he had been making a careful exami-
nation of the room

  li theyve took away our tools he
said  and we cant get out of here
without them hosc window bars are
uncommon strong but ive got a sim-
ple little plan in my head

  he picked up a wooden chair

   yes he said  two of them legs
will do when we want them they can
stay on for the present im going to ave
a snooze now them beds look fairly
comfortable

  and he lay down and went to sleep
declining flatly to tell slippy of his plan
mr luker holds strongly that il is a mis-
take to take ones inferiors into ones
confidence

  the plan was put into action about
four oclock the next afternoon the
prisoners had known that thomas and
tim were coming then to bring a meal
when they entered the room mr will-
iams was having a most painful-looking
fit upon the floor his long limbs twisted
in a complicated knot

  slippy williams was no fighting man
but as mr luker admits he had his
gifts all the same he couid simulate a
fit with great naturalness at need he
seemed to put his whole heart into it

  thomas and tim somewhat startled
advanced and bent above the sufferer

  and posh luker came upon them from
behind with a substantial chair leg in his
hand he contrived that there should be

little noise and administering to each
one tap in the right place with neatness
and address they both slumbered

  they were gagged and bound with
strips of sheet and then the late prisoners
locked the door upon them and made
cautiously for the garden

  irom the window it had appeared that
no one was about but anyhow some risks
had to be taken neither was keen on
stopping there and taking part in a dog-
taming act to make a negro holiday

  they had relied upon the dogs being
shut up until the evening and it appeared
that this calculation was correct they
tiptoed into the open air holding their
breath with anxiety voices came from
a room but no one seemed to hear their
escape

  the shrubbery was reached without in-
cident and then as posh luker led the
way he saw a sight that seemed to send
even his stout heart right up into his
mouth

  the big negro was strolling alone in the
shrubbery with his back toward his es-
caping prisoners

  the pair held a brief debate crouching
in the bushes slippy was strongly in fa-
vor of sneaking away if that were possi-
ble but posh luker was keen to square
matters with that negro and there was
business to be considered too

   a chap as carries a pint of loose dia-
monds upon him is worth attention he
whispered  besides i owe that colored
gentleman rather a lot and i like to pay
my just debts try and forget that youre
such a despisable white-livered worm
slippy and back up your leader

  and posh luker went forward on tip-
toe leaving his ally to follow- or not as he
chose mr williams chose to stay where
he was when posh luker was within
four yards of the negros back a stick
cracked under his foot and the black
man turned like a flash

  but mr luker was even quicker that
stout chair-leg was still in his hand and
he made one jump forward and struck
for all he was worth as he said


all-story weekly

   its no time for half-measures when
youre dealing with a black golierth
about seven foot high

  the blow landed fairly it might have
killed a white man but it only stunned
that thick-skulled negro

  he went down upon his face

  mr luker wasted no time the loose
diamonds were in the negros pocket and
he was wearing a handsome tie-pin and
some most costly rings

  posh luker took all he could get
slippy had advanced when the work was
done they left the negro blissfully un-

conscious and made for the garden wall
at speed it caused even posh luker to
shiver to think of that negro catching
them after this

  their luck was in they boarded a
london train as it left the station and
got clear away in case of telegrams they
were at pains to leave the train before
charing cross was reached

  as for the swag mr luker admits that
it was a handsome two days work the
profits were divided in just proportion ac-
cording to the head work and courage that
had been displayed

chapter xliii

black or white

for the first time since going into the
restaurant business alec was at a
loss what to do for the first time
he so far forgot himself as to sit down
at a customers side jessie wasnt a cus-
tomer precisely in the narrower meaning
of the term but technically she was

  he had started to falter out some ques-
tion as to what she would have and
ended up by seating himself at her side

  and sat there for a while lost in a
miserable silence

  jessie continued to weep

  then alec with the air of one who fears
to disturb a sleeping child cautiously
pushed back his chair and got up

  there is some instinct which all human
animals possess to seek shelter in the
familiar occupation at the moment of
stress the habitual activity grown dear
and comfortable through use it was that
way with alec now

  he stepped over to the counter drew

 a-s

this story began in the all-story weekly for january 




all-story weekly

a mug of coffee sugared it slipped a pair
of crullers onto a plate and brought these
things back to the table where jessie sat

  he put these things before her and
quietly withdrew

  no chesterfield could have paid her
an attention more delicate more finely
inspired

  several of the customers who had been
there had now withdrawn only doc
and the young gentleman in the gray
flannel shirt remained

  doc was meditative head down mut-
tering to himself the lines of his face
drawn into a map of ultimate disdain
the young gentleman of the gray shirt
had retrieved the soiled copy of an eve-
ning paper left by some recent customer
and was absorbing the contents of the
sporting page

   alec for the time being paid no atten-
tion to either of them he went about
the work of gathering up such empty
dishes as happened to be scattered about
and was thankful that there was no im-
mediate occasion for speech

  he was aware of a queer illusion-
the same sort of an illusion as had con-
fronted him a little while ago when jes-
sie schofield had first appeared at the
door then it had been jessie yet not
jessie the physical semblance of the girl
whom he had known in rising sun
yet this physical semblance made over
as by the touch of a magician it was a
change which allured him yet struck him
with distress this explains to a degree
what was in his mind now

  that was jessie schofield back there
and yet it wasnt jessie he wondered
what had happened to her and half for-
mulated his inquiry into the deduction
that the magician touch had been secured
only at a price-a price paid by jessie
herself the price of her previous person-
ality

  the jessie schofield of rising sun he
had been willing to marry but this one
he sought to disguise his secret misgiv-
ings by a show of professional activity

  he slapped doc on the back

   hows the old hoss alec demanded
with simulated joviality

   rotten doc mumbled

   fry it on both sides and use lots of
ketchup alec recommended  thats
what i do when i get a chinee egg
couldnt tell it from new

   the worlds full of eggs like that
doc commented  youre right world
dont know no difference xot here in
new york leastwise it dont

  alec gathered up docs mug and plate
he stood there hesitant trying to extract
light on his own situation from docs
wisdom such light as he did extract
brought him but small comfort all his
own smartness and wit were being pushed
out of him all that would come into his
brain were scraps of observation uncon-
sciously collected since his own advent in
new york

  he cast a look back at jessie sight
of her brought with it a wave of tender-
ness and desire but there was no mistak-
ing it on the crest of it was a froth of
caution of hopelessness of dismay

  was jessie good or was she bad
was she destined to become such a little
fat domesticated pigeon as doc had de-
scribed or was she to become like cer-
tain other girls who patronized this res-
taurant fie didnt know

   dont hurry away doc he urged
 i may want to talk to you about some-
thing

  alec with docs empty dishes in his
hand skated across the floor to gather
the dishes of the eater of prune-pie
that worthy was folding his newspaper
with the satisfied air of an intellectual
who has just finished the reading of a
good book

   rough house smitty win his second
bout wit kid johnson he announced
 i knowed him when-

   stick around alec interrupted
 something may be going to break
how about another shot of pie -his
voice lurched for he was doing an un-
precedented thing- on vie
the scarlet ghost



   go as far as you like his guest ac-
cepted

  with a flourish alec drew two fresh
mugs of coffee deftly with the skill
of a professional juggler he secured two
plates one of which received more
crullers for doc the other the sports-
mans pie he made a step or two as
if forgetful of his direction pirouetted
and delivered the victuals with a flourish
of triumph

  the sportsman laughed out loud
even old doc grinned but it wasnt
for them that alec had displayed his
virtuosity besides he may have sus-
pected that their approbation was stimu-
lated by the free food he dispensed

  it was to jessie he looked he was
rewarded by seeing her smile impulsive
friendly

  but jessie had wept the rouge and
the powder which had adorned her young
face were badly streaked and regard-
less of that smile of hers at seeing him
perform her mood was somber

  alec elected a cup of buttermilk for
himself cut himself a generous sandwich
and seated himself once more at jessies
side

   eat your crullers sweetie he
pleaded

   im not hungry jessie complained

   youve started on them so you
might as well finish them alec coun-
seled gently alluding to the tiny nick
jessie had already made in one of them

  the reasoning appeared to influence
jessie favorably still with that sad and
reflective look on her face she picked
up a cruller and bit into it she tried
to chew it meditatively but the bite dis-
appeared with surprising rapidity she
took another the entire cruller took
the plunge between her generous lips

   city crullers are much-better-than
country crullers she admitted sadly
after an interval

  alec was in process of doing full
credit to his own nourishment he
washed down the large bite of sandwich
he had just taken he was in too great

a hurry to waste time on proper mastica-
tion he had something to say

   she could always have all ihe
crullers she wanted he jolted half
aloud impetuously  i know where i
can buy em at fifty cents a hundred

   theyre awfully good jessie re-
warded him distraught as she picked
up the second cruller and bit into it

  if the first cruller went fast the sec-
ond one disappeared as if by magic
jessie was licking her fingers while alec
was still smearing mustard on the sec-
ond half of his sandwich without a
word alec got up took her plate and
brought back another brace of the con-
fection doc also so greatly loved

  who are those two gentlemen
jessie asked

  her mood wras softening her sadness
-whatever the inspiration of it-disap-
pearing under the influence of the food

   customers of mine said alec
 customers and friends the old gentle-
man is a doctor anyways i call him
doc that shows you how well ac-
quainted we are fine man too highly
educated practically at the head of a
scientific institute down the street you
know - one of these sort of old pro-
fessors dont care nothing about
money dotty but nice

   the young guys a friend of mine
too he just about put rough house
smittv where he is to-day-probably one
of the best-known prize-fighters in the
world right now you ought to hear
smitty call little old alec by his first
name he threatened to smash me in
the bean the last time he was in here-
you know only fooling he was soused
at the time

   i should think that youd just love
it here jessie quavered  what are
those under the glass cover chocolate
eclairs

   sure-try one

   im not a bit hungry jessie an-
swered detached yet pleased

  alec brought her one

  alec himself was softened by the
	all-story

food he had taken he watched jessie
with a recurrence of all the tenderness
and desire he had previously experienced
as she swallowed her first lump of eclair

   feeling better tootsie he whispered

  he was visibly moved and was dying
to know what had happened while she
was a guest of the woman who had taken
her away from mrs mosss establish-
ment but none the less he preferred
this killing suspense to what jessie might
tell him

  jessie was trying to eat her eclair with
dignity the pastry was so outrageously
good though that there was something
of a struggle between her dignity and her
greed her mouth was full she gave
alec a sidelong glance from her still-
painted through rather streaked eyes

  jessie looked exceedingly good to alec
into his mind there flashed a small vision
of what rufus underwood had done

  but rufus was a farmer

  no city man would act as rufus had
acted

  there returned to him the feeling of
sin and superiority which had actuated
him during so much of his sojourn at
rising sun

chapter xliv

by royal command

such a night such a dawn and
every day is the day of days for
some one some pair whom god hath
joined together some scattered group
meshed in the common net of karma

  while alec breen and jessie schofield
thus faltered blindly so with another
pair viola swan who shudders and
prophesies in mrs mosss flat waiting
for the dawn as a man condemned might
wait either for death or reprieve rufus
underwood her husband who also
groans and keeps his vigil

  rufus sa there in the room that had
been theirs there was no light except
the dusky opalescence of the night-the

weekly

night of the open country starlit misty
with shadows as black and deep as
death and pale drifts as elusive and
subtle as hopes of heaven there was
no sound except that eternal murmur of
the unadilla the skirl of crickets and
frogs the occasional sough and rustle of
the wakeful trees

  the windows were open the breeze
came in the odors of the night re-
minded him of her

  alice alice viola viola

  rufus caught himself as a man will
after an emotional outbreak when he is
alone he listened to the echo of his
own voice and wondered what it signified
he remembered that other time he had
called to her-in a delirium like this
then she had answered him it seemed
incredible to him that she should never
answer him again

   it cant be he said

  he looked at the bed where she had
slept at his side and silting down on
the edge of it touched the vacancy
where she had lain he did this with a
degree of reverence and awe

  what had become of this creature who
had occupied this place-this tenderness
and warmth he had felt at his side-
this mystery and charm which had come
into his life to ennoble him to make him
weak as a child and strong as a god

  he let his head fall into his hands

  finally once more he struck a match
and lit the lamp the lamp stood on a
table near the bed and he was surprised
to see how many burned matches already
lay around it there had been none a
while before but at first he didnt see
the cause of his torment the breeze had
carried it to the floor-a slip of paper

   thus o god said rufus to him-
self  could a breath from you make this
thing as if it had never existed

  the thought somehow consoled him as
he stooped and picked it up-that tele-
gram mrs moss had caused to be sent
to him he read it through he read
each word again most of all his eyes
remained on the signature
the scarlet ghost



  the tragic simplicity of it the tragic
folly

  two lines of doggerel signed with a
 v -brought to him on the wings of
the night to scoff at those fine senti-
ments of his as the only answer to the
prayers spoken and unspoken which
clamored from his heart

   you didnt write it said rufus
 you didnt write it you never did a
cruel act in your life you loved all
things made all things love you

  but as rufus looked up visualizing
there in the lamplight the woman to
whom he spoke there occurred one of
those old tricks of consciousness to which
humanity must have been accustomed
throughout the ages whence otherwise
could have sprung all those old stories of
ghosts and jinn of devils and angels
witches and errant souls

  rufus had visualized the alice linn
he had married-slender brave loving
faithful with a spirit as beautiful as her
physical presence he saw her as a sem-
blance in pale blue back of this there
evolved another shape-scarlet this time
it was fleeting momentary it was
gone but he had recognized it - the
wraith of viola swan

  rufus turned down the wick with a
shaking hand he blew out the light and
slid down to his knees

  xow whatever rufuss petition be-
hold the answer on the way

  penningtons chauffeur was a man
called beck there may have been a
more elaborate name on becks license-
card as a registered chauffeur there
must have been there were certain
other names of his on the books of cer-
tain great institutions of state-institu-
tions with steel doors and steel-barred
windows for beck had been celebrated
in his day despite his youth in ways
just as well forgotten

  he looked the part - not very tall
but exceedingly muscular a square
seamed face clean-shavenwhich might
have been brutal but for its touch of

humor of enlightenment of knowledge
acquired at the price of great suffering

  for all that a queer presence for that
of a messenger of the lord

  it was getting late

  the same night which had deftly sub-
merged the hills and valleys of the old
tenderloin and those of the unadilla
had similarly immersed josiah penning-
tons country-place

  beck was sitting in the kitchen talking
to the cook she was much older than
beck-stout getting gray xo one
looking at them and listening to them
for as much as two minutes would have
had any doubt about the depth of affec-
tion which existed between them beck
called her  honey and she called him
willie - both names ludicrously in-
appropriate save in the light of love

  there was only once that beck called
her by another name

  the telephone rang the telephone
was in the butlers pantry just off the
kitchen the cook answered it she
turned to beck

 willie its for you theyre tele-
phoning up from the depot that they got
a telegram for you from mr pennington
beck hustled over and took the re-
ceiver

   they say he explained after a col-
loquy  that mr pennington wants me
to take the car and bring some one to
xew york

  to-morrow morning

   to-night

  he spoke again into the instrument
listen i got to see that myself
the junction seven miles-say ill be
down there in seven minutes

  willie youll be killing yourself

   forget it hon mr pennington
aint asking me to do anything like that
id go the limit though if he did

  he threw his arms about the cook
kissed her twice while she surrendered
to his tenderness as if she had been a
schoolgirl

  good-by you rascal she mur-
mured and dont get hurt


all-story weekly

  good-by mother he said very
softly

  in truth it was just seven minutes
later that the big yellow touring-car
snorted up to the little railroad-junction
which was the nearest telegraph-office to
penningtons place beck read the mes-
sage through several times the night-
operator helping him to supply the
missing punctuation and make the mean-
ing clear the message instructed him
to proceed to rising sun without delay
there to find one rufus underwood and
bring him to new york- as fast as
you can

   what if this underwood aint ex-
pecting you the operator suggested

   that wont make a lot of difference
said beck folding up the yellow flimsy
 ill take this along

   that wont help the operator
laughed  if he dont want to go along
beck gave the telegrapher a glance cf
simple conviction

  say he declared this is all the
same as a warrant its got mr pen-
ningtons signature on it aint it well
that names all the same as if it was the
governors so far as im concerned im
off good-by and thanks

  good-by good luck

  the last word the telegrapher spoke
was still reverberating in his brain when
there were a dozen sputtering explosions
a cyclopean snort a crescendo whine

   that fellow ought to be an engi-
neer the operator muttered with a
touch of awe as he glanced at his clock
 rising sun twenty miles by the dirt-
road i bet at that he could beat the
cannon-ball express

  the road was deserted

  beck had that in his favor it was a
fact ever present in his mind as he lifted
the thing that carried him on the wings
of the wind over hill after hill it was
like a fantom that ran to a music of
thunder through a world at an end the
night was like the night after judgment
day

  in this world there was only one living

thing the thing was a man the mans
name was rufus underwood

  he had to be found

  quick

  over the hills and through long valleys
into which the yellow car gleamed and
dissolved like a falling star the rumble
and shriek of a startled bridge the swift
rush through a zone of damp chill where
the road followed a river then up and
up as a rocket climbs to the crest where
another long fall began scarcely less
swift through a dark town where only
the houses looked on with amazement-
their windows like open mouths and
wonder-stricken eyes four more villages
another town this time the car
slowed up

  beck found the railroad-station

  bainbridge

  he jumped from his car ran over to
a lighted window there was another
sleepless telegrapher there he was a
mere you interested at once

   i dont know of no rufus under-
wood he said but there is an un-
derwood farm out near the river this
side of rising sun you can get there
quicker if you take the fork to the right
where it crosses the right of way look
out when you come there too twenty-
nines due in a couple of minutes

  thanks so long

  beck was gone

  as the car leaped after the glimmer of
its own searchlights like a greyhound
after a spectral stag the night was pene-
trated by the long weird call of a loco-
motive-whistle

  number twenty-nine

  a fast freight

  beck could see it from a swiftly melt-
ing rise of ground he gave one thought
to penningtons cook he gave one
thought to pennington himself

  the yellow car flung into the fork to
the right as the fast freight rushed in to
accept the challenge

   missed me by a mile panted beck
as the freight bellowed just back of him
it was bellowing still as the night un-
the scarlet ghost



folded enough to disclose the dim con-
formation of a darkling farm under a
hill

  a glance and from this house like a
signal there came a gleam of yellow
light

  some one was astir in an upper
chamber

  there was a lane a dog barked a
gate flashed into existence the yellow
car crunched to a standstill

   im not going said rufus

  but there was no great decision in his
voice there never can be human de-
cision in the presence of superhuman
mystery and with that this night had
been filled until now it overflowed

   youre coming beck said with as-
surance

  beck was calm he understood men
-as one who has been among men when
their souls were naked he was friendly
but his assurance was monumental and
adamant he put out a gauntleted hand
until it touched the head of unconvinced
and growling duke his eyes though
remained on the face of the man he had
cc-me to find

   youre coming he repeated almost
soothingly  those are my orders from
mr pennington

   whos mr pennington rufus
asked

  a regular fellow beck answered
 one that dont make no false passes
i know id tell you about it only i
aint got the time get on your coat
and your shoes ill give you the run
of your life well leave a trail of rube
sheriffs right on all the way from here
tc new york when we get there well
learn the traffic-cops a trick or two
hurry up

   suppose i refuse

  you cant flared beck his jaw
came out he buckled his right arm
 there is a jolt in this he softly de-
clared

  rufus met becks eyes into his
baffled brain there plunged a rioting

throng of what his thoughts questions
gropings and petitions had been while
he was still alone a ghostly phalanx
out of the surge there came a flash or
a note or revelation

  it thrilled him like the blare of a
trumpet-gabriel -s

when gabriel blows his trumpet in the bright
   light

  wait thrilled rufus i believe
you were sent ill go

chapter xlv

the cosmic center

just as every day becomes the day of
days for some person or group of
persons so a mean house in a mean
street may become for some human
atom or association of human atoms
the dead center of the universe - the
pivotal point of cosmos

  see how the threads of a number of
destinies were suddenly stretched taut
and straight to mrs mosss place

  xo one would have thought it to see
the elderly house standing there in the
midst of its somewhat squalid neighbors
there in the thick of that part of new
york known as the old tenderloin

   the street itself was more sordid than
ever in the dawn-which is the way with
all human things which are old and evil
then the contrast is more hideous-the
unloveliness of grime and stench of
degradation and secrecy matched against
the supernal purity of the upper air the
refreshened beauty and sweetness of the
sky

  and mrs mosss house despite that
certain primness about it was of the
essence of the street the stained glass
of the front door which glowed more or
less warmly in the night was now merely
the red rim of an eye gone blind the
house itself was silent and sullen such
human interest as it might possess was
hidden in its heart-the nest of warm
and ugly secrets like the heart of many

another creature with a reputation for
respectability to maintain

  yet mrs mosss house was the mag-
net toward it as straight as uncon-
scious of other attraction as the black
sands of another magnetic field there
sped and aspired the mortal sands of
this one

  there was josiah penningtons friend
-the lady named julia the invisible
hooks were in every feminine fiber of her
-each hook at the end of an invisible
thread as strong as silk - each thread
drawing her as surely to mrs mosss
house as if she had been in the clutch
of gravity with nothing but ether to
intervene

  she was jealous miserable and frantic
for relief

  there was something about the hap-
penings of this night which had kept
her awake and apprehensive something
which she had been unable to fathom
men are as inexplicable to women at
times as women are to men and the
very rarity of this phenomenon makes
the sufferings of the woman all the
keener

  julia had always thought she under-
stood pennington-more or less of a boy
impulsive as to evil constant as to good

  what had occurred to change him so

  why had he left her so abruptly
why had he gone so eagerly at the sum-
mons of that other woman he had
told her that this other woman was not
so very young not so very beautiful
but her intuition told her that in this
pennington had deceived her - for his
own peace and hers but she knew no
peace

  there was another woman

   ill go there again she whispered
 ill go there as soon as i dare in the
morning i have a right

   ill go there again was also the
message with which another woman was
slaying her impatience as the night wore
on  ill go there myself and if that
brats there ill slap her face until shell
avish she was dead

  mrs lilly spencer this time - the
nice rich lady who had taken jessie
schofield from mrs mosss house and
from whose own house jessie had fled

  mrs spencer had passed a sleepless
night which was no extraordinary thing
for her perhaps but the night had been
one of bitterness and trouble as well

  in the first place there was jessies
inexplicable truancy in the second
place there was the impolite intrusion
ol the police it wasnt a raid precisely
just the inquisitive visit of a number of
cynical young men from headquarters
with orders straight from their supreme
chief to find a certain girl from the
village of rising sun

  mrs spencer quite professionally
had denied all knowledge of the existence
of such a person the young men had
impolitely insisted on a search of the
premises mrs spencer herself was
considerably more surprised than the de-
tectives themselves when jessie failed to
materialize

  the disappearance was there to rankle
even when the detectives were gone
right on into the dawn it rankled there
was only one place where she could hope
to find relief and that was in lettie
mosss miserable flat-house to which
she presumed-and also hoped for pur-
poses of revenge-the missing girl had
returned

  the blue dawn was streaking in
through various chinks of the heavily
curtained windows but no breath of the
outer freshness could get in to palliate
the heavy atmosphere there-an atmos-
phere of turkish tobacco and cold in-
cense-as lilly spencer stiffly began to
change her dress

  a long and tedious process for she
would have to remove as well the heavy
make-up she used when in the artificial
light of her house put on a make-up
more suitable for the street

  she examined her heavily painted and
sin-sculptured face in her mirror

 my god she meditated but
youre looking old
the scarlet ghost



  old old and what lay ahead of
her at mrs mosss house

  but if the detective intelligence of the
big town had earlier in the night sent
its young men to mrs spencers place
in quest of the girl reported missing by
no less a personage than josiah penning-
ton that intelligence now with the com-
ing of the dawn was none the less re-
sponsive to the magnetic drag which
others felt

  a house in the thirties the land-
lady of it an old woman with a past
letitia moss

   ill take a look in on that place my-
self said the guiding intelligence
 this is the first favor josh pennington
has ever asked of me since he was a
freshman and i was a sophomore-and
i had him down and he wanted me to
let him up crock he added aloud
this time to his policeman secretary
 you and i will have breakfast together
i want you to go along with me on a
little run up into the old tenderloin
the secretary young and healthy
built for welterweight honors in the
boxing-ring had he cared to go after
them looked up from the typewriter he
was arduously punching with a finger of
each hand he reassembled his thought

   chief he said cheerfully  at that

i	think we ought to bring lilly spencer
down here

   shell be here crock the chief an-
swered  weve got enough on her to
send her away for twenty years-if she
dont beat it for philadelphia or chi-
cago or the coast thats what im
thinking about old lady moss as well
the womans a crook weve had her
long enough well give her the tip
shes old let her retire to the country
-hoboken say or schenectady or-
the morgue laughed crock

  none slept once the magnet had them
in its clutch this was the day of
days mrs mosss house the cosmic
center

  it was more or less like that with
penningtons self

  he also had passed the sleepless night
not if the former viola swan the pres-
ent mrs rufus underwood had been a
princess of the blood or a relative or a
sweetheart even could he have been
more devoted to her cause

  he had brought good will enough to
her assistance from the first yet no
great enthusiasm but the enthusiasm
came later on only gradually did his
imagination permit him to grasp the full
scope of the drama in which he had
been cast if only for a minor role now
it was unfolding itself to his mental
vision with the vividness and something
of the grandeur of the dawn

  his friend at headquarters had kept
him informed of what the police were
doing - how the girl had presumably
been traced to the - after a fashion-
hospitable home of one mrs lilly spen-
cer how in that place both the girl
and her trail utterly disappeared

  so much had pennington communi-
cated by telephone to her yho had put
the scar on his face

  in the solitude of his private quarters
at the gotham club pennington medi-
tated on all this as the night wore on
lie knew now why he was trying so
hard to do all that viola swan would
have him do to win her ultimate com-
mendation might not hasten the de-
parture of that red brand from his face
but it would wipe out entirely the scar
on his heart-which was more important

   ill go to see her he told himself
t go just as early as i decently can-
whatever julia may say or think

  but as he thought of julia now in
connection with this present case pen-
nington felt the stab of a self-accusation
men toyed with tragedy the women
paid

  suppose you married julia

  that was the purport of what had
flickered in his mind he saw that this
was possible he saw that this was
good but there was no hesitancy in his


all-story weekly

mind no question at all as he declared
to himself the more pressing business

   but first - first - to mrs mosss
house

  jessie schofield and alexander breen
had also turned their faces to the house
in the old tenderloin - as primitive
mariners innocent of compass looked
to the pole star oh a stormy night all
the other stars of their heaven were in
movement their solid earth had gone
as unstable as the waves

  only mrs mosss house gleamed fixed
and magnetic

  alec had finally succumbed to the cor-
roding anxiety he had asked jessie-
ir a roundabout way but clearly enough
-just what had happened to her in
mrs spencers house

  now jessie may have told the truth
again it is possible that she had not
perhaps she was just drawing on
imagination on what she had read in
 metropolitan life unveiled or the
mysteries and miseries of americas
great cities you can hardly ever tell
when a girl like her gels fairly started
on such a theme moreover there was
the spectacle of alec breen-

such thick carnivorous passion in his throat
tearing a passage through the wrath and fear-

as elizabeth barrett browning said of
the lion

  that was alec in any cae as jessie
warmed up told of an orgy in mrs
spencers house - senators and captains
of industry present and a  foreign
nobleman -floods of champagne-the
giddy dance

  and right on the worse the more of
it until jessie had to have recourse to
poetry again not from mrs browning
this time but from some verses in that
favorite book of hers

i	durst not look to what i was before

my soul shrank back and wished to be no more

  she was definite enough however
when it came to recounting the details

oi her escapc so definite that alec was
forced to believe all the rest of the ac-
count-how there had been a girl named
pear how pearl had finally advised her
to  beat it lent her the clothes jessie
then wore and also twenty-five cents for
car-fare how pearl had diverted the at-
tention of a certain swart guardian of
the lower portal of mrs spencers castle
until jessie was safe away

   this listens said alec trying to be
humorous in spite of the quiver that
shook his lower lip  like a fillum with
theda bara in it

    adore theda bara said jessie

   and it looks to me alec continued
i like mrs moss framed you for the
part

  oh not dear old mrs moss

   well you got to go back to mrs
mosss with me alec quavered fright-
ened at his own courage  and you got
to repeat this in the presence of i and
my witnesses

   why dont you introduce me to your
friends jessie invited

  dawn when alec and jessie doc and
the gentleman in the gray flannel shirt
left the restaurant in fourteenth street
while alec locked the door the others
looked out upon the world about them

  doc meekly contemplated the dust of
the street the friend of prize-fighters
furtively contemplated jessie but jes-
sie saw the dim blue sky-scrapers up-
springing to the grays and pinks of the
infant day

  the high and gilded peak of the
metropolitan tower flashed out -  in
spasms of awful sunshine as her
favorite poet would have said

   and oh sighed jessie in a heart-
throb that was almost audible

      from the low earth round you
     reach the heights above you

      from the stripes that wound you
      seek the loves that love you

   gimme your package said the
youth in the gray shirt with elemental
chivalry  ill carry it for youse
the scarlet ghost



   oh thank you jessie smiled  but
theres nothing in it except a few eclairs

  alec turned they started north

  and all the time that these lesser
threads of destiny were shortening to
the appointed hour and place what of
that greater bond that was bringing
rufus underwood hurtling through the
night

  beck himself was like a meteorite
rushing to its predestined spot on the
surface of the earth

  beck sat hunched up one sensitive
foot was on a pedal his nervous and
powerful hands held the steering-wheel
in a grip which was at once light and
strong for mile after mile he hadnt
budged except to the almost automatic
reflexes of his matchless driving for
him his body had ceased to exist save as
an instrument of his intelligence his
intelligence had ceased to exist save as
the instrument of some all-inclusive
gratitude-somewhat as the human soul
may become so the philosophers say
the instrument of the spirit

  rufus equally motionless watched
the flight of prostrate miles the road
was a spinning river stricken white on
the black shores reeled and fell incon-
ceivable shapes in a perpetual hurricane
farms forests rivers whole townships
and counties whatever was solid and
substantial in ordinary times were all
stricken with the same breath of an-
nihilation

  rufus was a poet something of the
seer

  he read in this transmutation of
earthly things something of the divinity
of man his own soul soared up and
out ahead of the racing machine which
man had made and man directed to a
vision of the goal

  this was life

  life was a rush like this through dis-
solving blackness

  there was no permanent reality not
even in the brief zone of visibility which
lighted the road immediately in front

  reality lay away off there in the
darkness in the magical city toward
which all humanity was speeding each
one in quest of the beloved mate

  then only would it be day all things
be revealed

  its getting light said beck

   yes rufus answered thats the
east - almost straight ahead - and the
stars have gone

  they hit a hill with a grade so stiff
that the machine moaned as it gripped
the rough surface of the road and began
to climb beck pulled a lever he
touched a button the shine of the head-
lights deftly surrendered to a blue-gray
pallor which suddenly immersed the
world about them

  as if relieved by this change of at-
mosphere the car sprang on refreshed
while rufus was still marveling at the
changed outlook the car was over the
brow of the hill coasting again-to the
rocking panorama of a village

  a speck appeared in the road near
the edge of the village

  the speck became a man the man
developed an aspect of human authority
waving its arms

  the man and the village both were
gone

   hell telephone on ahead said
beck li but it  take more than a rube
sheriff to stop us

  the road was steadily improving an-
other village dangled across their sight
another speck appeared which likewise
developed into the semblance of a man
-a man armed with a shotgun this time
rufus glimpsed the face of the creature
as they rocketed past him

   bang

    xot the tire thank god beck ex-
claimed

  this village too was gone out into
the open country into the softly widen-
ing dawn the car was sprinting as if the
race were only begun

   he shot at us said beck not with-
out satisfaction t it  happen again 

   what if they stop us


all-story weekly

   they wont slop us said beck
 ive got a hunch this is one of those
runs that go through to the finish

   youre right said rufus

  he also felt the conviction that this
was  one of those runs that go through
to the finish the were as messengers
of the king no earthly power or
authority was so high and strong as that
which sped them on

  the day sprang up new york was
near

  thus the black sands of all these di-
verse destinies were caught for the time
being in the same magnetic field the
center of this field a certain mean build-
ing in a certain mean street human
thus far were these sands-as human as
humanity may ever be considered simply
that

  now enter the superhuman

  for one more element was caught in
the converging lines which led to mrs
mosss house as straight as an arrow
it came-out of the unknown also a
messenger of the king also with an
authority no man could question no
earthly power could stop or stay the
element has been pictured as the rider
on the pale horse

  the thing was death

chapter xlvi

revelation

throughout the latter part of

the night viola swan had found
herself alone-alone that is save
for those spirit visitors which always
come and go at such a time

  rufus uncle joel mrs jenvey the
preacher from the little wooden church
aunt allie andy jones then alec
breen jessie schofield mrs moss pen-
nington - all these had kept her com-
pany in the spirit ghosts and all the
lime that other-the scarlet ghost but
this one so real that at no time could
she have said

   thou art viola swan i - i - am
alice linn i am mrs rufus under-
wood  

  no most of the time she herself was
the scarlet ghost

  this was its birthplace this was its
habitat this was its very atmosphere-
an atmosphere which was killing to
alice linn it was viola swan who
brooded there who listened to the fur-
tive footfalls who unraveled and identi-
fied the blurred and tangled noises of
the night

  she was alone when she received her
several messages from pennington tell-
ing her that he had gone to police head-
quarters and there had been promised
help again when he had telephoned
merely to inquire if she was all right if
she had any news still again when he
told her that jessie schofield had been
traced to mrs spencers house and that
she had thence disappeared

  from what pennington told her and
from what she herself had learned but
most of all through the gradual evolu-
tion of her souls own vision she had
built up a pretty clear conception of
what had taken place-jessies welcome
in this house the hoodwinking of alec
breen the girls subsequent transfer to
mrs spencer

  the precise part taken in all this by
alec she did not perceive but this
didnt matter greatly she knew alec
he might put on the travesty of villain
 hero but his real character was that
of the clown

  on her own account she bore alec no
malice not even the thought that it
was he who had possibly lured jessie to
new york aroused in her any desire for
punishment so far as he was concerned

  he was but an element in the con-
spiracy of circumstance so also was
she herself so also jessies antecedents

  it was mrs moss who was the villain
of the drama-the old the sagacious
the unclean the polluter of the hitherto
pure the spectral presence of the old
woman haunted these rooms as could
the scarlet ghost



none other the very smell of these
rcoms was mrs moss so was the dim-
ness of them so was their response to
the throb and cacophony of the old
tenderloin the soiled walls and the
decrepit furniture were vibrant with her
contact they were saturated with the
secrets of old mrs mosss heart and
brain tainted to the same degree of cor-
ruption and decay

  at last viola swan could stand it no
longer

  she felt a sudden craving for some
sort of physical communication with
rufus if only indirectly this craving
she could satisfy in a measure by speak-
ing to jo the cellar-man learning from
him at least that her telegram had been
safely sent

  it was always night more or less in
mrs mosss rooms but as viola crept
softly out into the hall-where there was
a flight of steps leading down into the
cellar under those which led to the
upper floors-she noticed that the night
was waning that it was dawn she rec-
ognized this with a little gasp as one
might receive some great spiritual truth
when the soul itself gropes in darkness

  opening the door at the head of the
cellar-stairs she heard the clang and
scrape of a steel scoop on a cement
floor even at this early hour jo was
at work

  she found him between the coal-bin
and the small furnace used to insure a
hot-water supply to the upper regions
she called him by name he straight-
ened up eyed her startled through the
gioom for the few seconds it took him
tc- recognize her

  then straightway he became all ami-
able attention

   i got your change for you he said
 i guess it was more than you thought
it would be

  he hastily propped the scoop against
the side of the coal-bin made the pre-
liminary passes at digging into his
pocket

   thirteen words he began

  thirteen viola exclaimed there
were thirty jo

  jo was afflicted by a spasm of recollec-
tion the spasm dazed then flustered
him he didnt have enough wit to
frame a protective lie he coughed
seized his scoop shook down the coal
with it and made a great show of stoking
the furnace xoise - plenty of noise
that was jos idea of escaping from a
bad situation

  viola waited patiently for a lull in the
racket she wouldnt admit it but kept
telling herself all the time that jo had
simply made some minor mistake but
the fact of it was all the time that she
was waiting for jo to end his noise she
was trying to beat out the flames that
had started up inside of her like the
flames in the furnace-flames that hurt
her and frightened her more than any-
thing which had happened thus far this
night- she was always intuitional

  jo came to the end of his noise
shuffled about dejected-like a fugitive
overtaken in a cul-dc-sac

   what happened to my telegram 
viola asked softly

  she could read a portion of his secret
ir the growing trouble of hflwhite and
black face it was something to pour oil
on that inner conflagration of hers but
even now she was telling herself that
she must be calm must be strong

   i didnt mean no harm said jo
 in this life you got to do what youre
told to do look at me shovelin coal
down here when id ruther be out pickin
apples or somethin look at you i
bet you dont like it here in this dern
house any more than i like it down here
in this dirty cellar ive watched you
miss swan with my own eyes im
nothin but a cellar-man - and a bum
one at that-but i see often enough that
you was doin things you didnt want to
do no more than i want to do what i
got to do

   jo didnt you send the telegram at
all viola asked - with a ray of hope
almost  it wouldnt be too late to


all-story weekly

send another one put down your shovel
tell me the truth dont be afraid
instinctively she was using with him
much the same method she would have
used with a frightened child

   mrs moss told me to burn your
telegram jo blurted in an agitated
vhisper  she wrote another one to the
same address - wrote it next door in
cooneys delicatessen store  was there
and see her do it she told me to copy
it out on a telegraph-blank

   and did you

   thirteen words said jo i copied
it all right  got what mrs moss wrote
right here if you dont believe me
with a sort of crisping suspense violet
waited the flames were raging inside
of her now she was merely smothering
them as best she could dreading what
might follow their bursting forth it
was with an air almost of indifference
that she received a soiled fold of paper
which jo extracted from an old pocket-
book and handed over to her

  she read that substitute message which
had been sent-grotesque-as grotesque
as a grimace painted on the face of a
corpse she read it slowly over and over
again and was unconscious of it even
when the paper slipped from her fingers
and fluttered to the floor

  jo retrieved it and returned it to his
purse as something possessing value

   shes wicked she is the old lady
he said cautiously  shes got the devil
himself skinned for sin she has i knew
that i hadnt ought to switch these tele-
grams a fellow could go over the road
for that yes sir even if it is poetry
but she told me to do it she did and
you know how it is yourself when the old
lady says something

  and so on but viola didnt hear him
it was to the conflagration inside of
her to which she listened a palace was
burning up in there-or a temple some-
thing she had designed and builded out
of her hopes and dreams and the edi-
fice was tenanted by all those whom she
loved even alice linn was doomed

alice and rufus were there together out
of the red inferno it was only the scarlet
ghost whose name was viola swan which
could survive

  she murmured a word or two of excuse
and comfort for jos benefit but they
were words which not even she under-
stood

  she turned and made her way back to
the stairs she walked with constraint
and breathed with constraint and was
trying to think with constraint only she
couldnt think she could feel that
was all she could do and the feeling by
this time was a whirlwind of fire

  at the lop of the stairs she halted in
the midst of her turmoil and red anarchy
yet another sensation had come to her-
a sensation strange and small

  she stood there wavering as she sought
to identify it

  something like peace it was something
like divine comfort yet how could
either of these things be hers at the pres-
ent time

  then she recognized it

  this was the same feeling which had
come to her earlier in the night there
while she was lying on mrs mqsss bed
-that feeling of maternity such as a
young mother must know when her first-
born nestles for the first time at her
breast

  something to live for die for
whispered viola swan

  xo it was her other self which must
have whispered that

  but it was viola swan who reentered
mrs mosss flat and stood there pale
transfigured strangely exalted in the
presence of mrs moss herself

chapter xlvii

 vengeance is mine

mrs moss had been pottering
about the far side of the room
she turned as viola entered
whatever the change that had come over
the girls appearance it was something
the scarlet ghost



that made mrs moss start slightly draw-
back a little with a look of bafflement of
consternation

   i was just thinking that you might
want a bite of early breakfast said mrs
moss

  she kept her eyes on viola with no
special volition on her own part viola
kept her eyes on mrs moss violas
voice was soft and reasonable when she
spoke

   ive seen that telegram she said

   what telegram

  mrs moss was flustered but as an old
campaigner she was hastily looking to
her trenches

    the telegram you sent

   i didnt send no telegram viola i
dont know what youre talking about

   dont call me viola im not viola
im alice linn if you will im mrs
rufus underwood i sent a telegram to
my-my husband you intercepted it
you sent something else instead

  she was still speaking with an effort
to be gentle and reasonable perhaps
mrs moss misinterpreted her mood she
tried to inject an element of gaiety

   oh that was just a little joke she
babbled softly she was momentarily
convulsed with mirth at least she at-
tempted to give herself the appearance
of that the mirth went out in a flash
of something like indignation  you
know how to take a joke dont you
viola

   ive asked you not to call me
viola

  not that it mattered very much the
girl was merely making an effort to save
herself by thought that was all

  mrs moss decided to try the offensive

   you appear to be sort of uppish all
of a sudden she commented  i dont
see what particular give youve got to be
so particular about your name so
youre alice linn are you that aint
the name your sweetheart asked for you
by when he come here last night and
spent an hour with you-right here in
my own bedroom too why you ought

to be ashamed of yourself trying to throw
the bull with me and me the only friend
you got

   we did no wrong

  mrs mosss retort was a grin and a
leer

   i tell you that we did no wrong
cried alice linn with a mounting emo-
tion-a shade of suppressed hysteria  i
sent a telegram to my husband i tell
you and you took it and sent him an-
other instead oh i dont know what i
ought to do youre wicked youre
wicked you made me wicked you
want to keep me wicked ive tried-
ive tried-

  she had taken a few steps forward
still blind to the purpose that was leading
her on mrs moss displayed an unmis-
takable flurry of alarm she sought to
conceal this in a burst of rage

  	dont you talk to me like that you
snipe she gurgled  why i made you
what you was youd a starved if it
hadnt been for me now you want to
turn on me do you you was glad
enough viola swan to have me help you
when you was down on your luck you
come back now to fool that poor rube
husband of yourn while youre receiving
your swrell friends why honestly
viola-

   dont call me that

  it was a cry straight from the heart
there was so much grief and desperation
in it that mrs moss was momentarily
encouraged

  alice linn are you she mocked
alice linn

  she checked herself and plucked at
the breast of the old woolen wrapper she
wore

   i came here to rescue jessie scho-
field-

   so you said

   that was why i called on mr pen-
nington he had a friend at headquar-
ters-

   what

  mrs moss gulped forth the word only
after several efforts


all-story weekly

   theyll come here- the girl sobbed

   you call in the police you you
cheap little street-walker do you sup-
pose the police dont know you viola
swan

   alice linn

  mrs moss lost all control of herself
she began to froth at the mouth-as a
puff-adder drools blackness she tore at
her dress as if she were short of breath
but her greatest hope of relief seemed to
be based on some adequate expression of
her rage and hatred

   you-youd try to queer me with the
police you you scum why they
ship a hundred girls like you to the island
every day you white-livered little street-
walker bellevues full of your breed
sos the morgue aye and the morgues
loo good for em to hell with you
viola swan thats where you ought to
go thats where fll send you-you
with your saucer eyes and your chalky
face think youre beautiful do you
listen to this

   i hope you die i hope you die right
here in this house i hope you die as
viola swan-with a curse on you and
go back to hell where you was spawned
with strangers there to look at you -
and glad to be rid of you-and not even
the dead-house to give you a box to
lie in

  dont - dont speak like that
gasped alice linn

  die die fumed mrs moss with
the air of a stricken witch  and ghosts
a tearin the heart out of you while youre
doin of it-

  the interchange was becoming more
or less inarticulate-mrs moss choking
and gurgling out her curses as she con-
tinued to shuffle backward clutching at
the withered folds of her throat jerking
at the soiled flabbiness of her unlovely
dress alice linn confronting her-alice
somehow white and radiant with the
spirit that seemed to be in possession of
her

  there was a blue pallor drifting into
the room from the window that opened

on-the air-shaft but the gas still flickered
in the dim chandelier suspended from the
ceiling it was a squalid stage for any
sort of a human drama yet on just such
a stage had viola swan first appeared
was destined soon to disappear

  under the chandelier like a pool of
pale and unwholesome blood the red cot-
ton tablecloth lay-an emblem of tragedy
it was on one side of this that mrs moss
snarled and cursed slopped backward
pulling at her dress on the other side
that girl possessed of a devil or a god

  in a movement which might have been
inspired by her torture the girls own
hands sought her breast

  they came up tense and slow but at
that instant there appeared in her eyes a
look of sheer revelation her hands had
come in contact with the knife which she
had hidden there forgotten slowly she
drew the knife out and looked at it

  almost any object devoid of material
beauty may assume an aspect of spiritual
grandeur when it becomes transmuted by
a great meaning-like the relic of a saint
the face of a thinker the hand of a
mother of men and it was like that now
with this knife the handle of it was
black the blade of it was short and
discolored

  but it was as beautiful to the girl who
held it as if in very truth it had been a
child of hers

  from it her dark eyes flashed up

  mrs moss had also seen the knife her
mouth was sputtering blasphemies but she
was hypnotized her voice was weak

   curse you viola swan curse you
curse you 

  as inarticulate as the rush of a sewer
but that was the burden of it all-even
now when mrs moss had seen the knife
she was undoubtedly smitten with fear
and tugging at her gown shuffled in
retreat

   oh cried alice linn with a look of
joan of arc about her  im going to kill
you-kill you

  it was soft and almost a sob and yet
there was a queer thrill of elation in it
the scarlet ghost



her voice rose it still wasnt loud just
tense and piercing

   it was for this that i came to new
york said alice linn  i came to kill
you--clean the earth of your presence
loci sent me he said  kill her shes
lived too long shes taken -my children
shes sullied them shes broken their
hearts shes poisoned their souls shes
sent them to prison-to the hospital -
to the morgue kill her kill her kill
her 

   youll go to the chair mrs moss
managed to say

   its viola swan that will die-die
with you alice linn answered

   youre forgetting rufus gasped
mrs moss

    hell understand hell understand
i offer myself as a sacrificial victim its
atonement its like the cross ill be
forgiven 

  mrs moss had backed into a corner
whence she could retreat no further even
had she possessed the strength to do so
she supported herself there she looked
as if she were stifling her mouth was
open her scanty hair was coming down
a little wisp of it kepi plucking at her
rusty shoulder-like a gray and yellow
finger bidding her to come away-to
some one who was waiting and impatient
-the some one being death

  theyll put you in a cell - this
from mrs moss

   father forgive her- this from
alice linn

   beat you till-

   pray- pray-

  -to hell

  suddenly mrs moss took a shambling
step it was while alice linn was still a
ood six feet away from her mrs moss
appeared to be calling for help only she
was like one in the grip of a nightmare-
straining straining unable to utter a
sound

  she was fumbling at her gown into
her face there came a look of awed sur-
prise those fishy eyes of hers which had
been fixed on the destroying angel there

     ii	a-s

in front of her appeared gradually yet
swiftly to lose their focus

   alice linn still at a distance cast down
her knife she would have sprung for-
ward caught the old woman she was
aware of it even then that god had
declared a truce and that the truce was
death for the woman whom she herself
would have slain

  but before alice could move mrs moss
collapsed

  she shook and drooped down-throw-
ing up her hands as she did so as if to
ward off another blow from the unknown
or somewhat as if she were appealing for
mercy

chapter xlyiii

 what god hath cleansed

she lay there huddled on the soiled
carpet face down by the time that
alice linn came creeping up to her

  for several seconds alice had the ap-
pearance of one who has just witnessed a
miracle and knows it to be a miracle
and is fearful to intervene but she
turned the limp and heavy figure over
on its back she did this not ungently
yet with an air of wonder as if still in
the presence of something that she
couldnt understand

  the old woman was still alive

  just as alice absorbed this truth into
her own barely stirring consciousness she
heard the thrill of the bell in mrs mosss
bedroom-the bell of the outer door

  who could it be

  then she became aware of a movement
in the hall there must have been an-
other miracle of a kind in the cellar of
the house for jo had bestirred himself
down there had come up to open the
door himself perhaps jo possessed
something of that second sight which
seems to go so often with minds other-
wise weak

  it was the chief from headquarters and
his policeman-secretary-the first of those


all-story weekly

whom the magnet was assembling here
they were still in the hall when some
one else arrived-the chiefs friend pen-
nington the friends shook hands the
secretary in civilian clothes saluted

  the chief turned to jo

   wheres the landlady he asked

   back there jo gasped and disap-
peared jo must have heard his em-
ployer fall

  the three men went to the back of
the hall the chief himself peered
through the glass panel of the door to
see what might be seen-in a professional
way-before making his presence known
he saw an old woman lying there saw
a girl kneeling at her side saw this girl
lift her face and her folded hands in an
ineffable gesture of prayer

  the chief and his secretary were both
more or less expert in the matter of first-
aid both inured to tragedy alice had
accepted their presence there mechan-
ically almost mechanically she had an-
swered the few questions the chief had
asked but neither he nor his secretary
appeared to need such information as she
could give them or to attach for that
matter much importance to what she
said

   its her heart said the chief  shes
had a heart-attack crock im afraid
that its all over with the old lady try
to dig up some ammonia or something
then get us a doctor

  presently mrs moss was showing signs
of reviving consciousness she put up her
nerveless hands began to pluck at the
sagging folds of her withered throat she
seemed to bring to this occupation a sort
of pleasant and childish curiosity-as if
she were touching something which she
did not recognize the presence of which
suiprised her

  alice linn remained there kneeling at
mrs mosss side looking down at mrs
moss with pity and wonder with a curious
exaltation it was a feeling which was
both a hope and a prayer a lamentation
and a song of thanksgiving

  mrs moss was dying yet also was
this the passing of viola swan

  the scarlet ghost was dead

  alice linn in the presence of this truth
a truth which came to her so it seemed
from the very fountainhead of truth was
incapable of either speech or action

  had she tried to speak she would have
sobbed xo words anyway could pos-
sibly have expressed what she had in her
heart had she sought to move she would
have fallen so instinct told her she felt
as if she were standing over a million-
foot ab s-amid interstellar space-on
a lonely pinnacle-nothing but infinite
heaven overhead

  mrs moss final opened her eyes
over the old woman there had come
some tremendous and indefinable change
she blinked up mildly for a while she
appeared to see nothing-nothin except
the insubstantialities of a waking day-
dream then she was aware of the girl
leaning over her she smiled it was a
pleasant smile but devoid of recognition

  for that matter alice linn was not
recognizing mrs moss

  where was all the sin and the
violence the treachery and ugly knowl-
edge gone absolutely gone where
were all the things which had been
graven and scribbled there year after
year since the old cremorne days as on
a monument visited by unholy tourists
equally gone

  mrs mosss face was cleansed her ex-
pression was bland what remained to her
of earthly attention was fixed on rufus
underwoods wife the room was deathly
silent mrs mosss voice fluttered out
soft but perfectly distinct

   whats your name little girl

   my name is-alice linn

  to any one familiar with all the cir-
cumstances the question and the answer
both would have appeared as a part of
some magical rite-white magic-a for-
mula of confirmation a mystical christen-
ing

  it was clear that letitia moss believed
she had never heard the name before


the scarlet ghost

perhaps she never had-this part of her
which still remained alive

   a pretty name she whispered  a
pretty name for a pretty little girl be a
good girl alice

   yes whispered alice

  mrs moss let herself go for an inter-
val in pleasant reveries

  i- youd better run home alice she
spoke again  or your folks will be get-
ting worried she smiled she reflected
 ive got to be going along myself she
whispered more softly than ever  good-
by be good be-

  into mrs mosss face there crept
swiftly a look of growing blindness
there followed this a flash of awe-

   shes dead said the chief

  as he said this there was a conviction
which reached to the very soul of alice
linn-or perhaps the conviction came out
of her soul-that it wasnt the voice of
the chief at all but the voice of her
maker

  all this was quaking through the inner
silences of her being when she heard from
the hall a burst of hysterical laughter
in a voice which she recognized as that
of jessie schofield a babble of speech
in which she likewise recognized the voice
of alec breen she looked about her

  at first glance the room seemed to be
filled with strangers-not all strangers
for she recognized pennington there
were a couple of women present both of
whom looked miserable one of these
women young and fairly beautiful was
clinging more or less to pennington the
other-her misery made hideous by a
combination of sin cosmetics and old
age- was talking to a stout young man
whom the former viola swan recognized
instinctively as belonging to the police

   you stay right here lilly the young
man ordered

   lilly spencer 

  the name had a familiar sound to ru-
fus underwoods wife-an echo from the
disappearing world in which the scarlet
ghost had lived



  the chief and his secretary aided to
some extent by pennington had removed
what was earthly of letitia moss to the
little bedroom and closed the door before
jessie schofield and alexander breen
followed by doc and the youth in the
gray shirt were admitted

   there she is now cried mrs spen-
cer  ask her-

  but jessie forthwith had seen alice
standing there rushed to her with her
arms out was received in alices arms

   rve had a perfectly gorgeous time
jessie sobbed  but-but-

  she flung her face against alices breast
and cried this time without restraint
careless of the strangers present

  altogether it was some time and there
was some confusion before things began
to straighten themselves out but lilly
spencer was strong for self-justification
she managed to get herself face lo face
with jessie schofield here in the presence
of all these witnesses

   i ask you she thrilled  if  done
you any wrong or if any one done you
any wrong while you was with me
xone jessie answered abashed
you were lovely

  and jessie even tried to back this up
by giving mrs spencer the kiss peni-
tential but the policeman-secretary in-
terfered

   that setlles it so far as she is con-
cerned said the secretary but you
move none the less-to-day and the
further the better

  mrs spencer had a spasm of tears she
was beaten

  alec breen had also made a movement
to interfere as jessie started to demon-
strate just how lovely she considered mrs
spencer to lie he actually put his arm
about jessies waist

   hold on he counseled

   what are you going to do with her
mrs underwood demanded softly with a
recurrence of heat

   jessie and i are going to wed alec
announced with a flash of effrontery

  he turned to doc and the vouth with


all-story weekly

the gray shirt his voice was a sob a
sob of relief the confirmation of a con-
viction which he had been nursing all
along he had suspected that jessie had
let her imagination get the better of her

   shes as pure as the driven snow he
announced

  and he also began to cry jessie con-
soling him

  the lady named julia turned to pen-
nington she was moved she was con-
trite

   youre better than i thought you
were she whispered  and i am worse
forgive me you and i have looked on
life and death together now  love you
lets get out of here

  but before any one could move there
as a fresh movement in the hall a sug-
gestion of clamor the magnet was draw-
ing in the last of its mortal iron

  beck penningtons chauffeur threw
open the door looked in he turned

   come in he called

  he turned to pennington still with the
accumulated excitement of high speed
upon him

    ive got him here sir he cried with
a voice suppressed

  mrs lnderwood gave a little gasp
every muscle and fiber of her went dy-
namic even before she saw who the latest
arrival was

  then he was standing there-upright a
flare of blue light flashing from his eyes
eyes that went straight to those of the
woman god had given him

  rufus rufus

chapter xlix
day

they were alone there for a while
the others went away-out into
the hall there to wait for them

  there was speech between them but
such speech as no words can ever for-
mulate-speech needing no words-the
speech of perfect comprehension of that
perfect love it is occasionally given mor-

tals to know thus keeping alive the legend
of heaven and the angels

  the words crept in only gradually-
like the living things at the creation of
the world and for rufus and alice the
world was new-created

   the folks at rising sun-will be glad
to know-that everythings all right
said rufus

   uncle joel will understand alice
murmured

  yes rufus answered slowly and
so will aunt allie and andy jones and
the preacher and every one mrs jenvey
will want to go down on her knees to you
for what youve done-

   nothing-

   nothing-except to make the world
better-and more beautiful said rufus
with that inevitable touch of the seer and
the poet about him

   out in the hall there was a gradual dis-
association of the human elements brought
to mrs mosss house-as if now that the
chief dweller in the place was dead-the
magnet had lost its virtue

  pennington and julia went away with
beck after much hand-shaking and re-
peated farewells so went the chief from
headquarters and his secretary leaving
a policeman in charge of the premises
against the coming of the coroner soli-
tary was the flitting of mrs lilly spencer
-as one who flees in darkness in deeper
darkness still her only respite from the
fate which she must have known was over-
taking her

  jo the cellar-man crept up to speak
to mrs underwood

   so the old ladys dead he whispered
fie was moon-eyed overcome with awe
 so the old ladys dead say do you
know of any one who needs a cellar-man
ive held this place for twenty years

  they would have offered him a place
in the country but alec breen broke in
alec was himself again-the future sand-
wich-king

   we want a dish-washer jo he said
 how about it
john pyle rampant



  jo went foolishly glad here was a
chance of a lifetime for him

   hell get all that he wants to eat
too wont he alec jessie exclaimed
with her hand on alecs arm

  it was clearly to be seen that jessie
was reaching out to a fresh apogee of
romance-a romantic marriage this time
with no telling what horizons beyond
she would make a proper wife for a sand-
wich-king-the wife of one who would
barter for concessions at coney island at
state fairs wherever the world was in
picnic mood and she looked as if she
might well become the mother of many
children as well to that end nature
had designed her however unaware of the
fact she might have been

  a great day for the race alec ex-

claimed peering out at the sunshine of
the young morning

   what race asked rufus

   the human race cackled alec
speaking a deeper truth than was his
wont

   what shall we do whispered alice
smiling up at rufus

    first said rufus  well see these
two people made one they belong to
each other itll give us something to
tell the folks in rising sun about what
happened down here then you and i-
to the old home they were out on the
sill of the house of death rufus
thrilled

   look at the sky-our sky-up there 
 see it alice answered  i see it
reflected in your eyes

the end

john pyle opened his eyes blinked
ran his fingers through his tousled
gray hair and promptly sat up in
bed fie never had very much trouble
about waking up for the husk mattress
on his canvas cot was not conducive to
sleep after the actual demands of nature
had been satisfied

it was not yet light in the cubbv-hole
at the head of the stairs where the cot

williani

merrieon

rouse

stood under a canopy of dried apples
festooned from the ceiling but john knew
by the degree of grayness pervading his
sleeping quarters that it wras broad day
outside

  he swung his feet to the floor and by
a series of quick expert movements ex-
changed his torn nightshirt for a suit of
underwear that had long been buttonless
then lacing up a pair of heavy brogans


all-story weekly

over gray cotton socks drew on a blue
gingham shirt and adjusted a pair of
overalls by a single suspender

  in less than a minute after he had
opened his eyes john was tiptoeing down-
stairs half-way to the lower floor a
board squeaked he stopped and held
himself rigid as he listened there was
no sound through the house and with a
heartfelt sigh of relief he went on put-
ting each foot down with the utmost
caution

  the kitchen was flooded with sunlight
john went to the sink filled the wash-
basin from the water-pail and generously
soused his hands face and hair with
much grateful but subdued sputtering
he combed his hair still thick except on
top of his head with particular attention
and even tried to induce the ends of his
forlornly drooping gray mustache to take
on a slight curl

  it was the first day of september and
to-morrow barring death and accidents
lie would go to the plattsburg fair for
more than twenty years an annual trip
to the plattsburg fair had been john
pyles only holiday to him other days
had become more or less as stepping-
stones along the path of time that led
up to the second of september

  treading with marvelous lightness
john built a brisk fire in the cook-stove
and then went into the pantry butter-
milk a teaspoonful of baking-soda two
big pinches of salt and the right amount
of flour stirred in made pancake batter
he put the teapot on the stove and be-
gan to fry cakes old betsy the aged
and now useless house-cat came purring
out of a corner and rubbed against his
legs john let a cake burn as he stooped
tc- stroke her arching back

  nice kitty poor kitty he whis-
pered  want some milk

  betsy opened her mouth in a faint
mew of acquiescence john sighed and
shook his head as he turned some milk
from a pan betsy must be put out of
the way before long now that she could
not hunt he would have liked to keep

her and a dog too if things had been
different

  after he had eaten his breakfast of
pancakes and tea and betsy had polished
her saucer john washed the dishes and
climbed softly up-stairs he made his
bed folded his nightshirt neatly away
under the pillow and stepped to the door
of a room from whence came the irregu-
lar but unmistakable sounds of a man
sleeping on his back with his mouth open
he knocked gently

   hey ed time to get up

  the only reply was a snort and another
snore john knocked again louder

   aw-waff aw right  came from
within

  john went down-stairs walked through
the house and stopped in the door of a
spacious chamber that opened from the
parlor a woman whose black hair
showed only faint and occasional streaks
of gray lay sleeping in a broad and com-
fortable bed her face resting on a firm
white arm showed few marks of time
even in the relaxation of sleep

  seven oclock dethy

  detha pyles eyelids lifted and un-
veiled two big black orbs that snapped
threateningly even before she had com-
pletely torn herself from the embrace of
slumber

   fires made an kettles a-bilin
dethy 

  mrs john pyle was now thoroughly
awake she raised herself on an elbow
and pointed a stern finger at her hus-
band

   ye didnt ferget to set that mouse-
trap last night before ve went to bed
did ye

  john squirmed and shifted from one
foot to the other

   why-er-traps right out there in
the pantry dethy ve kin see it fer yer-
self

  he retreated abruptly but the voice of
his wife followed him across the parlor

   its a mighty good thing for ye that
ye did it would of been jest like ye to
forget all about it or to forget it on pur-
john pyle rampant



pose because ye know that if theys one
thing in the world  cant abide its a
mouse

  john tramped noisily through the
kitchen to the outside door turned quick-
ly and sped with catlike steps into the
pantry he took a wire mouse-trap of
the cage variety from a nail set it on
the floor in a conspicuous place and
hurried out of doors he threw back
his bent shoulders and drew in a great
breath of the crisp air

  pyles first step on the barn floor was
greeted by little good morning whinnies
from sam and slim his big bay team
he stopped to visit the stall of each horse
with a pat and a few words of general
praise before he went about the routine
of chores nearly everything had been
done when as john lifted a particularly
large forkful of hay the single button
that held up the back of his overalls flew
off with a pop

   thunderation  he exclaimed and
grabbed his departing garment in the nick
of time holding it up with one hand
he started for the house

  detha and ed cummins the pyle
hired man had just sat down to break-
fast coffee colored by rich cream
steamed in their cups a platter of fried
eggs flanked on one side by a big dish
of creamed potatoes and on the other by
an equally big dish of corned beef hash
stood in the center of the table there
were lesser appeals to the appetite in
the form of toast and muffins jolfn
gazed wistfully but resignedly as he said

   where kin i find a needle an thread
dethy just busted the last button off
my overalls

  a grin distended the well-fed chops of
ed cummins as he saw that pyles gar-
ments were uireatened with immediate
dissolution iiut detha did not grin
she turned on her husband a countenance
blazing with indignation

   done a fine job when ye set that
mouse-trap last night didnt ye ex-
pected to ketch mice without any cheese
i spose ill bet forty great apples ye

never set it at all last night but sneaked
out an put it down there on the floor
this mornin to fool me

  john decided that it would save argu-
ment to own up at once

    py gum dethy he said apologet-
ically  ye know jest as  was startin
to set the trap last night i heard a noise
in the barn an-

  mrs pvle snorted

   an ye done it jest like ye do every-
thing else ye miserable good-fer-nothin
old blockhead ye know jest as well as 
do that the mice have been runnin around
in the pantry fer a week an every time
i see one it gives me the creeps but i
spose if i want to get anythin done
around here ive got to do it myself
bimeby ill have to plough fer ye an do
yer mowin an put yer grain in the
barn whats the matter of ye anyway
are ye gettin simple-minded more sim-
ple-minded i mean

  john who had wriggled under his wifes
tongue-lashing until his overalls almost
dropped off at last managed to get in a
word

   honest to goodness dethy ill do it
to-night jest as sure as-

   jest as sure as yere a natural-born
fool get out of here

  he was glad enough to go even with
his costume in a state bordering on total
collapse

  it was mighty plain that detha was in
for one of her spells apparently brought
on by the mouse-trap incident john knew
that mice were his wifes pet aversion in
a collection of carefully nourished aver-
sions but it did seem that she was a
little more violent than the occasion war-
ranted

  his shoulders drooped as he wondered
apprehensively if there wasnt something
behind her wrath she had begun in the
same way when she was preparing to
make him sleep at the head of the stairs

  in the privacy of the barn john took
off his overalls and with the deftness born
of much practise inserted a shingle-nail
in such a manner that it served for the


all-story weekly

lost button he had already started milk-
ing when ed leisurely picking his teeth
appeared the philosophy that had served
john pyle through many domestic squalls
reasserted itself and he greeted his hired
man with a pleasant smile

   goin to have fair weather fer the
fair i guess he said cracking his an-
nual joke

   the weathers all right john re-
plied ed with a peculiar emphasis on
the word weather that stirred up a vague
uneasiness in his employers mind

  ed was a pretty good barometer for
detha when she was the most ram-
bunctious he was the most careless about
his work and john had read the signs of
more than one coming cataclysm in his
conduct sometimes cummins himself
came in for a share of the trouble but
he seldom got it very badly a farm-
hand would not stay where he was not
well treated and fed a husband had to

  john went through the mornings work
with a troubled spirit there was a faint
possibility that detha left to herself
would get over her spell but he knew
that a sight of him would be more than
likely to set her off again and he dreaded
the approach of dinner time

  the plattsburg fair offered a sort of
first aid to the situation for he would
be gone from the early train north to the
late train south and he thanked his lucky
stars that the annual holiday came at
such an opportune time letha would
have a chance to cool off

  dinner-time came with the swift ap-
proach that dreaded events take to them-
selves and john pyles very absorption
in the problem of how to avoid trouble
was the cause of his undoing remem-
bering a matter of business that needed
attention he absent-mindedly stepped to
the telephone a new acquisition by
detha and took down the receiver the
click of the instrument brought his wife
running out of the pantry a big iron
spoon in her hand

   get away from that telephone ye
nasty old codger she cried didnt

i tell ye that ye couldnt use the tele-
phone unless yed stop chewin tobacker
fer good an ail hey

  john dodged a blow from the spoon
and skipped nimbly to the other side
of the room

   now dethy- he began

   dont ye  now dethy  me she in-
terrupted  set down there an eat yer
dinner an then get out of here as quick
as ever ye can

  he obeyed but with a protest

   i want to telephone about drawin
some hay to westport- ye know fve got
tc figger out my work account of goin to
the fair to-morrer will ye telephone fer
me dethy

  no i wont she snapped  fair
huh fair i dont get no time to go
trapesin around to fairs

  john hastily filled his mouth with a
knifeload of boiled potato to prevent the
possibility of saying anything more in
case he should so far forget himself as
to want to make a remark the click of
knives and forks and the noises incident
to ed cumminss mastication were the
only sounds that broke the silence of
the dinner-table when ed kept still
like that it was a sure sign of the very
worst john knew that ed liked his easy
berth and that he realized not even the
necessity for keeping help would stay mrs
pyles tongue in one of her extra special
tempers all the signs pointed to a big
storm

  after dinner pyle walked to his near-
est neighbors to telephone about the hay
and then continued on two miles farther
to the railroad station it was his an-
nual custom to find out before the fair
whether the trains had changed time since
the year before they had not-they
never did-but it gave him a feeling of
satisfaction to reassure himself and it
was in an almost cheerful frame of mind
that he went back to his farm to find
that cummins had not done more than
fifteen minutes work in the interval since
dinner

  john fervently wished that he could
john pyle rampant



get over disliking his hired man for a
short time he knew that if he could
bring himself lo show the faintest sign of
affection for ed mrs pyle would dis-
charge that young man so quick it would
make his head swim

  when at the end of a busy day john
scraped his brogans at the back door and
went in to supper a single look at the
clouded face of bis wife overcast his
spirits she had never looked any more
thunderous or slammed dishes with great-
er vehemence knowing that he was
hanging on the brink of a domestic vol-
cano he held his peace through the mono-
syllabic conversation of mrs pyle and ed
until the meal came to an end then it
seemed a good time to make overtures

   dont ye want me to wash yer dishes
to-night dethy he asked

  dishes she hurled back at him
 if ye cant wash dishes any better than
ye kin set mouse-traps i dont want ye
monkeyin around in my kitchen an
theres another thing ive told ye to do
more than forty-eleven times-thats get
rid of that pesky old cat she dont earn
her salt between yew an the cat this
house  be overrun with mice-the dirty
things

   now dethy

   good land ye make me sick she
raved  cant ye say nothin but  now

belong an stay there

   all right dethy he agreed hastily
 if yell jest lay out my clean shirt an
sunday cloes so i kin have em to go to
the fair i wont bother ye no more an
ill set that mouse-trap sure as shootin
mrs pyle put down the stack of dishes
she was carrying faced her husband and
established her hands firmly on her hips
john involuntarily took a step backward
lie had time to notice that ed cummins
was grinning as he smoked in one corner
of the kitchen and his dislike for that
young man fairly curdled then the
storm broke

   john pyle his wife ripped out her
words  ye aint goin to the plattsburg

fair to-niorrer nor any other day ive
stood it for twenty years an i aint goin
to stand it no longer last jear ye went
an drank a glass of beer while ye was
gone-i smelt it on yer breath an ye was
brazen-faced enough to admit it yerself
the time is past when ye kin go gallivan-
tin off to the plattsburg fair while i stay
to home an work my lingers to the
bone

   now dethy aint i ast ye to go
along every year he argued

   if ye say  now dethy  to me agin
iil knock yer head off she picked up
the stove poker  i dont want to go to
yer miserable old fairs ive got business
to tend to home an thats where yere
goin to stay hereafter yer clean shirt

trunk an yer sunday cloes is in my
closet ye aint goin to get em neither
an whats more if ye dont set that
mouse-trap an kill that cat before ye go
to bed ill never cook another meal of
vitlies fer ye as long as i live put that
in yer pipe an smoke it

  john slunk out of the back door even
if he had not been too stunned to say
anything there would have been nothing
to say it was a relief to get out into the
open air and hide his chagrin and disap-
pointment under cover of the gathering
dusk

  old betsy appeared purring with her
tail aloft and her back arched he took
her up and went into the barn sam and
slim nickered the friendliness of the
animals was soothing for they could sym-
pathize if they did not understand he
sat down on an empty nail-keg with
betsy in his arms

  it seemed to john pyle that the bot-
tom had fallen out of everything and
that he had fallen with it into a dark
abyss from which there was no escape
his one day of freedom after three hun-
dred and sixty-four days of patient toler-
ance had meant everything to him th-t
one day of unrestrained action wh- v
shouldered through crowds and spent h s
money as he chose meant the reestablish-


all-story weekly

ment of his philosophical equilibrium for
another year of detha he needed it

  there was another cause of grievance
-old betsy he knew that if he did not
kill the cat his wife would and in a man-
ner highly objectionable to the cat he
and betsy were in much the same pre-
dicament except that betsy would meet
a reasonably swift end while he would
linger on to endure a daily tongue-lashing
and the disrespectful grins of a hired
man

  for the first time in the twenty years
that he had been married john pyle defi-
nitely distrusted the blessings of matri-
mony he shivered

  something was stirring deep in his soul
-the same sort of something that had
raged within him when he licked bull
whalen his rival for the hand of detha
more than a score of years had elapsed
since the memorable fight that had been
the talk of the township and in all that
time john pyle could not remember that
he had been angry

  of course for a long while there had
not been anything to get angry about
dethas black eyes had hashed with ad-
miration instead of wrath in those days
and for many months after their wedding
she had seemed even to stand slightly in
awe of him

  in some subtle way a change in their
relations came about little by little
detha usurped the powers that he good-
naturedly relinquished until there was a
time when with much scolding she told
him to make his sleeping-quarters in the
cubby-hole at the head of the stairs

  then came an order to get up and
make his own breakfast and not to touch
a morsel of the food that his wife might
have prepared for her own repast the
pyles had ceased to be man and wife-
they had become woman and husband
to-night for the first time john pyle
saw the situation in that light

  he shivered again and gripped old
betsy so hard that she gave a squawk of
outraged dignity and fled to the other
side of the barn he got up and kicked

the nail-keg on which he had been silting
betsy dashed into sams stall and the
horses snorted with excitement john
paid no attention to the animals

  he was mumbling over the words of an
old adage that emotion had dragged up
from the reservoir of his memory

 a dog a woman a hickory-tree-

the more you beat em the better they be

  suddenly the back door of the house
slammed and the irritatingly cheerful
whistle of ed cummins approached
through the gathering darkness john
slopped pacing to and iro and faced the
entrance as ed stepped into the barn
the young man was newly shaved and
dressed in his best he grinned com-
placently but awkwardly owing to a high
collar as he thrust his hands into his
pockets with a swagger

   mis pyle said i might go to the
plattsburg fair to-morrer so im goin
to start on the sleeper to-night he an-
nounced  want to send yer love to the
fair grounds john

   fair-yew-to-morrer stammered
john

   sure replied ed flippantly  an
mis pyle said fer ye to kill that cat to-
night an bury her so that she could see
the grave in the mornin an not to fer-
git to set the mouse-trap afore ye went to
bed

  so ed cummins could go to the fair
could he and john pyle could stay at
home and work it was the spark need-
ed to set off the magazine of pyles latent
wralh the accumulation of years blew
up with an interna convulsion that sent
red streaks shooting before his eyes and
a current of anger tingling to every nerve

  with a catlike leap he grabbed the
younger man by the throat and shook
him as old betsy would have shaken a
rat in her palmiest days he saw terror
chase amazement out of cumminss face
and was satisfied he gripped ed bv the
shoulders spun him around and lifted
him clear of the barn door with a care-
fully placed kick
john pyle rampant



   go on to the plattsburg fair called
john in a clear but restrained voice an
dont come back till yeve learnt how to
treat yer betters

  the rapidity with which mr cummins
was disappearing down the road made
further remark useless his recent em-
ployer readjusted the nail that held up
his overalls took a chew of tobacco and
glared at the back of the house appar-
ently no sound of the brief conflict had
reached his wife it was just as well
forewarned would have meant forearmed

  john spoke reassuringly to sam and
slim and then spent half an hour in
coaxing betsy down from the hay loft
where she had taken refuge during the
height of the excitement he stroked
her until her tail stood straight up

   poor old kitty nice kitty he said
 ye aint goin to be killed-not never
it had grown quite dark before pyle
chin up shoulders back and with a
strange new feeling of buoyancy in his
heart started for the house lights were
out and all was quiet he took the pre-
caution of removing his heavy brogans
before he went into the pantry

  smiling to himself he cut a titbit of
cheese baited the mouse-trap and then
made a trip down cellar when he came
up he had a can of dethas choicest cit-
ron preserves he ate what he wanted
left the can open in the pantry and
climbed up to bed with a springing step

  john pyle awoke while it was still night
at the head of the stairs and dressed
briskly in the dark cheerful sunlight
greeted him when he stepped into the
kitchen carrying his shoes in his hand
and he paused to dance noiselessly a few
steps of a long-forgotten jig before he
began the sputtering morning rites

  pyle parted his gray hair on one side
and plastered the longer ends into a little
curlicue he was surprised to see how
much younger it made him look one
rejuvenation suggested another and it
followed logically that he should take the
lamp shears and crop his drooping mus-
tache until it bristled smartly and ag-

gressively it was half an hour before he
finished his tonsorial labors and went into
the pantry

  four mice squeaked and tumbled over
each other in the cage so badly terror-
smitten that they had neglected to eat
all of the cheese pyle carried the trap
into the kitchen and smiled grimly as he
sat down to lace up his shoes looking
like anything but a man who could be
trilled with he picked up the trap and
clumped through the house he halted in
the door of his wifes chamber

  detha disturbed by the noise of his
approach muttered and flung out her
arms but she did not awake standing
erect and motionless john watched her
for a long moment before his voice rum-
bled forth

   wake up there

  mrs pyle sat bolt upright and her
eyes popped open she stared with un-
comprehending gaze

   get up- commanded john

  returning consciousness dawned in his
wifes eyes wrath followed hard be-
hind her lips drew to a straight line

   what dye mean john pyle talkin
to me like that there was an ominous
self-repression in her neglect of epithet

   get up

   ye good-fer-nothin imperdent dod-
derin old-

   stop

  mrs pyle stopped but not because she
was ordered to do so-she stopped out of
sheer amazement

   get up an give me my cloes an
what money they is in the house

   jest wait till  get out of bed john
pyle an ill learn ye how to talk to me

  she gathered herself to spring out of
bed john slowly and dramatically raised
the hand that held the mouse-trap he
walked toward the bed with measured
steps and held the four squeaking prison-
ers out toward his wife she recoiled

   see them mice he demanded

  mrs pyle looked from the trap to her
husbands face but she did not answer

   them mice is goin to get ye up he


all-story weekly

announced  an theyre goin to get me
my cloes an money an some breakfast
-a good breakfast too

  he moved the trap an inch nearer his
wifes nose

   take them nasty things right out of
here this minute she screamed

  john smiled and shook up his captives
they responded as one mouse mrs
pvle shrieked shut her eyes and struck
wildly at the trap

   ye miserable-

   one

  pyles finger moved slightly and a wig-
gling gray form dropped to the bed with
a piercing yell mrs pyle scrambled over
the footboard bounded across the room
and climbed onto a chair the mouse
equaliy terrified jumped to the floor and
stopped uncertainly looking from one to
the other of the human beings

  t skeedaddle barked john stamping
his foot the mouse started toward mrs
pyle and completely upset by her
screams bumped his head blindly against
a leg of the chair on which she danced a
hysterical jig

  take it away she pleaded oh
john take it away

  john permitting no sign of inward re-
lenting to show in his face shooed the
animal out of the room

   now he said ostentatiously swing-
ing his trapful of mice  get them cloes
an that money

  mrs pyle climbed down and with an
occasional sniffle dug into her closet and
trunk her husband pocketed the money
and laid the clothes over one arm

   i want some breakfast soon as ye get
dressed he remarked as he turned to go
out  an dont be too durned long about
it neither

  john hid his mice under the back steps
for possible further reference did the
chores and hurriedly changed his clothes
in the kitchen he had just finished
building a fire when detha came out

  she began to bustle from pantry to
kitchen almost cheerfully it seemed to
her husband and once he was astonished

to catch her looking at him with an un-
mistakable smile in her eyes he was
still pondering what revenge she might
have secretly in mind when she called
him to the best meal he had eaten since
the early days of their married life

  not a word was spoken until the end
of the meal then john settled back in
his chair with a sigh of such content as
his inner regions had not known for years

   that was an almighty good break-
fast dethy he said

  his wife actually blushed and looked
down at her plate

   im glad ye liked it john she re-
plied

  there was a moment of rather awk-
ward silence john got up and put on
his hat

   guess i better be gettin along to the
station

  suddenly he found himself looking into
dethys eyes she seemed to be nearer
to him without having moved

    i hope ye have a good time john i
like a man with some spunk

  the next instant dethy was in his
arms her head was on his shoulder and
he was patting her back with well-inten-
tioned thumps

  the clock had ticked many times when
there came a hesitating knock at the door
john and dethy sprang apart the round
face of ed cummins was pressed against
the screen

   have ye got over bein mad mr
pyle he asked humbly  cause if ye
have i thought mebbe id stay to home
anwork to-day stead of gointo the fair

   come in an get yer breakfast ed
well figger out the work to-night when
i get home from the fair  got to hurry
to ketch the train now

  as cummins entered john went out
dethy followed him to the steps and he
turned and smiled back at her a dozen
rods up the road he turned again dethy
still watching waved her hand john
swung his hat and started on

   dont women beat all he muttered
to himself

by tfve editor

one of the most puzzling jobs that ye editor knows is trying to figure out just
how much to tell you about a story in announcing it in this the heart to
heart talks on the one hand is the desire to catch and hold your in-
terest and attention and on the other the fear of telling you too much and therefore
taking the-er-wire edge off your appetite for it

    suppose for instance we were to tell you this is the story of a saint who
turned sinner-of an archbishop who became a yeggman youd want to read that
wouldnt you- and yet to tell you this might spoil for you the gradual working up
of a tremendous climax on the part of a master craftsman

    dont you see how difficult the problem is it might take the whole first in-
stalment of a serial that is destined to be a best-seller to reach such a point as this
yet did we not tell you this much your interest might not be attracted

    that is how the land lies with reference to the tremendous new serial that we
will offer you in six parts beginning next week-

the sin that was his

by frank l packard
author of the miracle man the beloved traitor etc

     as a matter of fact i have not told you its central idea in the foregoing though
i have hinted at it it is even more startling and far-reaching than this yet just
as i said to tell you what that situation is would be to tell you the whole first in-
stalment though it could never spoil what is by far the best thing mr packard has
ever written

    you have assuredly heard of  the miracle man if not either read the book
or seen the play when this masterpiece of mr packards was published in munseys
magazine three years ago george m cohan saw his opportunity and made of it one of
our greatest american plays  the miracle man  is filled with the deepest religious
meanings is perfection-but  the six that was his  is actually greater



do you remember the furor that was caused
a number of years ago by the publication
of george du mauriers wonderful story of the
latin quarter of paris- trilby  perhaps you
have read it perhaps seen the play which by
the way was revived only a season or two ago

  well trilby gives a striking and thor-
oughly convincing picture of the gay care-free
lawless life led by the art students their friends
and models in gay paris it is not what you can

call an immoral story it certainly deals with life
with a free brush and a full color call it un-
moral and you will be near the mark

  that is the paris that was-the paris before
the present great war

  no doubt you have formed a more or less
definite picture for yourself of what paris as a
whole is like since the war started but just
how has it affected the quartier latin-the
boul mich the boulevard mont-parnasse the




all-story weekly

gay and frivolous life of montmartre it is
hard to picture it isnt it

nevertheless the thing has been done and in
masterly fashion in

by j u giesy

next weeks complete novelette

   mimi  is the simple touching-and frank
little story of an artist and a grisette just before
the war and after it started like  those who
walk in darkness and  the scarlet ghost
though somewhat somber in coloring and un-
moral like trilby it has its lesson to teach-
and it is a great lesson

  the thoughtless young student learned that
 no man has ever lived until he has learned
how to die what lesson his sweetheart learned
i will leave for you to find out for yourself

 once ix a thousand years by-
samuel g camp goes to prove as the author
says that the exception is invariably the rule
when you want to demonstrate the rule that
exasperating perversity is not confined to in-
animate things that things always go contrari-
wise when you most want em not to but the
story is so delightfully told that it would be a
shame to tell you any of it at all

  mr camp has written some mighty good
stories for you in the past year and this one is
still better you want to keep your eye on this
young man

                                         

  what really is impossible of course you
couldnt jump head first out of a twentieth-
story window and expect to escape unhurt nor
dispute successfully the right-of-way of an ex-
press-train but how many other things are
there that positively cant be done

  perhaps fewer than youd think at all events
rufus sedgwick hero of  battle royal
by john d swain said so and had proved it
a number of times in fact rufus was pretty
nearly a hundred-per-cent efficient man and he
had an incessant craving for excitement that
law-abiding civilization couldnt satisfy so
when his friend the lawyer suggested another
impossible thing-

  maybe youll meet rufus again its a cinch
youll want to

ji	

 a salt-horse sailor by captain
dingle is another of that able writers stirring
little dramas of the sea it goes to prove that
-well sometimes you can teach old dogs new
tricks and sometimes the proverb holds good

joe briggs was a sailor of the old school-

a sail-or mind who had the utmost contempt for
such things as steam and modern breech-loading
rifles that  you shoots orf like a perishin pistol
unfortunately his skipper believed in efficiency
and up-to-dateness and-

its a fascinating yarn

well as the title of the story is sup-
plied by the correspondent

found the all-story via harvard

rlle following letter received at
this office recently encourages
us greatly there has long been a
popular impression that a magazine
carrying fiction only aiming to en-
tertain the great mass of readers was
without literary standards read the
opinion of a discriminating reader
and then subscribe at once

to the editor

    i wish to congratulate you upon the
 discovery of a new and most prom-
 ising author and that author upon a
 most remarkable story i refer to
  the enemy in his mouth by
 raymond ashley being a man of
 rather more than middle age of con-
 servative - perhaps old-fashioned -
 ideas and tastes i have always clung
 closely to the literary standards of
 my generation harpers century
 scribners atlantic the north
 american and one or two others were
 the only magazines i recognized the
 others-the  popular  magazine so
 called-i viewed with smiling supe-
 rior tolerance or with out-and-out con-
 tempt i believed them simply collec-
 tions of sensational or maudlin trash
 hastily and sloppily thrown together
 for the amusement of the undiscrim-
 inating uncultured masses that by
 any chance a piece of real literature
heart to heart talks



  could get into one of them did not
  occur to me until recently a friend in
  whose judgment i have always had
  great faith told me of this astonish-
  ing serial in the all-story week-
  ly frankly i had never heard of
  the magazine before and even with
  all my faith in my friend who by
  the way is connected with the de-
  partment of english literature at
  harvard i accepted it doubtfully
  it is really that doubt that is respon-
  sible for this letter for i feel that i
  owe you and your magazine an apol-
  ogy if you published but the one
  story-the enemy in his mouth
  -in the year you would have fully
  justtied the existence of your maga-
  zine it is a story every one should
  read and one i confidently prophesy
  will ultimately become a classic i
  will add a bit shamefacedly perhaps
  that my order has gone to my news-
  paperman and the all - story
  has been added permanently to my list
  of magazines

    just enough humor

to the editor

   attracted by the cover-dcsign of the issue
containing the first instalment of  the sea
demons i purchased and introduced into our
family of seven our first copy of the most en-
tertaining magazine in america the all-story
weekly

   it was with deep regret that our family and
doubtless the entire all-story family reached
the concluding chapters of  the god of the in-
vincibly strong arms knowing that we would
never meet vandeviater again however we
know achmed abdullah can and will turn out
something eoually as good

   it seems strange that there was so little en-
thusiasm shown over the sea demons true
it was very improbable in fact it was impossible
but in view of the fact that so many of us have
called for stories of this character and that mr
rousseau gave us just what had been demanded
for such a long time why should not more credit
be given this author i for one can give him
a good deal of credit for it surely requires strong

imagination and exceptional writing capability
to conceive and develop the plot running through
this story

  taking them as a whole every one of the
stories published in your weekly are interesting
interesting enough at least to hold the atten-
tion of the  knockers  to the last line surely
no one is required to read anything not worth
while according to their views

   there are two stories that ran as serials during
the  ear just closed that deserves special men-
tion they arc the brass check and too
much efficiency of the former everything
good has already been said at earlier dates
while of the latter enough praise can never be
extended the author of this unusual serial it is
not likely that that story will be surpassed by
any coming serial written along the lines most
capable of holding public interest-the ameri-
can fiousehold and through it all ran that
just enough humor over which rath has full
command

  awaiting impatiently the promised sequel to
 the brass check and wishing you every
success	r f kinder

to the editor 

  i have been a reader of your wonderful maga-
zine for some time starting with  tarzan of
the apes and although i am not a subscriber
i have never missed a single copy since fur-
thermore i read every word from cover to cover
and although some of your stories are not so
good as the others i have yet to come across a
really poor one

  i have just finished tarzan and the jewels
of opar and liked it immensely the only
trouble that i can find with the burroughs
stories is that they dont appear often enough
all of your authors as a whole arc good but
the best among them are burroughs harold
titus zane grey jackson gregory e k
means randall parrish stephen allen reynoids
frank condon and captain dingle

  i sometimes notice in the heart to hearts
letters knocking the all-story if t come across
a story that is not quite to my liking i just say
to mself well somebody might like this and
the other stories more than offset the poor one

  i like stories of the sea having spent con-
siderable time there myself the story  mid-
ocean by stephen allen reynolds makes me
feel homesick as i understand whaling some
of the best stories that you have published are
the tarzan tales sand to the victor on
a stallion shod with fire  contraband and
the yellow furlough i think the southern


all-story weekly

stories by e k means are fine i enjoy
many a good laugh from them  messing with
matrimony   think is the best  read

  keep up the good work you arc doing and 
for one will have my all-story as long as i
live when i get hold of my copy on thurs-
day there is no let up except to read till the whole
book is read i would like to see the day when
the all-story is a bi-weekly or better still a
daily feature

  i remain an all-story-kc forever

  living at the edge of the tropical jungle and
a subscriber to your always-welcome magazine
i do not doubt that you sent me the above
copy but as i did not receive it i guess that
nothing less than a u-boat captured it on its
way

  i sorrowfully missed the end of mr e j
raths too much efficiency in his castigat
ridendo mores way he is certainly right in mak-
ing fun of the said efficiency which begins to be
a two-hundred-per-cent curse in the good
u s a

  life is short why live it as a wooden sense-
less automaton instead of enjoying it the word
efficiency ought to be spelled k-u-l-t-u-r and
must have a lot of hyphens hidden somewhere
behind its letters

  give us again some good stories like  con-
traband and try to persuade mr burroughs to
go beyond mars with an imagination like his
 would not let his john carter miss a planet in
the whole solar system

thanks for a feast

to the editor

  i have never seen anything in the heart to
heart talks from keene and i think keene
should be heard from as i know there are a
number of all-story readers here because when
in a few instances i have been late in calling at
the bookstore for my favorite magazine i have
not been able to obtain it

  i am an old cavalier reader and have read
the all-story in cuba isle-of-pines and ber-
muda as well as our own united states and

when i pick up a number like the one of no-
vember  i feel that we all-story readers
ought to unite in thanking our editor for the
feast he has prepared for us of course there
have been stories that  havent liked but on
the whole i think it is the best brightest and
cleanest magazine i have ever read

  i am a cripple and spend most of my time
reading magazines and the all-story is the
one i wait for

  there is one thing more  would be in favor
of doing away with the short stories and having
one long story instead now who will boost
with me to bring this about

the all-story

  why dont you print more by fred jackson
i always liked his stories i know some of the
men kick about him but since we let some of
the stories that please them pass please put in
something that pleases the women

  i also like stories of the north and far west

stories are good only tastes differ
