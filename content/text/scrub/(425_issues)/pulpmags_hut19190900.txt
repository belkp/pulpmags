executor and trustee duties undertaken
a minute lesson in personal efficiency

to help you discover the biggest ambition of ycur life and how to achieve it quickly

by edward earle purinton the famous efficiency expert

recently i talked with the man who
draws the highest salary in the world

 asked him how he had succeeded

he answered quietly i have not succeeded
no real man ever succeeds there is always
another goal ahead

  although this man has outrun every rival he
has not reached the goal of his own satisfaction
-any more than you have but he is efficient
are you efficient  efficiency will save you
many years of grinding discouraging and
expensive haphazard experience

  is it not much belter to learn and profit by
the mistakes and false moves of others than
to waste valuable days and years waiting for
experience dont rely on the hope of doing
better next time with the proper know-
ledge you will save mistakes

  it has been my privilege to act as teacher
and counsellor to thousands of ambitious inen
and women-from the heads of large companies
to the most humble beginner in the ranks

  and i have concluded that the average man
engaged in a large enterprise who has not
yet applied efficiency methods to his work has
been losing from  to cxx a year-
while the professional or industrial worker has
probably been losing from  to  a year

  for twenty years i have been studying at
close range the exact reasons for these peoples
failure to get ahead and into my new
practical course in personal efficiency i have
put in compact form the results of this study
of individuals and business concerns

 the seven lessons

give you the essence of efficient living and
business achievement they teach you in a
few pleasant evenings of study
mow to measure your efficiency

  how to cet ahead

  how to keep well

  how to improve your finances

  how to organise your work
  blow to be efficient at home-
  how to plan your life

  by showing you in my lessons what other
men and women - just like yourself - have
learned and done and been i believe sincerely
that i can save you about ten years of costly
experiment and moreover can show you how
to use your strength energy and special
abilities in a way which will certainly bhng
you success

  efficiency is nothing less than the difference
between wealth and poverty fame and ob-
scurity power and weakness health and
disease growth and death hope and despair
the step from one of these extremes to the
other i a short and easy one-if you know
how

 take one of my pupils whom i shall call

m

mr x because if i ever met an unne
quantity he was one when he first can
to me	 

he has increased by about  per cen
his daily output of work his optimism 
will power his health reserve and his nnauc
resources

how did he do it

first he analysed himself have you 
done this-thoroughly  if not try doing
now	

 can tell you i never saw such a cmw
in a man		i

he changed his habits of living and ncret
his daily output of energy about  per ccefi
he stopped being a pessimist and grun 
and became the most cheerful man n re
whole organisation having grown tjsl
friendly he attracted a host of new fne 
he prospered he advanced he bec
a leader he developed courage	

but remember this mr x was no- 
exceptional man by any means he 
lust average to begin with when i firs  
him he was making  a week
is probably without a rival in his chosen
-and his name if known throughou 
business world you can do the s
better	k

neurasthenia

the twentieth century disease
nature s own cure

   medicines and drugs diet treatments exercise and rest
 cures have alike proved incapable of or only partially and
 temporarily successful in overcoming this condition small
 wonder then that the neurasthenic despairs of a cure-regards
 himself or herself as incurable

   neurasthenia arises from lack of nerve force the only
 method of restoring lost nerve force i to recharge the system
 with electricity the natural force secreted in the air we
 breathe and which in itself is scarcely distinguishable from
 nerve force for years the difficulty of the scientist and the
 physician has been to find a means at once cheap convenient
 and comfortable to the jiaiient of employing this treat vitalis-
 ing natural force until the pulvermcher electrologcal
 treatment overcame these objections electrical treatment

the him of drug-taking

for nerve strain

  every nerve sufferer will be vitally interested in a product which i
  taking the place of ordinary nerve tonics medicines and stimulants-

 when health breaks down beneath the strain of war
 anxiety or overwork then conies the problem of  lost
 nerve power and when the sure signs of nerve ex-
 haustion such as sleeplessness depression loss of
 energy brain fag general debility etc manifest
 themselves the popular tendency is to fly to some drug
 or so-called  tonic or stimulant to do so is not
 only futile but is often very harmful for
 in this connection the nervous system
 requires nourishment and strength
 not stimulation a little r- flection will
 convince the reader of the loc aid
 common sense of this statement

   the primary trouble in all phases
 of nerve exhaustion is starvation or
 semi-starvation of the nerve cells the
 reason being that the sufferer fails to
 extract from his daily food the preciou
 concentrated nutrient the nerve cells
 live and thrive upon no medicine
 or tonic or stimulant can replace this
 lost nutritive substance but by taking
 such false remedies the nerve sufferer
 sometimes feels a temporally improve-
 ment or exhilaration which in due course passes away
 leaving him worse than before

   the main guiding principle of the modern preserva-

p had been a hot day at the law
courts but a faint breeze had sprung
up with the later hours blowing
 over the river it caught the
of the blind by which field sat
tapped it against the window-frame
fifst gently like a child at play then
gathering force and insistence till
 last he looked up with a frown and
y to fasten it back

   was growing late the rose of the
trlow lay upon the water tipping
silvery ripples with soft colour it
t h mac nkt- but the wonder of
- d not apparency reach him a
f h	wtli papers stood in front

j  bearing a portable electric lamp
j obviously too engrossed to think
terior things

 rt a space he sat again in silence by
 n window only the faint rustling
curtain being audible his
at hard clean-shaven face was

bent over his work with rigid
tion his eyelids scarcely stirred

then again there came a tapping
this time at the door the frown re-
turned to his face he looked up

 well  

the door opened a small sharp-
faced boy poked in his head  a lady
to see you sir

 what   said field his frown
deepened  i cant see any one 
told you so

 says she wont go away till shes
seen you sir returned the boy glibly
 cant get her to budge sir

 oh tell her- said field and

stoppedasif arrestedbya sudden thought
 tio is it   he asked

a grin so brief that it might have been
a mere twitch of the features passed over
the boys face

 wouldnt give no name sir but
shes a nob of some sort he said got
a shiny satin dress on under her doak 
fields eyes went for a moment to ins

littered papers then lie picked up a
newspaper from a chair and threw it
over them

   show her in   he said briefly

  he got up with the words and stood
with his back to the window watching
the half-open door

  there came a slight rustle in the pas-
sage outside the small boy reappeared
and threw the door wide with a flourish
a woman in a dark cloak and hat with
a thick veil over her face entered

  the door closed behind her field
stood motionless she advanced with
slight hesitation

   i hope you will forgive me she said
 for intruding upon you

  her voice was rich and deep it held
a throb of nervousness field came
deliberately forward

   i presume i can be of use to you
he said

  his tone was dry there was scant
encouragement about him as he drew
forward a chair

  she hesitated momentarily before ac-
cepting it but finally sat down with a
gesture that seemed to indicate physical
weakness of some sort

   yes i want your help she said

  field said nothing his face was the
face of the trained man of law it ex-
pressed naught beyond a steady im-
personal attention

  he drew up another chair and seated
himself facing her

  she looked at him through her veil
for several seconds in silence finally
with manifest effort she spoke

  it was so good of you to admit me
-especially not knowing who i was
you recognise me now of course i
am lady violet calcott

   i should recognise you more easily
he said in his emotionless voice  if you
would be good enough to put up your
veil

  his tone was perfectly quiet and cour-

tion

no he said finally

it 

 no

entirely a matter of principle-  
are aware i have achieved a c

teous yet she made a rapid movement
to comply as if he had definitely require
it of her she threw back the obscuring
veil and showed him the face of one ot
the most beautiful women in london

   here was an instants pause befo
he said

   yes i recognise you of course-
and-you wanted to consult me  

   no   she leaned forward in jc
chair with white hands clasped  
wanted to beg of you to tell rnc-
you have refused to undertake burleig
wentworths defence  

  she spoke with a breathless intensity
her wonderful eyes were lifted to his
eyes that had dazzled half london

field only looked down into them as h
might have regarded one of his leg
documents a slight peculiar s i
just touched his lips as he made reply-
 i have no objection to telling 
lady violet he is guilty that
why

   ah i  it was a sound like t

ct

snapped string of an instrument 
fingers gripped each other so 
think that too indeed-indeed y
are wrong but-is that your
reason  	

   isnt it a sufficient one   he
her fingers writhed and slrat
against each other  do you mean
it is-against your principles 
said	

  to defend a guilty man 
tioned the barrister slowly	if

 she nodded two or three times
for the moment utterance were bey
her	ur

  fields eyes had not stirred frn 
face yet still they had that legal
if he searched for some hidden inf

reputation and i value it-


ethel m dell

  she made a quick movement that was
       convulsive

    but you would not injure your re-
 putation you would only enhance it
 she said speaking very rapidly as if some
 httruction to speech had very suddenly
 been removed  you are practically
 the top of the wave you would
 bcceed where another man would fail
 and indeed-oh indeed he is innocent

 he must be innocent  things look
 black against him but he can be saved
 nehow and you could save him-if
 u would think what the awful dis-
 grace would mean to him-if he were
 evicted  and he doesnt deserve it

  assure you he doesnt deserve it ah
 bow shall i persuade you of that  
 her voice quivered upon a note of de-
 pair  surely you are human  there
 just be some means of moving you
 vou cant want to see an innocent man
  under  

the beautiful eyes were blurred with
jtars as she looked at him she caught
ek a piteous sob the cloak had fallen
about her shoulders they gleamed
an exquisite whiteness

   the mans look still rested upon her
 th unflickering directness again that
 peculiar smile hovered about his grim

 nath

yes i am human he said after a
nse  i do not esteem myself as
temptation as you probably
yw i am a self-made man of very
bbbary extraction but-i do not feel
pted to lake upburleigh wentworths
i am sorry if that fact should
you any disappointment i do
why it should there are plenty
 pwher men-abler than i am-who
rtiy  a sure be charmed to oblige
violet calcott or any of her
uds

vbat is not so she broke in rapidly

  u know that is not so you know
 i  your genius has placed you in what



 is really a unique position your name
 in itself is almost a mascot you know
 quite well that you carry all before you
 with your eloquence i f-if you couldnt
 get him acquitted you could get him
 lenient treatment you could save his
 life from utter ruin

 she clasped and unclasped her hands
 in nervous excitement her face was
 piteous in its strain and pathos

 and still field looked unmoved upon
 her distress

  i am afraid i cant help you he
 said  my eloquence would need a
 very strong incentive in such a case as
 this to balance my lack of sympathy

  what do you mean by-incentive  
 she said her voice very low   will
 do anything-anything in my power-
 to induce you to change your mind i
 never lost hope until-i heard you had
 refused to defend him surely-surely
 -there is some means of persuading you
 left  

 for the first time his smile was openly
 cynical

  dont offer me money please   he
 said

 she flushed vividly hotly

  mr field  i shouldnt dream of it

  no   he said  but it was more
 than a dream with you when you first
 entered this room

 she dropped her eyes from his

  i-didnt-realise- she said in

 confusion

 he bent forward slightly it was an
 attitude well known at the law courts

  didnt realise- he repeated in his

 quiet insistent fashion

 she met his look again-against her
 will

  i didnt realise what sort of man i
 had to deal with she said

  ah   said field  and now  m

 she shrank a little there was some-
 thing intolerably keen in his calm utter-
 ance
 hutchinsons story magazine

    i didnt do it she said rather
breathlessly  please remember that 

    i do he said

  but yet his look racked her she
threw out her hands with a sudden des-
perate gesture and rose

    oh are you quite without feeling 
wliat can i appeal to  docs position
mean a great deal to you  if so my
brother is very influential and i have
influential friends i will do anything-
anything in nay power tell me what
-incentive you want  

   field rose also they stood face to
face-the self-made man and the girl
who could trace her descent from a nor-
man baron he was broad-built grim
determined she was slender pale and
proud

   for a moment he did not speak then
as her eyes questioned him he
turned suddenly to a mirror over
the mantelpiece behind him and
showed her herself in her unveiled
beauty

   lady violet he said and
his speech had a steely cutting
quality  you came into this room
to bribe me lo defend a man whom
i believe to be a criminal from the
consequences of his crime and
when you found i was not to be so
easily bought as you imagined you
asked me if i were human i re-
plied to you that i was human
and not above temptation since
then you have been trying-very
hard-to find a means to tempt
me but-so far-you have over-
looked the most obvious means of
all you have told me twice over
that you will do anything in your
power do you mean-literally-
that  

   he was addressing the face in
the glass and still his look was
almost brutally emotionless it
seemed to measure to appraise

 she met it for a few seconds and then
 in spite of herself she flinched

  will you tell me what you mean 
 she said in a very low voice

 he turned round to her again

  why did you come here yourself
 he said  and at night  

 she was trembling

  i had to come myself-as soon as
 knew i hoped to persuade you

  you thought he said mercilessly-
  that however i might treat others
 could never resist you

  i hoped-to persuade you she saj
 again

  by-tempting-me   he sa
 slowly

 she gave a great start

 i said before i am not above tempta-
 tion-being human you take a very
 personal interest in burleigh wentworth
  think  

 she met his look with quivering eyelids
  yes she said

  are you engaged to him  

 sued

 she winced in spite of herself

no

 he raised his brows

 you have refused him
then  

 her face was burning

  he hasnt proposed to me-
    she said  perhaps he

 never will

  i see his manner was re-
 mtless his hold compelling

 	will defend burleigh went-
 nh he said  upon one
 edition

  what is that   she whis-

 ercival field with his steady
 upon her face

 she was trembling from head

 	you-you-have never seen

 yes i have seen you he
  several times i have

 for a very long while i
 vt-n t had the time to seek you out
 jf nis to have been decreed that you
 puld do that part

 there cynicism in his voice  
 bped so yet his eyes never left her

 held her by some electric attrac-
 epvhich she was powerless to break
 looked at fcim white to the lips

said  surely you have had ample
opportunity to learn them  

 a tinge of colour crcpt beneath her
 pallor

  no one ever proposed to me-like
 this before she said

 his hand was still upon her arm it
 closed with a slow remorseless pressure
 as he made quiet reply to her previous
 question

  yes i am in earnest

 she flinched at last from the gaze of
 those merciless eyes
hutchinsons story magazine

    you ask the impossible she said

    then it is all the simpler for you to
 refuse he rejoined

  her eyes were upon the hand that
 held her did he know that its grasp
 had almost become a grip  it was by
 that and that alone that she was made
 aware of something human-or was it
 something bestial-behind that legal
 mask 

   suddenly she straightened herself and
 faced him it cost her all the strength
 she had

    mr field she said and though her
 voice shook she spoke with resolution
 if i were to consent to this-extra-
 ordinary suggestion  if i married you-
 you would not ask-or expect-more
 than that  

  if you consent to marry me he
 said  it will be without conditions

    then i cannot consent she said

  please let me go  

   he released her instantly and turn-
 ing picked up her cloak

  but she moved away to the window
 and stood there with her back to him
 gazing down upon the quiet river its
 pearly stillness was like a dream the
 rush and roar of londons many wheels
 had died to a monotone

   the man waited behind her in silence
 she had released the blind-cord and was
 plucking at it mechanically with fingers
 that trembled

   suddenly the blast of a siren from a
 vessel in mid-stream shattered the still-
 ness the girl at the window quivered
 from head to foot ar if it had pierced her
 and then with a sharp movement she
 turned

 mr field   she said and stopped
he waited with absolute composure
she made a small but desperate ges-
ture-the gesture of a creature trapped
and helpless

    i-will do it   she said in a voice
 that was barely audible but if- if

 you ever come-to repent-dont blame

  me  

   i shall not repent he said

 she passed on rapidly

  and-you will do your best-to
 save-burleigh wentworth  

   i will save him said field

 she paused a moment  then moved
 towards him as if compelled against he
 will

 he put the cloak around her shoul-
 ders and then as she fumbled with i
 uncertainly he fastened it himself

  your veil   he said

 she made a blind movement
 self-control was nearly gone with do-
 solute steadiness he drew it down over
 her face

  h ave you a conveyance waiting 
 he asked

  yes she whispered

 he turned to the door he was 
 the act of opening it when she stayed him-
  one moment   she said

 he stopped at once standing
 her with his level eyes looking straig
 at her

 she spoke hurriedly behind her veu-
  promise me you will never-
 let him know-of this  

 he made a grave bow his eye
 changeably upon her

 certainly he said

 she made an involuntary
 her hands clenched she stood as
 were about to make some further apptl
 but he opened the door and held l
 her and such was the finality 
 action that she was obliged to

out-	-m-

  he followed her into the lift and 
  her down in unbroken silence	

 a taxi awaited her he escorted n
 to it

      good night   he said then

    she hesitated an instant lhenj
    out speaking she gave him h 
    for a moment his fingers grasp


ethel m dell

  	you may depend upon me he said
she slipped free from his hold thank
yu she said her voice very low

   a few seconds later field sat again at
 table by tne window the wind was
 poing in from the river in rising gusts

eblind-tassel tapped and tapped now
cre now there like a trapped creature
king frantically for escape for a
fpacc- he sat quite motionless gazing
fore him as though unaware of his
 rroundings then very suddenly but
y quietly he reached out and caught
swaying thing a moment he held
then pulled it to him and taking a
knife from the table grimly deliber-
teiy he severed the cord

he tassel lay in his hand a silken
slightly frayed as if convulsive
iers had torn it he sat for a while
looked at it then with that
range smile of his he laid it away in a

calcott had surprised no one
jw ctilvcrliigh her brother was known
r bis intimate friend and the rumour
come already to be regarded as an
pushed fact when like a thunder-

bolt had come wentworths arraign-
ment for forgery

  it had set all london talking the
evidence against him was far-reaching
and overwhelming after the first shock
no one believed him innocent the re-
sult of the trial was looked upon before
its commencement as a foregone con-
clusion until it became known that per-
cival field the rising man of theday
had undertaken his defence and then
like the swing of a weather-cock public
opinion veered if field defended him
there must be some very strong point in
his favour men argued field was not
the sort to touch anything of a doubtful
nature

 the trial lasted for nearly a week
during that time lady violet went day
after day to the court and sat with her
veil down all through the burning hours
people looked at her curiously question-
ing if there really had been any definite
understanding between the two did
she really care for the man or was it
mere curiosity that drew her  no one
knew with any certainty she wrapped
herself in her reserve like an all-envelop-
ing garment and even those who re-
garded themselves as her nearest friends
knew naught of what she carried in her
soul

  all through the trial she sat in utter
immobility sphinx-like unapproach-
able yet listening with tense attention
to all that passed fields handling of
the case was a marvel of legal ingenuity
there were many who were attracted
to tiie trial by that alone he had made
his mark and whatever he said carried
weight when he came at last to make
his speech for the defence men and
women listened with bated breath it
was one of the greatest speeches that
the criminal court had ever heard

  he flung into it the whole weight of
his personality he grappled like a
giant with the rooted obstacles that


 hutchinsons story magazine

 strewed his path flinging them hither
 and thither by sheer force of will his
 scorching eloquence blasted every op-
 posing power consumed every tangle of
 adverse evidence it was as if he fought
 a pitched battle for himself alone he
 wrestled for the mastery rather than
 appealed for sympathy

   and he won his cause his scathing
 attacks his magnetism his ruthless in-
 sistence left an indelible mark upon the
 minds of the jury-such a mark as no
 subsequent comments from the judge
 could efface or even moderate the ver-
 dict returned was unanimous in spite of
 a by no means favourable summing-up
 the prisoner was not guilty

   at the pronouncement of the verdiot
 there went up a shout of applause such
 as that court had seldom heard the
 prisoner rather white but still affecting
 sublime self-assurance accepted
 it with a smile as a tribute to
 himself but it was not really
 directed towards him it was
 for the man who had defended
 him the man who sat at the
 table below the dock and turned
 over a sheaf of papers with a
 faint cynical smile at thecorners
 of his thin lips this man they
 said had done the impossible

 he had dragged the prisoner out
 of his morass by sheer titanic
 effort obviously pcrcival field
 had believed firmly in the inno-
 cence of the man he had defended
 or he had not thus triumphantly
 vindicated him

  the crowd staring at him
wondered how the victory affected
him it had certainly enhanced
his reputation it had drawn
from him such a display of genius
as had amazed even his colleagues

 did he feel elated at all over his
 success  was he spent by that
 stupendous effort no one knew

 now that it was over he look
utterly indifferent he had fought afljj
conquered but it seemed already as 
his attention were turning elsewhere

  the crowd began to stream out tb
day was hot and the crush had bee
very great on one of the benches occj
pied by the public a woman had fainted
they carried her out into the corridor
and there gradually she revived a
little later she went home alone in a
taxi with her veil closely drawn do
over her face

  the season was drawing to a do
  when the announce

of lady violet calcotts

  he took hex hand and looked at it hi   upo
cool and strong he slipped the ring up and
her finger testing it it wa as if he waited or 
thing she endured his action for a few coa
with a deliberate movement she took her bjnd a


engagement to percival field took the
orld by storm

  it very greatly astonished burleigh
wentworth who after his acquittal had
gifted down to cowes for rest and re-
freshment before the advent of the crowd
e had not seen lady violet before his
pparture she having gone out of town
r a few days immediately after the
but he took the very next train
to london as soon as he had seen
announcement to find her

it was late in the evening when he
jjved but this fact did not daunt him

   had always been accustomed to liav-
j his own way and he had a rooted
hef which the result of his trial had
 tended to lessen in his own lucky
he had dined on the train and he
ely waited to change before he went
traight to lord culverleighs house

he found there was a dinner-party in
prress lady culverleigh violets
jtr-in-law was an indefatigable hos-
she had the reputation for being
of the hardest-working women in
wcst end

ffhe notes of a song reached went-
pth as he went towards the drawing-
t lady violet was singing her
was rich and low he stood out-

h

the half-open door to listen

did not know that he was visible

  hy one inside the room but a man
 hig

near the door became suddenly
j  of his presence and got up before
 ong was ended wentworth in the
 of stepping back to let him pass
ppd short abruptly it was percival

jj-y faced each other for a second or
silence then fields hand cme
forth and grasped the other mans
ter turning him about
ftjould likea word with you he said
ly descended the stairs together
jsh wentworth leading the way

ui the vestibule they faced each

ethel m dell

other again there was antagonism in
the atmosphere though it was not visible
upon either mans countenance and each
ignored it as it were instinctively

  hullo   said wentworth and
offered his hand im pleased to meet
you here

  field took the hand after a scarcely
perceptible pause his smile was openly
cynical

   very kind of you he said  i am
somewhat out of my element i admit
we are celebrating our engagement

  he looked full at wentworth as he
said it with that direct unflickerfng gaze
of his

 wentworth did not meet the look
quite so fully but he faced the situation
without a sign of discomfiture

   you are engaged to lady violet  
he said  i saw the announcement i
congratulate you

  thanks said field

   rather sudden isnt it  said
wentworth with a curious glance

  fields smile still lingered

   oh not really we have kept it to
ourselves thats all the wedding is
fixed for the week after next-for the
convenience of lady culverleigh who
wants to get out of town

   by jove  it is quick work   said
wentworth

  there were beads of perspiration on
his forehead but the night was warm
he held himself erect as one defying
fate so had he held himself through-
out his trial field recognised the atti-
tude

  the song upstairs had ended they
heard the buzz of appreciation that suc-
ceeded it field turned with the air of a
man who had said his say

   i dont believe in long engagements
myself he said  they must be a
weariness to the flesh

  he began to mount the stairs again
and wentworth followed him in silence


 hutchinsons story magazine

  at the drawing-room door field paused
and they entered together it was al-
most wentworths first appearance since
his trial there was a moment or two
of dead silence as he sauntered forward
with field then with a little laugh
to cover an instants embarrassment
lady culverleigh came forward she
shook hands with wentworth and asked
where he had been in retreat

  violet came forward from the piano
very pale but quite composed and
shook hands also several people pre-
sent followed suit and soon there was a
little crowd gathered round him and
burleigh wentworth was again the
popular centre of attraction

  percival field kept in the background
it was not his way to assert himself in
society but he remained until went-
worth and the last guest had departed
and then very quietly but with indis-
putable insistence he drew lady violet
away into the conservatory

  she was looking white and tired but
she held herself with a proud aloofness
in his presence while admitting his
claim upon her she yet did not volun-
tarily yield him an inch

   did you wish to speak to me   she
asked-

  he stood a moment or two in silence
before replying  then 

   only to give you this he said and
held out to her a small packet wrapped
in tissue paper on the palm of his
hand

  she took it unwillingly

  the badge of servitude   she said

   i should like to know if it fits said
field quietly as if she had not spoken

  she opened the packet and disclosed

not the orthodox diamond ring she had
expected but a ring containing a single
sapphire very deep in hue exquisitely
cut she looked at him over it her
look a question

   will you put it on  he said

  she hesitated an instant then with a
tightening of the lips she slipped it on to
her left hand

    is it too easy   he said

  she looked at him again

  no it is not easy at all

  he took her hand and looked at it
his touch was cool and strong he
slipped the ring up and down upon her
finger testing it it was as if he waited
for something

  she endured his action for a few
seconds then with a deliberate move-
ment she took her hand away

  thank you very much she said
conventionally  i wonder what made
you think of a sapphire

    yoti like sapphires   he questioned

   of course she returned her tone
was resolutely indifferent yet some-
thing in his look made her avert her eyes
abruptly she turned them upon the ring
 why did you choose a sapphire  
she said

  if she expected some compliment in
reply she was disappointed he stood
in silence

  half-startled she glanced at him in
the same moment he held out his hand
to her with a formal gesture of leave-
taking

   i will tell you another time he
said  good night  

   she gave him her hand but he scarcely
 held it the next instant with a brief
 bow he had turned and left her

the return of the convict

by w l george

author of a tied of roses 

robert barlow stood outside the
gaol he was lonely as the dis-
coverer of a hew world first footing
an alien shore - indeed it was an undis-
covered world this old world long for-
gotten through slow years it had mani-
fested itself to him but only as the second
fiddle in an orchestra once a little while
after his imprisonment he had heard a
warder tell another that he was going to
vote liberal this time thus robert
barlow guessed that in the lost world an
election was going on then for years
there had been nothing except an extraor-
dinary uniformity of daily life meals
that regulated time rather than were
brought round by the clock and a task
without variation

  a few rumours had come from the out-
side which spread hardly through word of
mouth but rather from spirit to spirit as in
an eastern bazaar by a whisper in the yard
some admission from the chaplain the

gaol heard some details of the crippen

	case  many thought that stinie morrison
had been wrongly lagged  of the war they
were officially informed and soon excite-
ment spread through the prison when
now and then a man disappeared before his
time was up it became known that he
had volunteered forsaken the buried world
for a region of flame and death and
though a few chuckled behind their prison
bars told themselves they were well out
of it nearly all the young convicts volun-
teered barlow among them but he was
just too old and his offence too heavy to
earn the right to hazard his life echoes
of the war had floated in and there had
been the exquisite excitement of air raids
which terrified the convicts because they
could not do what instinct bids men do 
to take cover in any place other than the
one in which they are

he remembered the daily hour of exer-
cise round and round in the yard where
hutchinsons story magazine

the bricks in the walls had taken on in-
dividuality he thought  theres a
chip in the mortar of the ninth brick from
the gate seventh row from the bottom
and already some sentimental memory of
the past made him half regret that he would
never see that brick again it was gone
with the dead years

  the ex-convict took two hurried steps
forward and wondered half-childishly at
the lack of restraint here was nothing to
stop his progress and overhead the new
blue sky unlimited by walls sometimes
in the light square of his window he had
seen between the bars for a moment a
bird hover now there rested on his head
a sky devoid of boundaries streaked with a
flight of starlings he thought

   why am i not happy   and realised
that within him some spirit infinitely
sagacious did not believe that he was free
but whispered   its no good your trying
to move again or running away you
arent out not really its only like that
time when they let you out for the day to
give evidence when jim killed the warder
theyll have you in again in a minute
black marias waiting just the other side
of those trees a sideways glance told
him that the warder at the gate was watch-
ing him he thought

   keeping an eye on me like a cat
with a mouse

  then he underwent some slight con-
valescence he remembered the hour-old
scene how he had come down to the office
stood at attention while they made out his
discharge he had seen his name in a big
book vaguely realised himself as somebody
now they had closed the entry in the book
he had lost his uniform his number his
place in the world he was no longer
convict  knowing what he was and
what to do but robert barlow one of
thousands of barlows tossed into a world
not ready for him

  he started a man had touched him
upon the arm and the touch terrified him
barlows only thought was   there you
are  didnt i know  theyve got me
again and the paralysis of his will was
still such that he did not try to run away
to burst into that freedom which lay on the

other side of the curtain of trees then 
realised that this man was not an officaj
of the prison he was very tall and lean
gentle blue eyes peered at him througjj
spectacles a tired old man his face
stubbly as if he shaved only at night i
dusty black clothes and the collar turn
back to front reminded barlow that
were clergymen in the outer world 
smiled  there had also been clergymen 
the gaol they were the only kind of m
which one found in both worlds and
the first time in twenty years a rncrv
thought came to him he wondered whew
he would meet them in a world still divasdp
and wholly unexplored

   how are you feeling   said the
seized his hand and shook it heartily- 
barlow stared at him he added 
the prison-gate missionary we
want you to feel that youre just thrcj
oat with nowhere to go well
suppose it all looks pretty queer

you	

  barlow did not reply and undisc 
aged the missionary went on quickly- 
if he had often said this before and kne

by heart	

   of course youre bound to feel ra
at a loose end time passes
change but there i theres no ca 
you to despair youre young yet an je
world isnt as hard as you think- 
suddenly grew personal   whats r
name  

   barlow

   been in long  

   twenty years

  the missionary looked at him
he respected the prison etiquette- at
makes it bad manners to ask a man 
he is in for besides he knew his
law he realised that even the
expert forger would have got out in
years and that this man must ha 
life he hesitated this happed ofafy
his first murderer and the mli
who had grown familiar with the 
who could work up some symp  t
that kind of modern adventurer
technical interest in the wile 
embezzler and found some meeting
even with the spy did not know
w l george

     to the murderer also he was a little
 wrvoos of him so he plunged

  well well we cant stay here talking

	the morning a good sharp walk and
a good square meal and a pipell put a
different complexion on things perhaps
uve already made your plans and of
urse in that case i wont try to influence
but if you take my advice as an old
nan whos seen a good deal of the world
wont hurry youve got a little
foney in your pocket it wont last very
ng itd be a pity to waste it and
might you know dont you think
ud better let me do something for you
lljst as a pal  suppose you were to stay
 a hostel for a day or two while you look
liout you and see what can be done  
after a moment barlow shook his head
said 

    thank you sir no i dont think
i he took a step forward and the
 sionary with a genuine air of distress
ched his arm again

j but look here really i cant let you go
this wandering like a lost dog where
 you going  have you got any friends 

family   as barlow did not
y he added  perhaps youve got a
who    he drew back startled
j he dark flush which rushed up into the
  face

m ah said barlow suddenly awake
i lt all very well talking of my wife sir
its because of her i was in there

    you didnt  

oh no i didnt kill her

   no

miled sideways and said 

i	killed him
id do it
id rather like to do it again
no whispered the missionary  you
t say those things you know that
awell there you mustnt think about
all over and done with
low hook him ofl-  oh-its  very
y your saving its all over and done with
j wouldnt think so if you were me and
w ad nothing else to think of for twenty

miamm	iif trtiim

what would you have said if youd
a tool and only twenty-five

a girl of twenty-two and youd

nth

that she was just a plaster wint

you a worm who ought to say thank
being allowed to crawl round her 

what would you have done if youd found
out that thered been another man hanging
round her before you married her and that
she was still hankering after him when
she was your wife  and he too hanging
about at the end of the road for her to slip
out to him of evenings

   dont think about it any more

   what else is there to think about  
asked barlow his handsome clean-shaven
mouth tightening  havent i had her
picture before my eyes even when i kept
them shut for twenty years  and she
was a picture shed got blue eyes like
that sky up there but more shiny and a
dimple in each cheek  you could hide the
tip of your finger in it when she laughed
and hair    oh my god   his voice
grew hoarse   rolls and rolls of red gold
   and one day when she let it down she
trod on it and it tripped her up

   there there said the missionary
patting his arm  dont think of those
twenty years think of the twenty years
that are coming youre forty-five you
say well im sixty and im not tired of
life theres lots more before you come
with me well find you a job in a place
where they dont know your story you
talk like an educated man very likely
youll get on make a good living who
knows  if your wifes alive she   
may not live for ever there are good
women as well as bad think of it some
other woman may come wholl really love
you in a few years you may be playing
with your babies by your own fireside

  barlow gave a loud discordant laugh

	wives and children   he cried  no
thanks ive had enough of that no im
for the gay life i wasnt telling you the
truth when i told you that for twenty years
i thought of nothing but her i thought ot
lots of other things having a damn good
cigar and drinking as much as i could
hold and putting a bit on a horse   
though im afraid ill be had  i havent
kept up my study of pedigrees no more
women except for fun i can tell you that
i dout want another like her though
after all perhaps im hard on her she
didnt want to marry me she wanted him
all along  know it came out at the


hutchinsons story magazine

trial it was her mother did it because
id some money of my own you may say
i ought to have talked to her when i found
out what was going on and then i wouldnt
have done it id have been sorry for her
poor kid having to marry the man she
didnt want she riled me you know
she thought i was a muff she called me
a softy because i hated drowning kittens
and she said i had no determination be-
cause once i wanted to go to the seaside
when she wanted to go to the country and
i gave in he laughed  but i showed
her i showed her if id no determination
i was game enough to lay him out and
she knew it too  i can remember her
eyes at the trial and how they stared at me
 as if blue lights had been hung in them
ah  she did hate me

  the missionary did not know what to
say when a figure detached itself from the
curtain of trees and came towards them
it was a woman and as she reached the
two men she hesitated staring at barlow
with a puzzled expression in her eyes she
was very slight and pale and her brown
coat and skirt were worn and ugly her
eyelids looked very red round pale blue
eyes in her white face her hands gloved
in black kid clasped the handle of her sun-
shade a ridiculous ivory bird with green
glass eyes she stood shifting a little from
foot to foot as if uncertain what to do
she was deprecating as a dog that humbly
seeks to make apology and goes its tail
ingratiatingly awag to a certain beating
and an uncertain forgiveness suddenly
she set her teeth  one could see her jaw
square she came close laid on y her finger-
tips on barlows sleeve the missionary
turned and faced her

   what do you want   he asked he
was full of instinctive suspicion thus con-
fronted with a creaturc born again into a
world that did not welcome him he felt
paternal tutelar  it was as if he became
responsible for this man whom he received
dulled rather than broken infirm of will
and bereft of desire so he stared at tfie
woman who bad cast down her eyes
she surprised him for he was familiar
enough with sordid adventuresses that
await men for years nurtured in abstinence

and capable on the recovery of freedom
of ungovernable folly she was neither
young nor attractive nor clad so as 
please  nor was there in her manner a
thing jaunty no lure this sent to 
ex-convict as the ambassador of a treacb
ous world so he hesitated he was
pelled to cry out to her  go away 
him alone the man is mine he m 
be saved yer but he must be saved by
so he said 

   what have you to do with
man 

  she did not reply still she stared at
ground her mouth a little twisted as 
the determination which had urged br 
this place were muted into fear
robert barlow still looked away to
the curtain of trees as if he did not
the touch upon his arm of the kid-govi
fingers as if like a caged tiger he mirr
in hfe eyes the past suddenly the wonj
looked up at the missionary and the apz
went out of her attitude her eyes met
straightly as she said 

   i am his wife she was in that
ment filled with the dignity of her stabe
for she was his wife still his wife
was something to him that no other
whether young or rich or charming
be to him she was the anchor
twenty years before he had dragged
now they sailed into waters whcr-
chance she might moor him into bar
 oh said the missionary  y

oh of course theyd let too know
was still suspicious for hall a
the prison gate told him that even 
ugliness have their charms and their  
he realised that the prisoner a 
money in his parket can easily b
one who has the iusight to
immediate desire but he reflect
such approaches are not made with a 
drawn face and red-edged eyes
drew back saying 

   youve don right take him
take care of him and if you want an
by and by    somebody to say 
word for him or advice write to st

the man obedient under the womans
kui-iing hand and so they passed the
governors house and disappeared towards
jhe town which a train was just entering
vng grey cumuli of smoke in the radiant

air

they did not speak in the train instinct
the woman that her husband must
fecapture life slowly that he must re-
qcornpass it nor did he challenge her
kile her eyes rested steadfast upon him
anxious half devoted he looked out
the country that unrolled broad
rtmoor purple-spangled with heather
d silver-split with rivulets of white water
the hills rose and fell on the skyline
upon the light wind the birch leaves
uddered robert barlow was incredulous
amazed rather than glad every-
n was extraordinary everything was

novel

i at okehampton several people came into
 carriage- little underfed man a com-
rcial traveller who perused a stationery
jatalogllc

as if it were a breviary and a
 untry woman wrangling with two
ldren her scolding did not disturb
it was merely the vague chorus
a dream picture which unfolded before
and only by degrees took upon itself
aractcr of reality so once again his
 e had to take lum by the arm and urge
t out when they reached exeter he
he followed her into a fly that
ve them through the unaccustomed
towards a careless destination he

passed

p up a small front garden a gravel
j cu in the midst of which a green pod
lass earned dusty begonias a door
a hall yawned the door closed
 down in the parlour looked about
it  suddenly the dead life came alive
tv fcai and unral he had never been
house before-indeed never before
ltnntcred exeter  for some reason un-
his wife had migrated here from
br n- vet all that surrounded him

hry up the d lie  stired at thl
vrt ogany sideboard by jove 
ov ught that himself and on the
up	tood the toby jug hed picked

arm nth town for seven and six
otten jt x too jc garbled

a song of wilkie bards which had pene-
trated the prison 

 it cost me seven and sixpence

i wish id bough a dog

and smiled the nottingham lace curtains
were belted with green satin he didnt
like that he remembered other curtains
   what were they like     oh yes
one of those art fabrics with messy designs
that came out before the boer war all
very long ago a reminiscent pang over-
came him but the content of his body was
too great as he nestled in the padded arm-
chair it felt queer after the wooden stool
nice though and that old etching in the
corner  harvest home that was jolly
good suddenly he looked at his wife still
clasping in her gloved hands the sunshade
with the absurd birds head and the green
glass eyes maisie  no doubt about it
he picked out one after the other her
features so altered so familiar funny
hed never realised shed got that dry
pinkish skin and her nose  it had
been such a short impertinent little nose 
it didnt become it to have thinned then
as if with an effort she looked at him and
he grew more conscious of her tragedy for
he found in the blue eyes not a vestige of
the old glow nor in the hair of which
untidy strands cscaped from under the
gaily-flowered hat the old blaze the old
sheen of molten gold for a moment they
stared at each other as if gripped in a
conflict of wills he felt neither hate nor
attraction only surprise she must have
understood him for she bit her lip and
taking a step forward whispered 

   bob    dont jook at me like that
havent you    cant you   

   irrelevantly he replied  it all seems so
strange then after a pause   i never
thought id see you again maisie

  his voice was so cold that she stiffened
with anger

   perhaps you didnt want to perhaps
youre sorry i came to fetch you

   oh no he aid after a moment  i
dont mind

  her features twitched as tf she were
about to cry and instinctively her hands
went to her hair patting it into order


 hutchinsons story magazine

her femininity arrayed itself and she
thought

   what a fool i was not to wear my blue 
only its so out of shape past ironing
with a desperate air she came closer
leaning over him her hands upon the table
and she stared at him filled with intense
desire to force into his eyes that ardent
tender gaze she had not seen for twenty
years as he remained passive looking at
her with unconcern she realised at last
things that the mirror had murmured in
vain because it had told its story so slowly
day by day for a moment she did not
see the man upon whom her eyes were
fixed she saw herself as she had been
white and round heavy-crowned in radiant
locks and laughing she remembered  he
used to bury the tip of his little finger in
the dimples which formed no more in the
thinned cheeks it was horrible she
thought

   im forty-two i suppose i look forty-
two oh its no use pretending   but
she hated him then hated him as she had
not done when he roused her disdain hated
him more than when he slew her lover be-
cause then he had outraged only outside
things whereas now he placed upon her the
culminating insult of resisting her attrac-
tions but at once her fury collapsed and
her hands fell helpless what was to be
done  nothing so she said 

   let me get you something to eat

  she left the room but she did not at
once go into the kitchen she ran upstairs
hurriedly took off her brown coat and
skirt and after a moments hesitation put
on her blue skirt and a white blouse she
ordered her hair it lay easily now and
without spring this hair which had once
been so unruly then after a long pause
she dabbed her face over with the powder-
puff she thought

   he used to hate face powder but hes
so different now perhaps hes different
even in that

  then after a while upon a tray she
carried in a meal which she set out oo the
ready white tablecloth he watched her
carelessly as if separate from the scene
at last she said 

   come along you must have something

to eat obediently he came to the table-
he liked the soup thin vegetable soup easv

a large slab of game pie a delicious feeling
of excitement arose in him the exquislta
scent of it rose like a prayer into w ii
nostrils and greedily cutting off a 
piece he crammed it into his mouth jf
a moment he chewed it but the
disturbed him he gulped down half jjji
mouthful something sickened him
was so heavy so vigorous this uiiacc
tomed food good too  he did 
know what was the matter with him

 never mind said his wife
solingly  try something else

   he ate a little custard and a jelly-
soft liquid things one could eat 
better than skilly anyway

  when he had done his meal his wife
up and with a sacramental air hrl g

   bob    dont look like that
ive   she did not finish her sentence
she shrank from telling him that once
before she had seen his features so set
and that an hour later he had killed her
lover

   what do you mean   said barlow
speaking to the wall	

   oh you frighten me so you look at
me as if you thought youd squash me like a
beetle just to get me out of the way she
loosed her clasp  im frightened of you
i thought itd be all right but   

   oh aid barlow  i see what you
mean youre afraid ill murder you
you neednt be nervous if i was to do
that id have done it twenty years ago

    but then she cried  if you feel like
that if you dont think wrr  of me why
have you treated me like this all these
years  

   i dont know what you mean

   my letters you never answered my
letters oh dont say you couldnt she
went on her injury suddenly raising her
anger  you could write a letter a month
and i wrote you month after month and
you never answered

    you didnt stick it out to the end said
barlow bitterly

   well what do you expect  i wrote to
you every month for five years and you
never answered what was the good  
 what would you have done if id
swung in a month instead of being re-
prieved and getting out in twenty years 
gone to the cemetery and put a bunch of
violets on my stone every sunday when it
wasnt raining  

   dont she said weakly  havent
we suffered enough both of us without
going on like this  didnt you believe
what i told you in my letters if you read
them  perhaps you didnt read them
but its true what i told you i swear its
true there wasnt anything between jim
and me oh yes i was fond of him id
been fond of him before i met you and i
couldnt help that one cant alter those
tilings they just happen but he couldnt
afford to marry me and you could and
mother would have it then jim came
along and he was so unhappy he said

without me he asked me to be his frieo
if i couldnt be more what could i do

i couldnt let him hang about the road li
that with his pale face and his eyes gettifls
larger as he got thinner when he ontf
wanted to see me now and then but i di
you no wrong i was your true wife 
the end you killed him    just r
nothing

  barlow stared at her thoughtful
dabbing his forehead with his handkercbi
for the heat had grown heavier as tb
clouds massed upon the hills promising 
storm

   dont you believe me   she asked-
 oh yes i believe you what does
matter now  	la

    oh but it does it does   she cried
of an ecstatic need to convince him 
thats not the end bob she hesita
her mouth open as if seeking words  tb
throwing her arms round his ncck 
kissed him clasping him with all b
strength crushing her face against bis
if she would penetrate him drown ber
within him he did not resist and
moment she drew back her head
her eyes and in a low hoarse voice sa 

   bob dont you understand     
you youre my man youve coffle 
to me come back to me as my busb 
and let me love you  let me really be y
wife as i never was before	- jj

  after a moment the man said   jj
me  its the first time youve said 
you had your chance twenty years ag-
 im changed

   oh hows that happened    ilttf
  she hesitated then in a furtive wbw

said	hid

 lout pluck 

different  i

  but now i know youre
knew it from the day
hen you killed jim

  after a moment barlow drew away
 she shocked him  she was incredible and
 horrible in a steady voice he asked 

   do you mean that you didnt care for
 when we were married and that now
 youre in love with me because i killed a
 man  

  after a doubtful silence she replied
 defiantly   yes thats why oh i dont
 an i wanted you to kill jim if id felt
 yw oould do it itd have been all right
 fcut i never felt you could do a thing like
 bat i wanted a real man then you did
 it

 u barlow shook himself free and stood up

  seems rather hard lines on jim that be
 kould have t be killed to supply evi-
 dence he said  but never mind let
  go  you make me sick he stood for a
 foment at the window staring at the heavy
 ckl-caps from which now came distant
 ouuds of thunder and the woman was
 but dared not break into his medita-
 r- she felt entirely in his hands she
 d aid what she could say the right of
 on lay with him and now that she had
 ined belief in his purposefulness his
 vfty she was content so she stood and
 rted until he decided her course for her
 ddenly barlow raised the lower sash of
 window and calmly stepped out into

  	garden passed the gate went out

i walked fast along the road not caring
re it icd and only from time to time
his hand across his wet brow for now
heat fell heavyas a blanket and the
of thunder drew closer and doser his
d was still filled with maisies revela-
et e was more conscious of her
than of her words those dim
 that meagre shape that hair without
ai tlat bconc to tlle woman who
kd	bul not to maisie fr whom he

 l bven twenty years the maisie who
  died the day they sentenced lain and
 jd not rise again he thought  when
 her she couldnt love me now she
 me and its too late shes not what

 and be did not reproach himself
 rhsing that if after tlwsc tweuty years

 by some miracle there had come to meet
 him the maisie he had last seen in the old
 bailey such as she was gold lily and rose
    such a maisie even hostile even
 guilty he would have knelt to while now
 he could only repel the new maisie even
 innocent even loving

   as he went along the road the suburb
 grew sparser the rows of houses gave
 place to terraces of semi-detached villas
 then to large houses in their own grounds
 at last he met the wall of a country park
 and for some time followed the exe that
 flowed sleepy and shallow the thunder
 had come closer as he went and now a
  sharp clap startled him he slopped and
 felt with gratefulness the first drops of rain
 upon his head it was exqaisite and as
 the rain cc s faster in heavy drops that
 clattered separately upon the trees making
 a sound like small beasts running he felt
 cooler and more assured

   faster and heavier came the rain and
 still he stood water was flowing down
 his face from his soaked hair making
 his clothes sodden he stood among
 the wagnftriao sounds of the storm re-
 verberating artillery of the heavens sharp
 musketry and flame of the thunderbolts
 a great pall of rain had swung across
 the hills and the waters of the exe were
 stippled with millions of holes as the
 spears of rin pierced the grey glass of its
 waters it lasted for a very long time and
 so deafened so blinded was he by the fury
 of the storm that he lost consciousness
 of time and so stood thrown by the rage
 of the elements into a state half comatcse
 where he saw himself as lie had been hold-
 ing close the maisie that had died with the
 years

   some hours must have elapsed for so
 entranced was he by his dream so remote
 did he grow from the surrounding world in
 which he had found no heritage that he
 realised with surprise that the storm was
 long done that the sun of late afternoon was
 drying the road and sinking swiftly into the
 western sky he moved painfully in his
 clothes which dung heavy and wet to his
 body he thought  im dripping and
 this brought him back to the actual wucld
 he thought  whats to be dnoe  i


hutchinsons story magazine

cant stay here i must do something
instinctively he felt in his pocket for the
few wet treasury notes and coins which had
been given him as fruit of his labour for
twenty years  it isnt much he thought

  i dont suppose i can live on it more than
a week or two i suppose i must find some
work

  but an immense disgust of work of
association with his fellows in a workshop
akin to the prison oame over him he
did not want to chain himself np again
he wanted nothing prccise only to be
alone and at rest but mankind he
realised would not lot him alone it
couldnt there were too many of them-
coming along the road he saw a couple
arms locked about waists walking slowly
aud coming down towards the exe he
stared at them calmly rather than
enviously a workman and some girl out
of a shop in exeter no doubt    holding
hands and talking nonsense they didnt
know what they were in for and what life
could do to them very likely but as t iey
drew closer barlow shrank away he
thought no more of them but only of him-
self those two those kids they didnt
know they didnt know who he was
he wondered what theyd say if he went up
to them and said  ive come out of
dartmoor this morning after twenty years
i killed a man he smiled as he thought
of their frightened faces but perhaps
they wouldnt be frightened perhaps
theyd just draw away because he was a
convict a disgraced man he thought
 ill run but just then the couple
climbed over a stile and disappeared across
a field

  now he knew that the eyes of his fellow-
men must frighten him because they must
judge him once a convict always a
convict they could never think of him
as one of them selves he roust be horrible
to them  or wonderful maisi thought
him wonderful

   i oant bear it he said aloud  ill
go abroad but he remembered how little
money was in his pocket and also that
abroad he would be faced always by the
curious eyes of men meu who might find

out what he was for a moment he loo

at the river

   i suppose one could drown oneself i
that if one got to the middle

  then from down the road ho saw ri
above a ridge the helmets and torsces
two county constables he gazed hy
tised at the silver glitter of those helmet-
they came along talking good-humo
smoking pipes and barlow stiffened to s
his manhood by waiting until they p
him but he couldnt do it the
faces the heavy gait the big eyes whie
they would fasten on him terrified hi-
irresistibly compelled he turned afld
hurriedly walked back in the direction
whence he came once more he passed 
wall of the country park the big hous
in their own grounds the semi-detacho
villas and arrived at the houses in cs
instinct stopped him before a garden 
yellow gravel surrounding a pod of gi
grass and dusty begonias he went jj

summing up is quite masterly rowenaand

morrow would be the second anniversary
of the day during which after a quarrel
over something that he had completely
forgotten he had agreed with rowena to
give separation a trial he and she were
in the pithy language of the lady with the
far-reaching voice  wealthy gutter-snipes
they had  haunted the city dissipating
youth and freshness in the foul atmosphere
of night clubs and dancing places in com-
pany with people as careless and as futile
as themselves his education had been
washed and he had  deliberately gone back
on the traditions and good form of his ex-
cellent family and it was a good thing
that his father and mother had not lived
to undergo the pain and disappointment
of seeing their only son go completely to
the dogs

  these were strong words to apply to the
youthful process that is universally knovn
as sowing wild oats he thought-the dra-
matic exaggeration of a woman with a
dangerous gift of the gab and as such
he endeavoured to dismiss them from his
mind he laughed at the term wealthy
gutter-snipe but in order to take the state
of it out of his mind threw his eyes with a
sense of keen refreshment over the beau-
tiful gardens of his sisters southampton
cottage made magic by the moonlight he
was glad he found to be out of town glad
he had to confess to take a rest from the
rather petnlant demands of violet orme
and the all-night frivolous set in which she
moved and had her being it was good to
breathe that clean sweet air and stand
alone beneath the infinite meadows of
heaven in which all the forget-me-nots of
the angels were in full blossom it was
good by way of a change to smell the
sccnt of honeysuckle and syringa and to
hear the sound coming through the dusky
glimmer of the night not of the msh of
city traffic but the chorus of long island
frogs

  he went along the italian terrace whose
nymphs seemed to have paused in mid-
motion to watch their shadows on the
squares of stone to the quiet pool in which
lay as in a looking-glass the reflection of
the sky the beauty dignity and sim-
plicity of the place which ordinarily would

have earned a mere brief recognition stirred
and touched him as he stood there that
night he was surprised at this being
the mood of a man who has been forced to
stand outside himself and see what he
looked like he ought to have been bored
and restless and to have felt the irresistible
call of the crowd and the bright lights and
the lure of ragtime he ought to have
been a little sore at the impertinence o
that talkative woman and to have rankle
under the truth of her scathing indictment-

  the truth is always harsh as it was
knew that this pause in his perpetual joy-
ride was welcome although he was aston-
ished that it should be and being fund
mentally straight he told himseli that the
ugly words that he had been obliged
overhear painted a pretty accurate picturc
of his mode of life and point of view

  and as he stood out there in the m
light alone and introspective the menon
of boys dreams came back to him lle 
almost forgotten song old ambitions
aspirations formed up in front of him-
old ideals took shape and floated wistful 
like spirits in and out of the thin treef
at one time life had held enormous p
bilities and not so many years ago he i
tingled and stood with his shoulders ba-
and chin high as his father had said to hn
 given health and a day chris and 
may conquer the world and now-
behind him lay nearly two years of
foolishly and wantonly killed money  
health wasted and frivolled away
love begun in all the ardour of
youth dying for want of seriousness
sympathy	

  well the tactless woman who p
herself on never being afraid to sa
cisely what sh thought had achieve

thing that his father and mother fcave not
lived to undergo the pain of seeing their
niy son go completely to the dogs those
ords had entered like iron into his soul

all at once a gentle aflectionate hand
was aid upon his arm and his sister belle
hallett a little breathless looked up
his for once unsmiling face  ive
 looking everywhere for you chris

    said nervously  an extraordinary
thng s happened

chris didnt say anything about the
raordinary thing that had happened
cdy he meant to tackle that alone
f simply asked  what is it   and put
 arm round his little sisters shoulders

    rowenas turned up and wants to stay
 the week-end without calling me
p r sending a wire shes just descended
pn us to take her chance of there being

	room for her isnt that exactly like

 it   asked chris  ive almost
can you give her a room  

        i can as it happens iiut what
ot you  do you mind  what worries
t s that you may not want to stay under
ranie roof and i slid  be tembly dis-

    snce ive seen anything of you
    hung anxiously on his answer

 q course i dont mind said chris
should   rowena and i are on
tfcost polite speaking terms whenever
jt my dear

hallett heaved a sigh of relief  i

    	know that youve neither of you
    anything and there are so many
    stories going about so youll
    thats splendid olivers very cross
    anted me to say that the house
    foil

 vvat   much mver 
tic -w you see shes brought a man with

y know how oliver hates what

i f loose ways of the younger set

oft orht a man with her   even as

the ringleaders o that very set

 incredulous rowena knew

wcll that hallett belonged to the

camp of conventional law-

could mrs mapletons

lengths  be carried so near the

edge of the limit   who  what  his
name  

   merrill shannon said belle  just
think of it it appears that they had a
breakdown a little way from here on their
way to easthampton and decided not to
worry about going on as they want
something to eat i must go and look after
them its awfully sweet of you to take
it like this chris and away she went
excited but disturbed

  take it like that  how else was he to
take it  what right had he to say a word
as to how rowena ran her life  it was
true that she bore his name but that was
not much for her to be proud of for
the rest she had refused to accept any
share of his income and had lived on her
own money but for the act of marriage
which counted for so little with these ultra-
moderns they had become mere acquaint-
ances their only mutual interest was that
they both played the fool whatever
he did to rescue the remainder of his own
youth from dissipation would have to be
done alone the girl whom lie had
married in a good and even beautiful spell
of adolescent romance was running in
single harness perfectly happy and care-
less

  one thing however he would cer-
tainly achieve for the sake of old times
he would put the man who ought to have
married violet qrme out of the running
he would make use of this opportunity to
rid mrs christopher belmore of merrill
shannon cad and lady-killer and then
start out to sec what he could make of him-
self everything that was decent in him
every shred of gratitude and love for the
memory of his father and mother urged
him to prove the last part of mre maple-
tons summary untrue and undeserved
 so help me god he said to the stars

  that decided he turned and marched
back to the house the french windows
of the drawing-room were open his
brother-in-law was playing bridge at one
table and his sister at another mrs
mapton and her confidante were sitting
on a settee with their heads together the
white-haired lady with the black eyebrows
and th scintillating sequins had received


 hutchinsons story magazine

 further fuel for her conversational powers
 by the sudden and unconventional arrival
 of two of the most famous members of the
 younger smart set that was obvious

   two figures were standing together on
 the verandah with the moonlight upon
 them-one slight and blond and as grace-
 ful as a narcissus the other tall and
 square-shouldered and dark

   hello rowcna   said chris

    oh hedo chris what fun meeting
 you here the voice was as light as the
 petal of a rose

    yes im awfully glad i shied at
 coming but i see now why i came he
 bent over her perfectly cordial hand

    but we had no intention of stopping
 here we were on the way to emorys
 at eastliampton

    perhaps there was something occult
 about it he said laughing

   with even more of the consummate ease
 and equability that chris remembered so
 well this slip of a girl this finished product
 of super-civilisation this child who had
 been born to sophistication half turned
 her fair head towards the man at her side
  you know merrill shannon she said

    no said chris  i low do you do  
 murmuring an appropriate answer
 shannon conveyed plainly enough a de-
 sire to be left undisturbed as soon as pos-
 sible with some one to whom he had the
 exclusive right

    and as chris got it his back stiffened and
 his determination became as hard as rock
 it was not his job to interfere with rowenas
 choice of friends but this one this un-
 scrupulous bounder should find himself
 very properly unhitched before a new day
 broke if he knew anything about it it
 was written on the new leaf that be had
 just turned over

   he sat on the step at rowenas feet with
 a cold shoulder towards her companion

  how do you go   he asked

     no grumbles she replied with a little
 laugh  i caught sight of you one day
 last week pretty isnt she  

   yes and very charming 

  were talking about mrs orme
rowena with one of her cliaracteristic
touches of audacity

    yes shannon attempted to

appear

  uninterested but his eyes flicked a little at
 the mention of violets name

    chris deliberately ignored his existence-- j
  have you been to the house lately 
 asked rowena casually

    i slept there about three weeks ago
 but the camphor- balls chased me round to
 the club

    hows that queer old housekeeper
 mrs pipkin  

   chris laughed  she wept over
 she considers that were both quite beyoo
 redemption

    does she  funny old thing i should
 have thought shed forgotten me by thb
 time

   there was a pause but not a silence 
 the water nearby the frogs continued theic 
 rasping chorus and from away in the dt 
 tance came the steady boom of the sea

   chris leaned forward  may i be p
 sonal for a moment   lie asked

    i wondered how long you were goio 
 to be before you said something nice abou
 my frock she waited with a flash 
 smile

    its corking but i was thinking w
 your face

    ob its the same young face

  only prettier	 j

    dear me she said  quite your
 form chris do you remember the
 things you used to say on the yacht
 which we became engaged  whos got f 
 cigarette  

    two cases were instantly presented
 took one from shannons- a gold one
 opulent than useful and then a servj
 came out and called attention to the 
 that there was supper in the dining-roobhs
  and believe me im ready for it
 rowena ruing with alacrity 
 along merrill youre starving i
 from every masculine sign

   shannon followed her he was
 and obviously disconcerted young

 over her shoulder  would it bow 
 to come and watch us eat chns f

 the lights in the dining-room were so
 flanged as to be kind to women who had
 passed the first flush of indisguisable youth
 from his place a little away from the
 oak table chris bel more studied the
 j of the girl whom he had married for
 v and the man who had removed the
 nale of the girl with whom he chris was
 everywhere from conventional visit-
  lists he was quick to notice a rather
 ed look in rowenas astonishing eyes
 jw something tliat seemed to him to be

 	little wistful round her lips when she
 ijjed to laugh she forced her merriment
 he thought and gave him the impres-
  one who stood greatly in need of
  but who wouldnt let go

 here was no doubt that shannon had
 a subtle change since he had
  u him last discontent was all about
 i- and a certain nervous irritability he
 no effort to play up and keep the
 versa tic nal ball in a rally and once or
 he disagreed with rowena with so
 a note tliat even she raised her eye-

   elruore didnt go bock with these two
 w verandah he went into his brother-
 eei n an shut himself in he had
 t that he was going to make something
 ieli for the sake of his father and

 at the back of kowenas eyes which

 jjy o but by jove  he would take a
 out there in the garden under the
 sn i   a cried a halt to folly he had
 c to honesty and the beauty and
 of    a scetie which lay tmder the magic
 ujv 	had touched him deeply and

oonld he do f it was not  all

of a sudden to trample down the wild oats
which had grown so high all about him
and his wife and shannon and violet orme
he dismissed at once the obvious idea of
getting up a fracas with shannon and
ordering him off the place it was not his
place and shannon would have the right
to say that rowena could choose her friends
he dismissed also the equally obvious plan
of going to rowena and asking her to take
up her life with him again she would
inevitably demand to know why she should
be bracketed with violet orme the maze
in which all four of them had placed them-
selves easy as it had been to get into was
difficult to get out of he believed that
rowena had done nothing more than amuse
herself with shannon he clung to his
boyish faith in her how was he to prove
that his relations with violet orme were
only those of a man who had desired a
companion in lunacy  that was the
point

  walking up and down with his hands
deep into his pockets he got as far as this
and no farther the way was blocked by
the barrier of his own temperament and
those of the other three he feared the
ridicule that he would ask for if he went
frankly up to rowena and shannon and
told them that he wanted to turn over a
new leaf his sense of civilisation rose up
against a row with shannon and whem it
came to violet orme he had to conicss
tliat he had done much to add to the
scandal which shannon had attached to
her name she had to be considered too
wild oats grew quickly and clung like burrs

  suddenly he remembered that violet
was a member of a week-end party at a
house within a thousand yards of his sisters
and that he had promised to meet her at
ten oclock on tho hill that divided them
and then at that instant inspiration put
a light into his befogged brain let them
all four come together out under the stars
catch the beauty and sanity of the night
and with the magic of the moon upon
uu-m stumble into honesty 

  out he went quivering with a strange
excitement believing however mistakenly
that they were all three like himself in
need only of a little help to emerge from

the high crop that entangled them  give
human nature a chance he seemed to
hear in his brain  it is fundamentally
decent love hope fear faith-these make
humanity and in every heart the christ is
born

  he found rowena lying back in a deck-
chair gazing at a star he stepped quietly
and caught her face in repose he had
been right it was tired and wistful
shannon was leaning against a pillar with
his eyes on the ground his cigarette in a
bughokler had gone out he seemed to be
miles away

  a clock in the house struck ten

  young belmore knew that he must go
warily shannon had not spoken to violet
since the divorce-no one knew why-and
rowena had not chosen to meet her
vitriolic was the only word to use in at-
tempting to describe violets language
whenever she mentioned shannon-which
was not often so that art was needed in
the process of achieving this meeting which
might not last any longer than  flash of
lightning  a wonderful night he said

   i suppose it is said shannon

  rowena looked from one man to the
other and her eyes rested on chris what
was it about him to-night that made her
feel just a touch of pain in her heart 

  chris btood over rowena  como up
on the hill and have a look at the sea he
said

  she took his hand and allowed herself
to be drawn to her feet  must i   she
asked but she wanted to go all the same
his voice and the way he looked at her
took her back two whole years to that
night on the yacht when he had proposed
what had they quarrelled about  she
couldnt remember it was her fault
probably she had been idiotically young
then she felt old to-night

  chris turned to shannon  care to
comc   he asked casunlly

  there was a brief hesitation shannon
had no use for the sea ihen he nodded
and re-lit his cigarettc and fell in step
this man had been rowenas husband but
that was no reason for his marching her off

  they went slowly through the garden in
silence all the flowers were asleep

fireflies flashed their little lights and the
moon silvered everything

   fairies are out to-night said rowena
presently putting her hand on shannons
arm

  he glanced sharply at her her expres
sion was that of a tired child he
never seen it on her face before he looked
about there were mulutudes ol stars 
full moon made him blink with its honesty-
the scent of new-mown hay came to bin-
yes it was gorgeous why had thing
gone so crooked 

  they made their way up the hill
faced daisies peppered the dry grass tbey
were on violet before she or they realise
it only young belmore had seen er
lying full stretch with her hands under be
head

  she sat up resentment in every line

of

her shannon drew up short anger a
eagerness clashed in his expression roweo
was not amused and wondered why

  belmore deliberately ignored the hide
awkwardness of the whole thing  c
come to share the view he said  a
want you to meet my wife vi

  the two girls murmured appro pn 
words and violet who had months be
dropped shannon like a stone gave 
 how do you do   to which slianl
mumbled an answer	 j

  what had seemed to all four cnu
impossible liad come to pass quietly
naturally it was almost unbelieva
these four of all people

rowena sat down near to violet

the

two men followed her example nd 
more set a light to conversation 
well done he had relied on two thtfvj
civilisation and humanity - and they
not failed him and for an hour be ro
the ball lighuy and with laughter	

ouier three kept it going defuy 
strange hour

 and at last a silence came	

died and artificiality petered out  aflj
one made a move to go nervously 

with almost boyish self-consciousness

      hj and jujs t caa- be played unless x rowena wud the fairies are out
 hutchinsons story magazine

    ive got a new game to suggest lie
 said hedging  it needs a night like this
 witlj moonlight and stars and it cant be
 played unless as rowena said the fairies
 are out

   no one helped him or caught his eyes
that glanced with eagerness from face to
face so he started again with a courage
that he didnt believe that he possessed

    its called breaking down the fourth
 wall he said  its-its about the
 hardest game ever invented its gener-
 ally played by two people but it doesnt
 spoil it to have four the rules arc that
 the walls are not just pottered at butbashed
 right open so that everything can be seen
 inside and that each person smashes bis
 own wall

   he cleared his throat he felt as though
 he were in a fern-house ail eyes were on
 him now and in every one there was
 nothing of ridicule it was almost too
 good to be true

    go ahead said shannon grimly
belmore hesitated for an instant and
then jumped in  ive had enough of
rotting about with violet and the old
crowd im fed up with it its a fool
life i only took to it because of a row
with rowena   

    my fault cried rowena

    no mine i wasnt suclj a kid as you
 were-and i kept on at it because i was
 afraid of being jeered at if i chucked it

 i never was gone on violet for a single in-
 stant i liked her mighty well and was
 sorry for her

   violet scoffed but it ended in a sob
 shannon dug his heel into the earth

   and now im out continued bel-
more  the old town wont see me again
until ive got my wind and musclc back
and violet wont be bothered by me any
more im for sanity from to-night on
and im going to plug at getting rowena
back again for home and babies i its
voice broke a little as he came to an end

 who goes next  

     do said rowena quickly before
her courage oozed away  im sick to
tear of merrill of restaurants smutty
stories late nights and all the same old
dull stuff id have got out months ago

   and gone home and played the game if 
hadnt been afraid that cfiris would laugh
at me chris   with a strange litd
cry she held out her hand belmore caugw
it and put it to his lips

  violet and shannon looked at one an-
other queerly they seemed to mcasuf
each other up and wonder whether
good could come of their entering the gain-
shannon remained silent so violet spok

 are you in this  

   yes said shannon shortly   er
much in

    im listening

  ladies first	

   no she replied roughly you g-
 im glad to  i loathed and d

smallest attraction for me i fellow
about simply because you were everywb
with belmore the comic side of it
pealed to me to say nothing of the

he almost shouted this anger but
from him like fire

  i didnt turn you down	

lie cried violet  after the hvl
never came near me and made me a la
ing stock people jeered and said 
at her divorced for a man wlios cu
her the fool- she hit the earth 
her open hand

author of  tfie landlord of the love-a-vuck 

it simply would not come right david
stroud sat back in his chair and stared
out of the window with all the sheets
of manuscript scattered on the table in
front of him thus he had sat for nearly
three hours without once putting his pen
to the paper he knew that the main kja
for the book was a good one and there was
a kind of second theme a little below the
surface which intrigued him but things
would not somehow dovetail me stared
from the window to the fireplace he bit
his nails a very bad habit he lighted a
cigarette and walked up and down the
room it was a meagrely furnished room
with a bedroom adjoining the two com-
prising his lodgings in an obscure house in
west kensington

  david was young-barely twenty-three
-and lie had come to london from the
cathedral town of norwich with the uiuai
determination to set the big city by the
ears his father had been an organist and
music-teacher and on his death had left a
small sum of money to be divided between

david and his sister hilda it broug
them in about eighty pounds a year
but hilda bad since married a fairly
perons young doctor and continued to
at norwich the mother had died vtlc
they were both quite young david cd
sequently was alona in london excep
several chance acquaintances lonelit
has its compensations as well as its we
disadvantages he did not entirely
his loneliness to a man who is going 
set london by the ears write the big
the world-disturbing play a large amo
of loneliness is essential

he had been in london a year an j
had one or two short stones accepted 

m but
enibooc

 had done a little hack journalism
 big novel was still in a very

stage and on this morning after two 
abortive thinking he suddenly bcinnff
tensely alive to his loneliness it lug
and pale sunlight was streaming  r t
the windows somewhere ths r
be very beautiful

rery beautiful	hoiibt

    i know what it is im stale 


stacy aumonier

  he contemplated a walk in the park-his
usual recreation-but decided that this
would hardly meet the case it was
changc he wanted  something definite and
gical at the same time he thought for
a ng time and then went and borrowed
an old cassells time-table from his land-
ed he knew nothing about the country
near london but he reckoned that one
would have to trawl for at least an hour
j escape from bricks and mortar at last
 pitched on a place called moblesham-by-
mill he liked the name it was on
 de line not far from guildford the fare
cheap and it would be somewhere near
 surrey downs it would serve

rather apathetically he boarded a motor-
 to waterloo and took his ticket- the
journey wearied him and when he
fjed at a station where he had to change
 hesitated whether he should not return

  e had a premonition of failure the
plc in the train irritated him  the in-
nnable suburbs gave him no hope

-vcn when he arrived at moblesham-by-
he was doomed to disappoint-
it was a plain villa-y little town
th an ugly main street a large brewery

innumerable tin chapels there was
 mill and no evidence of there ever
vng been a mill it was nearly midday
he arrived there and he walked list-
ly into an inn and ordered some bread
 cheese and some shandv-gafl having
otiated this modest lunch he started
to walk the road led for nearly a
between high hedges with fields on
ide and then began to slope up-
ijv- his legs ached  the prospect of a
depressed him coming to a fork in
foad he chose the narrower road which
upwards after a time the country
 cd out more and he sat on a gate and
ked a cigarette

  in rotten condition he thought

cigarette had no attractions for him
ttit h wanted to lie down and sleep so
was this desire that he decided

-	he must make a determined eflort to
 rr t- he threw away the cigarette
gan to walk briskly lie selected a
w lane which led through a copse of
 larch trees his choicc was influ-

yrtu

enced largely by the fact that thelane was
steeper than the road and he wanted to
do what he didnt feel inclined to he
urged himself forward the air was be-
coming very fresh and sweet and the birds
were singing gaily he began to think
about his book but nothing happened
the same old ideas still jumbled against
each other he crossed a stretch of com-
mon and caught a glimpse of blue distances 
he was certainly up in the surrey hills
an old man passed and touched his hat
david jerked out

   oh how do you do   in the tight
voice of a man who has been too long con-
fined to city life

  he passed a farm where a team of large
sleek horses were just returning to the
fields in cliarge of an old carter and a boy
david sighed and rested once more against
tlie farm-gate he was in bad condition
and yet there was something a little sooth-
ing in all this

  he went on suddenly the lane forked
again this time he took the lower turn-
ing because it seemed the more deserted
better attuned to his melancholy mood
he had not progressed more than four
hundred yards when he came to the dingle

  it nestled in the hollow of a disused
chalk-pit it was wild and overgrown
with shrubs gorse and delicate birch trees
he instinctively plunged into it the soil
was sandy fresh young green leaves
tickled his face and hair brambles caught
at his trousers he came to the carcase of
an old fallen tree partially covered with
moss and lichen he chose a part of the
stem where the bark had peeled away and
sat down

  it was extraordinarily quiet and remote
he had never felt so cut oft from the world
bees droned around him in the gorse the
little sound of birds and living thing un-
familiar to him soothed his senses the
sun streaming through the leaves made
bewildering patterns martins swung in
semicircles at the top of the pit

  it was    somehow cosy he sat with
his elbows dug into his knees and his hands
holding his head and examined the
activities of some red ants darting in and
out from iwncath the bark ol the tree he


hutchinsons story magazine

sat on he had an uncomfortable feeling
that the ants would get on to his trousers
or his coat and crawl all over him he
edged farther away and looked around
him again he felt like a small boy scent-
ing adventure but slightly nervous of the
unknown in this arabesque of sunlight
and foliage it was difficult to detach things
it was the kind of place that a small boy
could imagine the eyes of a tiger or a
rattlesnake or even-a red indian  he
would like to be a small boy again playing
at red indians with his sister hilda in the
garden at norwich his mothers slim
figure in the doorway   

   why should the father-confessor him-
 self not be the lover his secret hidden be-
 hind his dark cowl  why should he not
 tell the story  

  strange  but as david sat there blink-
 ing in the sunlight he could almost swear
 that a voice whispered this into his ear
 what did it mean  the father-confessor 
 why yes of course there was a father-
 confessor in the story  it had not
 occurred to him he was not thinking of
 his book but suddenly he began to think
 very rapidly the whole thing unfolded
 itself before his minds eye on those
 lines the story would be much more man-
 ageable the various themes began to co-
 ordinate his pulses were throbbing at
 an unaccustomed rate he could see it
 all the main idea became simple and
 dignified inevitable everything took its
 place his fingers itched to set it down 
 but he had not even a notc-book

  he sat there till the sun began to set
 and jio one disturbed him he glowed
 with a quiet contentment feeling himself
 tho medium of expression of forces greater
 than himself then when the light began
 to fade he rose up and shook himself

   queer he thought  that it should
 have come like that  of course it was
 nonsense my fancying i beard the voice
 im ridiculously run down i must do
 this more often

  he walked quickly down the hill hum-
ming to himself when he arrived borne
he snatched a hasty meal and then he sat
down to write he wrote all night

  he slept till the afternoon and awoke

still tingling with the sense of new-found
power thoughts came easily and had only
to be set down for nearly three week
he worked at pressure the story made
astounding progress

  and then another day came when the
feeling of emptiness and lassitude assailed
him he struggled through the day rest
less feverish and discontented h
wanted to go on but his brain seemd
disinclined to work on the other hand
in his anxiety to get the book finished be
resented having to waste a day in the
country wien night came he realisd
tliat he had accomplished nothing h
slept badly and rose at dawn

   i must go for another tramp 
thought he caught the earliest train ao
went to epsom he walked up to the
downs a light breeze was building up a
splendid architectural arrangement
clouds it was a glorious day he walked
and walked and walked sometimes
rested and began to think of his book
but no ideas came	f

    it will come as before quite suddenly
he determined  i feel better anyw
its foolish not to do this more often

   he walked till the evening occasional 
lying down by clumps of bushes leaning
on stiles and gates humming and-tryif
to think when it became time to go 
felt his limbs quivering with

exhaustion

but no progress -had been made with wj
work he returned borne disgruntled
crestfallen

  the next day he found himself n
better case he idled the day away 
issue of the book becoming more c
fused at the end of the week he
another desperate sortie on to the
and lanes still without result	 i

   it was not till the following wedqfcl
that he decided that he would once j
go back to the dingle it waa a grey
but tolerably warm he took the train
moblrtham-bythe-miu and started out
find the dingle he had some difficulty
doing this as he had made no note of
roads and turnings which he had
the previous occasion he wmdered 
came back and at length reoogn
little lane which skirted the chalk-p-

the dingle had lost its wild pattern of
ewilderirg sunlight and shadow it was
n a benign mood the air was tender
nd caressing the young trees nodded
 a companionable manner a rabbit
p rted from a hole in the sand stared at
with almost friendly eyes and then
pampered away among the bracken he
that he wanted to laugh he sat on
fallen tree and began to think of amus-
incidents of his boyhood all his pre-
t troubles were forgotten and then
uldenly something seemed to whisper in
is ear 

the fisherman goes from the east side
the river to the west from the west to

   	east is it only fish he carries in his
basket  

he started what was this strange in-
tosion  what fisherman  what bas-
 what river  what did it all
  his mind reverted instantly to
book fisherman  there was no

 character of fra lomberto  it
be possible  the analogy was

to work the ill-assorted arrange-
nts of ideas fell into a proper perspec-
a he visualised the working-up the
ejpnient of character and plot the

to a surprising finish the whole

 ver a month he worked uninter-
the book was finished and de-

spatched to a publisher who had shown an
interest in his work but it was not pub-
lished for six months in the meantime
he was at work on other things a play
some poems and essays and another novel
it was not till late in the autumn that he
became convinced that-for him in any
case-there was a genie of the dingle i

  for he tried the experiment again and
again and it never appeared to fail di-
rectly his creative power became stagnant
he took the train to moblesham and sought
his dingle sometimes the-little whispers
of the leaves were slower in their delivery
of the revelation than at other times but
they never utterly disappointed him on
occasions the illumination would not come
till he was returning from the dingle or
even till he went to bed that night

  one day he tried the experiment of writ-
ing in the dingle he took a writing-pad
and fountain-pen but the result was not
successful ideas came but not the
facility to set them dwn he was dis-
tracted by the sunlight and the movement
it did not appear to be within the cove-
nant of the high gods who presided over
this enchanted spot it was essentially a
place for inspiration for adjustment but
not for the deliberate prosecution of a
routine

  in the winter when the book was pub-
lished it happened to catch the eye of a
luminary in a little office off the strand
who foresaw the glories of a personal scoop
in  discovering  a young and unknown
writer he let hhnself go in a weekly
journal devoted to such things and be-
came maudlin over it in a large club in st
jamess it had no great sale but it at-
tained a succis destxme other works were
published and commented upon

  even in the winter he visited the dingle
when the trees were bare and there were
great squidgy pools of water he would still
go and plunge about humming to himself
laughing gaity feeling virile and joyous
and the little voice was always eloquent
he began to know every mound and tree
and shrub in the dingle and he watched
their growth and colour and peculiarity

  david was not a mystic he tried to
explain the whole thing to himself


hutchinsons story magazine

   there just something about thi
place thats sympathetic the walk is
good for me by the time i get here i am
feeling well they are not really voices i
hear only i like it its very beautiful
extraordinarily quiet and remote and then
the-combination-of things stimulates me
thats all to it but its very queer

  it was two years later that david met
the genie face to face he was becoming
a successful man already recognised as
being more than  promising  this
young author is going to count an-
nounced the delphic oracle of the literary
world he had moved to more commo-
dious rooms and had even bought an up-
right piano on which he groped his way to
vague satisfactions

  one day late in june he was sitting in
the dingle musing upon the strange in-
fluence it had exercised upon his fate
the dingle was in its wild patterned mood
the sunlight dancing through the leaves
he was staring idly at the quivering ap-
pearance of a stunted almond tree and
thinking how difficult it was in this effect
to separata one tone from another when
suddenly he became uncomfortably aware
that eyes were watching him through the
pattern

  he stood up and instantly a branch
quivered vertically and the genie sprang
lightly to the ground near his feet she
had bright puck-like eyes and an oval
elfish face framed in a mass of dark
brown hair a dark green fustian kind of
tunic and brown-stockinged legs she
said 

   oh i say  im awfully sorry  

  david stared at her foolishly and re-
echoed 

   im awfully sorry i 

  it was obvious that each felt that they
were prying into the privacy of the others
life

   i didnt see you till just now re-
marked the genie

   oh  i was only just sitting there
answered david limply

   its very jolly here said the genie

   do you live here   murmured the
rnystified young man

  then the surprising visitor from the

spirit-world laughed and shook her shining
hair and in the process displayed a line of
small and perfect teeth

   i do pretty nearly she answered
 i live down the road at that red house
its called  clonbeggan  for some reason
or othr i havent any brothers or sisteis
and i come here nearly every day 
fathers a doctor and hes always busy -
and my mothers in london

  she sat on her haunches on the sand
with her legs crossed facing him david
stared at her as though still doubtful o
her reality she was just a girl perhap
sixteen or seventeen the daughter of 
country doctor at least that was wh
she said but what was real and
imaginary in the dingle  he said huskily 
 you say you come here often  

   ive been here nearly every day 
years and years and years	

 strange that i have never seen yj
 why do you come to the dingle  j
david started he felt curiously alar
and self-conscious he looked down
his hands and coughed then lea
towards her he said 

   do you ask why i come  im a
an author i come to the dingle

cause-	p

  he paused and suddenly she leap
her feet and clapped her hands

   oh i know  i know i  she
m how lovely i 	j

  and shaking her roguish curls a
she darted away through the trees y
david stretched out his arms and c
after her  then realised that he was 
having rather ridiculously and sat 
after all it was quite simple a loniie
little girl living not far away she
here to play but why bad he  
her before  had she been watching   j
what did he mean when she  
know    and above all would b
her again 

  he returned home thinking of h 
nd the elfin-child her vwit had
brief and her movement  quick hf 
not had the opportunity to
he wanted to but she wa very 
ful very vital- goddess worthy 
dingle he was in an inspired 
stacy aumonifci

 next day and he began what proved to
 be his raost successful work an allegory
 called  he chalk pit

 he visited the dingle three times before
 ke saw his genie again and then one
 ay she slithered between the branches of
 the almond tree and threw herself on the
 ground by his feet he gave an exclama-
 tion and she said 

  well  

 -	he put out his hand but without touch-
 ing her he exclaimed 

  oh  it is you ive been looking for
 you

  ive seen you twice	

  why didnt you speak to me  

  you were working

  how do you know  

  i could tell by your face

     you queer child i tell me your name
  stella

  i love the name of stella

  rea me something youve written

  alas  ive nothing here

  tell me a story then

  david blinked at the sunshine real and
 aginary he smiled and wondered
 worshipped then suddenly he be-
 jj to tell her the story which he had not
 to ntcn- tle chalk pit he pieced it
 wther watching the jov and sorrow and
 fcpathy flicker across her sensitive lace
 n when he had finished it she was cry-
 and he said 

      tn sorry stella

 she did not look at him but she replied 
 no i like to cry its very beauti-
   and suddenly she snatched his
 and kissed it and walked away
 wrh the trees

 itr that she seemed bolder nearly
 me he visited the dingle she came
 	and he found- the place more

 jprinff and fruitful of ideas than ever
 n k	ummer he called

 father ir parson a rotund red-
 little man quite unlike his daughter
  courts but somewhat pre-
 he sat forward leaning on hi
 and asked david a few questions
 th u professional life he listened to
 without giving the impression
 they- had unk in a dog-cart was

waiting to take him on his rounds he
rose at the end of ten minutes and pressed
davids hand and murmured 

   very delighted    any time and
he waved his hand vaguely towards the
fireplace

  david heard afterwards from the vil-
lagers that dr parsons wife was a very
beautiful roumanian lady but thero
had been some great trouble they no
longer lived together she was in london
or paris and she never visited her husband
or child

  and in time david went beyond the
dingle he went for walks with stella and
sat in her garden under the walnut tree
and told her of his ambitions and his life
and his sister and his work and the people
he met in the social life which was gradu-
ally enveloping him

  for three years this strange friendship
grew and quickened and david was then
referred to as  this brilliant young author 
and his sister hilda in her placid home at
norwich blushed with pride and wealthy
people sought him out and publishers
began to jostle each other for his wares
and david was dazzled he was accom-
plishing what he had set out to accomplish
and all within the space of five years he
began to adore flattery and adulation was
food and wine to him

  there was only one disconcerting ele-
ment in this joyous scheme he encount-
ered it on the lawn of dr parsons house
it came in the person of ephraim barnes
ephraim barnes was a young keen-facerl
man of semitic origin he was a successful
builder and contractor who drove about
the country in his own car being cured
of a bad attack of sciatica by dr parsons
he had visited him and there of course
met stella stella showed him no special
attention bnt ephraim was persistent
keen and thorough and suddenly david
realised that he was jealous finding him
there on three successive occasions he took
his dingle-maiden to task

   stella are you fond ol this man f 

   no david

   not a bit  

   not a scrap he tywc me

   you would never marry him stella  


hutchinsons story magazine

   stella peeped at him coyly and remarked

   oh dear oh dear how foolishly you
talk i 

  on his way home david suddenly
thought

    good god  im in love with that girl 

  and he began to reason with tiimself
to be a  brilliant young author  and to
have arrived are two very different things
david was by no means well off he lived
above his income he found fashionable
house-parties far more expensive than
expensive hotels he ached to buy antique
furniture pictures to have a beautiful
house  and he could see no prospect of
attaining anything so fantastic his
palate for success had been whetted but
the banquet had not begun what was he
to do  he had seen the distressing re-
sults of some of his friends marrying when
they were not in a position to they went
down the sink they prostituted their
art in the sordid struggle they became
hemmed in by babies domestic troubles
and insistent material demands they
soon ceascd to count and yet-stella 
her eyes followed him through the dim
shadows of the night she was an obses-
sion an angel a nymph his genie of the
dingle

  he hesitated and did nothing he
visited her home and the dingle and he
drew inspiration from both he fumed
with jealousy at the sight of the unspeak-
able ephraim but the summer passed
and the winter and the position remained
the same

  and in the following spring he met laura
van steyn he met her at a house-party
at the frankinstein-possets the bond
street picture-dealera she was tall fair
rather distinguishod-looking very emo-
tional and gorgeously apparelled she
was a widow three years older than david
and enormously wealthy her husband
had been an american canned-fruit mag-
nate there was nothing of the canned
fruit about laura she was passionately
devoted to art and artists she devoted
her life to helping and hattering young
painters and musicians and writer she
did not spare herself with regard to david
she took liim aside under a pergola dark-

ened by clusters of blood-red rosea and
told him more by the heaving of her bosom
and her breathless intonation than by what
she said that he stood on the threshold of
being what george meredith thomas
hardy and others had tried to be and
david drank it in and realised that her
was a divinity little diamonds sparkled
at her throat a gold bag hung by a won-
drous antique chain nestled between the 
folds of silk upon her lap her skin was
incredibly fair and there was a watchful
beauty about her eyes as though she we
the high-priestess guarding the acerdotl
offerings of all that was more priceless and
forbidden in human life

  david walked with her and as he had
nothing else to flatter he flattered her
beauty and her intelligence bsfore tn
house-party broke up she invited him
visit her in town alas  poor stella

  followed then a year of doubt contri-
tion and dazzling dreams	
on the eve of the day when he marrd
laura she said 

   my darling you shall be the greatrf
writer in the world everything shall b
arranged for you in london you s
have the walnut-panelled room ovciwf
ing the park as your study  ami at fob
sham we will build a bungalow hidd 
right away in the woods where not a sou
shall disturb you but change changft
the great thing to a creative artist
understand the artist soul we will tra 
you shall have beautiful rooms to wr
at naples florence venice and	

always a change fresh experiences
people we will go to egypt and agn 
india and china  we will build a
of beauty around us collecting as wjj
adding to it studying finding more 
more in cach other kiss me david- 
they stayed two months at napl l a
villa overlooking the bay david
large study furnished with francois
furniture and persian rugs and a wltl 
desk reputed to have been the prptt
racine and for six hours a day be o
there staring at blank sheets of	i

reading over the things he had rt
last year sometimes he would
and look out of the window at the


stacy aumonier

 and other times he would bury his face in
 his hands and dream-of stella and the
 ngle he would visualise the last time
 he had visited her her laughing innocent
 eyes the chain of marigolds she had made
 and crowned him vflfch her babbling ex-
 crement over the things they were going
 t do together and o god  he had
 ever told her  his courage had failed
 him he was a coward and he could not
 think thoughts were going round and
 found and jumbling each other and there
 as no genie to set them right 

   he plunged into social dissipations he
 oght experiences to which he had been
 previously a stranger and he could do no-
 thing with them he told his wife he
 oold not work on his honeymoon and she
 as enchanted

   	there is no hurry mon brave she
      and they went to sicily

   they travelled from sicily to algiers
algiers to cairo then down the
qe as far as fashoda back from fashoda
cairo  crossed to genoa visited flor-
ce sienna and venice they stayed at
yeoice for two months in the hope that
would settle down to work by
time he had realised that his wife was
jlow and superficial all her enthusiasms
r froth bubbling on the stream she
it always flying off at a tangent being
rriel away by some new mood or fashion
covering some new genius she became
stated that david did not produce new
interesting work she tired a little
i 	he found her dull and their

       fccre filled with great emptiness

e venice he did no work and one day

	 told her about the dingle she list-
apathetically and did not seem to
rderstand when he had finished she

 jd

how peculiar i now my dear we

 yllla

 to bonlighera my sister has a
np in the hills and she has written
y offered to lend it me venice is too
ptrcting at bordighera it is quiet

oh so restful there yon will feel

trained to work ray love

 m he crossed the peninsula and took up
hwi abodt at th vua gmplrri bt brdi-
jt waa indeed a glorious spot

nestling in the hills a garden overflowing
with clematis passion-flowers and roses
and an avenue of cypresses pointing to tho
sea for some days david enjoyed the
garden and he sat at the open window of
his study biting the end of his pen and
then the mood of remorse and dissatisfac-
tion again assailed him he wandered
aimlessly about the country and spoke
bitterly laura sought other company
and had no difficulty in finding it along
this gay and alluring coast she left him
to his own devices one night at dinner
he made another reference to the dingle
and she turned on him and said bitingly

   oh that dingle i why do you always
talk of that dingle  

  and david pushed his plate away and
walked out of the room and out of the
villa he walked bareheaded up into the
hills his heart overflowed with angry and
disturbed feelings he strode along quickly
and his breath came in little stabs between
his nostrils at length he returned and
went straight into the salon where laura
was arranging masses of blue delphinium
in a tall vase without any preliminary
explanation lie bore down on her

   ill tell you why he almost shouted
 in every mans life there is a dingle
do you understand what i mean  a
dingle a dingle a dingle i some place
that is just his and no others its the
environment he must have or hes no
good you cant explain it he cant
explain it its what his soul demands
and nothing else will serve it may be a
room in a slum a side-chapel in a cathe-
dral a clearing in a forest a set of con-
ditions the touch of a friends hands-
almost anything it may be but it must be
jnst that nothing else is any good to
him one has to be loyal to ones dingle
or    one is finished i 

  he picked up an embroidered mat from
a side table and scrunched it in his hands

   ive not been true    ive deserted
my dingle and im lost i  he buried his
facc in his hands  o god  we cant
help it  were made like that  

  by the door laura turned her bps
were white she said quite calmly

   you fool i

  five days later david stroud arrived in
london he stayed the night at his old
rooms in west kensington his ace was
drawn and thin and dark rings encircled
his eyes but there was a buoyancy and
hope about his bearing

  in the morning he awoke refreshed he
caught an early train to mobleham-by-
the-mill it was april and little clusters
of primroses peeped at him from the
hedges his heart was beating rapidly
stella  would she be in the dingle  was
she still there  did she think of him 
would she understand  could he ever
get back to the old position 

  at the turning where the lane forked he
was disturbed to find a large red-brick
house he muttered curses on the ac-
tivities of speculating builders and plunged
down the lane he had not advanced
two hundred yards when he suddenly
stopped he felt he was going to swoon
he staggered to a gate and supported him-
self beads of perspiration streamed down
his face

   its finished he said hoarsely
 everything is finished i 

  an iron gallery crossed the road great
chimneys and cranes stood out against the
sky a wooden fence shut off what once
had been the dingle above the top of it
he could see a wilderness of corrugated
iron and white chalk smoke and corrup-
tion a steam-navvy was puffing noisily
figures were coming and going whilst
standing out insolently at an angle to the
road was a large slate-coloured board on
which was painted  ephraim barnes 
co lime and cement merchants

  david clung to the gate he had diffi-
culty in getting his breath an old woman
who came hobbling down the lane stopped
and said 

   are you sick mister  is anything
awry  

  he shook himself nervously and jerked
out

    no no thank you its all rigat

  its muggy for the time of year y
 marked the old lady

 david was struggling to keep himself
 hand he controlled his voice as be re-
 plied 

  yes can you bll me madam
 lives at the red-brick house at te
 corner  

 she turned her old face in the direction
 he was looking and answered 

  ay mr barnes isself and is family
 lives there

  oh  could you tell me    whom did
 mr barnes marry  

  mr barnes  oo-e married old dr-
 parsons daughter

  is-she-still-there  	i

   ay she do that shes expecting a chil-j
  they say shes a hard woman thougb-
  hard  stella 	i

  how do you mean shes hard  

  eh they doant like er about tbes
 parts shes too quiet sullen bitter-likc-
 she never talks to us cottage-folk nor t
 no one else they say they say her m
 her good man make them lime-works
 the dingle some whimsey or other she
 very queer-like they say its pay j
 though hand over fist e makes a  
 money do mr barnes	

   its finished    its all finished
  gasped david

  pardon sir  

  its all right i beg your pard
 thank you very much	 

 the strange young man lowered his b 
 and walked rapidly away	 i

 the old lady shook her bead  d
 perhaps she murmured  a plesa
 looking young man too

 but david was only speaking the - j
 it was finished so relenuesa are the g
 who preside over these mysterious conw
 and goings tliat if you look through mo
 or any publishers trade-catalogue 
 will find that no work by david stroo
 ever bcn published since thr- chttm
 attained so conspicuous a success

 captain hugh drummond

dso mc late of his majestys
royal loamslurcs was whistling in
morning bath being by nature o
cheerful disposition the symptom did
sr urpnse servant late private of
arae famous regiment who was laying
kfast in an adjoining room

  vfter a while the whistling ceased and
li musical gurgle of escaping water
rouncr-l tliat the concert was over it
fj	signal for james denny- the
bhwd ex-batman-to lisappear
ue back regions anl get from his wife
kidneys and bacon which that most
cment woman ltad grilled to a turn
ct- on this particular morning the in
routine was broken james
seemed preoccupied distrait
or twice he scratched his head
 w out of the window with a puzzled

tet- and each time alter a brui survey

turned back again to the breakfast table
with a grin

  whats you looking for james denny  
the irate voice of his wife at the door made
him look round guiltily  them kidneys
is ready and waiting these five minutes

  her eyes fell on the table and she ail-
vanced into the room wiping her hands on
her apron

   did you ever sec such a bunch of
letters   she said

   forty-five returned her husband
grimly  and more t come he picked
up the newspaper lying beside the chair
and opened it out

   thems the roult of that he con-
tinued cryptically indicating a paragraph
with a sqnare unger and thrusting the
paper under his wifes nose

   demobilised officer she read slowly
 finding peace incredibly tedious would
welcome diversion legitimate if pos-
sible  but crimc if of a comparatively
humorous description ao objection ex-
citement essential would be prepared
to consider permanent job if suitably

  she put down the paper on a chair and
stared first at her husband and then at
the rows of letters neatly arranged on
the table

   i calls it wicked she announced at
length  fair flying in the face of provi-
dence crime denny-crime dont you
get aving nothing to do with such mad
pranks my man or you and me will be
haviug words she shook an admonitory
finger at him and retired slowly to the
kitchen in the days of his youth james
denny had been a bit wild and there was
a look in his eyes this morning-the sus-
picion of a glint-which recalled old
memories

  a moment or two later hugh drummond
came in slightly under six feet in height
he was broad in proportion his best
friend would not have called him good-
looking but he was the fortunate possessor
of that cheerful type of ugliness which
inspires immediate ceufidence in its owner
his nose had never quite recovered from
the final one year in the public schools
heavy weights his mouth was not small
in fact to be strictly accurate only his
eyes redeemed his face from being what is
known in the vernacular as the frozen limit

  deep-set and steady with eyelashes
that many a woman had envied they
showed the man ur what he was-a
sportsman and a gentleman and the
combination of the two is an unbeatable
production

  he paused as he got to the table and
glanced at the rows of letters his servant
pretending to busy himself at the other end
of the room was watching him surrepti-
tiously and noted the grin which slowly
spread over drummonds face as he picked
up two or three and examined the en-
velopes

   who would have thought it james  
he remarked at length  great scot
i shall have to get a partner

  with disapproval showing in every line
of her lace mrs denoy entered the room
carrying the kidneys and drummond
glanced at her with a smile

   good morning mrs denny he said

 wherefore this worried look on yoar
face  has that reprobate james bee
misbehaving himself  

  the worthy woman snorted  he ha
not sir-not yet leastwise and if so t
that he does-her eyes travelled p
and down the back of the hapless denny
who was quite unnecessarily pulling books
ofl shelves and putting them back again-
 if so be that he does she continue
grimly  him and me will have words-
as ive told him already this morning-
sho stalked from the room after staring
pointedly at the letters in drummond
hand and the two men looked at ae
another

   its that there reference to cri
sir thats tom it said denny in a hoars
whisper

   thinks im going to lead you astry
does she ames  	 

  hugh helped himself to bacon 
dear fellow she can think what she h
so long as she continues to grill 
like this your wife is a treasure j
-a pearl amongst women  and yofl
tell her so with my love he was pef
the first envelope and suddenly lie lo y
up with a twinkle in his eyes 
set her mind at rest he remarked
 you might tell her that as far as
see at present i shall only undert
murder in exceptional cases

  he propped the letter up
toast-rack- and commenced his break

 dont go james  with a slight
he was studying the typewritten 

 im certain to want your advice be 
long though not over this one   j
does not appeal to me-not at
assist messrs jones  jones w 
business is to advance money on   a
hand alone to obtain fresh clie
form of amusement which leave me
the waste-paper basket ple-ic j 
tear the effusion up and we will p
to the next

  he looked at the mauve cnrtarlc
doubtfully and examined tlie p  oq
where is pudlmgton james  an-
might almost ask-why i

no town has any right to such an 
he glanced through th

   name

he paused as he go to ble

tbe wife of the hank manager too -

conceive of anything so dreadful 
 afraid mr bank manager is a
t  distinct puss its when they get

fcrnd tore up the letter and
wio   piecr into the basket beside
tn he turned to his servant snd

 co  m  rnainder of the envelope

  them james while i
   tle kidneys and pick two or three
  i ee that you will have to

 and glanced at the row of letters

become my secretary no man could
tacklc that little bunch alone

    do you want me to open them air 
 asked denny doubtfully

    yoov hit it james-hit it in one
 classify them for me in groups criminal 
 sporting amatory-that means of or
 pertaining to lovo stupid and merely
 boring  and as a last resort miscellaneous
 he stirred his eoflee thoughtfully  i
 feel that as a first venture in our new
 career-ours i said james-love appeals
 to me irresistibly find me a damsel
 in distress a beautiful girl helpless tn
 the dutches of knaves let me feel that


hutchinsons story magazine

i can fly to her succour clad in my new
grey suiting

  he finished the last piece of bacon and
pushed away his plate  amongst all
that mass of paper there must surely be
one from a lovely maiden james at
whose disposal i can place my rusty sword
incidentally what has become of the
damned thing  

   its in the lumber-room sir-tied up
with the old hurnbrella and the niblick
yon dont like

   great heavens  is it   drum-
mond helped himself to marmalade
 and to think that i once pictured myself
skewering huns with it do you think
anybody would be mug enough to buy it
james  

   but that worthy was engrossed in a letter
he had just opened and apparently failed
to hear the question a perplexed look
was spreading over his facc and suddenly
he sucked his teeth loudly it was a sure
sign that james was excited and though
drummond had almost cured him of this
distressing habit he occasionally forgot
himself in moments of stress

  his master glanced up quickly and re-
moved the letter from his hands  im
surprised at you james he remarked
severely  a secretary should control
itself dont forget that the perfect
secretary is an it an automatic machine
-a thing incapable of feeling   

  he read the letter through rapidly and
then turning back to the beginning he
read it slowly through again

   my dear box xio-i dont know
whether your advertisement was a joke

i suppose it must have been but i
read it this morning and its just possible
xio just possible that you mean it
and if you do youre the man i want i
can offer you excitcment and probably
crime

   im up against it xio for a girl
ive bitten off rather more than i can chew

i want help-badly will you come to
the carlton for tea to-morrow afternoon 

i want to have a look at you and soe if
i think you are genuine wear a white
flower in your buttonhole

  drummond laid the letter down and

pulled out his cigarette-case  to
morrow james he murmured  that
is to-day-this very afternoon verily

i	believe that we have impinged upon the
goods he rose and stood looking olt
of the window thoughtfully  go out
my trusty fellow and buy me a daisy
or a cauliflower or something white

   you think it genuine sir  
james thoughtfully

  his master blew out a cloud of smoke-
 i know it is he answered dreamily-
 look at that writing  the decision
it-the character shell be mediurn
height and dark with the sweetest little
nose and mouth her colouring jartlcs

will be-

  but james had discreetly left the roo-

ii

  at four oclock exactly hugh drutnnl
stepped out of his two-seater at the hf
market entrance to the carlton a wbf
gardenia was in his buttonhole  his
auit looked the last word in cxcv
tailoring for a few moments after elf
ing the hotel he stood at the top of
stairs outside the dining-room
his eyes travelled round the tables n 
lounge below

  a brother-officer evidently taking
country cousins round london nd
resignedly a woman at whose h 
he had danced several times smile
him but save for a courteous
took no notice slowly and thoroug 
he continued his search it was 
of course yet and she might no
arrived but he was taking no chances-
suddenly his eyes ceased
and remained fixed on a table at
end of the lounge half hidden he 
a plant a girl was seated alone and 
moment she looked straight at  
then with the faintest suspicion
smile she turned away and cataf
drumming on the table with her

 the table next to her was	

and drummond made his way	oi

and sat dowm it was character
the man that he dhl not hesitaw 
once made up his mind to g

coiled over her ears from nnder a small
black hat he glanced at her feet-being
an old stager she was perfectly shod
he glanced at her hands and noted with
approval the absence of any ring then
he looked once more at her face and
found her eyes were fixed on him

she nodded as if satisfied are

  thing he was in the habit of going
loking neither to the right hand nor
 left which incidentally was how
 d s but tba  kping
ik y  anothcr tory

     lelt not tlie slightest doubt in his
this was the girl who had
v n bim and having given an order
 waiter he startcl to study her face
obtrusively as possible he could
profile but that was quite
lul o make him blem the moment
a j than anything else
lr hn advertisement to the paper
j	be could see were very blue

masse of golden brown hair

you prepared to risk your life 

  this time she did not look away she
seemed to think that it was her turn to
conduct the examination and drummond
turned to his tea while the scrutiny con-
tinued he poured himself oat a cup
and then fumbled in his waistcoat pocket
after a moment he found what he wanted
and taking out a card he propped it against
the teapot so that the girl could see what
was on it in large block capitals he
had written box xio then he added
milk and sugar and waited

  she spoke almost at once  youll
do xio she said and ho turned to her
with a smile

    its very nice of you to ay so h

 
hutchinsons story magazine

murmured  if i may i will return the
compliment so will you

  she frowned slightly  this isnt
foolishness you know what i said in
my letter is literally true

   which makes the compliment even
more returnable he answered  if i
am to embark on a life of crime i would
sooner collaborate with you than-shall
wo say-that earnest eater over there
with the tomato in her hat

  he waved vaguely at the lady in question
and then held out his cigarette-case to the
girl  turkish on this side-virginian
on that he remarked  and as i appear
satisfactory will you tell me who im
to murder  

  with the unlighted cigarette held in
her fingers she stared at him gravely
 i want you to tell me she said at length
and there was no trace of jesting in her
voice  tell me on your word of honour
whether that advertisement was bona fide
or a joke

  he answered her in the same vein
 it started more or less as a joke it
may now be regarded as absolutely genu-
ine

  she nodded as if satisfied  are you
prepared to risk your life  

 drummonds eyebrows went up and
then he smiled  granted that the induce-
ment is sufficient he returned slowly
 i think that i may say that i am

  she nodded again  you wont be
asked to do it in order to obtain a half-
penny bun she remarked  if youve
a match i would rather like a light
drummond apologised  our talk on
trivialities engrossed me for the moment
he murmured he held the lighted match
for her and as he did so he saw that she
was staring over his shoulder at some one
behind his back

   dont look round she ordered  and
tell me your name quickly

   drummond-captain drummond late
of the loamshire ho leaned back m
his cbair and lit a cigarette himself

   and are you going to henley this
year   her voice was a shade louder
than before

   i dont know he answered casually

 i may run down for a day possibly-

but-	-j

   my dear phyllis said a voice behind
his back  this is a pleasant surprise
had no idea that you were in london

  a tall clean-shaven man stopped besid
the table throwing a keen glance
drummond

   the world is full of such surprise
isnt it   answered the girl lightly
dont suppose you know captain dou
mond do you  mr lakington-art co
nomeur and-er-collector

  the two men bowed slightly and
lakington smiled  i do not rcmetnbe
ever having heard my harmless pastij
more concisely described he rnnar
suavely  are you interested in so
matters  

   not very im afraid answel
drummond  just recently i have bfj
rather too busy to pay much attend
to art	w

  the other man smilod again and 
struck hugh that rarely if ever had
seen such a cold merciless face -

   of course youve been in franc-
lakington murmured  unfortunately
bad heart kept me on this side of the watj
one regrets it in many ways-regret
immensely sometimes i cannot
thinking how wonderful it must bave
to be able to kill without fear of cfl
quences there is art in lolling cajj
drummond-profound art and a vtt
know phyllis he turned to thepyjj
 i have always been greatfy attra- c
by anything requiring the artistic tottc 
he looked at his watch and bighed  a 
i must tear myself away are vn
turning home this evening  

  the girl who had been glancing round
restaurant shrugged her shoulders 
bably she answered  i havent q 
decided  might stop with aunt	

 fortunate aunt kate with  
turned awav and

lakington turned away am -
the glass drummond watched	s

his hat and stick from the cl
then lie looked at the girl and n
that she had gone a little white

  whats the matter old thing f

she shook her head and gradually the
lour came back to her face  im
uite all right she answered  it gave
rather a shock that man finding us
liere

   on the face of it it seems a harmless
pupation said hugh

 on the face of it psrhaps she said
bit that man doesnt deal with iaco
with a short laugh she turned
youve stumbled right into
middle of it my friend - rather sooner

     i	anticipated that is one of the
     you will probably have to kill  

i i companion lit another cigarette

is nothing like straightforward
our he grinned  except that i
m z  tac anc his manner i must
that i saw norhing about him to
my going to so much trouble
jt s his particular worry  

	and foremost the brute wants

  knarry me replied the girl
iloathe being obvious said hugh
t am not surprised

but it isnt that that matters she
n  i wouldnt marrv him even
ve my life she looked at drum-
i phetly  henry lakington b the
most dangerous man in england
-jonly the sccond murmured hugh
k  hadnt i better start mv new career
 iim  

     looked at him in silence  i
you think that im hysterical
pjarked after a while  youre
jjj	even wondering whether im

hmemond flicked the ah from his
sc then he turned to her dis-
pwy  yon must admit he re-
 that up to now our conversation
proceeded along conventional

hm  m a complete stranger to you 
fcj jr man who is a complete stranger
 peaks to you while were at tea
lrirm me that i shall probably
llw fall him in the near future the
 nt i i think you will agree a

rew back her bead and laughed
    yoo poor young man the
put that way it docs sound

alarming then she grew serious again
 theres plenty of time for you to back
out now if you like just call the waiter
and ask for my bill well say goodbye
and the incident will finish

  she was looking at him gravely as she
spoke and it seemed to her companion
that there was an appeal in the big blue
eyes and they were very big  and the
face they were set in was very charming
-especially at the angle it was tilted at
in the half-light of the room altogether
drummond reflected a most adorable girl
and adorable girls had always been a
hobby of his probably lakington pos-
sessed a letter of hers or something and
she wanted him to get it back of course
he would even if he had to thrash the
swine to within an inch of his life

   well   the girlsvoioe cut into his
train of thought and he hurriedly pulled
himself together

   the last thing i want is for the in-
cident to finish he said fervently  why
-its only just begun

   then youll help me  

   thats what im here for with a
smile drummond lit another cigarette
 tell me all about it

   the trouble she began after a
moment  is that there is not very much
to tell at present it is largely guess-
work and guess-work without much of
a clue however to start with i had
better tell you what sort of men too are
up against firstly henry lakington
-the man who spoke to me he was i
believe one of the most brilliant vrientist
who has ever been up at oxford there
was nothing in his own line which would
not have been open to him had he run
straight but he didnt he deliber-
ately chose to turn his brain to crime
not vulgar common sorts of crime-but
the big things calling for a master criminal
he has always had enough money to
allow him to take his time over any coup
-to pcrfcct his details and thats what
lie loves he regards a crime a an ordinary
man regards a complicated bmines deal-
a thing to be looked at and studied from
all angles a thing to be treated as a mathe-
matical problem he is quite utucrapu-

x

lous he is only concerned in pitting
himself against the world and winning

   an engaging fellah said hugh

  what particular form of crime does he
favour  

   anything that calls for brain iron
nerve and refinement of detail she
answered  principally up to date bur-
glary on a big scale and murder

   my dear soul   said hugh incre-
dulously  how can you be sure  and
why dont you tell the police  

  she smiled wearily  because ive got
no proof and even if i had   she gave
a little shudder and left her sentence un-
finished  but one day my father and i
were in his house and by accident i got
into a room id never been in before it
was a strange room with two large safes
let into the wall and steel bars over the sky-
light in the coiling there wasnt a win-
dow and the floor seemed to be made of
concrete and tbe door was covered with
curtains and was heavy to move-almost
as if it was steel or irdn on the desk in
the middle of the room lay some miniatures
and without thinking i picked them up
and looked at them i happen to know
something about miniatures and to my
horror i recognised them she paused
for a momeut as a waiter went by their
table

   do youremember the theft i the cele-
brated vatican miniatures belonging to the
duke of melbourne  

  drummond nodded  he was beginning
to feel interested

   they were the ones i was holding in
my hand she said quietly  i knew
them at once from the description in the
papers and just as i was wondering
what on earth to do the man himself walked
into the room

   awkward-deuced awkward drum-
mond pressed out his cigarette and leaned
forward expectantly  what did he
do 

   absolutely nothing said the girl

	thats what made it so awful

    admiring my treasures he remarked

 pretty things arent they   i couldnt
speak a word  i just put them back on the
table

    wonderful copies he went on 
the duke of melbournes lost miniatures-
i think they would deceive most people-
  they deceived me i managed
get out	 j

  did they   he said  the
who painted them will be flattered

   all the time he was staring at mu-
coid merciless stare that seemed to
my brain then he went over to one 
the safes and unlocked it  come bej
miss benton he said  there are a
more-copies

   i only looked inside for a moment 

i have never seen or thought of sue
sight beautifully arranged on black 
vet shelves were ropes of pearls a gors
diamond tiara and a whole heap of  j
uncut stones and in one corner i
a glimpse of tbe most wonderful 
chaliced cup-just like the one for 
samuel levy the jew moneylender
still offering a reward then he shut t
door and locked it and again stared at
in silence

   all copics he said quieuv 
derful copies and should you eveof
tempted to think otherwise-ask 
father miss benton be warned by
dont do anything foolish ask your fa
first 	  i

   and did you   asked drumfflobd 
she shuddered  that very evening
she answered  and daddy flew t
frightful passion and told me never 
dare to meddle in things that didn t
cern me again then gradually  
went on i realised that lakingto 
some hold over daddy-that he d b rg
father in his power daddy-of all  
-who wouldnt hurt a fly  the bea 
dearest man who ever breathed- 
hands were clenched and her breast
and fell stormily

  drummond waited for her to
herself before he spoke again-
mentioned murder too be remark

rooi-



 she nodded  ive got no
 but there was a man called george

said  less even than over thfi

 

and one evening when lakiatf 
dining with us i heard hun disc
man with daddy
sapper cyril mcneile

  hes got to go said lakington
 hes dangerous  

 and then my father got up and closed
door  but i heard them arguing for

half

an hour three weeks later a coroners
lry found that george dringer had com-
butted suicide while temporarily insane
he same evening daddy for the first
in his life went to bed the worse for

lrink

 the girl fet silent and drummond
 ptted at the orchestra with troubled eyes
 things seemed to be rather deeper than he
 anticipated

 then there was another case she
speaking again  do you remember
bat man who was found dead in a rail-
y-carriage at oxhey station hr was
f italian-giuseppe by name  and the
iuty brought in a verdict of death from
tural causes a month before he had
 interview with lakington which took
at our house  because the italian
a stranger came to the wrong place
lakington happened to be with us at
c time the interview finished with a
fful quarrel she turned to drum-
qnd with a slight smile  not much
jdencc is there  only i know laking-
ejj murdered him i kr it you may
dk im fanciful-imagining things  you
think im exaggerating i dont mind
you do-because you wont for long

 drummond did not answer immediately
gainst his saner judgment he was begin-
to be profoundly impressed andat
p moment he did not quite know what
 ay that the girl herself firmly be-
in what she was telling him he was
i	 the point was how much of it was

c she herself expressed it-fanciful

siaation

    what about this other man   he
    at length

 can tell you very little about him

nawered  he came to the elms-

u   the name of lakingtons house-
months ago he is about medium
iujt and rather thick-set clean-shaven

thick brown hair flecked slightly with

 -	his forehead is broad and his eyes

l srt of cold grey-blue but it hi
that terrify me theyre large and

white and utterly ruthless she turned
to him appealingly  oh  dont think
im talking wildly she implored  he
frightens me to death-that man  far far
worse than lakington he would stop
at nothing to gain his ends and even lak-
iagton himself knows that mr peterson is
his master

   peterson   murmured drummond
 it seems quite a sound old english name

  the girl laughed scornfully  oh  the
name is sound enough if it was his real
one as it is its about as real as his
daughter

   there is a lady in the case then  

   by the name of irma said the girl
briefly  she lies on a sofa in the garden
and yawns shes no more english than
that waiter

  a faint smile flickered over her com-
panions face  he had formed a fairly
vivid mental picture of irma then he
grew serious again

   and what is it that makes you think
theres mischief ahead  he asked abruptly

  the girl shrugged her shoulders  what
the novelists call feminine intuition i
suppose she answered  that-and my
father she said the last words very
low  he hardly ever sleeps at night now
i hear him pacing up and down his room
-hour after hour hour after hour oh 
it makes me mad    dont you under-
stand  ive just got to find out what the
trouble is ive got to get him away from
those devils before he breaks down com-
pletely

  drummond nodded and looked away
the tears were bright in her eyes and
like every englishman he detested a scene
while she had been speaking he had made
up his mind what course to take and
now having outsat everybody else lie de-
cided that it was timo for the interview
to cease already an early diner was
having a cocktail while lakington might
return at any moment and if there was
anything in what she had told him it
struck him that it would be as well for
that icentleman not to find them still to-
gether

   i think he said  wed better go
my address is oa half moon street  my


hutchinsons story magazine

telephone  mayfair if anything hap-
pens if ever you want me-at any hour of
the day or night-ring me up or write if
im not in loave a message with my ser-
vant denny he is absolutely reliable
the only other thing is your own address

   the larches near godalming an-
swered the girl as they moved towards the
door  oh  if you only knew the glori-
ous relief of feeling ones got some one to
turn to    she looked at him wiib
shining eyes and drummond felt his pulse
quicken suddenly imagination or not
so far as her fears were concerned the girl
was one of the loveliost things he had ever
seen

   may i drop you anywhere   he asked
as they stood on the pavement but she
shook her head

   no thank you ill go in that taxi
she gave the man an address and stepped
in while hugh stood bareheaded by the
door

   dont forget he said earnestly  any
time of the day or night and while i
think of it-were old friends can that
be done  in case i come and stay you
see

  she thought for a moment and then
nodded her head  all right she an-
swered  weve met a lot in london
during the war

  with a grinding of gear wheels the taxi
drove off leaving hugh with a vivid pic-
ture imprinted on his mind ot blue eyes
and white teeth and a skin like the bloom
of a sun-kissed peach

  for a moment or two he stood staring
after it and then he walked across to his
own car with his mind still full oi the
interview he drove slowly along piccadilly
while every now and then he smiled grimly
to himself was the whole tiling an ela-
borate hoax  was the girl even now
chuckling to isreaf at his gullibility  if
so the game had only just begun and he
had no objection to a few more rounds with
such an opponent a mere tea at the
carlton could hardly be the full extent of
the jest    and somehow deep down
in his mind he wondered whether it was a
joke-whether by some freak of fate he
had stumbled on one of those strange mys-

teries which up to date he had regarded

as existing only in the realms of shilling
shockers

  he turned into his rooms and stood 
front of the mantelpiece taking off w
gloves it was as he was about to
them down on the table that an envelop
caught his eye addressed to him in 
unknown handwriting mechanically 
picked it up and opened it inside was
single half-sheet of notepaper on which 
few lines had been written in a small nea
hand

   there are more things in heaven

earth yonng man than a capability to
steak and onions and a desire for
ture i imagine that you possess bo
and they are useful assets in the secos
locality mentioned by the poet in
ven however one never knows-espec
with regard to the onions bo careful-
drummond stood motionless for a
ment with narrowed eyes then
leaned forward and pressed the bell sa
 who brought this note james
quieuy as his servant came into the
 a small boy sir said i was to 
sure and sec you got it most partictm
he unlocked a cupboard near the win 
and produced  tantalus  whisky

carefully folded the sheet of pp
placed it in his pocket and his face 
took the drink from his man would

   james denny supplied the deficiency
 otn a dish that was standing on an electric
 atater

are you going for long sir   he

 matured

   	i dont know james it all depends
 circumstances which when you come
 think of it is undoubtedly one of the
 fatuous phrases ia the english
 jjguage is there anything in the world
  doesnt depend on circumstances  
 will you be motoring sir or going
 train   asked james prosaically dia-
 ctical arguments did not appeal to him

    by car answered drummond  py-
 jaas and a tooth-brush

  you wont take evening clothes sir  
 no i want my visit to appear un-
 litated james and if one goes about
 pletely encased in boiled shirts while
 tenduig to be merely out for the after-
 ra people have doubts as to ones

   james digested this great thought in
 uce

 will you be going far sir   he asked
 jth pouring out a second cup ol cottee
 to godalming a charmiug spot i
 though ive never been there
 niir inhabitants too james the
 v i met yesterday at the carlton lives

  deed sir murmured james non-
 bpfttally

 damned old humbug laughed
  you know youre itching
 all about it i had a very long
 jtij westing talk with her and one of
 things emerges quite clearly from
 caverstion either james i arn a
 cital idiot and dont know enough
 out of the rain  or weve hit

 that  wbat  i  
 y tny little excursion either our
 iu my friend arr being pulled till thoy

s -

 ejtltr are a lot more answers in this
 if denny made a movement
 letters he had been sorting
 kom a lovely widow with two

   lovely cried drummond  how
forward of her   he glanced at the
letter and smiled  care james and
accuracy are essential in a secretary
the misguided woman calls herself lonely
not lovely she will remain so as far
as i am concerned until the other matter
is settled

   will it take long sir do you think  
 to get it settled   drummond lit
a cigarette and leaned back in his chair
 listen james and i will outline the
case the maiden lives at a house called
the larches near godalming with her
papa not far away is another house
called the elms owned by a gentleman
of the name of henry lakington-a
nasty man james with a nasty face-
who was also at the carlton yesterday
afternoon for a short time and now
we come to the point miss benton-
that is ihe ladys name-accuses mr
lakington of being the complete it in
the criminal line she wont even so far
as to say that he was the second most
dangerous man in england

   indeed sir more coflee sir  

   will nothing move you james   re-
marked his master plaintively  this
man murders people and does things like
that you know

   personally sir i prefer a picture-
palace but i suppose there aint no
accounting for obbies may  clear away
sir  

   no james not at present keep
quite still wliilc  go on or i shall get it
wrong threo months ago there arrived
at the elms the most dangerous man in
england-the it of its this gentleman
goes by the name of peterson and he
owns a daughter from what miss
benton said i have doubts about that
daughter james he rose and strolled
over to the window  grave doubt
however to return to the point it appear
that some unpleasuig conspiracy is being
hatched by it the it of its and the
doubtful daughter into which papa
benton has been unwillingly drawn as
far as i can make out the suggestion is
that i should uuravcl the tangled skein
of crime and extricate papa


hutchinsons story magazine

   in a spasm of uncontrollable excitement
james sucked his teeth  lumme it
wouldnt alf go on the movies would it  
he remarked  better than them red
indians and things

   i fear james that you are not in
the habit of spending your spare time at
the british museum as i hoped said
drummond  and your brain doesnt
work very quickly the point is not
whether this hideous affair is better than
red indians and things-but whether
its genuine am i to battle with mur-
derers or shall i find a house-party roaring
with laughter on the lawn  

    as long as you laughs like ell yourself
sir i dont see as ow it makes much
odds answered james philosophically

    the first sensible remark youve made
this morning said his master hopefully
 i will go prepared to laugh

  he picked up a pipe from thmantel-
piece and proceeded to fill it while james
denny still waited in silence

   a lady may ring up today drum-
snond continued  miss benton to be
cxact dont say where ive gone if she
does  but take down any message and
wire it to me at godalming post office
if by any chance you dont hear from me
for three days get in touch with scotland
yard and tell em where ive gone that
covers everything if its genuine if on
the other hand its a hoax and the house-
party is a good one i shall probably want
you to come down with my evening clothes
and some more kit

   very good sir  will clean yom
small colt revolver at once

  hugh drummond paused in the act of
lighting his pipe and a grin spread slowly
over his face  excellent he said
 and see if you can find that water-
squirt pistol i used to have-a son of a
gun they called it that ought to raise
a laugh when i arrest the murderer with
it

ii

   the  hp twocatcr made abort work
of the run to godalming under the
dickey seat behind lay a small bag con-
taining the bare ncccssaries for the night

and as drummond thought of the two gun
rolled up carefully in his pyjamas-tbe
harmless toy and the wicked little auto-
matic-he grinned gently to himself
the girl had not rung him up during tbe
morning and after a comfortable lunch
at his club he had started about three
oclock the hedges fresh with the glory
of spring flashed past the smell of the
country came sweet and fragrant on the
air there was a gentle warmth a balm
ness in the day that made it good to be
alive and once or twice he sang under hi
breath through sheer lightheartedness 
spirit surrounded by the peaceful beauty
of the fields with an occasional villa
half hidden by great trees from under
which the tiny bouses peeped out 
seemed impossible that crime could exist
-laughable of course the thing was 
hoax an elaborate leg-pull but being 
guilty of any mental subterfuge h
drummond admitted to himself q
truly that he didnt care a damn if
was phyllis benton was at liberty
continue the jest wherever and whenev
she liked phyllis benton was a very n-e
girl and very nice girls are permitted
lot of latitude	-

  a persistent honking behind arouse
him from his reverie and he palled
the side of the road under ncrt
circumstances he would have let his 
car out and as she could touch
with ease he very rarely found hi
passed but this afternoon he felt d
inclined to race  he wanted to go que 
and think blue eyes and that
colouring were a dangerous combina-
-distinctly dangerous most engro
to a healthy bachelors thoughts	

 an open cream-coloured rolls-r
drew level with five people on bo
and he looked up as it passed
were three people in the back-two
and a woman and for a moment
met those of the man nearest him- 
they drew ahead and drummond pu
up to avoid the thick cloud of dust

  with a slight frown he stared at 
retreating car  he saw the man lean
and speak to the other man  he 
nthpr man irmlc round then a o

 
the road bid them from sight and still
owning drummond pulled out his case
ad lit a cigarette for the man whose
ye he had caught as the rolls went by
henry lakington there was no
staking that hard-lipped cruel face
evesumably thought hugh the other

two

occupants were mr peterson and the

ubtful daughter irma presumably
 y were returning to the elms and
-gmcntally there seemed no pronounced
json why they shouldnt but some-
w the sudden appearance of lakington
upset him he felt irritable and
oyed what little he had seen of
man he had not liked  he did not want
be reminded of him especially just as
 was thinking of phyllis

he watched the white dust-cloud rise
the hill in front as the car topped
he watcbed it settle and drift away

	the faint breeze then he let in his
jch and followed quite slowly in the big

     wake

there had been two men in front-the
jlrer and another and he wondered idly
the latter was mr benton probably

	he reflected since phyllis had said
ting about her father being in london
jaccelerated up the hill and swung over
p top the next moment he braked

and pulled up just in time the
p with the chaufleur peering into
bonnet had stopped in such a posi-
es that it was impossible for him to

 t fay

the

girl was still seated in the back of

   car also the passenger in front but
tf two other men were standing in the
 apparently watching the chaufleur
jt fter a while the one whom drummond
k recognised as lakington came to-
him

tn o sorry he began-and then
in surprise  why surely its
drummond  

ond nodded pleasantly  the
at of a car is hardly likely to change
 mile is he   he remarked  im
e i forgot to wave as you went past
  ot your smile all right he leant
lts steering-wheel and lit a second

rette

are you likely to be long  

sapper cyril mcneile

lie asked  because if so ill stop my

engine

  the other man was now approaching
casually and drummond regarded him
curiously  a friend of our little phyllis
peterson said lakington as he came up
 i found them having tea together
yesterday at the carlton

   any friend of miss bentons is i hope
ours said peterson with a smile  youve
known her a long time i expect  

   quite a long time returned hugh
 we have jazzed together on many occa-
sions

   which makes it all the more unfor-
tunate that we should have delayed you
said peterson  i cant help thinking
lakington that that new chaufleur is a
bit of a fool

   i hope he avoided the crash ail right
murmured drummond politely

  both men looked at him  the crash i 
said lakington  there was no question
of a crash we just stopped

   really remarked drummond  
think sir that you must be right in your
diagnosis of your chauffeurs mentality
he turned courteously to peterson
 when something goes wrong for a fellah
to stop his car by breaking so hard that
he locks both back wheels is no bon as
we used to say in france i thought
judging by tlie tracks in the dust that you
must have been in imminent danger of
ramming a traction engine or perhaps
he added judicially  a sudden order to
stop would have produced the same effect
if he saw the lightning glance that passed
between the two men he gave no sign
 may i offer you a cigarette  turkish
that side-virginian the other i won-
der if i could help your man he continued
when they had helped themselves  im
a bit of an expert with a rolls

   how very kind of you said peterson
 ill go and see he went over to the
man and spoke a few words

   isnt it extraordinary remarked
hugh  how the eye of the boas galvanises
tbe average man into activity i as lun
probably as mr peterson had remained
here talking that chauffeur would have
gone on tinkering with the engine and

-j
hutchinsons story magazine

now-look in a second-all serene and
yet i daresay mr peterson knows nothing
about it really just the watching eye
mr lakington wonderful thing-the
human optic

  he rambled on with a genial smile
watching with apparent interest the car
in front  whos the quaint bird sitting
beside the chauffeur  he appeals to me
immensely wish to heaven id had a
few more like him in france to turn into
snipers

   may i ask why you think he would
have been a success at the job   laking-
tons voice expressed merely perfunctory
interest but his cold steely eyes were fixed
on drummond

   hes so motionless answered hugh
 the bally fellow hasnt moved a muscle
since ive been here i believe hed sit
on a hornets nest and leave the inmates
guessing great gift mr lakington
shows a strength of will but rarely met
with-a mind which rises above mere
vulgar curiosity

   it is undoubtedly a great gift to have
such a mind captain drummond said
lakington  and if it isnt bcirn in a
man he should most certainly try to cul-
tivate it he pitched his cigarette away
and buttoned up his coat  shall we be
seeing you this evening  

  drummond shrugged his shoulders
 im the vaguest man that ever lived
he said lightly  i might be listening to
nightingales in the country  or i might
be consuming steak and onions preparatory
to going to a night club so long   
you must let me take you to hectors one
night hope you dont break down again
so suddenly

  he watched the rolls-royce start but
seemed in no hurry to follow suit and
his many friends who were wont to regard
hugh drummond as a mass of brawn not
too plentifully supplied with brains would
have been puzzled had they seen the look
of keen concentration on his face as he
stared along the white dusty road he
coold not say why but suddenly and very
certainly the conviction had come to him
that this was no hoax and no leg-pull-
but grim and sober reality la la imagina-

tion he heard the sudden sharp order to
stop the instant they were over the hill-

so that peterson might have a chance

of

inspecting him  in a flash of intuition he
knew that these two men were no ordinal
people and that he was suspect and as
he slipped smoothly after the big car now
well out of sight two thoughts were donu
nant in his mind the first was that thef
was some mystery about the motionless
unnatural man who had sat beside
driver  the second was a distinct
of relief that his automatic was
loaded

  at half-past five he stopped in front oj
god aiming post office to his surprise tn
girl handed him a wire and hugh tore 
yellow envelope open quickly it v
from denny and it was brief and to t
point

   phone message received aaa-
see you carlton tea day after to-motfjs

  with a slight smile he noticed the
tary phraseology-denny at one tiffl 
his career had been a signaller-and
he frowned  must see yon she sho
-at once

  he turned to the girl and enquired
way to the larches it was about

road and impossible to miss a bagyj

grounds	

   is it anywhere near a house called

    next door sir said the girl

  he thanked hor and having tom up 
telegram into small pieces he got i-lt

cided but to drive boldly up to the
and say that he had come to call o

which many a boxer addicted to tor

sapper cyril mcneile

 remember what more natural he re-
 jected than to drive over and see such an
 lcl friend 

 he had no difficulty in finding the house
 a few minutes later he was ringing the
 ont-door bell it was answered by a
 bjdservant who looked at him in mild
 young men in motor-cars were
 common visitors at the larches

   is miss benton in   hugh asked
 ltb a smile which at once won the girls
 heart

   she has only just come back from
   sir she answered doubtfully  i
   t know whether  

 would you tell her that captain
 pjfeunnond has called   said hugh as the
 hffi hesitated  that i happened to
 myself near here and came on chance
 ing her

 once again the smile was called into
 jrf and the girl hesitated no longer
 yon come inside sir   she said

     go and tell miss phyllis

  uhered him into the drawing-room
 closed the door it was a charming
 just such as he would have expected
 phyllis big windows opening down
 i - ground led out on to a lawn which
 flready a blaze of colour a few great
 frees tiirew a pleasant bhade at the
 the garden and partially showing
 them he could see another house
 h-pr he rightly assumed was the elms

 even as lie heard the door open and
 behind him he saw peterson come out
 i in aipah summer-house and commence
 up and down smoking a cigar
 he turned round and faced the

 ukarning as she had looked in i-ondon

  doubly so now in a simple linen
 hich showed off her figure to per-
 tqv k but if he thought he was going
 any leisure to enjoy the picture un-

        baw you come here captain
 	t  ah said a httle breathlessly

the carlton-the day after to-

 inunatelym said hugh  id left
 kj before that message came my
 ip ired it on to the post office

i he was soon disillusioned

here not that it would have made any
difference i should haw come any-
way

  an involuntary smile hovered round her
ups for a moment then she grew serious
again  its very dangerous for you to
come here she remarked quietly  if
once those men suspect anything god
knows what will happen

  it was on the tip of his tongue to tell
her that it was too late to worry aboot
that then he changed his mind  and
what is there suspicious he asked  in
an old friend who happens to be in the
neighbourhood dropping in to call  do
you mind if i smoke  

  the girl beat her hands together  my
dear man she cried  you dont under-
stand youre judging those devils by
your own standard they suspect every-
thing-and everybody

   what a distressing habit he mur-
mured  is it chronic or merely due to
liver  i must send em a bottle of good
salts wonderful thing - good salts
never without some in france

  the girl looked at him resignedly
 youre hopeless she remarked- abso-
lutely hopeless

   absolutely agreed hugh blowing
out a cloud of smoke  wherefore your
telephone message  whats the worry  
she bit her lip and drummed with her
fingers on the arm of her chair  if i tell
you she said at length  will you pro-
mise me on your word of honour that
you wont go blundering into the elms
or do anything foolish like that  

  at tiie present moment im very com-
fortable where i am thanks remarked
hugh

   i know she said  but im bo dread-
fcilly afraid that youre the type of person
who    who    she paused at a loas
for a word

   who bellows like a bull and charges
head down interrupted hugh with a
grin she laughed with him and just for
a moment their eyes met and she read in
his something quite foreign to the point at
issue in fact it is to be feared that the
question of lakington and his companions
was not engrossing drummonds mind as


hutchinsons story magazine

it doubtless should have been to the ex-
clusion of all else

   theyre so utterly unscrupulous she
continued hurriedly  so fiendishly clever
that even you would be like a child in
their hands

  hugh endeavoured to dissemble his plea-
sure at that little word  even and only
succeeded in frowning horribly

   i will be discretion itself he assured
her firmly  i promise you

   i suppose i shall have to trust you
she said  have you seen the evening
papers to-day  

   i looked at the ones that come out in
the morning labelled six pm before i had
lunch he answered  is there anything
of interest  

  she handed him a copy of the planet
 read that little paragraph in the second
column she pointed to it as he took
the paper and hugh read it aloud

   mr hiram c potts-the celebrated

american millionaire-is processing favour
ably he has gone into the country
a few days but is sufficiently recovered
to conduct business as usual he 
down the paper and looked at the grl
sitting opposite  one is pleased
remarked in a puzzled tone  for the sak
of mr potts to be ill and have a nam
like that is more than most men couw
stand    but i dont quite see  - 

   that man was stopping at the carlton
where he met lakington said the
 he is a multi-millionaire over here n
connection with some big steel trust
and whon multi-millionaires get friendly
with lakington their health frequently
does suffer	

   but this paper says hes getting better
objected drummond   sufficiently re
covered to conduct business as usual-
whats wrong with that  

   if he is sufficiently recovered to cn
duct business as usual why did he se

his confidential secretary away yesterday
morning on an urgent mission to bel-
fast  

  search me said hugh  incident-
al how do you know he did  

   i asked at the carlton this morning
sbe answered  i said id come after a
job as typist for mr potts they told me
at the enquiry office that he was ill in
d and unable to see anybody so i
ked for his secretary and they told me
fthat ive just told you-that he had left
for belfast that morning and would be away
eral days it may be that theres
nothing in it on the other hand it may
 that theres a lot and its only by

following up every possible clue she
continued fiercely  that  can hope to
beat those fiends and get daddy out of
their clutches

  drummond nodded gravely and did
not speak for into his mind had flashed
suddenly the remembrance of that sinister
motionless figure seated by the chaufleur
the wildest guess-work certainly-no
vestige of proof-and yet having once
come the thought stuck and as he
turned it over in his mind almost prepared
to laugh at himself for his credulity-
millionaires are not removed against their
will in broad daylight from one of the
biggest hotels in iondon to sit in immov-
able silence in an open car-the door
opened and an elderly man came in

  hugh rose and the girl introduced the
two men  an old friend daddy
she said  you must have heard me
speak of captain drummond

   i dont recall the name at the moment
my dear he answered courteously-a
fact which was hardly surprising- but
i fear im getting a little forgetful i
am pleased to meet you captain drum-
mond youll stop and have some dinner
of course

  hugh bowed  i should like to mr
benton thank you very much im
afraid the hour of my call was a little
informal but being round in these parts

i felt i must come and look miss benton
up

  his host smiled absentmimledly and
walking to the window stared through
the gathering dusk at the house opposite
half hidden in the tree and hugh
who was watching him from under lowered
lids saw him suddenly clench both hands
in a gesture of despair

  it cannot be said that dinner was a meal
of sparkling gaiety mr benton was
palpably ill at case and beyond a few
desultory remarks spoke hardly at all
while the girl who sat opposite hugh
though she made one or two valiant at-
tempts to break the long silences spent
most of the meal in covertly watching
uf father if anything more had been
required to convince drummond of the
he pulled the curtain aside	genuineness of his interview with her at

                            
hutchinsons story magazine

the carlton the preceding day the at-
mosphere at this strained and silent party
supplied it

  as if unconscious of anything peculiar
he rambled on in his usual inconsequent
method heedless of whether he was
answered or not  but all the time his
mind was busily working he had al-
ready decided that a rolls-royce was
not the only car on the market which
could break down mysteriously and with
the town so far away his host could hardly
fail to ask him to stop the night and
then-he had not yet quite settled how-
he proposed to have a closer look at the
elms

  at length the meal was over and the
maid placing the decanter in front of
mr benton withdrew from the room

   youll have a glass of port captain
drummond remarked his host removing
the stopper and pushing the bottle to-
wards him  an old pre-war wine which
i can vouch for

  hugh smiled and even as he lifted the
heavy old cut glass he stiffened suddenly
in his chair a cry-half shout half
scream and stifled at once-had come
echoing through the open windows with
a crash the stopper fell from mr bentons
nerveless fingers breaking the finger-bowl
in front of him while every vestige of
colour left his face

   its something these days to be able
to say that remarked hugh pouring
himself out a glass  wine miss benton
he looked at the girl who was staring
fearfully out of the window and forced
her to meet his eye  it will do you
good

  his tone was compelling and after a
moments hesitation she pushed the glass
over to him  will you pour it out  
she said and he saw that she was trembling
nil over

   did you-did you hear-anything  
with a vain endeavour to speak calmly
his host looked at hugh

   that night-bird   he answered
easily  eerie noises they make dont
they  sometimes in france when every-
thing was still and only the ghosuy green
flares wont hissing up one used to hear

em startled nervous sentries out ol
their lives he talked on and gradually
the colour came back to the other mans
face but hugh noticed that he drained
his port at a gulp and immediately
filled his glass   

  outside everything was still no repe
tition of that short strangled cry a 
disturbed the silence with the training
bred of many hours in no mans land
drummond was listening even whfl
he was speaking for the faintest suspid 
ous sound-but he heard nothing th
soft wliispering night-noises came gently
through the window  but the man wh
had screamed once did not even whimp
again he remembered hearing a simile
cry near the brick-stacks at guincby
and tjto nights later he had found the gfr
of it at the edge of a mine-crater with
glazed eyes that still held in them tb
horror of the final second and w
persistently than ever liis though
centred on the fifth occupant of the roo i
royce   

  it was with almost a look of relief
mr benton listened to his tale of vr
about his car

   of course you must stop here for i
night he cried  phyllis my
will you tell them to get a room reatv

  with an inscrutable look at hogb  
which thankfulness and apprfheosio
seemed mingled the girl left the roo-
there was an unnatural glitter ia a
fathers eyes -a llash on his cheek t
to be accounted for by the warmth
the evening and it struck
that during the tuns he had been p
tending to look at his car mr bcnk
had been fortifying himself it was 
viou even to the soldiers un profe
eye that the mans nerves had
picce  and that unless something
done soon his daughters worst forebo
were likely to be fulfilled he  f
dtsjointcdly and fast  his hands wer
steady and he seemed to lie always w
for something to happen

 hugh had not been in the roo 
minutes before his host produced
whisky and during the time that h


 sapper  cyril mcneue

    drink a mild nightcap mr benton
 succeeded in lowering three extremely
 strong glasses of spirit and what made
 lt the more sad was that the man was
 obviously not a heavy drinker by pre-
 ference

   at eleven oclock hugh rose and said
 rood night

    youll ring if you want anything
 wont you   said his host  we dont
 ave very many visitors here but i hope
 youu find everything you require break-
 k at nine

drummond closed the door behind him
stood for a moment in silence looking
nd the hall it was deserted but he
nted to get the geography of the house
ly imprinted on his mind then a
uoise from tjie room he had just left made
won frown sharply-his host was con
juhig the proccss of fortification-and
t stepped across towards the drawing
rro inside as he hoped he found the
m

she rose the instant he came in and
by the mantelpiece with her hands

 ked

    what was it   she half whispered
    that awful noise at dinner  

he looked at her gravely for a while
b bs head  shall we
it as a night-bird for the present  
said quietly then he leaned towards
- dd took her hands in his own  go
bed little girl he ordered  this is
hifeow and may i say  think youre
wonderful thank god you saw
 advertisement f

brotly he released her hands and
to the door held it open for her
 by any chance you should hear things
cdht-turn over and go to sleep

	wht ire you going to do   she

grinned  i havent the re-
idea he answered  doubtlc
will provide
instmnt the girl had left the room
itched ofl the lights ami stepped
 to the curtains which covered the
jndows he pulled them aside
them come together behind him 


then cautiously he unbolted one side of
tho big ccntrc window the night was
dark and the moon was not due to rise
for two or three hours but he was too
old a soldier to neglect any precautions
he wanted to sec more of the elms and
its inhabitants  he did not want them to
sec more of him

  silently he dodged across the lawn
towards the big trees at the end and
leaning up against one of them he pro-
ceeded to make a more detailed survey
of his objective it was the same type
of house as the one he had just left and
the grounds seemed about tho same size
a wire fence separated the two places
and in the darkness hugh could just
make out a small wicket-gate closing a
path which connected both houses he
tried it and found to his satisfaction that
it opened silently

  passing through he took cover behind
some bushes from which he could com-
mand a better view of mr lakington
abode save for one room on the ground
ioor the house was in darkness and
hugh determined to have a look at that
room there was a chink in the curtains
through which the light was streaming
out which struck him as having possi-
bilities

  keeping under cover he edged towards
it and at length he got iuto a position
from which he could see inside and what
he saw made him decide to chance it
and go even closer

  seated at the table was a man he did
not recognise while on cither aide of
him sat lakington and peterson lying
on a sofa smoking a cigarette and reading
a novel was a tall dark girl who seemed
completely uninterested in the proceedings
of the other three hugh placed her at
once as the doubtful daughter irma and
resumed his watch on the group at tho
table

  a paper was in front of the man and
peterson who was smoking a large cigar
was apparently suggesting that he should
make use of the pen which lakington
was obligingly holding in readiness in
all respects a harmless tableau save for
one small thing-the expression on the


hutchinsons story magazine

mans face hugh had seen it before often
-only then it had been called shell-shock
the man was dazed semi-unconscious
every now and then he stared round the
room as if bewildered  then lie would
shake his head and pass his hand wearily
over his forehead for a quarter of an
hour the scene continued  then lakington
produced an instrument from his pocket
hugh saw the man shrink back in terror
and reach for the pen he saw the girl
he back on the sofa as if disappointed
and pick up her novel again and he saw
lakingtons face set in a cold sneer
but what impressed him most in that
momentary flash of action was peterson
there was something inhuman in his com-
plete passivity by not the fraction of a
second did he alter the rate at which he
was smokiig-the slow leisurely rate of
the connoisseur by not the twitch of an
eyelid did hii expression change even
as he watched the man signing his name
no trace of emotijn showed on his face-
whereas on lakligtons there shone a
fiendish satisfaction

  the document was still lying on the
table when hugh produced his revolver
he knew there was foul play about and
the madness of what he had suddenly made
up his mind to do never struck him  being
that manner of fool he was made that way
but he breathed a pious prayer that he
would shoot straight-and then he held
his breath the crack of the shot and the
bursting of the only electric-light bulb in
the room were almost simultaneous and
the next second with a roar of  come on
boys he burst through the window at
an immense advantage over the others who
could see nothing for the moment he
blundered round the room lie timed the
blow at lakington to a nicety  he hit liim
straight on the point of the jaw and he
felt the man go down like a log then he
grabbed at the paper on the table which
tore in his hand and picking the dazed
signer up bodily he rushed through the
window on to the lawn there was not
an instant to be lost  only the impossi-
bility of seeing when suddenly plunged
into darkness had enabled him to pall the
thing oflf so far and before that advan-

tage disappeared he had to be back at
the larches with his burden no light
weight for even a man of his strength to
carry

  but there seemed to be no pursuit no
hue and cry as he reached the little gate
he paused and looked back and he fancied
he saw outside the window a gleam ot
white such as a shirt-front he lingered
for an instant peering into the darkness
and recovering his breath when with a
vicious phut something buried itself in the
tree beside him drummond fingered n
more  long years of experience left
doubt in his mind as to what that some
thing was

   compressed-air rifle -or electric 
muttered to himself stumbling on and
half dragging half carrying his dazed coin
panion

  he was not very clear in his own mind
what to do next but the matter was settled
for him unexpectedly barely had b
got into the drawing-room when the doof
opened and the girl rushed in

   get him away at oncc she cried
 in your car    dont waste a second-
ive started her up

   good girl he cried enthusiastically
 but what about you  

  she stamped her foot impatiently  i 
all right-absolutely all right get b
away-thats all that matters

  drummond grinned  the humorou
thing is that i havent an idea who the biw

is -except that- he paused

his eyes fixed on the mans left thm
the top joint was crushed into a red shaf-
less pulp and suddenly the meaning of
instrument lakington had produced fr
his pocket became clear also the re
of that dreadful crv at dinner

only the bullet imbedded in a tree proved
that somebody must have got busy of

on a warm afternoon in february
dr alec caird was strolling through
t the mousky in cairo his quick eyes
from side to aide with an alertness
terest in all he saw which was at
with his slow almost languid

brr wu been in airo a wcok- having
his journey home from india for
purpotr  and he was already regretting
that his passage was booked in the
sk boat winch was due to sail from port
on the following evening for all
 done cairo wa a laacinating city

        night jeer at it  a poor imitation
ynrh town traveller might talk con-
jjwwovmy about the  near east pre-
 there was nothing oriental about
but for all that there teas an
in cairo wtuch to a sensitive
least was charged with delicious
	mystery and enchantment and

for all his scotch shrewdnr

the hard-headedness which is typically
northern was strangely sensitive to im-
pression that was why he found such
delight in strolling through the bazaars
studying the types he saw on every hand
with the trained interest of the psychologist
and the more romantic curiosity of the
idealist

  particularly was he interested in the
goldsmiths plying their trade with the
most delicate of tools the mot deft of
fingers  and in the jewellers those hungry
spiders who spun webs of the loveliest
jewels iridescent and sparkling with which
to entice the rich flies who visited their
unpretentious booths

  for the last three days indeed dr
caird had been in negotiation with old
 lutsein -ben  i lassan for the purchase of
a ring a great green emerald set in a most
delicious claw-setting of the finest gold
which he had set his heart on presenting to
his mother a month hence on the occasion


hutchinsons story magazine

of her golden wedding and although the
pricc was still beyond his means he was
not without hope that a satisfactory
bargain might be driven after all

  as he entered husseins shop this after-
noon the jewel-seller came towards him
with an eagerness which yet held no hint
of servility  and caird began to hope that
the old villain was about to accede to his
terms-a hope which was quickly dispelled
by husseins first words spoken in un-
grammatical french

   i am honoured msieu by your visit
you desire the emerald is it not  but
htlas msieu another customer won by
the green fire of the jewel is willing to give
poor hussein his price  and unless msieu

see his way to paying the paltry sum-

he raised deprecating shoulders shooting
keen glances out of his eye-comers at the
prospective customer the while

  caird uncertain whether this was mere
bluff hesitated  and as he did so a sccond
arab came forward from the dark recesses
of the shop and placed a small object in
husseins hand retiring as swifuy as he
had advanced hussein himself wore the
shabby frock-coat and red tarbflsh of so-
called civilisation but the second merchant
was clothed in flowing robes a turban bound
round his head  and as caird looked idly
enough at the man his quick eyes caught
sight of a strange little scar in shape like
a miniature horseshoe on the forehead
beneath the edge of the folded turban
almost as though the arab resented liis
scrutiny he raised his hand and dragged
the folds of drapery lower so as to conceal
the scar completely and at the same time
a hash of something not unlike rage shone
out of his dark eyes with strangely dis-
concerting effect

  the whole incident occupied less than ten
seconds yet it was unconsciously stored
away in cairds retentive memory though
it was most certainly of no importance
whatever

  as the second arab retired hussein
opened his hand to display another ring
scarcely less effective than the first save
that in this case the emerald was a trifle
smaller and round instead of square

   my assistant mahomet-ben-hadj

m

flunk this ring may suit msieus purpose
he spoke glibly still shooting those keen
glances at the others face  it is a little
cheaper than the first-a matter of fifty
francsonly-but it is of almost equal beauty
nesl-ce-pas msieu  

   hm yes its not bad he was care-
ful not to express the admiration he really
felt  but id rather have the square one
come hussein you know youre charging
exorbitantly for the thing let me have
it at the price i offer three hundred francs
and we shall both be satisfied

  the jewel-seller uttered a cry of pr
test

   mashallah but the hakim possess
the instinct of a jew   he had already
made himself acquainted with the status ol
his would-be customer  i am a pr
man msieu but to makj so miserable 
bargain would turn my few hairs white
with shame nay msieu rather woulj
i give you the ring  take it msieu ao
know that the despised seller of jewels 
man of generosity indeed  

  he held out the ring in his open pal
with a magnificent gesture but cai
laughed and shook his head

   no hussein nothing doing perhap
after all id better leave the thing aloft--
i can get what i require in paris
my way home at least fifty per cert
cheaper 

  he spoke convincingly and the
chants eyes began to shine with cupidit
it was true he had a second customer
view but there was many a slip twixt 
and lip  ami maybo it were better to sell
this tall lean roumi with the sharp e
and the pockets stuffed with gold

   for four hundred francs the ring
msieu s he spoke with an air of
plete magnanimity  and caird who h-
not expected to get the beautiful
under sixteen pound pretended to
sider the question for a moment
which he shrugged his shoulder in imitatj
of the other mans habitual gesture v
signified his willingness to be thus rob
g his hard-earned money

  the transaction completed it r 
inevitable he should partake of a cup 
coffee with his late adversary in the


kathlyn rhodes

 words and the pair retreated to a dim
corner of the little shop where half hidden
by

   a screen of priceless meshribyeh work
thev squatted on low stool and gravely
spped the mastic-scented coffee in token
of friendship

barely was the ceremonial rite begun
before two prospective customers entered
little place and with a muttered word
 apology to his guest hussein went for-
ward bowing to greet the pair

   he spoke in french as usual and caird
perforce gathered that this was the man
who had expressed a desire to purchase
square emerald ring after a rapid
eplanation of the sale hussein produced
e second ring  and as the two examined
 their heads nearly touching in their
eaerness caird observed them idly
tore from habit-the habit of observation
han from any real curiosity

    he had seen the girl before passing in and
 f shepheards where he himself was
ying and he had taken notice of her
n three separate counts  one her extreme
yth two her real though rather fragile
pttiness and three her look of fear as
jwplified by the timid glances which she
bttually cast from side to side as diough
t uved in a state of constantapprehension

to-day as she stood beside the good-
v  n- well-built youth who had brought
he did not lose her look of timidity
cairds eyes narrowed as he noted the
 nervous movements with which she
erd the beautiful ring

 t was evident that the man wished to
y her the jewel and equally evident
t she longed to possess it yet for some
hardly dared to sanction the gift
caird found himself speculating as to
could be the inner significance of
rloctance to appropriate the jewel
of money was apparently not tho
for the man made no attempt to
iq p the bargain yet the girl hesitated
that at last hussein with a clever
tption of indifference turned away
v	to rummage among a heap of

 tone laid out in small sauccrs on
	table m though the transaction

    ceasd to interest him

k did so caird sitting in his dark

 comer hidden from sight heard a hurried
 whisper from the man which still further
 intrigued his awakening curiosity

    try it darling quick take off that
 beastly wedding ring-just for a moment-
 to please me-and put on this one instead 

   with a swift movement the girl obeyed 
 and putting the discarded ring into the
 little silver bag she carried slipped the
 emerald on to her slim finger in its place it
 seemed a matter of some difficulty to get it
 on for the ring was of an unusually small
 size but she persevered and finally it
 flashed triumphantly on her hand at
 the same moment caird heard a quick gasp
 beside him and turning hastily saw the
 arab assistant craning forward from his
 stool in his dark comcr his fierce eyes
 blazing upon the pair with a veritable fire
 of mingled triumph and fury so startling
 was the sight that caird himself uttered an
 involuntary exclamation whereon the
 arab rose from his stool and retired into
 some still more mysterious recess in the
 shadowy little shop

   a moment later the jewel merchant was
 recalled and the transaction concluded with
 the payment of a goodly number of english
 -sovereigns those wonderful pieces of gold
 which before the days of the great war
 carried their value all over the civilised
 world to cairds relief the offer of coffec
 was replaced by a gift of cigarettes and
 turkish delight after which the two left
 the shop followed by bows and compli-
 ments from the gratified hussein

   a few moments later caird too departed
 and finding the afternoon was yet young
 he called an arabeah and had himself driven
 out to the ghezireh palace hotel with a
 pleasant feeling in his heart that his present
 would delight his handsome white-haired
 mot her still a gracious and dignified figuro
 for all her sixty-nine year

   he was interested while lazily enjoying
 his tea on the terrace to observe the couple
 of the ring episode sitting at a small table
 not very far from his own and lie could
 not help noticing two fact about the pair-
 one being tliat they were quite evidently
 oblivious of all save themselves and the
 other that while the girls left hand was
 still ornamented with the beautiful emerald


hutchinsons story magazine

ring there was no trace of the narrow band
of gold which would surely have proclaimed
her status to the world

  well it was no business of his they
were a well-matched pair in appearance at
least  and though the affair in the bazar
seemed to point to the presence-in the
background-of a husband possibly there
were extenuating circumstances which
made this tfte-a -ute not only excusable
but innocuous

  when an hour later caird rose and
strolled away over the marvellously kept
greeu turf the young couple were still
lingering at their table though the girl had
glanced more than once at the little gold
watch on her wrist as though conscious that
time was not standing still

  when later he entered shepheards all
thought of the lovers had vanished from
cairds mind occupied truth to tell with
pleasant anticipations of an excellent
dinner by and by

  yet he was to meet one of them again
in circumstances which would impress the
meeting indelibly on his memory

  as caird was dressing leisurely for
dinner he heard a hurried knock on the
door of his adjoining sitting-room and
called out a summons which went dis-
regarded a second later the knock was
repeated still more hurriedly  and since
another invitation proved fruitless caird
slipped on liis coat and went to see who
thus sought admittance

  he opened the door rather brusquely
expecting to find some apologetic waiter or
servant but the vision which confronted
him on the threshold made him begin to
wonder if he were in a dream

  for his importunate visitor was a woman
-a woman dressed in a wonderful frock of
foamy white chillon half concealed by the
satin wrap she held round her with a
shaking hand her fair hair shone like a
golden halo round her delicate and fright-
ened face and it was evident she mu
labouring uuder some tremendous excite-
ment which deprived her of self-control and
made her lips tremble almost too much for
speech

  obviously the first thing to do was to

reassure her if she were to state the object a
of her visit and since tbe corridor of the
hotel was a public lounging-place it wa
equally obvious that she must be invited
into the room before disclosing that object-

  when he spoke his voice was carefully 
modulated to inspire confidence

   you want to speak to me  well
wont you come inside and sit down  
held the door open as he spoke and io
vited her to enter with a gesture which 
induced compliance

  she entered accordingly and as she 
her satin wrap slip on to a chair beside her
his eyes were riveted instantly to the small
left hand whereon an emerald flashed and
glowed a veritable point of green and
translucent fire

  instantly the same quick eyes sought he
face and what had hitherto been a sus-
picion became a certainty his visitor vva
the girl of the jewel-sellers shop and
although at the first glance he had not been
sure of her identity so different was he
appearance without a hat he recognised 
her now with unfailing pureness

  hut why did she seek him of all people
and what had been the shock which
drive the blood from her cheeks
strength from her limbs  it was obviou
that she was on the verge of collapse n
with a tinge of professionalism in his manoj
he laid one hand on her bare shoulder 
gently pressed her down into the hf
beside which she stood

   sit down and compose yourself
said quietly  then you will be able
tell me what i can do for yon ferhaf 
you would hke a glass of water

   no no f  her voice arrested him a
was moving away  im nerfecuv well-

 dont want water only-you  j
doctor arent you  they told me so-
downstair

   yes im a doctor is some one j
that you come to me  

   no for a moment she sat iao
less though her clenched hands
lips betrayed her emotion then suddj
she spoke vehemently

    want you to do something t 
please it-its not much its only
in spite of hertelf she flushed and pal
kathlyn rhodes

   its only to help me to get this ring off
tov finger

  and she held out her hand on whose
whiteness the emerald glowed greenly
 mute appeal

    spite of himself caird started the
reqest was unusual and from the girls
tens- manner he gathered that his compli-
anc was a matter of the highest import-
ce to her

  without replying he took the small hand
 his and scrutinised the slim finger on
ivrhich the emerald shone with a fire which

held

surely something almost baleful in

green flame it was evident that its
prsnce there was a menace of some sort
although he could not help feeling that
 was exaggerating the whole affair he
not quite rid himself of a fancy that
 emerald ring held something sinister
in its beauty

   	you have tried to get it off voureclf  
     touched her finger gently  it is
     impossible for you to do it  
     quite quite impossible i  her tone
     rled conviction  you see even when
     t on this afternoon in a shop in the

  tat- she broke off biting her lip

    yon bought it to-day   he was

imii  put cr at cr cac- antl spoke
 y head bent over her hand  oddly
 bought an emerald ring to-day
w hussein he is a regular villain
he hts some splendid jewels

    then-was it you who bought the other
sl	one with the squate emerald  

   a moment she spoke more naturally
 i wanted it for my mother
j	trying gently to ease the nng as

     poke   say it  a tight fit i how
  nh did you get it on  
  i hesitated

it ru i -i jammed it on somehow
ifur father but i was so keen on wearing
lhe faltered a little- and then
ajtl   wranted to get it ofl it simply
t come  

u know your finger is quite swollen
  your pushing and pulling at it 
m digit was indoed inflamed round
 youve tried soap-yes  well

i	think unless its very im-

youd do wii to leave it for

a few hours till your finger gets cool and
normal again then i think we might
get it off without much trouble

  instantly she was all aflame

  	no-i cant do that  i must get it off
-i must really and truly it must come
off-if you have to chop my finger off as
well  

  she was again pulling frantically at the
gold circlet and it was plain to see her
nerves were giving way for some as yet
unexplained reason she found it imperative
that the ring should be removed and
suddenly caird remembered the fact that
she had taken off her wedding ring in order
to put on this other trinket   

  he spoke quietly

   dont inflame your finger any more
youre staying in the hotel arent you

miss-er- he hesitated purposely

but she did not speak  shall i come
along presently and see what i can do  
 oh no no   she spoke vehemently
 you mustnt do that i but-oh cant
you please do something-anything-to
help me  it-its almost a matter of life
and death  

    ill try he had decided that curio
sity must wait  well experiment with
a bit of cotton and if that fails well
theres one expedient left but its a des-
perate one i 

   whata that   the question shot out
sharply

   ill have to file it ofl but well try
less heroic measures first just t back
quietly and let me see what i can do

  she obeyed and for nearly a quarter
of an hour he laboured trying his very
liardcst to solve the problem of sliding the
ring over the slender finger which yet
slender as it was proved too large for the
small circle around it as the time went
on he could hear her breath coming quickly
and when at length the clock on the mantel-
piece struck the half-hour after seven she
broke out into a wailing cry wfcich betokened
her to be on the very edge oi a breakdown

   oh cant you-cant you get it of 
if you cant-oh cut my finger ofl-any-
thing t i cant- cant face my husband
with this ring on my hand i 

  for a moment he ceased his endeavour


hutchinsons story magazine

bending his keen eyes on her face with a
closeness of scrutiny beneath which she
turned ashy pale

   your husband  see here mrs-

i	dont know your name yet but didnt i
see you in husseins shop this afternoon

with a tall blue-eyed chap-

   yes yes   she interrupted him
hysterically  it was my-my friend who
bought me this ring oh it was only as a
souvenir we were engaged once you know
-three years ago  and when my father
made me marry sir peter-she bit her
lip then hurried on as though she had
decided concealment were useless- sir
peter clinton why i had to break off
with hugh and ive never seen him since
till three days ago when we met by chance
in the street here in cairo

   and i gather you dont want your
husband to inquire into the history of this
ring lady clinton   although his
fingers busy with the ring were gentle as
ever there was a hint of cynicism in his
tone which cut the girl to the heart

   oh you are condemning me-of
course i  her voice had tears in it
 every one would i suppose unless they
knew everything but-god only knows
what ive had to bear  to marry a child of

seventeen to that man- she shuddered

so violently that her hand shook in his
 why he laughed at me  our wedding
day  jeered me because my father had sold
me to him to pay his debts  and he-he
took me because i was young and he
couldnt hope to get a decent woman any
other way i 

   lady clinton dont talk so-youre
upsetting yourself

   oh you dont know what it means-a
marriage like mine   she spoke impetu-
ously the words bursting forth in a quick
torrent  if i looked at another man-
the merest passing glance-my husband
reviled mo he was wildly insanely
jealous of me-not because he loved me
but because i was his i couldnt speak
to the most casual acquaintance without
finding him at my elbow and he made my
life one long-drawn-out insult  

  she broke off her breast heaving but
before he could speak she was off again

   four days ago he left me here suddenly
to go to alexandria for a week on what he
called business at first i thought it s
only pretence that he was pretending 
go so that he could spy on me and catch
me doing something he could punish me
for  and then when i found he had really
gone i felt like a bird let out of a cage
wanted to dance to sing to do anything
however absurd to mark my freedom- 
and then-her voice changed- threfl
days ago i met-hugh

   and you let him take you about  

   yes in her tone were mingled terror
and defiance  he is leaving cairo to
morrow and to-day we were to pretend 
just for once that we were engaged again- 
that all my life since my marriage had bee
only a dreadful dream i was to wear thij
ring instead of my hateful wedding ring
and we were to go out to mena house to
night to have dinner and look at tbe
sphinx by moonlight 

   well  what interfered with your pr
gramme   unnoticed by the girl he hu
succeeded at last in moving the ring 
fraction  has your husband returned 

   yes at least he sent me a messag
saying he would be with me to dinner  
eight she spoke drearily the fire g
from her manner  he thinks-hugh 
that he must have learnt of our meeting
returned on purpose but i dont see h
he can have done until to-day we ha 
been so careful	 s

  she sighed looking at his down-bent be i
as he wrestled with the ring with an air 
indescribable fprlornness	

   well im glad you came to me  j
spoke briskly  i really believe were
to get the tiling off yes-its coming-  
im afraid im hurting you abominabv
but it cant be helped

 youre awfully gentle and i dont
being hurt-she spoke with a
vivacity- if you can get it off
simply darent face my husband	i

my wedding ring i think-i think
would lull me if he saw this emerald 
hand and yet -suddenly she  m
very young and wan- it was 
harmless only a little bit of folly
worst i 
kathlyn rhodes

    unfortunately one has to pay for
follies as heavily as for crimes sometimes
fe spoke half-absently knowing that he
ad succeeded in his difficult little task

   but in this case therell be no need to
py theres the ring-and im afraid
vur poor finger must be dreadfully sore  
he dropped the beautiful emerald into
 lap and stood upright with a sigh of
relief

    oh how can i thank you   her joy
as too real to find expression in words

you have saved me-and im so grateful
  no need for gratitude he smiled

   but where is your wedding ring  will
von ever be able to get it on over that poor
ner of yours  

   	yes its much too large for me ive
rwn thin since i was married she said
ply producing the gold band as she
poke  here it is  will you put it on for
tte please  

   he took it from her gently and slipped it
her linger still red from his manipula-
n with an uncomfortable sense that he
riveting her fetters afresh

now i must go she coloured with
 fand of embarrassed blush which made
look like a schoolgirl  i-i dont

what i owe you for your time-

nothing he smiled and patted her
 kindly  im delighted to have
ped you now if sir peter is to expect

 at eight-

cs i must go she rose quickly
 threw her satin wrap over the foamy
of her chiffon frock  good-
and-and thank you a thousand

tv cont later she had vanished  and
he closed the door after her caird felt
and quite genuine sense of pity
flrrnr n his heart-a pity which allowed
censure no reproach for what had
as she said only a little harmless
 which nevertheless had been like
o tragedy

utor little pretty thing  his
shu played tenderly round her as he
his interrupted toilet  shes

   	hard row to boe and shes only a
 tt all pity she didnt marry that
looking young chap-theyd have

made a splendid couple well its no
business of mine and i dont suppose i
shall ever run across little lady clinton
again  

  he did not see her as he sat at dinner in
the crowded restaurant nor was she to be
seen in the lounge afterwards though he
caught a glimpse of the man she had called
hugh pacing distractedly up and down in
the street outside the hotel unconscious
of the shrewd eyes which watched him from
the terrace above it was evident that
the young man knew of sir peters arrival
yet could not tear himself away from the
spot which housed the girl he loved  and
caird felt strangely sorry for the lover who
had been twice bereft of his right to place a
ring on the finger of his beloved

  at last with a final lingering look at the
great building the young man turned
and strode away into the night and caird
rose and re-entered the hotel intending to
write a couple of letters and go to bed

  but just as his foot was upon the lowest
stair a man touched him quietly on the
arm and turning quickly he found the
head waiter at his elbow

 pardon msieu-gustav was a
frenchman- m le propriilaire makes
you his compliments and begs yon to
derange yourself sufficiently to make a
visit to room numero quinze there is a
pauvre monsieur there who is taken ill
and it is feared he will perhaps die without
attention

   right show me the room he
spoke brusquely all his professional in-
stincts to the fore

  led by gustav he hastened to the first
floor and was admitted without delay into
a large room on the right hand side of the
corridor it was the usual hotel bedroom
of the east with high green wall and
polished floor and on the couch which
stood across the foot of the two beds lay a
man with his collar torn ort and his shirt
loosened over his labouring bosom

  it was evident to cairds practised eye
in that first glimpse that the man was
dying probably from some afiection of the
heart  but for forms sake he made a brief
examinations the patient-an examination


hutchinsons story magazine

which fully confirmed his previous lightning
diagnosis

  besides the manager and the waiter who
had summoned caird there was a woman
in the room  and as he looked across to the
chair in which she sat her white chiffon
skirts foaming around her feet caird
recognised his visitor of a few hours
previously

  instantly he reviewed the situation
and walking across to her said in a low
voice 

   lady clinton this is your husband 
has he been excited overwrought to bring
him to this state  

  she looked at him with her childlike
eyes which yet were the eyes of a woman
who had known tragedy and her voice
shook as she answered him

  yes when he came in-only half an
hour ago-he accused me of shameful
things he asked me if hugh were my
lover ftnd when i denied it he struck
me  

    struck you  

   yes instinctively she looked down
at her arm where the mark of cruel fingers
was plainly to be seen marring its white-
ness  and then he said a hundred
dreadful things  how i had allowed hugh
to buy me jewels in the bazar in return
for-for myself-

   in the bazar  but-how did he find
that out  

   i dont know but he raved at me
like a-a madman  and then quite sud-
denly he clapped his hands to his heart-
so -she illustrated the gesture- and
fell  

   would you be shocked to know that
he is dying  

   shocked  no i think -she spok
slowly- i think i should be almost-
glad

  half an hour later sir peter clint
passed away without regaining consciot
ness  and although the hotel officials were
plainly disturbed by the happening thanks
to cairds intervention lady clinton was
treated with the greatest consideration n
every hand

  it was after she had retired weeping now
to the room which had been placed at her
disposal that caird received the last shock
of the ev ening and it was one which made
an indelible impression on his unusually
retentive memory

  he had gathered from the girls n
coherent speech that in some mysterious
way sir peter had been cognisant of tm j
purchase of the emerald ring  but it w
not until he examined the dead mans sti
visage for the last time wondering as b
did so how any father could have given w j
young daughter to this satyr that he cata
upon a clue to the mystery

  and when he did so he realised with 
strange leap of his pulses that this death-
sudden and tragic as it seemed had prh
ably been tbe means of preventing a w
long persecution

  on the dead mans forehead half hidd j
by the hair which hung streakily arouo
it there was a small oddly shaped scar-

  and the shape of the scar was that of 
miniature horseshoe

u rdne and turning on his heel he led

   -	 to the house

 ir  s a jook right enough said bindle
 itp	and huggles  es so

oin aad paased into the dining-
       rdnt carefully closing the door

    v

--j- understand that this is an-
         paused

    its all right sir said bindle reassur-
ingly  nothing aint going to be said to

nobody

   theres no name on the van   went
on mr crane

  bindle looked out of the window

   not so much as a number sir

   and you dont know where you are
going

   well sir said bindle cheerfully
 earty and mrs b seems pretty sure
its ell but-

   dont be impertinent mr crane
looked at bindle severely  you dont
know your destination where you are
taking the-er-furniture  

   avent a notion sir was the re-
sponse  i got to phone up the office soon
as were loaded up then ill ear

  mr crane nodded approvingly

   the neighbours began mr crane
again he paused he was obviously ner-
vous

   you leave them to me sir said
bindle confidentially   can tell the tale

   and you understand said mr crane
putting his hand in his pocket and jingling
his money seductively

   when the vd gets a job like this ere
sir they always sends me  joe bindle
says the manager to me yesterday after-
noon  if it wasnt for you e says  gawd
knows wot would ave appened to the
british empire you see sir he con-
tinued im married myself and be
winked knowingly

  mr crane started violently

   you-i-what do you mean   he
demanded fear and suspicion in his eyes

   dont you worry sir you jest leave it
all to me ill see you through safe as
ouses

  im going down by tram to- be-
gan mr crane-and again he hesitated- to
where youre coming to he concluded

   there aint no trains runrtln to where
im goin murmured bindle with mourn-
ful conviction  an now  get on
with the job sir if you please  and with
that he turned and walked to the door and
went out

  for some time mr crane watched thu
work of dismantling his home his early

-
hutchinsons story magazine

inclination to interfere bindle had dis-
couraged

   now you jest set down an watch
sir he had said  or youll get them
pretty duds o yours all messed up an
wotll she say then  

  soon after ten mr crane departed hav-
ing given explicit instructions to bindle
not to divulge a secret with which he was
unacquainted mr crane did not seem
to sec the inconsistency of the request

  contrary to bindles expectations and
thoe of mr crane the neighbours evinced
no very particular interest as to where the
furniture from number  was going they
gazed from behind their curtains and from
their front doors according to the state of
their presentibility but nothing more
a few of the tradespeople from time to
time took up strong strategical fsitions
and watched the proceedings

  the most persistent of these itinerants
was a telegraph-girl who seemed to have
the whole morning before her a perky
diminutive little creature with a scrap of
fair hair tied behind with a pink ribbon
she stood drinking in the scene her jaws
moving continuously in the process of
chewing gum at length as if to assure
herself of the correctness of her own deduc-
tions she turned to bindle as he was
returning to the house

   moving   she inquired indifferently
nodding her head in the direction of the
house

   no darling were doin it to make our
air grow we puts everythink in the van
then we takes it all back into the ouse
again and we feels better gives us a sort
of appetite for supper

   funny aint you   she retorted quite
unmoved as she continued her chewing

  at noon bindle and his mates knocked
oft for dinner locking the doors of the
vus and also of the house at one oclock
thoy were back again

  as bindle turned into the garden he
caught sight of a lady standing at the front
door she was a little slip of a thing
brown hair brown eyes brown dresa with
very red lips and an almont childish ex-
pression of countenance her hands were
trembling violently and her large brown

eyes looked as if they would start front ber
head as bindle approached she took
step towards him

   what-what are you doing with
furniture   she cried in an unsteady voice
 your furniture mum   repeated bind i
as if he were not quite sure that he
heard aright

   you mustnt take it away oh y
mustnt  

  she clasped her trembling hands together
and looked at him beseechingly there
in her voice the note of a child who 
a cherished toy in danger of destrrietio

   were takin it away accordin
orders mum said bindle forgetful ofl -i
instructions in hi sympathy for 
pathetic figure before him

   but-but whose orders  

   fat little chap e was mum
jewels all over im an black air
smarmed down enough to cause a grea
shortage

 that was my husband she
 i am mrs crane

she was now trembling violently
swayed slightly as if about to collapse-
 look ere mum said bindle
tously  you better come in and set do
you aint fit to stand out ere

replied

zxa

 im sin l ui vo ianu uui tie	j

 opening the door with the key he 

 in his hand he led the way into one

 of 

rooms where a large chintz-covered
chair stood near the door bindle j

 his thumb to indicate to mrs crane
 she was to sit there with a sigh that 
 half a sob she collapsed into its cap
 depths which seemed to emphasis 
 slightness of her figure	

   where-where arc you taking
 she paused

    i aint allowed to say roan

 sorry said bindle sympathetically

iu

a matter of fact i dont know
were loaded up then i gets my
 oh maurice  how could you 
moaned then suddenly turning to i
she cried  you mustnt yu
will you  its my home yon 

and-- she broke ofl sobbing	

bindle stood before her cap i
picture of embarrassment a

tlic

cisson


 presently the storm of weeping subsided
 she looked up at him through her

 tea

       a pitiable figure of despair

 i fhe-he sent me away and-and-it
 t his fault its that dreadful woman
 i you wont take them away will you 
 -please say you wont

      look ere mum said bindle with sud-
 es decision  you an rats got to have a
 k about this ere   and he seated
 t maeif on the edge of a chair opposite

 bindle left the house to continue
  ajldrk removal- there was a grim set

 rt  jaw ant a stranle i in lis
 sjj for the rest of the day his habitual
 rrhumour seemed to have forsaken him
 work proceeded without the usual
 and jokes and huggles and wilkes
 them from time to time they
 ri their comrade and then at each
 eeg   puzzled to accouut for the

iv

 	ere steady ole sports cried bindle

  frntiy does it valuable little bit o
  ere

  re men were toiling laboriously with
 ii  double-doored oak cabinet of
 design and dubious antiquity
   e wm dodging from side to side in
 vour to prevent damage

 little canary-cage he mur-
 ljr   during a brief rest as lie wiped his
 with a large khaki-coloured hand-

tf	she going inquired one

      dilm-room replied bindle  keep
   by pght theres things inside he added
   th tf  explanation  mustnt upset

 t vmg that morning at six oclock
 ddren in brighton given him the
 ibjlre bindle had found three men
  kelp unload the van stevens
 gone to get a sleep whilst
  had immediately sot to work
 hep y journey to brighton he had

nliingilry comjrtby on  i 

l

 n top of the traiw

herbert jenkins

  after infinite labour and much grumbling
and blowing on the part of the men the
cabinet was planted in the dining-room
opposite the fireplace

   that finishes the dining-room mur-
mured bindle  now then you ole war-
riors he called after the men as they
trooped out of the room  put your backs
into it an you shall ave a drink of milk
and a bun if youre good boys ah  ere
you are sir as mr crane bustled into the
house

   so you got here safely he inquired

still anxious and furtive  no one-

he paused

   no one said nothink sir nor asked
nothink

   you are quite sure

   sure as sure sir said bindle reassur-
ingly

   you were not followed persisted mr
crane

   nothink followed us along the road
sir an  didnt ear an aeroplane

  mr crane drew a deep sigh of relief

   weve got the dra win-room an the
dinin-room done sir an now well get on
with the other rooms

  mr crane looked about him apparently
pleasantly surprised at the progress that
had been made during the last three houns

   theres a-er-er-a lady coming he
said  you had-cr-better call me

   right-o sir said bindle cheerfully
as he walked down the passage towards
the door whistling  my wife wont let
me

  mr crane gazed after him with a look
of doubt on his face

  a few minutes later bindle was back in
the dining-room examining the oak cabinet
apparently to see that it had suffered no
damage

   wheres mr crane  

  bindle span round on his heel and stood
regarding a ilambuoyautly-dr eased girl
with pufly feature hill hips and startling
yellow hair her manner was supercilious
and her diction that of bow

   e was ere a moment ago mum or
miss said bindle when he had taken
stock of the stranger  did you want
im  


hutchinsons story magazine

   tell him im here said the girl as she
proceeded to peel off her gloves

  bindle noticed a broad circle of gold upon
the third finger of her left hand he
winked knowingly at a portrait of a pale
narrow-headed man looking like a half-
ripe banana

   very good miss-mum i mean who
shall i say   bindle gave a covert glance
in the direction of the oak cabinet

   mrs crane she replied indifferently
 right-o miss ill go an fetch im
as he turned towards the door mr crane
entered at the sight of the girl his cus-
tomary nervousness seemed to increase
he fluttered across to her with a forced
rather sickly smile

   the drawing-room is quite ready my
dear he said looking at her anxiously as
if uncertain of her mood

   thatll have to be moved she an-
nounced pointing to the cabinet and
without any attempt at greeting by which
bindle decided in his own mind that they
had parted only a short time before

   moved my dear   interrogated mr
crane

   i dont like it its hideous youll
have to sell it

   i-er- began mr crane

   whats inside shelves   she de-
manded

   its-er-theres nothing inside said
mr crane  its just an ornament

   ornament   she cried scornfully
going over to it and turning the handle
 wheres the key  she demanded over
her shoulder

    the key ought to be in it said mr
crane turning and looking interrogatingly
at bindle

   i got the key sir said bindle rum-
maging in his trousers pocket  i took
it out when we was bringin it in for fear
it might catch up against somethink
with a grin he handed the key to the
girl who proceeded to insert it in the lock
indolently and indifferently she opened
the right-hand door then with a cry started
back mr crane turned to see the cause
of the cry his eyes became fixed almost
bulging out of his head

   good morning maurice

  out of the oak cabinet stepped tw
diminutive form of the real mrs crare-
perfectly self-possessed and smiling

the effect of the greeting upon

mr

crane was curious his hands fell to w
sides his jaw dropped and his thick pur
lips gaped his face became an aawfj
colour and in his eyes was terror as
gazed at the neat and self-possessed g 
of his wife	 

   wont you introduce me to y j
friend maurice   inquired mrs c 
sweetly looking from one to the other

  mr crane swallowed twice labriouvj j
at the end of each effort his lips part j
again in a silly gape he blinked his e
rapidly  but speech was denied him- j
bindle stood in the background all
satisfaction of a successful imp

depicted upon his features

  seeing that nothing was to be got
her husband mrs crane turned to
fair-haired flambuoyantly-dressed girl
had stood the picture of dazed stup

  wont you sit down  	ab

  mrs cranes honied sweetness seeme 
goad the girl to madness she laugh
sneering insolent laugh

   you damn fool   she cried
to the now trembling figure of mr 
 theyve tricked you or else her c
suddenly blazed  youve done it n

pose you mealy-mouthed chicken-he

swine and a stream of obscene vita
tion poured from her lips

  bindle took a step forward  but the
did not wait

  with a fresh volley of abuse she flu 
out of the room mrs crane foiown 
into the hall as if to assure herself
visitor had really left the house  
she returned she stood for a mpne
garding her husband who had ul jr
a chair the picture of dcjoction a
spair	pot

   please-please have the fuming
back into the van	 nac

  bindle turned round from the
where he had been watching the	

of the vanquished  bit o	g fflf

moment he hesitated then das
ward was just in time to catch ml-
as she fell
herbert jenkins

well im blowed what would mrs
  say now he mumbled  ere look
tre sir this is your job he cried looking
fcross at where mr crane sat a moist and
aten man

seeing that no help was to be expected
 mr crane bindle gently lowered his
rj to the floor and placing a hassock
rath her head bolted out of the room
search of water when he returned
having told the men to wait by the
he found mr crane kneeling by his

  	a side the picture of helpless misery
as bindle knelt down beside her a cup
water in his hand mrs crane opened
eyes after looking at him for a mo-
j  with a puzzled expression she smiled
jfting her head gently bindle placed
cup to her lips she drank a little
 n with a motion of her head signed to
to take it away she sighed deeply
looked inquiringly at her husband
 was still on his knees gazing down at
 th unseeing eyes

          said bindle you jest lift er
    that chair an shell be all right in
    ticks -

if

 crane seemed grateful for something

    	stooping down he lifted the slight
p f his wife and placed her in a chair
sooc minutes bindle and mr crane
sazing down at mrs crane pres-
he appeared to gather herself to-
sv r- and looking from one to the other
 niled

y m all right now she said weakly
 you mustnt bother any more

 well

mum if you dont mind bein

ima ne a minute or two me an
hi  gt one or two little things to settle
 y-ated mr crane with his thumb
r sure youll be all right   he

m anxkuly

 v rane nodded ami smiled wanly
ct- ar said bindle addressing mr

tv well go into the kitchen

vny c wa a grim ness about bindles
        caused mr crane to look appre-
         the direction of his wife  but

wre closed bindles air as he
open tle door was so deter-
ijj c after a momentary hesitation
passed through it into the

kitchen as if compelled by sheer force of
personality carefully closing the door
bindle stood before it facing his victim

   now look ere sir he said  i met
some queer coves in my time coves wot
wasnt over particular wot they did  but
youre about the damnedest and dirtiest
tyke i ever see without a muzzle  he
paused as if to give mr crane an oppor-
tunity of resenting or denying the charge
as he did neither bindle continued 

   i aint been brought up in a young
ladies school an i seen some pretty dirty
things done by men an women an orses 
but im blowed if this aint the dirtiest
i ever eard of

  again he paused and looked at mr crane
who stood clutching with both hands the
corner of the kitchen table as if unable
to support himself with his own legs his
face was a ghastly grey his lips dry and
in his eyes was fear

   i card all about it from your missus
ow you got er to go away to see er
mother while you nipped orf with the sticks
an that there bit o fluff wot jest got it
in the neck i brought er down in that
there black cupboard o yours-your missus
i mean such goins-on didnt ought to
be allowed now you can lose me my
job by reportin me or you can ave it out
in the back-yard man to man which is
it to be  

  bindle looked eagerly at the quaking
figure before him twice mr crane swal-
lowed noisily he made several ineffectual
efforts to moisten his lips finally he
blinked his eyes  but no sound came from
him

  if you could make it the back-yard
id be kind o grateful said bindle  i
want to it you badly  but i cant do it
while you looks like that youre biggcrn
wot i am an you aint so old an i
wouldnt mind betting two to one you
aint got various veins in yer legs so im
givin away a lot of things besides weight
now do take orf yer coat he sakl per-
suasively

  and then mr crane did a strange thing
his knees seemed slowly to double up
beneath him and he sank down still
clutching with both hands the edge of the


hutchinsons story magazine

table burying his face in his arms he
sobbed the hard dry sobs of a man who
is alone with his soul

   well im blowed muttered bindle
his eyes upon the light patch on the back
of mr cranes head  if this aint it  
and he walked over to the table and stood
gazing down at the sobbing man as if be
had been some new and strange animal

   please leave us now said a quiet
voice behind him he turned swiftly to
find mrs crane standing just inside the
kitchen door a new light in her eyes
 get the furniture back in the van please 

i	will settle up everything with your em-
ployers you have been very very kind
to me i shall never forget it i will
thank yoxi later and she looked up into
bindles face with a tremulous little smile

  a moment later bindle was blowing his
nose violently in the passage

   well im blowed he muttered as
he made his way into the dining-room
 jest fancy er wantin im back an me
gettin mixed up in-ere you ole repro-
bates he shouted out of the window
 we got to load up again now look
slippy been a little family scrap ere
he said a moment later by way of explana-
tion to the men as they trooped into the
room  now then charlie chaplin this
to a large man enveloped in a voluminous
pair of trousers  up guards an at em

  the men grinned they had a fairly clear
idea of what had taken place

   well im blowed said bindle when
they were all at work again as he scratched
his head through his cap  if this aint
the rummest go i ever-

   so youve come back mrs bindle
proceeded to splosh irish stow from a
saucepan into a large buff-coloured pie-
diah

   the tired ole orse returns to is

walked over to the sink for the evening
rinse

taken the edge orf a little appetite i got- 
mrs bindle sniffed and proceeded to
bindles plate for twenty minutes i
ate with noisy enjoyment finally he lead
back in his chair with a sigh of relief an
repletion

   now mrs b for the story he
as he filled and lighted his pipe when
was drawing to his entire satisfaction
started to tell mrs bindle of the happ
ings of the last two days in her intere
she forgot to clear away the supper thing

   jezebel   was her comment wmjs
bindle had concluded his account of
discomfiture of the pseudo mrs crane 

  	that might ave been er name
she didnt appen to mention it

  and what happened afterward
inquired mrs bindle eagerly

  bindle explained his interview with

interrupted	

   when they come out of the kitchen 
he concluded  they was like lo-e-bttj

i

when young fumival proposed to
marion carver all classes of society
in the little town wherein they
both resided held its breath in sheer and
profound amazement

  young furnival was a gentleman  his
father had been a well-to-do solicitor and
lie lived with his mother and two sisters in
one of the best houses in one of the best
parts of the little snobbish surburban town
wherein mary carvers father kept a small
grocers shop

  it was an unpretentious shop and carver
was an unpretentious man  he served be-
hind the bacon counter himself in a white
apron and his wife sat in the cashiers
desk

  mary was their only child and she had
been-what her father proudly called
 educated   which meant that he had
sent her to a school which was really more
expensive than he could afford and that

she could play the piano better than
of young furnivala sisters and sing
songs in a very charming mezzo that o
shone every other amateur in the towfl- 
old carver and his wife adored her
they had spoken the truth they f
probably have said that it was a necl
ending wonder to them how they cmegt
have such a daughter  she was the
sacred thing in their lives  they
never allow her in the shop and it ws 
dream of her fathers life to be ab e i
save enough money to enable
move away from the shop premises
live-as he called it- private 
the shop which he recognised a 
environment for himself and his 
considered degradation for marion
secret ambition was that she should
a gentleman	 toid

   shes fit to marry a duke he 
his wife so many limes that she -
soul had firmly grown to believe tha


ruby m ayres

      the duke would graciously came along
  j high street and fulfil his obligations
  y stopping at the door of  carvers
  general stores

  the sons of other tradespeople in the
  wn who would gladly have cast eyes in
  rnns direction were severely dis-
  uraged  the doors of old carvers hos-
  pitality were closed to them and marion
   walled about by many hopes and
  axpirations most of them foolish ones

herself was pretty and un-
ected  she was very fond of her parents

   but

   bad

      secretly she was amused at them  she
  no vain illusions about a duke though
  p than once her blue eyes had turned
  tfully in the direction of young furnival
  a ie was twenty-two then and articled to
   hcitor in london  he went up to town
  j ery day and every day his way to the
  uon took him past carvers general

          he did his courting or how no-
cver discovered  but one morning
by stolidity of the little town was startled
j bombshell piece of news that young
ivai and marion carver were engaged
l	up at one ot tlie best houses in the

         of the town young furnivals
wept and declared tlat her heart
	ci wle dwn the high street

a	the unpretentious little grocers

      marion carvers mother wept also
  hr eolared it to be the happiest day of

  iq j ways knew our girl would do well

i izrns father told any of his cus-

  ul ri who were interested and they were

  tjterested look how shes been
        j 

his kindly heart sang for joy as he
up the bacon because now there no
atued any need to scrape and save
t diligently in order to live  pri-

      rn would have a house of her own
  cvr	 wle coul continue to live

  w  sllop  he thanked heaven lor the
  	 consiclcred entirely due to

      eeht in having had marion edu-

towards the end of july and
re the nine days wonder-chatter

of the town had subsided and before
young furnivals mother and sisters had
made up their minds to invite marion to
tea the war broke out and its unknown
terrors put everything of minor import-
ance out of their heads

  young furnival was a territorial and
his regiment was called up within the first
forty-eight hours

  his mother wept and wrung her hands
even while in the war she saw a merciful
providence intervening to save her son
from the clutches of  that girl

  there was no more talk of an early wed-
ding  old carver shook his head over the
bacon counter and wondered how soon
prices would begin to soar

  he was terribly proud of his future son-
in-law in the uniform of a full-blown lieu-
tenant  in his heart he wished he himself
had a son to send swaggering off against
the enemy he told his daughter that her
tears were sinful and that she ought to be
glad that she could send her man to fight
for his country

  she looked up at him with wet indig-
nant eyes

   and supposing lies killed   she
asked tragically

  old carver stared  such a possibility
had not occurred to him  the excitement
and glamour of the thing had run away
with his imagination  he could only see
victory and the enemy slain in his thou-
sands

   killed  he wont be killed he an-
swered speaking very loudly as if to carry
conviction but marion only wept the more

  she clung round young furnivals neck
in the little dark sitting-room behind the
shop almost speechless with grief

   youll come back-promise me  pro-
mise me   she wailed and his eyes were
almost as wet as hers as he kissed her and
said huskily that of course he should come
back

  he had almost to tear himsell from her
in the end and then for a time the sun
went out of marions world  for she loved
him sincerely and love had sharpened her
instinctive dread

   when the first terrible casualty list came
out she knew she had cxpected to sec his




hutchinsons story magazine

name amongst those hundreds  when she
found it was not there she shivered and
braced herself ior the uncertainty of wait-
ing again

  then after some weeks came a ray of
hope which was yet a fresh kind of despair 
fumival was going to india he dashed
homo for a week-end leave to say good-
bye  already he seemed to have grown
more manly and developed  he was light-
hearted too and a little impatient at
marions tears

   but darling-ita better than france
surely   he protested

   i know i know- she sobbed

 but youll be away so long i it may
be years before i see you again youll
forget all about me

  he silenced the words with passionate
kisses he would never forget her he de-
clared  she was the only woman in the
world for him  if they did not meet again
for twenty years he should love her just
as well as he did now

  and it was four years before they met
again  four years during which a great
many things happened-the most import-
ant being that old carver made a fortune

  it was partly luck and partly profiteer-
ing in the first place a large piece of
derelict land which he had once bought as
a bad speculation and which had been the
white elephant of his life was purchased
by the government for an exorbitant
sum on account of its nearness both to a
railway and the river and from that
moment his luck never turned back-he
went on from success to success piling up
the money and growing fatter and more
self-important while other people-
amongst them young furnivals mother
and sisters-went down the scale

  their moderate income which had been
sufficient before the war was barely enough
now to keep them in decency and there
was no possibility of increasing it

  the girl tried to get posts but their in-
competence debarred them even from
government offices things were very
sadly indeed in that best house in the best
part of the town and though once or twice
marion carver made timid overtures to
them she was coldly repulsed  their pride

could not bear that she should see the
in their broken fortunes they hated he
and her parents for their new affluence

  old carver had left the shop after all
and gone to live  private  in a house not
many yards away from the furnivals - 
did up his new abode in lavish style
without much taste  he fitted every v
dow with a flower-bax and every box
flaming geraniums and white daisies  i
painted the gates of the carriagc-drt
bright green and bought a laadaomh 
from one of his customers who could 
longer afford to run it

  when the petrol restrictions came oatl
he handed it over with great magnanimity 
to the local hospital ior wounded soldi
and headed every subscriptions-list in 
town with a generous sum

ive made my money in the town

d

 they shant say im mean was his
 ment

 he dressed his wife and daughter exxf

vagantly he took them to town to

tl

theatre once a week on early-closing
he smoked fat cigars and always
to get plenty of whisky even after it
controlled	-

  little by little people who liked a 
meal and generous hospitality began
take them up only the fumival
mained coldly aloof	

  old carver was sorely perplexed n
mind

   dash it all i id be only too plert
to give em a hand be said to
but she shrugged her shoulders

   better leave them alone  they nc 
liked me and never will she said 

sigh

  but she wrote to young furnival 
day and posted the budget once r
she knew that he was having a  
in india and she wept in secret j 
over the various snapshots which he
her of himself and his friends wo
there seemed to be a great many
figuring in those snapshots and gf f
she began to reason it out to herself 
he was having such a good tunc 
joying himself so much why
she 	  jnto

  so she flung herself wliole-berteoir

 y fun that was going and just then
 fhere was a good deal going in a small way

 	the quiet little town for a regiment of
 leicestershires was billeted there and
  subalterns were mostly quite pleased
 and ready to be entertained

 old carver entertained them royally

     the best is only just good enough for
 avc men so he said  come any time
 yu like-all of you  always sure of a

 welcome

 several of them fell in love with marion
 though she liked their attentions she
 ver once swerved from her devotion to
 jttng furnival  he was the man for her
 only man in her world

 even when donald anstey who had had
 varsity education and whose father was
 healthy manufacturer in the north
 went on his knees to her to marry
 she shook her head

i cant  im engaged -you know

 that 

but the chaps in india anstey urged

 he

 thin

 may never come back loads of
 gs may happen and the wars going
  for years and years yet why not have
  od time while you can i ill give you
 jpping time  say yes my sweet

he made love very well and earnestly

 	marion said no

    i dont love you and i do love him
 jr if he never came back -her voice
 k- i should love him just the same
 way  

 j	just about that time that young

 nivals letters began to get less fre-
 nt and less ardent marion who under-
 nothing of the conditions under
 flt-h he was lining fretted and put it all
 itt to changed affections  lor a fort-
 rht she never wrote to him at all as re-
 	but she cried he reel t to sleep

night and was tlie most miserable

 o	the world then her mother died-
 j suddenly sitting in a chair in the
 drawing-room in which she had
 really ielt comfortable or at home-
 wr death seemed to turn the world
 down for old carver and hi daugli-
 perhaps neiuier of them had realised
 vjj very much she had been to them -
 been a humble self-effacing old

zi

soul  one of those women who are never
really appreciated until death has taken
them

  her loss broke old carvers heart and
turned him from a generous hearty old
man into a grim unsympathetic snob

  he began to close his hospitable doors
and hoard his money  he was less affec-
tionate to marion and worried about
young furnival and grieved about her
mother the girl hardly knew how to bear
herself

  anstey saw his opportunity and made
the most of it he dropped the role of
lover and constituted himself her friend 
he was always there always cheerful and
willing to help and comfort it was the
most natural thing in the world that she
should begin to find him indispensable to
her life he was the one bright spot in a
world that seemed suddenly to have grown
sunless

  he encouraged her to speak to him about
jim furnival  he was careful never to say
a word against him and to be always kind
and hopeful he manufactured excuses
for his silences and brief letters when in
his heart he did not believe there were
any excuses to be made  he thought-and
hoped-that furnival was getting tired of
his engagement

  it was a shock therefore when one day
a wire came announcing that jim was on
his way home-ill 

  marions spirits went up like rockets 
the colour came back to her cheeks and
the light to her eyes  she thanked anstey
for his kindness to her but let him see
that she no longer required him  she could
comfort herself easily enough now with-
out his assistance she found hundreds of
excuses for her lovers changed manner-
it was due to illness i she ought to have
known that it was -her first romantic
love for him came surging back to her
heart-she counted the days till they
should meet

  the years of anxiety and pain were ended
-he was coming home safely alter all

  and he came home safely-that l he
came home whole and without a wound
but with his health broken by tropical
suns and tropical lever

    a wrcck thats what he is old carver
said bluntly to his daughter  i should
hardly have known him and thats a fact

   the same thought was in marions heart
all young furnivals smartness and cheeri-
ness seemed to have gone he was thin
and shrunken with fever  always tired
and inclined to be irritable

   after a great struggle he got a diminu-
tive pension from an ungrateful country
and was discharged as unfit for further
service

   he was unfit for anything else as well
for the time being at all events  work of
any sort was beyond him for many months
so the doctors said  he was too sick a dog
to trouble himself about anything

  it was winter when he came back to
england and after the heat of india he
found the cold intolerable  he crouched
over the fire most of the day shivering
and cursing his inability to rouse himself

   perhaps it was only natural that after
the first few days marion carver should
get tired of crouching over the fire with
him  she was strong and healthy and
had expanded greatly in the sunshine of
her fathers wealth

  she was invited out constantly and
though as a rule young fumial was in-
cluded in the invitations it was seldom
that he could accept

   but you go he urged  of course
you must go  i dont want you to be tied
to me all day i shall be better when the
warm weather comes

  so marion went and young anstey who
could dance and skate and drive a car and
do most of the things expected of an up-
to-date man generally went with her

  he was a strong strapping fellow and
a bit of a wangler at any rate so far he
had managed to hold down a home job
and in her heart mai ion unconsciously
began to compare him with jim furnival-
to the latters disadvantage

  she wondered what life would be like
were she married to an invalid and had
to spend most of her time nursing him 
she had not had much pleasure out of her
engagement its first glow and rapture
had been cut short by the war and it had
never been resumed

  even now that her circumstances had
changed furnivals people made a 
friendly overtures to her  she had cel
tainly been to tea once or twice but k
such an air of frigidity that she had bod
thankful to get away from the house

  she knew that they condemned her be-
cause she did not wish to spend every
moment of her time with her fianc i
the knowledge drove her to defiance  vh
did she care what they thought 

  one night old carver broached the sub-
ject of marriage to her

   what about setting up a house of y
own   he asked

  marion flushed

   how can we  what can we marry
on  jim has nothing but his pension

  a few months ago she knew that 
father would have told her not to srj
about money-that he had enough
them all but now he only said 	wl

   youve been engaged long enough 
dont hold with long engagements i
speak to jim

 marion laughed bitterly	

   it wont do any good she said 
knew so well what jim would say 
had no prospects and that marriage
impossible for the present -

  and jim said all that and more besid 
he said-with a touch of his
obstinacy and pride-that if mr c
did not consider him good enough
marion she could be free if she wished  -
the old man looked at him and his
fell  the thonght was in both tbeir b
that four years ago things had been
different that four years ago jim
been welcomed with open arms and p

  now the scale had tipped the other
old carver cleared his throat and
on with what he had come to say 	

   i dont bold with long ensageef 
youre only young once  youre nci
you getting any younger

  jim furnivals thin face flushed 

   did marion send you  say 
he asked with an effort	rjirve

   no she did not said old
 but she knew i was coming

  he looked round the house with di
ficd eyes as be went out  after the no


ruby m ayres

grandeur of his own abode it seemed
ver- shabby and poor to him  this was
not the sort of home he wished his daughter
occupy  now the scale had tipped he
ev in his heart that he considered jim
urnival a very poor catch indeed

during the next few days he lost no
opportunity to hint as much to his daugh-
i he was careful to say nothing direcuy
t his whole conversation when they were
aether was pointed subtly

  marion understood what he meant and
j galled and irritated her  during the last
lr years she had grown to appreciate the
health and luxury with which she was
rrounded and now-instead of looking
rly forward to her marriage with fur-
 vl she shrank from ever thinking about
a sick man and a poor man to boot
was not much romance in life after



jshe was not naturally a very strong
tctcr and she was easily influenced 
y say that eternal dropping will wear
y a stone and marion was not stone 
 h subtle cleverness her father and
between them undermined her love
jim fumival they represented her
with him as one sordid grind to
jrp ends meet and keep up appearances 

   carver toij plainly that she had
hng to cxpect from him

    	made my money by hard and honest
ry he said untruthfully  other
j --meaning jim- must do the

climax came when jim-on the
to recovery-began to awaken
jl fact of ansteys existence  he had
his sisters talking and what they
k was hke a shutter drawn from before

  	cs

-pkc to manon about it and de-
that she gave up ansteys acquaint-
jl  perhaps he was unnecessarily
 hi earnestness but his own di-
made him so

was ill and without a shilling in the
  r prospects  anstey was hale
ttrng and with the world at his

    

       not going to txi dictated to
      aul with a quiver in lier voice

she was really terribly unhappy without
knowing in the very least what made her
so  i shall choose my own friends

  jims face hardened

   you will not-if you are going to
marry me he said flintily

  she laughed at that

  it does not seem as if i shall ever have
the chance of marrying you she said

  he took the knock as it was meant

   you mean that i am not in a position
to marry and that anstey is he said with
deadly calm

  her brown eyes were misty with tears
but anger had her in its grip

   yes that is what i do mean she said
but her thoughts went back with unkind
vividness to the little dark sitting-room
behind the shop in the high street where
he had first kissed her and the memory
hurt insufferably

   then anstey is more than welcome to
you was all jim fumival answered and
marion took off her ring and laid it down
on the table between them

  there was a moments silence then she
said hoarsely

   i suppose this is what you have bwn
wanting ever since you came home and
jim laughed as he answered drearily that
perhaps it was

  she went away then and he stood and
listened to her retreating steps feeling as
if a great door had slammed-to across the
whole world shutting them one on either
side  

  it was all over the town the next morn-
ing that marion carver had broken her
engagement with young fumival people
who four years ago had held up amazed
hands because young fumival had stooped
to marion now wagged their heads and
said they were not surprised

   he was no match for her they said
 ruined in health and wiuiout a shilling
to his name   it was the tip oi the scale
indeed 

  every one guessed uiat anstey was the
cause of the final rupture and in a way
they were right

  he went round to see marion as soon as
the rumour rcached him  she was crossing
the hall when he was admitted and re-


hutchinsons story magazine

gardless of the servant he went up to her
and caught her hand

    marion  is it true  

    is what true   she knew quite well
what he meant but she shrank from ad-
mitting it to herself

   that you have broken your engage-
ment i met furnival and he said it was
true but i could not believe it-i had to
come to you

  she drew a hard breath looking away
from him then-

    yes its quite true she said expres-
sionlessly	

    then-then is there    may i  oh
marion does it mean   

  she broke away from him

   oh not now  not now i i cant bear
it

   she went to her room and locked herself
in  she could not understand her own emo-
tions  she had wished to be free and now
that she had got her freedom she was
more unhappy than ever in her life be-
fore

    if i could only forget-if i could only
forget she kept telling herself but she
knew that the first happy memories of her
engagement the stolen meetings and the
kisses in the little dark room behind the
shop were all things which could neer be
forgotten

  when-a week later-anstey pressed
her for an answer she said yes old
carver was delighted  he gave a cham-
pagne dinner to celebrate the occasion  he
made a speech in which he said it was one
of the happiest moments of his life

   he looked at his daughter guiltily as he
said it and she winced as if he had hurt
her  for both their thoughts had gone
hick to the day of her engagement to jim
furnival and the bottle of indifferent port
that had been opened and drunk in the
little dark room behind the shop to cele-
brate their happiness when old carver
had said just the same things only with
greater sincerity

   oh why could not things last she won-
dered hopelessly  why must illness and
poverty step in and spoil the beauty of
romance i

  young anstey took her home to his

people  they made a great fuss of her
and did all they could to make her happy
but in spite of everything she was miser-
able

  though she tried hard to forget jit
furnival her thoughts were always with
him  she was unutterably relieved when
her visit came to an end and she went back
home again

  she drove past the furnivals house of
her way from the station and she peered
up at its windows with a racing pulse an
quickly beating heart j ust as she had dofl
in the old days before jim and she we
anything to one another

  where was he now  what was he do-
ing  it seemed impossible that he had
not come to meet her on her return th-
there was not the pleasure of his delight
to look forward to at seeing her again

  it was not until the next morning that
she heard what had happened to him-
that three days ago while crossing tw
high street he had been knocked do
by an army lorry and was lying between
life and death in hospital

  one of the servants told her and for 
moment it seemed as if ail the world h
fallen away from her into utter blackfle
and chaos as she stood listening	 

  between life and death that mca
death of course i he would die and
would never see him again  never tell 
that already she had repented-that al
she had loved him	

  her first impulse was to go to him
reason checked her  she had no
go now-they would not let her see
if she went she did not even dare toat
on his mother and sisters she knew
if they had hated her before they  
hate her a thousand times more 
what she had done	lurtc

  she wandered restlessly about the
she could settle to nothing  she was  
to question her father afraid i
should guess something of the terror
anguish of her heart

  anstey was away from the vnk-
then for which she was unutteraoiy 
ful  she could not have tolerat
devotion	jcjlig

  the hour seemed endless-
ruby m ayres

 ping evening without an end  when at
 it began to get dark she put on her
 at and crept out of the house

 she went up to the furnivals house and
 fctood trembling at the gate  the windows
 in darkness as if already death had
 hen there and taken its cruel toll of life

 non longed to go and ask for news but
    was afraid  she dreaded the cold con
    nation of mrs furnivals eyes that

 dem

 ere so like jims  at last she crept away
 an and went home

 her father met her in the hall

   where have you been   he asked
 ued

    only for a walk-it was so hot in the
 bouse

 they avoided looking at one another

    marion went up to bed without bid-
 d her father good night he stood
 v n the expensive splendour of the
 and watched her go trying not to hear
 c vicc of tho past that was whispering
 him

 he went back to the dining-room and
 ped himself to a stiff glass of whisky

  its not my fault if the boys dying
 told himself angrily  its not my
 -its fate i thats what it is   
 wtair marion had undressed and
  into bed  she lay awake for hours
  into darkness that was peopled by

                        her heart
                        having drawn the

tan

tort

rous visions of the past  in
hlamed the war for having 

 about the sunshine of her happiness
full well that only she herself was
lame  she cried and sobbed like a
cjnate child who resents punishment
it to be just and deserved

ally she sobbed herself into an cx-

         sleep   

ii

    h morning she found out who was
 lytor attending jim at the hospital
 wuttblc to bear herself any longer she
 to see him
 thl him what had happened and
  - nitake she had made

 jli  vc nver really loved anybody but
 she said wildly  i shall always

il he dies i shall die too

 the doctor looked at her with kindly
 pity

  i wish death was the worst we could
 promise him he said sadly

 she raised terrified eyes

  oh what do you mean  

 he told her as gently as he could  there
 had been injuries to the head and if young
 furnival lived it was possible that he
 might never know any one or anything
 again

 she stared at him white as death

  you mean-madness   she gasped

 he did not answer but his silence was
 eloquent

  and there is no hope-none   she
 asked with stiff lips

  there is a chance he admitted re-
 luctantly- a very slender chance an
 operation of couree but it is dangerous
 and most costly  his mother has not tho
 money but i doubt if she would consent

 the colour surged back to marions face

  we have plenty my father is a rich
 man i will give anything-my last
 penny   

 he shook his head sadly

  i am afraid after what has happened
 his people would not acccpt help from you
 he said compassionately  they are very
 proud and they cannot easily forgive

  but they must  i will make them 
 oh surely any chance no matter how
 dangerous is better than letting him dio
 or live on as  as you say  

 the doctor smiled faintly

  perhaps if you were to see hla
 mother    he said

 marion fled back home  there was a
 letter in ansteys writing waiting for her
 but she took no notice of it she sought
 her father  she poured out her story in
 -n incoherent jumble

  i love him-we must save him  ob
 father with all your money  

 he tried to repulse her but he would
 not meet her eyes

  where is your pride   he asked
 harshly  you-engaged to another
 man   

  i never loved him  it was always jim 
 always  oh you havent forgotten how
 proud and pleased you were about it -
hutchinsons story magazine

how pleased mother was  oh if you ever
cared for me at all   

  she was on her knees beside him sobbing

  old carver tried to raise her

   youre excited-you dont know what
youre talking about youve done with
jim-you told him so but his voice was
less confident

  marion looked up

   yes i told him so-but it was a lie 
if he dies ive done with everything for
all my life oh if we could only go back
to tlie old days  we were happy then-in
the little shop-and mother was here   

  she broke down and for a moment there
was silence  then old carver put an arm
round her

   im a rich man he said brokenly
 any money you want-its vours  take
it my dear-and    and i hope the boy
recovers

  marion went to jims mother  she went
full of eagerness and hope but the chill
formality of the house damped her spirits 
the old fear and sense of unwantedness
almost overcame her as she was admitted 
she shook in every limb as she crossed the
hall to the shabby drawing-room

  mrs furnival was there to receive her-
aged poor woman by many hours of
anxiety since last they met-and for a
moment marions courage failed her then
with sudden impulse she held out her
shaking hands

   oh forgive me-forgive me  i loved
him always-i love him now

  for an instant she thought she was to
bo repulsed then the hard worn face of
the woman who was jims mother softened
and broke and the next moment they
were crying in each others arms   

  presently marion told her of her plans
-of what the doctor had said and of what
her father had promised

   and even if the chance is so small
you will take it wont you   she pleaded
 somehow i feel that he will get well-
that it will be all right  oh he must i he
must i

  in the end she prevailed  better be
deud than to live on as the doctors said
he must live if the chance was not taken
it was arranged that the operation should

be done and at once-every hour lessened
his chances

   even if he lives and the operation s
successful he may be an invalid for tbe
rest of his life his mother said hiding her
face

  marion laughed

   what does it matter  he will have
you and ine to love him and care for him
she said   

  there followed days of cruel anxiety
days when hope hung in the balance and
marions heart almost stopped beating
with dread

  she had not been allowed to see jim
nobody but nurses and doctors were ad-
mitted and the time seemed to drag n
leaden feet

  there was one nurse whom marion al
ways saw when she called at the hosp
-a young woman with a sweet lovabl
face who was always cheery and kint-
al ways hopeful and encouraging

   live  oh i am sure he will  and b
quite himself she said once positively-
 i know the doctors still fear for him b-
somehow  know he will be all right

  marion had written to young anstey-
she hail told him quite candidly all
had happened and sent him away  s j
had refused to see him and after one or t
attempts to persuade her he let her aloj

  she was thankful for this-she 
dreaded a scene

  then quite suddenly jim took a tu 
for the better  the doctors smiled 
looked pleased  the operation had bee
entirely successful  everything was g
on quite normally

   and when may i see him  
asked eagerly she was all pasona
impatiencc to see him again	

   ahwhen i-you must have patie
so they always said seeming to e
answering definitely so she thought

 and then the blow fell	-j

  marion went up to mrs furnival
evening full of hope and - 
was glorious summer weather avo-j
world seemed full of tbe promise of a
ness to come	h

  already she dreamed of the tin 
jim would lie about and well a 
ready she was looking forward to their

arrige and the joy of being able to care

  r him and nurse him

  	did not deserve such happiness she

   w herself  words could not express her

  nkfulness

   t as soon as she saw jims mother it

j as if a rough hand had clutched at her

wringing away its joyousness  she

   yed forward pale as a ghost

       oh what is it  jim  not-dead  

 t  

r  o no    oh my dear you must

   and be brave

      tell me-tell me it was all she could

  y

  i	tlen she heard-jim- in his con-

  scence had fallen in love with the
  nurse and was to marry her as soon
  e was well enough

   arion sat quite still her hands gripped
   epftw  outside the sun shone and the
   sang but it might have been bleakest
    for all she knew or cared

  i	punishment which she had thought

  avert was here  it had fallen with a
  y hand ruining her life

  i	furnival tried to comfort her and

        to defend her son

     it so often happens during long

  	illnesses-he was not normal and

   n rcd him so devotedly

      	know marion spoke the words with
  l hps  she was not blaming jim-she
   he alone was to blame

and he never knew that it was through
i jj-through your generosity mrs fur-
ent on in tears  he never knew
 hut for you he would have died or

   ibr worc  

avarn put her gently away  she rose

       alke-l out of the house

      rr was nothing more to hope for 
  v  had written  finis  across the book of
  hfe

      he could only die and get away from
    suffering j y sle could only die 

   i w jttle river ran through one part of the
   	made hrr way subconsciously

        n had gone now and the water
        cold and dark in the grey light

          dentlv too-its depths were
      niter

 	

ruby m ayres

 marion closed her eyes  it would soon
 be over if she could just get one little spark
 of courage then   

 some one was holding her hands calling
 to her-

  marion-marion 

 she opened her eyes with a stifled shriek 
 she was sobbing convulsively

 her father was bending over her his
 face pale with alarm

  oh daddy  oh daddy   she clung to
 him as she had done years ago when sh
 was a child down at the little shop in the
 high street

 old carver soothed her gently

  there  there  dreaming thats what
 it is   was passing your door and heard
 you crying  its only a dream  nothin
 to be afraid of

  a dream   she sat up with a gasp 
 there was no river no grey night t she was
 at home in her own bedroom

 a dream  thank god  only a dream -
 but-how much of it  she broke out into
 eager questioning

  jim  i it true that hes been hurt-
 or did i dream it  

 mr carver frowned

  whats it to do with yon -youve
 done with him

 manon almost laughed

  done with him  i love him  if hell
 forgive me and take me back i shall be
 the happiest girl in the world

 she could get no more out of him  she
 was still dreaming he told her curtly  in
 the morning perhaps she would be sensible

 he went away and manon lay awake
 all night afraid to sleep any more

 as soon as it was light she got rtp and
 wrote to young anstey  she was grieved
 to hurt him she wrote but she could not
 marry him

  all my life i have only loved one man
 she wrote   love him still  

 at breakfast time there was an angry
 scene with her fatlier but she did not care

  if jim wont have me i shall never
 marry she said firmly

 he stormed at her in vain

  youll not have a penny of my money
  i dont want it manon said

 later she went up to mrs fumival 
hutchinsons story magazine

 the old fear and nervousness was upon her

 as she waited at the door  she flushed
 crimson when one of jims sisters opened
 it to her

    oh-could i see your mother   she
 faltered

   the girls face hardened

    mother never wishes to see you again
 she said

   marion turned away a little lump in
 her throat  two parts of her dream had
 been but a dream then-her fathers
 generosity and mrs furnivals forgive-
 ness  she was afraid to hope that all the
 rest might prove to be a dream too

   she went to the hospital in dread-she
 waited in a little room while somebody
 fetched the sister

   if she is young and pretty marion
 told herself wildly  i shall die

   the door opened behind her  a stout
 grey-liaired little woman entered

    you have come to enquire about mr
 furnival   she asked kindly

    yes marion could hardly speak
  i-i   oh is it true that he is very
 badly injured  

    not a bit came the crisp reply  i
 really dont know how such rumours get
 about  a few bruises thats all and a
 shaking-

 marion was white to the lips

  and hes not    not hurt-in the
 bead   she whispered

 the sister smiled kindly

  hes not hurt anywhere specifically
 she said  a few bruises as i told you-
 it was a wonderful escape she saw the
 relief in the girls eyes  perhaps you
 would like to see him she said kindly

  might i  oh if only i oould  

  certainly you may  hes in a room by
 himself-shall i tell him you are here  
 oh no  if i might just go in  

 she hardly knew what she was doing as

  she followed the little grev-haired woma j
  upstairs  she felt that she had gone bli
  when at last she stood in the room ww
  jim lay and heard the door close behind her
  there was a moments silence then-

  marion   young furnival spoke lisf
 name hoarsely incredulously

 she stumbled forward and fell on hff
 knes beside him

  oh forgive me-ive been so wretched
 -i love you  ive always loved you    
  marion   it was a cry of gladnes
 now as he raised himself frpm the pill
 and took her into his arms

 some time later-

   what will your father say   he aske
  marion laughed

  poor daddy  im afraid i dont mi
 what be says

presently	j

  what will your mother say  
 asked apprehensively

  it was jims turn to laugh

   poor mother  im afraid i dont c
  what she says

later-	j

  marion we shall be very poor w
 sweet

    i dont mind

 she bent and kissed him

   jim  

   darling  

   is there any particular nurse who  
  after you   she could not meet his
  as she asked her question

  yes-nurse mathews he answe
 the colour rushed to her face

  and is she-is she-pretty  

jim laughed	t

  good lord no shes one of theu
  women ive ever seen	 

  marion gave a sigh of relief

   im so glad she said softly

  but it was not till some time after
  that she told him why

others and he pointed to them
an end of some of tho wounded
j  but who arc these   and he
with evident astonishment first at
t ultartul lonr umslopogaas and then
grotesque hans  nay answer not

j-t be weary and need rest aftcr-
ari we can talk

   well as a matter of fact we have not
yet breakfasted i replied  also i have
business to attend to here and i pointed
to our wounded men

  the old fellow nodded and went to speak
to the captains of his force doubtless as
to the pursuit of the enemy for presently
i saw a company spring forward on their
tracks then assisted by hans and the
remaining zulus of whom one was goroko
i turned to attend to our own people
the task proved lighter than i expected
since the badly injured man was dead or
dying and the hurts of the two others were
in their legs and jmparatively slight
such as goroko could doctor in his own
native fashion after this taking hans
to guard my back i went down to a little
stream and washed myself then  returned
and ate wondering the while that i could
do so with appetite after the terriblo
dangers which we had passed still we had
passed them and robertson umslopogaas
with thrceof his men i and hans were quite
unharmed a fact for which i returned
thanks in silence but sincerely enough to
providence

  hans also returned thanks in his own
fashion after he had filled himself not before
and lit his corn-cob pipe but robertson
made no remark indeed when he had
satisfied his natural cravings he rose and
walking a few paces forward stood staring
at the cleft in the mountain difl into which
he had seen the litter vanish that bore his
daughter to some fate unknown even
the great fight that we had sought and tho

victory we had won against overpowering
odds did not appear to impress him he
only glared at the mountain into the heart
of which inez had been raped away and
shook his fist since she was gone all else
went for nothing so much so that he did
not offer to assist with the wounded zulus
or show curiosity about the strange old
man by whom we had been rescued

   the great medicine baas said hans
in his sententious way  is even more
powerful than i thought not only has it
brought us safely through the fighting and
without a scratch lor those zulus there do
not matter and there will be less cooking
now that they are gone  it has also brought
down your reverend father the predikant
from the place of fires in heaven some-
what changed from what i remember
him it is true but still without doubt the
same when  make my report to him
presently if he can understand my talk i
shall---

   stop your infernal nonsense you son
of a jackass i broke in for at this moment
old father christmas smiling more
benignly than before reappeared from the
kloof into which he had vanished and
advanced towards us bowing with much
politeness

  having seated himself upon the little
wall that we had built up he contemplated
us stroking his beautiful white beard then
said addressing me

   of a certainty you should be proud
who with a few have defeated so many
still had i not been ordered to come at
speed i think tliat now you would have
been as those are and he looked towards
the dead zulus who were laid out at a
distance like men asleep while their com-
panions sought for a place to bury them

   ordered by whom   i asked

   there is only one who can order he
answered with mild astonishment  she-
who-commands - she-who-is-everlast-
ing

  it occurred to me that this must be some
arabic idiom for the eternal feminine but
 only looked vague and said

  it would appear that there arc some
whom this exalted everlasting she cannot
command  those who attacked us those

who have fled away yonder and i waved 
my hand towards the mountain

   no command is absolute  in ever
country there are rebels even as i hav
heard in heaven above us but wanderer
what is your name  

   watcher-by-night i answered

   ah  a good name for one who
have watched well by night and by day too
to reach this country living where sh
who-commands says that no man oi v
colour has set foot for many generations
indeed i think she told me once that t
thousand years had gone by since
spoke to a white man in the city of k
 did she indeed   i exclaimed stilu
a cough

   you do not believe me he went 
smiling  well she-who-commands
explain matters for herself better than 
who was not alive two thousand years
so far as i remember but what must
call him with the axe  

   slaughterer is his name

   again a good name as to judge by
wounds on them certain of those rebels
think are now telling each other in
and this man if indeed he be a man
added looking doubtfully at hans

   light-in-darkness is his name

   i see doubtless because his couf 
that of the winter sun in thick fog- f
bad egg broken into milk and the
white man who mutters and whose bro
like a storm  

   he is called avenger  you will 
why later on i answered impatiently 

 grew tired of this catechism

 and what are you called and if 
pleased to tell us upon what errand do
visit us in so fortunate an hour   n 

   i am named billali he answered

servant and messenger of she-who-- o 
mands and i was sent to save you
tiring you safely to her 

   how can this be billali seeing
none knew of our coming  	 be

   yet she-who-commands kncvl -j 
said with his benignant smile 
think that she learned of it some
ago through a message that was sent
and so arranged all things that you  
be guided safely to her secret borne
rider haggard

kerwiae how would you have passed a

keat pathless swamp with the loss i think

  e said of but one man whom a snake
bit  

   kow i stared at the old fellow for how
 uld he know of the death of this man 
  thought it useless to pursue the con-
 veation further

when you arc rested and ready he
on  we will start meanwhile i
ve you that  may prepare litters to
those wounded men and you also
tchcr-by-night if you wish then
jjh a dignified bow for everything about
 old fellow was stately he turned and
vanished into the kloof

 the next hour or so was occupied in the
 rfy the dead zulus a ceremony in
 hich i took no part beyond standing up
 raising my hat as they were borne
 av for it is best to leave natives alone
 these occasions indeed presently i lay
 reflecting that strangely enough there
  ud to be something in old zikalis tale
 a wonderful white queen who lived in a
 tain fastness since there was the
 tntain as he had drawn it on the ashes
  the servants of that queen who ap-
 rently had knowledge of our coming
 jed in the nick of time to rescue us
 j one of the tightest fixes in which ever
 und myself moreover the antique
  - cqqrtcous individual called uillali
 of her as  she-who-is-everlasting
 i what the deuce could he mean by that
 oldered  irobably that she was very

and therefore disagreeable to look on

i confessed to m-self would be a
l ppintment and how did she know

 c were coming  i could not guess

    when i asked robertson he merely
jy ked his shoulders and intimatel that
no interest in the matter

     	truth is that nothing moved the man
 whole soul was wrapped in one desire
 to rescue or avenge the daughter
 whom lie knew he had so sorely
 in fact this loose-living but
 d seaman waa becoming a mono-
 and what fs more one of the

 

ht h	c a hle with him

     ben given to him by hi mother
      wai a boy and in this be read

constantly also he was always on his
knees and at night i could hear him groan-
ing and praying aloud doubtless now
that the chains of drink had fallen off him
the instincts and the blood of the dour old
covenanters from whom he was descended
were asserting themselves in a way this
was a good thing though for some time
past i had feared lest it should end in his
going mad and certainly as a companion
he was more cheerful in his unrcgenerate
days

  abandoning speculation as useless and
taking my chance of being murdered where
i lay for after all billalis followers were
singularly like the men with whom we had
been fighting and for aught i knew might
be animated by identical objects i just
went to sleep as i can do at any time
to walifc up an hour or so later feeling
wonderfully refreshed hans who when i
closed my eyes was already slumbering at
my feet curled up bke a dog on a spot where
the sun struck hotly roused me by saying
 awake baas they are here  

  i sprang up snatching at my rifle for i
thought that he meant that we were being
attacked again to see billali advancing
at the head of a train of four litters made of
bamboo with grass mats for curtains and
coverings each of which was carried by
stalwart amaliaggers as i supposed that
they must be two of these the finest he
indicated were for robertson and myself
and the two ptherf for the wounded ura-
blopogaas and the remaining zulus evidently
were expected to walk as was hans

   how did you make these  quickly  
i asked surveying their elegant and indeed
artistic workmanship

   we did not make them watcher-by-
night we brought them with us folded up
shc-wlio-oommands looked in her rta
and said that four would be needed beside
my own which is yonder two for white
lords and two for wounded black men which
you see is the number required

   ye i answered vaguely marvelling
what kind of a glass it was that gave the
lady this information

  before i could inquire upon tbe point
billali added

   you will be glad to learn that my men


 hutchinsons story magazine

caught some of those rebels who dared to
attack you eight or ten of them who had
been hurt by your missiles or axe-cuts
and put them to death in the propet
fashion yes quite the proper fashion and
he smiled a little  the rest had gone too
far where it would have been dangerous to
follow them among the rocks enter now
my lord watcher-by-night for the road ia
steep and if we would reach the place where
she-who-commands is camped in the
ancient holy city before the moon sinks
behind the cliffs to-night we must travel
fast

  so having explained matters to robert-
son and umalopogaas who announced that
nothing would induce him to be carried
like an old woman or a corpse upon a shield
and seen that the hurt zulus were com-
fortably accommodated robertson and i
got into our litters which proved to be
delightfully easy and restful then our
gear having been collected by the hook-
nosed bearers to whom we were obliged to
trust it though we kept with us our rifles
and a certain amount of ammunition we
started first went a number of billalis
spearmen then came the litters with the
wounded alongside of which umslopogaas
and his three uninjured zulus stalked or
trotted then another litter containing
billali then my own by which ran hans
and robertsons and lastly the rest of the
amahagger and the relief bearers

   i see now baas said hans thrusting
his head between my curtains  that
yonder whitebeard cannot be your reverend
father the predikant after all

   why not   i asked though the thing
was fairly obvious

   because baas if he were he would
not have left hans of whom he always
thought so well to run in the sun like a
dog while he and others travel in carriages
like great white ladies

   you had better save your breath instead
of talking nonsense hans  said  sincc
i believe that you have a long way to go

  fn fact it proved to be a very long way
indeed especially as after we began to
breast the mountain we must travel
slowly we started about ten oclock in the
morning for the fight which after all did

not take long had it will be remembered
begun shortly after dawn and it was three
in the afternoon before we reached
base of the towering cliff which i hav
mentioned here at the foot of a curie
isolated column of rock on which i ts
destined to see a strange sight in the aft
days we halted and ate of the remain 
food which we had brought with us whflj
the amahagger consumed their own whic
seemed to consist largely of curdled nu
such as the zulus calljni-js and lump
a kind of bread i noted that they vvctt 
very curious people who fed in silence
on whose handsome soiemn iaces one
saw a smile somehow they gave me
creeps to look at and robertson
affected in the same way for in one of
rare intervals of his abstraction he retna
that they were  no canny then  s
added

   ask yon old wizard who might be ooe
the bible prophets come to life what tb
man-eating devus have done with 
daughter

  i did so and billali answered	 j

   say that they have taken her awy 
make a queen of her since having rebeirl
against their own queen they
another who is white say too that  
who-commands wall wage war on them
perhaps win her back unless they kill
first

   ah i  he repeated when i had	

lated  unless they kill her tirs 
worse then he relapsed into bts 

slience-		 adi

  presently we start-xl on again

straight for what looked like a shecr  
of black rock a thousand feet or
height along a path so steep that	jj

and i got out and walked a
scrambled up it in order to ease the
billali  noticed remained in his  
the convenience of uc bearers di
trouble him  ho only ordered 
gang to the polos i could not unag
we were to negotiate this precip-
could umslopogaas who looked at

id  

   if we are to climb that macum t

think that the only one who will l
to the top will be that little yellow n



hutchinsons story magazine

  of yours and he pointed with his axe at
  hans

 if i do replied that worthy much
nettled for he hated to be called a yellow
monkey by the zulus  be sure that i will
roll down stones upon any black butcher
whom i see sprawling upon the cliff below

   umslopogaas smiled grimly for he had a
sense of humour and could appreciate a
repartee even when it hit him hard then
we stopped talking for the climb took all
our breath

   at length we came to the cliff face where
to all appearance our journey must end
suddenly however out of the blind black
wall in front of us started the apparition of
a tall man armed with a great spear and
wearing a white robe who challenged us
hoarsely yes suddenly he stood before
us as a ghost might do though whence he
came we could not see

   presently the mystery was explained
here in the cliff face there was a cleft
though one invisible even from a few
paces away since its outer edge projected
over the inner wall of rock moreover
this opening was not above four feet in
width a mere split in the huge mountain
mass caused by some titanic convulsion
in past ages for it was a definite
split since once entered far far above
could be traced a faint line of light coming
from the sky although the gloom of the
passage was such that torches which were
stored at hand must be used by those
who threaded it one man could have
held the place against a hundred until he
was killed still it was guarded not only
at the mouth where the warrior had ap-
peared but further along at every turn
in the jagged chasm and these were many

  into this grim place we went the
zulus did not like it at all for they arc a
light-loving people and i noted that even
umslopogaas seemed scared and hung back
a little nor did hans who with his usual
suspicion feared some trap nor or the mat-
ter of that did i though i thought it well
to appear much interested only robertson
seemed quite indifferent and trudged along
stolidly after a man carrying a torch

old billali put his head out of the litter
and shouted back to me to fear nothing

since there were no pitfalls in the path
voice echoing strangely between those
narrow walls of measureless height

  for half an hour or more we pursued
this dreary winding path round the cornel
of which the draught tore in gusts so here
that more than once the litters with the
wounded men and those who bore them
were nearly blown over it was safe
enough however since on either side of us
smooth and without break rose the she
walls of rock over which lay the ti
ribbon of blue sky at length the cle
widened somewliat and the light gre
stronger making the torches unnecessary
then of a sudden we came to its end an
found ourselves upon a little plateau
the mountainside behind us for a
sand feet or so rose the sheer rock wau
as it did upon the outer face while in fr
and beneath far beneath was a beautif
plain circular in shape and of great extend
which plain was everywhere surround
so far as i could see by the same wall 
rock in short notwithstanding its enr
mous size without doubt it was neitb
more nor less than the crater of a vas
extinct volcano lastly not far fro-
the centre of this plain was whidp j
to be a city since through my glasses
could see great walls built of stone and
i thought were house all of them 
character more substantial than any t
at this time i had discovered in the
of africa	

  i went to billalis litter and asked 
who lived in the city

   no one he answered  it has
dead for thousands of years but she-
commands is camped there at present w
an army and thither we go at once- 
ward bearers  

  so robertson and i having re-eu
our lit tore we started on down hill
rapid pace for the road though steep-
safe and kept in good order ah tbe
of that attemoon we travelled t
sunset reached the edge of the plain  r e

till v

 strong

 we baited a while to rest and eat
 light of the growing moon grew
 enough to enable us to proceed tj
 pogaas came up and spoke to me	

 here  a tortrew indeed macaco
rider haggard

  said  since none can climb that fence
rock in which the holes seem to be few
and small

  	yes i answered  but it is one out of
hich those who are in would find it difficult
get out we are buffalo in a pit umslo-
pgaas

   that is so he answered  i have
ught it already but if any would
netlle with us we still have our horns and
can toss for a while

  then he went back to his men

the sunset in that great solemn place
 a wonderful thing to see first of all
 measureless crater was filled with light
ulce a bowl with fire then as the great orb
behind the western cliff half of the
became quite dark while shadows
med to rush forward over the eastern
part of its surface till that too was swal-
wd up in gloom and for a little while
 remained only a glow reflected from
cliff face and from the sky above while
 the crest of the parapet of rock played
trange and glorious fires presently these
vanished and the world was dark

  then the half moon broke from behind

	hank of clouds and by its silver uncertain
jjht we struggled forward across the flat
in- rather slowly now for even the iron
vies of those bearers grew tired i
i not see much of it but i gathered

hat

we were passing through crops very
 crops to judge by their height as
tdtless they would be upon this lava
also once or twice we splashed
ogh streams

  length being tired and lulled by the
ying of the litter and by the sound of
w chant that the bearers had set
p now that they neared home and were
of no attack i sank into a doe
j cn i awoke again it was to find that the
had halted and to hear the voice of

     y-

fccend white lords and come with
companions the black slaughterer
 he yellow man who h named iight-
she-who-comtnands desires
w yoo at once before you eat and sleep
u mt not be kept waiting fear not
the others they will be cared for till

chapter xii

the white witch

i descended from the litter and told the
others what the old fellow had said
robertson did not want to come and
indeed refused to do so until i suggested
to him that such conduct might prejudice
a powerful person against us umslopogaas
was indifferent putting as he remarked
no faith in a ruler who was a woman only
hans although he was so tired acquiesced
with some eagerness the fact being that
his brain was more alert and that he hid
all the curiosity of the monkey tribe which
he so much resembled in appearance anti
wanted to see this queen whom zikali
revered

  in the end we started conducted by
billali and by men who carried torches
whereof the light showed me that we were
passing between houses or at any rate
walls that had been those of houses and
along what seemed to be a paved street

  walking under what i took to be a great
arch or portico we came into a court that
was full of towering pillars but unroofed
for i could see the stars above at its end
we entered a building of which the doorway
was hung with mats to find that it was
lighted with lamps and that all down its
length on either side guards armed with
long spears stood at intervals

   oh  baas said hans hesitatingly
 this is the mouth of a trap while umslo-
pogaas glared about him suspiciously
fingering the handle of his great axe

   be silent i answered  all this
mountain is a trap therefore another does
not matter and we have our pistols

  walking forward between the double
line of guards who stood immovable as
statues wc came to some curtains hung at
the end of a long narrow hall which al-
though i know little ol such things were
i noted made of rich stuff embroidered in
colours and with golden threads before
these curtains btllali motioned to us to
halt then after a whispered colloquy
with some one beyond earned on through
the join of the curtains he vanished
between them leaving u alone far five
minutes or more at length they opened


hutchinsons story magazine

and a tall and elegant woman with an
arab cast of countenance and clad in white
robes appeared and beckoned to us to
enter she did not speak or answer when
i spoke to her which was not wonderful
as afterwards i discovered that she was a
mute we went in i wondering very
much what we were going to see

   on the further side of the curtains was a
room of no great ize illumined with lamps
of which the light fell upon sculptured
walls it looked to me as though it might
once have been the inmost court or a
sanctuary of some temple for at its head
was a dais upon which once perhaps had
stood the shrine or statue of a god on
this dais there was now a couch and on the
couch-a goddess

   there she sat straight and still clothed
in shining white and veiled but with her
draperies so arranged that they emphasised
rather than concealed the wonderful
elegance of her tall form moreover from
beneath the veil which was such as a bride
wears appeared two plaits of glossy raven
hair of great length to the end of each of
which was suspended a single large pearl
on either side of her stood a tall woman
like to her who had led us through the
curtains and on his knees in front but to
the right knelt billali

  about this seated personage there was
nn air of singular majesty such as might
pervade a queen as fancy paints her though
she had a nobler figure than any queen i
ever saw depicted mystery seemed to
flow from her  it clothed her like the veil
she wore which of course heightened the
effcct beauty flowed from her also
although it was shrouded i knew that it
was there no veil or coverings could obscure
it at least to my imagination moreover
she breathed out power  one felt it in the
air as one feels a thunderstorm before it
breaks and it seethed to me that this power
was not quite human that it drew its
strength from afar and dwelt a stranger to
the earth

   to tell the truth although my curiosity
always strong was enormously excited and
though now  felt glad that i had attempted
this journey with all its perils i was hor-
ribly afraid so much afraid that i should

have liked to turn and run away from tb
beginning i knew myself to be in the prc-
ence of an unearthly being clothed in 
and perfect womans flesh something alie
too and different from humanity

  what a picture it all made  there sb
sat quiet and stately as a perfect
statue  only her breast rising and iali
beneath the white robe showed that sbe
was alive and breathed as others
another thing showed it also-her eve-
at first i could not see them through tb
veil but presently either because i g
accustomed to the light or becausc twf
brightened as those of certain animals ha
power to do when they watch intently  
ceased to be a covering to them distinctly 
saw them now large and dark and splendi
with a tinge of deep blue in the iris allurio
and yet awful in their majestic aloofn
which seemed to look through and beyo
to embrace all without seeking and with-
effort those eyes were like windo
through which light flows from within
light of the spirit

    glanced round to see the effect of dj 
vision upon my companions it was
peculiar hans had sunk to his knees 
hands were joined in the attitude of
and his ugly little face reminded me of tw 
of a big fish out of water and dying
excess of air robertson startled out
his abstraction stared at the royal won
on the couch with his mouth open	

   man he whispered  ive got the
back although i have touched nothing
weeks only this time they arc	i

for yons no human lady i feel it in

  umslopogaas stood great and grim -
hands resting on the handle of his tall

either aide of her stood a tall woman like to her who had led us through the curtain and
on his knees in front but to the right knelt billali
hutchinsons story magazine

amid the rush of sensations this one had
scarcely disentangled itself in my mind i
looked at the draped shape and saw-well
never mind whom i saw  it was not one
only but several in sequence  also a woman
who at that time  did not know although
i came to know her afterwards too well
perhaps or at any rate quite enough to
puzzle me- the odd thing was that in this
hallucination the personalities of these
individuals seemed to overlap and merge
till at last i began to wonder whether they
were not parts of the same entity or being
manifesting itself in sundry shapes yet
springing from the same centre as different
coloured rays of light flow from the same
crystal while the beams from the source
of light shift and change but the thing
is too metaphysical for my poor powers to
express as clearly as i would also no
doubt it was but an hallucination that had
its origin perhaps in the mischievous brain
of her who sat before us

  at length she spoke and her voicesoundod
like silver bells heard over water in a great
calm it was low and sweet oh  so sweet
that at its first notes for a moment my senses
seemed to swoon and my pulse to stop it
was to me that she addressed herself

   my servant here and ever so slightly
she turned her head towards the kneeling
billali  tells me that you who are named
watcher - in - the - night understand tlie
tongue in which i speak to you is it so  

   i understand arabic of a kind well
enough having learned it on the east
coast and from arabs in past years but

not such arabic as you use o- and i

paused

   call ine hiya she broke in v which is
my title here meaning as you know she
or woman or if that docs not please you
call me ayesha it would rejoice me after
so long to hear the name i bore spoken by
the lips of one of my colour and of genuo
blood

  i blushed at the compliment so artfully
conveyed and repeated stupidly enough

   not such arabic a you use o-
aycha

    i thought that you would like the sound
of the word better than that of hiya
though afterwards i will teach you to pro-

nounce it as you should o-have you any
other name save watcher-by-night which
seems also to be a title  

   yes i answered  allan

   o-allan tell me of these sb
went on quickly indicating my companion
with a sweep of her slender hand  for the
do not speak arabic  think or stay i
tell you of them and you shall say if i do
so rightly this one and she nodded 
towards robertson  is a man bemused
there comes from him a colour which i s
though youcannotandthatcolour betoken 
a desire for revenge though i think that 
his time he has desired other things also

i remember men always did from tto j
beginning to their ruin human natu
does not change o allan and wine a 
women are ancient snares enough of bit
for this time the little yellow one there j 
afraid of me as all of you are that  t
womans greatest power although she is
weak and gentle men are still afraid of t
just because they are so stupid that thf
cannot understand her to them after 
million years she still remains the linkn
and to us upon the earth all the unkno 
is also the terrible	 i

   now of the last this black one her
think is a man indeed a warrior of wafrioj
such as there used to be in the early woo
if a savage well believe me	

savages are often the best moreover 
are still savage at heart even yon and 
for what is termed culture is but coat op
coat of paint laid on to hide our
colour and often there is poison in the p
that axe of his has drunk deep i
though always in fair fight ami i y  
it shall drink deeper yet have i 
these men aright o allan  

   not so ill i answered	 

   i thought it she said with a ma
laugh  although at this place i ru 
grow dull like an unused sword  jpif
would rest go-all of you to-fl i
you and i will talk alone fear nothngiy

them hence anl shewaved her hand to
gaify that the audience was ended

  at this sign hans who apparently was
tqo much afraid rose from his knees and
hterally bolted through the curtains
cbertson followed him umslopogaas
tood a moment drew himself up and
lifting the great axe cried dayite after
which he too turned and went

   what does that word mean o allan  
    asked

i explained that it was the salutation
hich the zulu people only give to kings
did i not say that savages are often the
  she exclaimed in a gratified voice
the white man your companion gave me
salute but the black one knows when
nestands before a woman who is royal
he too is of roval blood in his own
unj i said

    if so we are akin o allan

  then i bowed deeply to her in my best
auicr and rising from her couch for the
time she stood up looking very tall and
inarling and bowed back

jfter this i went to find the others on the
r    curtains except hans
had run down the long narrow hall and
fuh the mats at its end we followed
rching with dignity behind billali
cn the double line of guards who
d their spears as we passed them and
w he further side of the mats discovered
n still locking terrified

baas he said to me as we threaded our
through tlie court of columns  in my
have seen all kinds of dreadful things
 faced them but never have i been so
 afraid as  am of that white witch
i think that she is the devil of whom
verend father the pncdikant used to
  much or perhaps his wife

 f so hans i answered  the devil
 black as he is painted but i
you to be careful of what you say
e may have long ears
doesnt matter at all what one says
u  because she reads thoughts before

 th tllc   fet hcr flon there
j- lt room and do you be careful

    	or she will eat up your spirit and make
     u love with her who i expect is

rv

    ly inileed since otherwise she would

not wear a veil whoever saw a pretty
woman tie up her head in a sack baas  

   perhaps she does this because she is so
beautiful hans that she fears the hearts of
men who look upon her would melt

   oh  no baas all women want to
melt mens hearts  the more the better
they seem to have other things in their
minds but really they think of nothing else
until they are too old and ugly and it takes
them a long while to be sure of that

  so hans went on talking his shrewd
nonsense till following so far as i could see
the same road as that by which we had
come we reached our quarters where we
found food prepared for us broiled goats
flesh with comcakes and milk i think it
was also beds for us two white men covered
with skin rugs and blankets woven of
wool

  these quarters i should explain con-
sisted of rooms in a house built of stone of
which the walls had once been painted the
roof of the house was gone now for we could
see the stars shining above us but as the
air was very soft in this sheltered plain this
was an advantage rather than otherwise
the largest room was reserved for robert-
son and myself while another at the back
was given to umslopogaas and his zulus
and a third to the two wbunded men
billali showed us these arrangements by
the light of lamps and apologised that they
were not better because as he explained
the place was a ruin and there had been no
time to build us a house he added that
we might sleep without fear as we were
guarded and none would dare to harm the
guests of she-wlio-commands on whom he
was sure we or at any rate i and the black
slaughterer had produced an excellent
impression then be bowed himself out
saying that he would return in the morning
and left us to our own devices

  robertson and i sat down on stools that
had been set for us and ate but he seemed
so overcome by his experiences or by his
sombre thoughts that i could not draw him
into conversation all he remarked was
that wp had fallen into queer company and
that those who supped with satan needed
a long spoon having delivered himself of
this sentiment he threw himself upon the


 hutchinsons story magazine

bed prayed aloud for a while as had become
his fashion to be  protected from warlocks
and witchcs  amongst other things and
went to sleep

  before i turned in i visited umslopo-
gaass room to see that all was well with
him and his people and found him standing
in the doorway staring at the star-spangled
sky

  greeting macumazahn he said  you
who are white and wise and i who am black
and a warrior have seen many strange
things beneath the sun but never such a
one as we have looked upon to-night who
and what is that chieftainess macu-
mazahn  

    i do not know i said  but it is worth
while to have lived to look upon her even
though she be veiled

   nor do i macumazahn nay i do
know for my heart tells me that she is the
greatest of all witches and that you will do
well to guard your spirit lest she should steal
it away if she were not a witch should i
have seemed to behold the shape of nada
the lily who was the wife of my youth
beneath those white robes of hers and
though the tongue in which she spoke was
strange to me to hear the murmur of
nadas voice from between her lips of nada
who lias gone further from me than those
stars it is good that you wear the great
mcdicine of zikali upon your breast macu-
mazahn for perhaps it will shield you from
harm at those hands that are shaped of
ivory

   zikali is another of the tribe i
answered laughing  although less beauti-
ful to see also i am not afraid of any of
them and from this one if she be more
than some white woman whom it pleases to
veil herself i shall hope to gather wisdom

   aye macumazahn such wisdom as
spirits and the dead have to give

   mayhap umslopogaas but we came
here to seek spirits and the dead did we
not  

   aye answered umslopogaas  these
and war and i think that we shall find
enough of all three only i hope tfct war
will come the first lest the spirits and the
dead should bewitch me and take away my
skill and courage

  then we parted and too tired even to
wonder any more i threw myself down o
my bed and slept

  i was awakened when the sun was al-
ready high by the sound of robertson who
was on his knees praying aloud as usual-
a habit of his which i confess got on
nerves prayer in my opinion is a private
matter between man and his creator that
is except in church  further i did not i
the least wish to hear all about robertson 
sins which seemed to have been many anl
peculiar it is bad enough to have to bear
the burden of ones own transgression
without learning of those of other people
that is unless one is a priest and must do
professionally so i jumped up to escap
and make arrangements for a wash onl
to butt into old billali who was standing
in the doorway contemplating robertson 
with much interest and stroking his whie
beard

  he greeted me with hi courteous bo
and said

tell your companion o watcher

tha

it is not necessary for him to go upon - 
knees to she-who-commands-and must 
obeyed he added with emphasis 	i

he is not in her presence and that even to
he would do well to keep silent sine  
much talking in a strange tongue
annoy her

  i burst out laughing and answered

   he does not go upon his knees j
pray to she-who-commands but to
great one in the sky	jt

   indeed watcher well we only
a great one who is upon the earth
it is true that perhaps she visits tlic 
sometimes

    is it so billali   i answered
jously  and now i would ask you to
ine to some place where i can bathe- it
 it is ready he replied  otaep

  so i called to han who was
about with a rifle on his arm to follow
a cloth and soap of which fortunaty

hi

had a couple of pieccs lct and we
along what had once been a paved i
running between stone house of 

 us icn anii
 along what bad once been a paved

rhic

time-eaten ruinsst ill remained on

 who and what is this queen of v


 billali 

 she

i asked as we went  surely

 not of the amahagger blood

 ask it of herself o watcher for i
nnot tell you all i know is that i can
cc my own family for ten generations
 nd that my tenth forefather told his son
his deathbed for the saying has come
through his descendants that when
e was young she-who-commands had
the land for more hundreds of years
 an he could count months of life

    i stopped and stared at him since the
    was so amazing that it seemed to deprive

    	of the power of motion noting my very
  lous disbelief he continued blandly

     if you doubt ask and now here is
 re you may wash

then he led me through an arched door
v and down a wrecked passage to what
obviously had once been a splendid
such  some i have seen
i utures  that were built by the romans
size was that of a large room  it was
tnictcd of a kind of marble with a
ng bottom tliat varied fromthree to
feet in depth and water still ran in
  out of it through large glazed pipes

reover around it was a footway about
ij across from which opened cham
unroofed now that the bathers once
as dressing-rooms while between these
pben stood the remains of statues
 at the end indeed where an alcove had
sd it from sun and weather was still
perfect except for the outstretched
jj vlich were gone the right hand i
lcd lying at the bottom of the bath
s that of a nude young woman in the
of diving a very beautiful lit of
r  thought though of course i am no
of sculpture even the smile mingled
tcplalin upon the girl s face lxuig
osturaly portrayed
statue showed two things that the
jwa used by females and that the
who had built it were highly civilised

belonged to an advanced if some-
eastern race since the girls nose
hfcj ythinj semitic in character and
pfr though prettily shaped were full
e rst the basin was so clean that i
hk  t  must have bwn made ready for
r other recent bathers and at its

rider haggard

bottom i discovered gratings and broken
pipes of earthenware which suggested
that in the old days the water could be
warmed by means of a furnace

  in this relic of a long-past civilisation
which excited hans even more than it did
myself since having never seen anything of
the sort he thought it so strange that as
he informed me he imagined that it must
have been built by witchcraft i had a most
delightful bathe even hans was per-
suaded to follow my example a tiling i had
rarely known him do before and seated in
its shallowest part splashed some water
over his yellow wrinkled anatomy then we
returned to our house where i found an ex-
cellent breakfast had been provided which
was brought to us by tall silent handsome
women who surveyed us out of the corners
of their eyes but said nothing at all

  shortly after i had finished my meal
billali who had disappeared came back
again and said that she-who-commanded
desired my presence as she would speak
with me  also that i must come alone
so after attending to the wounded who
both seemed to be getting on well i went
followed by hans armed with his rifle
though i only carried my revolver

  robertson wished to accompany me as he
did not seem to care about being left alone
with the zulus in that strange place but
billali would not allow it indeed when
he persisted two great men stepped forward
and crossed their spears before him in a
somewhat threatening fashion then at
my entreaty for i feared lest trouble should
arise he gave in and returned to the house

  following our path of the night before
we walked up a ruined street which i could
see was only one of scores in what had once
been a very great city until we came to the
archway tliat i have mentioned a great one
now overgrown with plants which from their
yellow sweet-seen ted bloom i judged to
be a species of wallflower also with a kind
of ho use leek or saxifrage here haas was
stopped by guards billali explaining to me
that lie must await my return an order
which ne obeyed unwillingly enough then
i went on down the narrow passage lined
as before by guards who stood silent as
statues and came to the curtains at the end


hutchinsons story magazine

here at a motion from billali who did not
seem to dare to speak in this place i stood
still and waited

chapter xiii

allan hears a strange tale

for some minutes i remained before
those curtains until had it not been for
something electric in the air which got
into my bones a kind of force that perhaps
in my fancy only seemed to pervade the
place i should certainly have grown bored
indeed i was about to ask my companion
why he did not announce our arrival instead
of standing there like a stuck pig with his
eyes shut as though in prayer or meditation
when the curtains parted and from between
them appeared one of those tall waiting-
women whom we had seen on the previous
night she contemplated us gravely for a
few moments then moved her hand twice
once forward towards billali as a signal to
him to retire which he did with great
rapidity and next in a beckoning fashion
towards myself as a signal to me to follow
her

  i obeyed passing between the thick
curtains which she fastened in some way
behind me and found myself in the same
roofed and sculptured room that i have
already described only now there were
no lamps such light as penetrated it coming
from an opening above that i could not see
and falling upon the dais at its head also
on her who sat upon the dais

  yes there she sat in her white robes and
veil the point and centre of a little lake
of light a wondrous ami in a sense a
spiritual vision for in truth there was
something about her which was not of the
world something that drew and yet fright-
ened me still as a statue she sat like one
to whom time is of no account and who
has grown weary of motion and on cither
side of her yet more still like caryatides
supporting a shrine stood two of the stately
women who were h-r attendants for the
rest a sweet and subtle odour pervaded the
chamber which took hold of my senses as
hachich might do which i was sure pro-
ceeded from her or from her garments
for i could see no perfumes burning she

spoke no word yet i knew she was irviutt
me to come nearer and moved forward
i reached a curious carved chair that was
placed just beneath the dais and thett
halted not liking to sit down with
permission

  for a long while she contemplated me
as before i could feel her eyes searching ne
from head to foot and as it were lookis
through me as though she would discover
my very soul

  then at length she moved waving thos
two ivory arms of hers outwards with  
kind of swimming stroke whereon th
women to right and left of her turned 
glided away i know not whither

   sit allan she said  and let us talfc
for i think we have much to say to eac
other have you slept well  and eate
though i fear that the food is but rough
also was the bath made ready for you 

   yes o ayesha i answered to all
questions adding for i knew not what
say  it seems to be a very ancient bath-

   when last i saw it site replied
was well enough with statues staud
round it worked by a sculptor who h
seen beauty in his dreams but in
thousand years-or is it more -the towgl
of time bites deep and doubtless mw
else in this dead place it is now a ruin 

  i coughed to cover up tbe exclamation
disbelief that rose to my lips and renunj
blandly that two thousand years was j
tainly a long time

   when you say one thing allan jl
mean another your arabic is even
vile than usual and does not serve to cwl

your thought

   it may be so o ayesha for i 
know that tongue as i do many other  
dialects of africa by learning it from 
non men my own speech it english 
which if you are acquainted with 
should prefer to talk

   i know not english which doubth-
some language that has arisen since
the world perhaps by and by you 
teach it to me but  tell you yoo ang 
whom it is not well to anger because

my hp

and

 believe nothing that
 do not dare to say so	jfl

  how can i believe one o avcsha


   i understand aright speaks of having
 gen a certain bath two thousand years ago
 whereas one hundred years are mans
 utnost days  forgive me therefore if i
 not believe what i know to be untrue

 nov- i thought that she would be very
 ngry and was sorry that i had spoken
 t as it happened she was not
 rj u must have courage to give me the
 jj so boldly and i like courage she said
 ho have been cringed to for so long
 ek  cnow that you are brave who
 heard how you bore yourself in the
 rt yesterday and much else about you
 think that we shall be friends but-seek
 more

  what else should i seek o ayesha  
   ked innocently

  now you are lying again she said
  know well that no man who is a
 j sees a woman who is beautiful and
 him without wondering should he
 t if she couldcome to love him that
   she be young
 j that at least is not possible when
  has seen two thiusand years after
 time naturally she would prefer to
 veil  exclaimed boldly seeking to
  the argument into which i saw she
 d to drag me

         	 she answered  i think the little
 man who is named light-in-dark-
  put that thought into your heart oh

 trouble as to how i know it who have
 so uy pica lcrc as he guessed well enough
 ionian who has lived two thousand

   -	ust be hideous and wrinkled must
 c tamp of youth and loveliness
  ng have fled from her  of that you
 man axe sure very well now
   tertpt me to do what  had determined
 lit l ot do and you shall pluck the
   tree of curiosity which grows so
 you look o allan and say
 i hvkr  am oli and hideous even though
 lvd two thousand years upon the
 yw mayhap many more

        se lilted her hands and did somc-
 vjy  er vttfl so that for a moment
  l moment her face was revealed

  i	the veil fell into its place

uqv i uw and if that chair had

	back i believe that i should have

rider haggard

fallen out of it to the ground as for what
i saw-well it cannot be described at any
rate by me except perhaps as a flash of
glory every man lias dreamed of perfect
beauty basing his ideas of it perhaps on
that of some woman he has met who
chanced to take his fancy with a few acces-
sories from splendid pictures or greek
statues thrown in plus a garnishment of
the imagination at any rate  have and
here was that perfect beauty multiplied
by ten such beauty that at the sight of it
the senses reeled and yet i repeat that
it is not to be described i do not know
what the nose or the lips were like  in
fact all that i can remember with dis-
tinctness is the splendour of the eyes of
which i had caught some hint through her
veil on the previous night oh t they were
wondrous those eyes but i cannot tell
their colour save that the groundwork of
them was black moreover they seemed to
be more than eyes as we understand them
they were indeed windows of the soul out
of which looked thought and majesty and
infinite wisdom mixed with all the allure-
ments and the mystery that we are accus-
tomed to see or to imagine in woman

  here let me say something at once if
this marvellous creature expected that the
revelation of her splendour was going to
make me her slave to cause me to fall in
love with her as it is called well she must
have been disappointed for it had no such
effect it frightened and in a sense humbled
me that is all for i felt myself to be in
the presence of something that was not
human something alien to me as a man
which i could fear and even adore as
humanity would adore wliat is divine but
with which i had no desire to mix more-
over was it divine or was it something very
different  i did not know-i only knew
that it was not for me  as soon should i
have thought of asking for a star to set
within my lantern

   think that she felt this felt that her
stmke was missed as the french say that is
if she meant to strike at all at this moment
of which i am not certain for it was in a
changed voice one with a suspicion of dull
in it that she said with a little laugh

   do you admit now o allan that a


 hutchinsons story magazine

 woman may be old and still remain fair and
 unwrinkled 

    i admit i answered although i was
 trembling so much that i could hardly
  speak with steadiness  that a woman may
 be splendid and lovely beyond anything that
 the mind of man can conceive whatever
 her age of which i know nothing and
 i would add this o ayesha that i thank
 you very much for having revealed to me
 the glory that is hid beneath your veil

    why   she asked and i thought that
 i detected curiosity in her question

    for this reason o ayesha that now
 there is no fear of my troubling you in
 such a fashion as you seemed to dread a
 little while ago as soon would a man
 desire to court the moon sailing in her silver
 loveliness through heaven

    the moon  it is strange that you
 should compare me to the moon she said
 musingly  do you know that the moon
 was a great goddess in old egypt and that
 her name was isis and-well once i had to
 do with isis  perhaps you were there and
 knew it since more lives than one are given
 to most of us i must search and learn
 for the rest all have not thought as you
 do allan many on the contrary love
 and seek to win the divine

    so do i at a distance o ayesha but to
 come too near to it i will not presume
 knowing that i might be consumed

    you have wisdom she replied not
 without admiration  the moths are few
 that fear the flame but those are the moths
 which live why do you come to me and
 what do you seek of me o allan watcher-
 in-the-night  say it truthfully for though
 i may laugh at lies and pass them by when
 they have to do with the eternal swordptay
 which nature decrees between man and
 woman until they break apart or casting
 down the swords seek arms in which they
 agree too well when they haveho do with
 policy and high purpose and ambitions
 ends why then i avenge them upon the
 liar

    now i hesitated as what i had to urll her
 seemed so foolish indeed o insane while
 she waited patiently as though to givr me
 time to shape my thoughts speaking at
 last because i must i said

   i come to ask you o ayesha to sho
me the dead if the dead still live elsewhere f
 and who told you o allan that i j
could show you the dead if they are no
truly dead  there is but one i think anc
if you are his messenger show me hi
token for without it we do not speak
together of this business

   what token   i asked innocently
though i guessed her meaning well enough
she searched me with her great eyes lf
 felt and indeed saw them on me through i
the veil then answered	

   i think-nay let me be sure j
half-rising from the couch she bent hj
head over a tripod at her side and stare
into what seemed to be a bowl of crystal

if i read aright she said straightening
herself presently it is a hideous thiofc
enough the carving of an abortion ol 
man such as no woman would care to
on lest her babe should bear its stamp
a charmed thing also that has virtue 
him who wears it especially for you 
allan since something tells me that k i
dyed with the blood of one who loved y

if you have it let it be revealed since lt
out it i do not talk with you of your dead-
now i drew the talisman from its hidwjj
place and held it towards her

  give it me she said	b

  i was about to obey when sodjetw
seemed to warn me not to do so	j

   nay i answered  he who lent
this carving for a while chargcd me th 
except in emergency to save others i rr
wear it night and day until i returned j
to his hand saying that if i parted
fortune would desert me i did not beje 
and tned to be rid of it whereon death j 
near to me from a snake such a
i see you wear about you which doub 
has poison in its fang if of another s
ayesha	jh

   draw near she ud  and let tt 

 man be not afraid

  so i rose from my chair and knelt 
her hoping secretly that no one wool 
me in that ridiculous position whi j
most unsuspicious might misinterp
admit however that it proved t
compensations since even through th

i saw her marvellous eyes better

had done before and something of the pure
outline of her classic face also the fragrance
of her hair was wonderful

  she took the talisman in her hand and
examined it closely

   i have heard of this charm and it is
true that the thing has power she said
 for i can feel it running through my
veins also that it is a shield of defence to
him who wears it yes and now i under-
stand what perplexed me somewhat
namely how it came about that when you
vexed me into unveiling-but let that
matter be the wisdom was not your own
but anothers that is all yes the wisdom
of one whose years have borne him beyond
the shafts that fly from womans eyes the
ruinous shafts that bring men to doom and
nothingness tell me allan is this the
likeness of him who gave it yon  

   yes o ayesha the very picture as i
think carved by himself though he said
that it is ancient and others tell that it
has been known in the land for centuries

   so perchance has he she answered
drily  since some of our company live long
now tell me this wizards name nay
wait awhile for i would prove that indeed
you are his messenger with whom i may
talk about the dead and other things o
allan you can read arabic can you not  
 a little i answered

  then from a stool at her side she took
paper or rather papyrus and a reed pen
and on her knee wrote something on the
sheet which she gave to me folded up

   now tell me the names she said
 and then let us see if they tally with
what i have written for if so you are a
true man not a wanderer or spy

   the principal names of this doctor are
zikali the opener of roads the  thing-
that-should-never-have-been-bom  i
answered

   read the writing allan

  i unfolded the sheet and read arabic
words which meant  weapons  cleav
of rocks one at whom dogs bark aiw
children wail

   the last two are near enough she
said  but the first is wrong

   nay ayesha since in this ma
tongue zikali means  weapons  intem
ence at which she clapped her hands a 
merry girl might do  the man i
on  is without doubt a great doctor
who sees and knows things that others can
not but i do not understand why
token carved in his likeness should ha j
power as you say it has	jh

   because with it goes his spirit 
allan have you never heard of
egyptians a very wise people ho 
i remember declared that man has 
ka or double a second self that c
dwell in their statues or be sent
away  

  i answered that f had heard this	

   well the ka of this zikali goes ith
that hideous image of him which is perhap
why you have come safe through
dangers and why i seemed to drean
much of him last night also say
what does zikali want of me whose
he knows very well  	j

  an oracle the answer to a riddle
ayesha

   then set it out another time so
desire to see the dead and this old
who is a home of wisdom desires an of 
from one who is greater than lie go 
and what are you or both of you prepa
to pay for these boons  know allan  
i am a merchant who sell my favours
tell me then will you pay  

   i think that it depends upon the p

i answered cautiously  set out

   little signs that reveal character at a glance-

   plain as print when you know how to read them

 ne evening a few months ago i move him it is all as clear as a book
 happened to be in my club after when you know the simple alphabet of

dinner  whom should  run into
y old friend john cogan

fcjur talk gradually veered round to
 nes but no ordin ary  shop talk -
found myself getting a new point
on meeting and dealing with

john cogan is called practical he
j  thoroughgoing business man and
ays a good salesman so he took
du itiewhat by surprise when he told
jjaprofos of a big deal that he had
k put through-that in the last few
wl  he had learned more about get-
 on wjth people and about selling
all his previous years of ex-

 cd him how  by learning how
 people-from their faces from
tward appearance how to look
through them instead of merely
 ctn was his answer

 have learned about judging
john continued  has already
f per cent to my sales and you
ve always done fairly well i can
itljh found now that  ued to fail
wpy because i can size them
sht and tell just how to get at
  right away with
ti r pcn up n a roundabout way
cr eak points are what kind of
uke the best appeal to each
hat facts or arguments will

signs that spell out a mans character
and his mental traits-an alphabet that
is surprisingly easy to learn

    from a strictly business standpoint
john went on  i consider this knack of
judging people at sight about the biggest
thing i ever picked up in my life and
yet learning it was a matter of only a few
spare half-hours while smoking my after-
dinner cigar

   maybe youve heard of dr k m h
blackford who for years has made a
business oi analysing character from
appearances one of the big agricultural
implement companies paid dr blackford
a record salary for choosing employees-
because of dr blackfords ability to tell
from an applicants looks whether he had
the stuff to make good and what kind of
a job he would fit into best instead of
being guided by an applicants record
or experience or references dr black-
ford judged hi good points and bad
joints his ability and dependability
entirely from what she could see of him
while taking his application other big
firms have also paid her big fees for
doing similar work

   i had read and heard enough about
dr blackfords work he continued  to
convince me that this was something
 wanted to learn i made careful in-
quiries i found that this individual
had taught the knack of judging to

thousands of men and women-from
ambitious clerks up to the managers of
large companies

  i have known john cogan for years
he isnt a man who lets mere enthusiasm
run away with him results are the
only things that count with him but
there was one point i didnt get-how
so busy a man as john cogan had found
time to take lessons from dr blackford
or anyone else

  nothing of the sort he exclaimed
when i asked him  dr blackford has
arranged the whole thing into seven
simple quick and easy lessons in printed
form-a sort of pocket course for busy
people one that they can read and study
after dinner at home in the train or at
any other time or place the lessons
are so simple and interesting that they
are more like a pastime than a study
my first evening on those lessons was
a real pleasure and the practical re-
sults began to show immediately-that
first evening gave me pointers that i
began to find useful the very next day
the rest was merely a matter of a little
more practice

	   

  i took john cogans suggestion and
wrote for the lessons that was about
three months ago now ive learned
the knack of reading people from the
outward signs-of telling what a man
or woman is like from what they look
like

  he didnt paint it a bit too strong-
cither the simplicity of it or the practical
everyday value of knowing how to judge
people instead of relying on mere hap-
hazard impressions about them thanks
to those seven easy lessons i can now
tell almost the minute i lay eyes on
people how to make them my friends
in cither a business or social way-how
to talk to them how to influence them
to the best advantage also i can tell
at a glance whom i can trust and whom
i cant the first time i see a man -
or woman either-i know more about

him than many of his friends do
years of acquaintance on top of
this those lessons have taught me 
about myself than i ever knew before
and when you come right down to
mighty few of us ever really know ojf
selves to say nothing of others
my mind those two points are two
the biggest factors in any kind of w 
or business-knowing yourself
knowing others no wonder mr l-
hawley wrote as follows-

   if i had known years ago vaa
have learned already from dr 
fords course the knowledge would
been worth a thousand times the
of these lessons to me

send no money

  next to the ability to read and

i	cant think of anything more pract
and useful to any man or woman  t
this easily-acquired ability to rc
others from selling all kinds of
to addressing a jury or winning
board of directors from cl 
-png then
ti others sc
-the ability to judge people at a
is a tremendous advantage whu
lack of it is a tremendous handicap
