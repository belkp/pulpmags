the wonders of the simple

by hugo gernsback

he most difficult things for
the human mind ever to un-
derstand are possibly the-to
us-simplest things and the
simplest phenomena in nature
it seems that nature has
conspired against us in such a way as to
keep the true essence of the material world
hidden from our knowledge perhaps for
ever as a matter of fact it is doubtful
that we can ever know from our own
senses the ultimate truth of anything in
our world

take for instance such a thing and as
simple to us as a light beam science to-
day knows little more about it than she
did two thousand years ago we do not
know whether light is composed of parti-
cles-as once imagined by newton-or
whether light is in the form of waves we
know nothing as to the propagation of
light in open space nor do we know much
of the composition of the sunlight in gene-
ral except that we may call it by other
names such as electro-magnetic waves
radiation and the like the same may be
said of all other radiations as well be-
cause practically nothing is known about
their innermost workings when we come
down to the final analysis

when we contemplate the simple phe-
nomenon manifest all around us every
moment which we call gravitation even
our best-informed scientists will cheerfully
admit that they know next to nothing
about it we do not even know the speed
of the propagation of gravitation whether
it be radiation or whether it be a ray or
beam or what not we havent the most
remote idea as to how long it takes gravi-
tation to travel a given distance for in-
stance suppose the moon were suddenly to
leave her accustomed orbit and fly off at a
tangent how long would it take the dis-
turbance created thereby to reach the
earth would the gravitational force travel
at the speed of light or would it be in-
stantaneous science has yet given us no
answer to this we simply do not know
what it is all about yet all around us
these mysterious forces go on right under
our own noses and we must admit that
we cannot solve the mystery at least so
far the reasons for our poor knowledge
of such simple phenomena may be far

more complicated than we can admit at
first as sir james jeans points out in
his recent book the mysterious universe
most of these unknowable things are prob-
ably unknowable only because most of the
ideas under discussion are mere creations
of our own minds

the human being after all is only a
complete biological accident and the hu-
man being has little relation to the world
at large and the human mind is prob-
ably constituted in such a manner that it
can no more understand the ultimate de-
signs of nature than a dog could under-
stand or even recognize a technical volume
on astronomy the dog could see the
book he could see the printed pages and
the illustrations but it would all mean
nothing to him-because his mind is con-
stituted on such an entirely different plane
of reasoning and to him of course the
book is totally meaningless

it is so with the human mind the
plane of our reasoning is probably entirely
out of any relationship to the ultimate de-
signs of nature and our reasoning in most
cases as to natures designs is probably
entirely irrelevant and certainly entirely
inadequate to comprehend what it is all
about the human mind immediately tries
to make a mechanical analogy of the un-
knowable when most probably there can-
not be a mechanical analogy for such so-
called simple things as a light beam or
gravitation it is even to be doubted that
our senses interpret the outside world at
all correctly and just because a number
of people arrive at a similar conclusion
that does not prove that the natural phe-
nomenon is in accordance with their un-
derstanding it may be something entire-
ly different

for instance a few hundred years ago
it was entirely contradictory to the best
human reasoning that part of the worlds
inhabitants could face the sky one way
while the rest would face it another way
one part seemingly standing upright
the other part seemingly hanging with their
heads down it took a long time to di-
gest even this simple proposition which is
entirely contrary to human instincts and
human reasoning it may be so with most
of the other phenomena which we witness
with our imperfect and usually misguided
senses

dust of destruction

v	 by p schuyler miller

rays  

cjttustrated by paul

melted and fell hissing intelligence directed those
the intelligence that threatened the earth


dust of destruction



this old earth of ours has passed
through some pretty severe crises in its
long and fruitful career as a minor planet-
afflicted with a variety of life-but never
has its danger been so
great as in the frantic 
weeks following the
inverted cyclone of
august   i
was near norfolk
when it happened i
was one of the little
group that saw the
thing through to the
end and now that it is
over i am attempting
a narrative that will

set forth in a fashion
more readable than
technical the story of
the death-dust from
the moon-the green
dust of destruction

in  norfolk
nebraska was a city
of perhaps twenty
thousand people no
one knows why the
dust struck there first
but the fact remains
that it did the
things had probably
been experimenting
for some time with a
sort of sliding-scale of
frequencies before they
hit on what they were
looking for and there
is ample evidence of
extreme auroral acti-
vity and atmospheric
fluorescence for years
back the day be-
fore tuesday the nd
i had been motoring
west on a canvassing
trip and i remember



a s our author states
this old earth has
passed thru some pretty
severe crises in its long and
fruitful career and so has
the human race for that
matter we have won
what civilization and com-
fort we now possess only
by the bitterest struggle for
millions of years against
the onslaughts of nature
and other forms of life

and even what we have
now we hold by a thread
our life on earth is so un-
certain that it would need
only a very minor change
in physical conditions to
wipe us from the face of
the globe a change of a
relatively few degrees in
temperature either way a
change in the composition
of the atmosphere a minor
solar disturbance are all
things that are unimportant
in the cosmos but totally
disastrous for us

mr miller is no pessimist
but he treats in a new ori-
ginal and refreshing fash-
ion of some of the troubles
that might befall our old
race and globe at any time
he shows too that inside
of all of us even the most
callous there exists the hero
and the martyr given the
chance we would be willing
to protect and save the race
from any disaster though
our efforts may mean a
terrible agony and even
death this is a most unu-
sual story

that the radios of
eastern nebraska were raising a brand of
cain that even my patent static eliminator
could not iron out

at  on that wednesday morning i was

burning up the road between stanton and
norfolk and had stopped for gas about ten
miles from the latter city not far beyond
stanton where i had miraculously filled
my sales quota during
a lull in the interfer-
ence the day before
the moon was well
past full hanging low
in a cloudless sky i
remember talking with
the proprietor of the
gas station about the
rocket that norfolks
favorite son my old
pal dick haverford
meant to aim at the
moon in a week or so
as soon as he gave it
enough test-flights in
the upper atmosphere
i jokingly said that i
was willing to throw
over my job if he
would take me along
and the proprietor
called me a fool and
flooded the tank over
effectively transferring
the compliment

i was sunk to the
back teeth in what is
generally called a
horse-laugh when out
of the west came a
flash of blinding light
followed by a shatter-
ing crash of sound
that rattled my wind-
shield and splintered
the closed windows of
the gas station then
from the east came a
wind-the wind-and
like a man in a dream
i watched my hat scale
off down the road
toward a murky pillar
of smoke or dust that was vomiting into the
sky over norfolk the station was sheltered
by a low hill of sorts but in front at the
side of the road grew a real old new eng-


wonder stories

land elm over a hundred feet tall shading
the station with its great green umbrella

now as i watched it the green leaf sur-
faces turned to show their pale under sides
with the coming breeze then the twigs
began to bend and let their leafy ends
stream out toward the west not with the fit-
ful tossing of a brewing storm but slowly
steadily as if a mounting force were draw-
ing them out and now i saw that the
great upper branches were twisting and
bending to give way to the wind slowly
like a weary laborer bending to his load its
mighty green crown drooped and the six-
foot trunk took on a taut curve and then
it broke with a white flare of splintered
wood it went bobbing off
down the road like a
giant stalked tumbleweed
while the shattered stump
screamed aloud with vi-
bration above the sullen
roar of the rising wind

sand and gravel splat-
tered the back of the car
and i looked around to
see that the top of the lit-
tle cut that sheltered the
station was being torn
down by the wind all
manner of things were
tearing past and over-
head-roofs uprooted or
broken trees and bushes
the tops of autos-and
still the wind mounted
with its droning roar a queer unreal quality
of leisurely sleepy growth in its tone as
the wall of the cut wore lower great air
currents ripped nearer my car where i sat
in a sort of daze i could detect now an
ugly whine lurking under the sullen roar

everything happened at once there
was a new crash from beyond the edge of
the cut and the fat proprietor fairly dove
into my open car as a huge bushy maple
popped over the rim and crashed full into
our rear driving me headlong into the open
in an instant the tempest caught us the
open top flapped forward and off with a
snarl of ripping fabric and i was bowling
down the open road with the owner of the

gas-station gripping my neck in a frantic
stranglehold-

the wheel was no good for steering-it
was of use only as a pillar a post to which
i could cling the road ran straight for a
mile or so and for maybe a minute we
swept smoothly between stripped fields
where the grain clung in a mat to the
ground then we struck a curve and the
buick took a wire fence below the level of
the road like a racing greyhound struck
in a swampy meadow and somersaulted end
for end i felt the garage man loosen his
grip then sensed a changing perspective
of earth and sky and my own grip loosened
and i was being carried bodily by the wind

the other man was now
a blurred form in the air
ahead

ur tattered clothes
offered little gliding
surface and gravity very
soon asserted itself a
second fence loomed pro-
bably the other side of
the field the other fel-
low cleared it with a foot
to spare and vanished in
the dust beyond but i
met it fair and square
and with a crack of rotten
posts and screech of
freed wire was rolling
head over heels through
the water-stripped mire
of a small pond with
an ominous buzz of splintered fibers anoth-
er elm whipped past me butt first and
struck the opposite bank of the pond driv-
ing deep into the mud

in the fraction of a second that its course
was checked i found myself firmly wired
into the heart of the mass of stripped
branches and then my strange steed was
up-ending it across the fields filling me
with a wholesome fear of death every time
its mighty crown struck the ground and
new splinters sang around my head then
there would be a breathless rising glide-
a heart-shaking swoop-an instant of crash-
ing limbs and flying branches-then on
and up again
dust of destruction



i cant even start to describe that race
with the wind straight across nebraska
for ten fearful miles to the devastated city
of norfolk my tree was a big one and for
a large part of its trip it traveled crown
foremost dragging the heavy butt but every
now and then it would drop up-end and
drive like a dart until it struck some ob-
struction with a shattering crash and spun
end over end for a new start i know that
w drove clear through the walls of a farm-
house where people still clung for shelter
and that we hurtled through a brief grove of
splintered tree-stubs that were screaming
madly above the wind with shrill vibration
i knew too that the wind was falling some-
what for its throaty roar was growing deep-
er and lower but when the trunk of my
tree snapped off and we hit norfolk i can-
not tell i was probably unconscious

	 

a rising sun found me plastered amid
debris of tree and fence and city against
the still-standing wall of a bank-vault up
to my neck in a fluffy green dust that was
piled in great drifts and dunes all along the
remaining walls of norfolk to a keener
sense it might have been gritty for it seem-
ed angular and crystalline and on my ton-
gue it felt granular but to eyes and fingers
ir was merely a fluffy emerald powder that
seeped and drifted through and into every-
thing and everywhere it was light enough
to retain considerable air except where it
was packed in a thin crust along the walls
and when i felt something squirm against
my feet i was able to burrow in and drag
out the man still alive and kicking

he was a physical hercules but the wind
had stripped him clean for unlike me he
had had no buffer it was a miracle that
no bones were broken though his mighty
muscles were purple with the ruptured cap-
illaries of great livid bruises around his
waist still hung a cartridge belt and auto-
matic and in that instant i recognized the
face behind the tawny uncut hair and stub-
ble of beard he was red brockton
tramp and bank-robber whose pictures and
finger-prints adorned the post-office wall in
sheldon he showed signs of coming
around so my discretion prompted the

transfer of his little arsenal and my valor
consequently survived a rather abrupt de-
pression

i do not know how or where he had gone
to sleep but he woke with the fine green
dust in his hair and his ears and the barrel
of his own gun centered on his stomach
i had read somewhere that such a target
often secures a moral hit long before phy-
sical contact would register it seemed to
work

what the hell he wanted to know

i was noncommittal

leggo that gun-youre pointin at me
he bellowed peevedly

nix i informed him im perfectly
comfortable as is you just lean back and
contemplate nature at her best-or worst
if you like it better

funny guy aint you well the leads
yours-i pass whats your hand

i have openers-or an opener

yeah  had it last deal

sure but this is now-and here feel-
ing at all agreeable and open to sugges-
tion

that depends

naturally listen here im going to
make you a proposition are you listening
to it

shoot

its this way i dont have to tell you
that something or other has raised particular
hell right here where were sitting and for
plenty of miles around were luckier than
most so its our play well lets play it
and play it straight

urn go ahead with the spiel

i guess there are plenty of people
around here who need help and not too
many to help em the really lucky ones
are dead im pretty well and you look
as if you could still lift a safe or so under
the sore part i know you or i wouldnt
have your gun but my memory isnt so
good after ive been working hard for a
spell-say at relief work-and i have an
idea there will be others around who have
just about the same kind of memory of
course if im lifting houses off of people
im going to need both hands but thats no


wonder stories

drawback if you have everything straight
how about it

well its a proposition suppose i ac-
cepted an then plugged you

you couldnt  keep the gun

hell i thought there was a catch in
it how about afterward

afterward is none of my business that
i can see i woke up sitting on you and i
acted accordingly if we gang up on this
relief work youre just a husky house-lifter
so far as im concerned and if any police
turn up who have better memories than i
have then youre on your own unless you
want to take a chance on what pull i have
here in town

good with me feller im on you
know me well who are you while were
teamed up

call me hank if you want to it saves
time and its been done plenty of times
before if youre in a hurry you wont
use a name anyway so why worry

good with me you can stow the gun
if you want to my say-so is good

the city of the dead

together we climbed up on the flat
top of the wrecked vault and looked
around on every side the city lay in ruins
banked deep with the glittering green dust
of destruction like long drifts of powdered
jade or emerald and yet the green wasnt
quite so emerald or jade either it was
more like some of the spectrum lines my old
physics prof had showed me from the light
from some of the diffuse nebulae of the
milky way the wind had snuffed out any
fire that had started just as you would
blovf out a match all around us was just
a desert of green dunes and jutting ruins of
cement and metal-work whatever had hit
norfolk had hit unmercifully hard our
work would be all too easy

for three hours we searched the ruins of
norfolk for living victims of the storm-all
in vain what we did find sickened us until
we hated and feared to drag aside a timber
or dig into a mound of the green dust a
few like ourselves had been blown in from
outlying districts and were merely scratch-

ed or bruised-dead of shock mostly-but
of all the twenty thousand and more who
had lived in norfolk before the disaster
not one was alive or even recognizable when
the dawn of august  broke the dead
reminded me horribly of the old cruel ex-
periment of the frog in the exhausted bell-
jar for the awful truth was that every living
thing within the grasp of that inverted cy-
clone had exploded bloody ribbons of
terribly torn flesh remained clinging to
raw bones-no more

about noon of thursday we ceased our
dreadful search and hunted in the cellar of
a ruined grocery store for food water
there was in plenty spouting from broken
mains and piping washing away the light
green dust from the horrors that it hid

thanks to the incessant flow a thin green
mud was forming in all the depressions
mottled here and there by a hideous brown-
ing red that turned us weak and pale from
memories of what it meant no other re-
lief workers appeared they had enough
to do in the territory where the real hurri-
cane had laid the land waste for miles and
miles but with noon came a gleaming
shape of metal and crystal dropping slowly
from the clouds through the slow drizzle
of rain sending red in a headlong dive for
shelter it was a giant stream-lined rocket
such as theoretical publications had so often
shown soft golden vapor drumming gently
from three great jets as it eased to the clean-
swept intersection of norfolks two largest
streets

-	forgetting red for a moment i ran to
where it had landed banged with my grimy
fists at the polished walls rising a hundred
feet and more above me kicked frantically
at the unresponsive metal clawed at the port
whose outline i could see just above my
head i was mad with a mixture of relief
and terror joy and anger and like a child
i took it out in petulant physical defiance
of the great rocket

from far above a voice shouted angrily
hey you cut that out what do you
think youre doing anyway

that voice-dicks voice i stared up
fifty feet to an open port a head was
sticking out a brandished fist threatened
dust of destruction



me-dicks fist i let out one whoop of
joy jumped five feet in the air danced
from foot to foot in excited eagerness

hey dick its me its me-hank
come on down here and get me before i go
clean crazy

hank why you old son-of-a-gun-
what are you doing here where on earth
did you spring from hey doc for the
love of mike look whos here

another head popped out above his
white-whiskered like an image of george
bernard shaw in the old thirties-by all
the gods doc jarvis-old jarvis our phy-
sics prof what was going on here

a ladder of flexible cable unrolled from
the port dick scrambling down as fast as
it fell he dropped the last ten feet and
began to hammer me on the shoulder my
sore shoulder i hammered right back till
he quit

dick what has happened here how
did you escape and when did you finish
the rocket where have you been where
are you going how--

wait a minute what am i-a world
almanac give me time for the love of
mike and tell me how you get here and
struck it out without exploding when the
pressure went down

oh i came in with the wind but how
did you know they exploded here and-
hey wheres red

red who

why red brockton he was with me
a minute ago when you landed ill bet he
thought you were the police and lit out
hey -red where are you its all ok
come on out

police what kind of company are you
keeping anyway who is this red brock-
ton

never mind who he is if you dont know
now-he island thats enough maybe he
is wanted by the police but youre no more
of a preacher than i am and whats not my
business is none of yours sabe

oh sure no offense i just wonder-
ed

ok hes a hard liver but he worked
here with me like a regular man today and
im for him there he is-hey red
come on over here and meet my friend

i introduced him to dick and to
doc who had come down while we were
talking i told them what i had seen and
what had happened and red confirmed my
description of the catastrophe with a rather
guarded story similar to mine

and now where do you come in i
asked dick

we were on our first trial trip-five
hundred miles or so out of the atmosphere-
and we saw the thing hit and what happen-
ed and we came in as fast as we could with-
out heating up too much what you have
said confirms most of docs ideas and be-
lieve me this thing is plenty big the next
time it happens theyll have it under con-
trol and in quantity and then-goodbye
earth were done for-a race stamped
out completely-unless the four of us can
put a stop to whatever is brewing i take
you for granted hank youre one of us
how about you brockton

where you goin an how long

its the moon were aiming for and well
hit it we may not come back but well
die fighting for this old earth of ours it
will be a bigger lay than anything youve
been in brockton and youre big if you
join us you dont have to if you dont
want to but id like you along coming

good with me this state hasnt too
much love to waste on me and it wont put
me out any to leave it even for the moon
im with you

good and listen here-im not asking
who you are or what you are if hank
knows hell keep his mouth shut he
knows how im boss unless you all dis-
agree with me or were separated and thrown
on our own are you still with us

oh sure lets get goin if its like you
said it dont pay to stall any in a tight
place

right come on

chapter ii

the threat from beyond

in the main chamber of the rocket
the port was carefully sealed and doc
raised us while red and i stuck to the pad-
ded chairs it was just like going up in an
elevator the floor pressing hard on our
feet and our breath coming slowly to heavy
lungs for a moment after we got higher
doc threw in nearly full power and as the
great rocket sped ahead in its course we
were plastered into our air-cushions by the
enormous acceleration as if a giant were
shoving us back the cabin became a whirl
of bursting color-bombs and my blood
pounded in my ears but as our velocity
became constant or nearly so conditions
returned to normal and i felt able to look
from a port at the earth and to take notice
of the rocket itself

the clouds that the sudden storm had
brought rolled in a great white sea far be-
low us veiling the surface of the earth
which was already assuming the shape of a
great bowl to the west the mountains
were jutting above the low-hanging clouds
to the east appeared the momentary glint
of the great lakes and the deep green of
the appalachian forests as details melted
and faded one into the other the deserts
began to take on a reddish-yellow tint
they were at great variance with the mottled
green of the mississippi valley bounded on
the west by a chain of dazzling white
dappled with clouds through which the
great central rivers appeared in silver etch-
ing against the shadowed green-they were
a sight that no mans experience had equal-
led

the rocket itself was worthy of notice
the cabin where we were was roomy about
fifteen feet in diameter and of equal height
with heavily padded walls and ceiling
there was a broad seat running all round
the room padded with air-cushions of
course with straps set in the walls at
shoulder level here and there were deeply
sunk padded recesses like chairs while other
firmly fixed swivel seats were placed about
the room large ports at sixty-degree in-

tervals were sunk about five feet in the
walls while a bulging quartz bulls-eye set
in a metal frame gave a clear if lens-like
view of the outside world there were
cupboards set in the walls with books
chemicals and the like and the space be-
neath the seats was utilized for other label-
ed cupboards for food spare implements
and such accessories doors led into the
hollow walls of the ship

in the very center of the room was a great
circular control table with huge levers set
about it and keyboards flush with the white-
enameled metal surface beside the three
control chairs a master-control and two
duplicates were set bakelite panels with a
formidable array of meters and gauges each
with its dial and graphing stylus and in
the very center of the table sunk a little
below its surface was a plate of frosted
glass in which was mirrored a panorama
of the outside heavens divided into rec-
tangular sections by a system of cross-hairs
beside each control chair a binocular eye-
piece permitted a reduced view of this same
panorama with a switch to permit an en-
larged view of any section of the plate

now doc had turned over the controls to
dick and had settled down to give us an
idea of what was happening we had put
on coats over what remained of our rags and
even red was looking reasonably at his
ease

in the first place began doc you pro-
bably want to know how this ship is pro-
pelled in rockets of this type fuel is al-
ways the big problem-maximum energy for
minimum weight the early experimenters
and writers developed the other details-
construction materials everything but the
hull and the fuel up til now liquid hy-
drogen was the best bet with the discarded
shell system and a small residual body you
could probably get to the moon and back
if you were careful and ran on a mighty
narrow margin with refueling posts in
space you could get to anther planet
but nobody wanted to try it and no govern-
ment would risk the havoc caused by the
falling of cast-off fuel-shells

we dick and i used hydrogen to get
clear of the earth then following dicka
dust of destruction



idea we built a laboratory out here between
earth and moon-just as writer after writ-
er worked it out nearly forty years ago we
used the heat of the sun and the cold of
space to run our turbines we maintained
artificial gravity by centrifugal force but
we did more

isintegration or else creation of

jlj matter alone can supply the limitless
atomic energy that dreamers have wrote
about science has found out that in the
stars and in space these processes are go-
ing on and so came dicks idea

here in the void using the electrical
energy of the solar turbines we learned to
build up the elements clear through to ur-
anium just as nature does we could not
control the energy produced however so
disintegration alone was left to us it was
dicks idea to build far beyond uranium un-
til we came to an element whose disintegra-
tion we could control at will providing
well-nigh unlimited power in small mass and
bulk we did it and our synthetic element
aslron controlled by the apparatus here be-
neath our feet is winging the ship on her
way

now for the catastrophe that is threaten-
ing earth out here we saw the great ray
flash into the atmosphere and blot out nor-
folk men that ray came from the moon
i know how it acts and i know what will
happen to our old planet if we do not kill
this thing right at its source and do it quick-
ly

you hank have seen coolidges cathode
ray at work remember how it makes rock
salt turn violet and how acetylene gas falls
in a dense yellow powder there is your
clue this is a ray a cathode ray gen-
erated on the-moon of such a frequency as
will pump energy into the nitrogen of our
atmosphere and cause it to fall in the fluffy
green powder that you saw the observa-
tory jjp above was in the path of the ray

uranium is one of the radio-active metals
which disintegrates into lead giving off energy
at the same time the point is that this dis-
integration is terribly slow and can neither- be
accelerated nor slowed up it has been felt that
if it could be accelerated then man would have
limitless energy at his command

and i have studied what happens to the

air

four-fifths of the atmosphere-equal to
twelve pounds of pressure out of the fifteen
per square inch that exist on the earths
surface in our neighborhood-fell in green
dust from what i have seen norfolk
must have been buried thirty feet deep in
the stuff it was an inverted cyclone pour-
ing dust upon earth just as a real tornado
sucks it off norfolk was smothered in
dust though the oxygen remained but
there was one more fatal result suddenly
the atmospheric pressure over norfolk was
dropped to a small fraction of its normal
value and like a frog in an evacuated bell-
jar every living creature exploded from his
own internal pressure then the rest of
the surrounding atmosphere rushed to fill
the breach and the awful storm came and
spread dust and destruction far and wide

 one thing more whatever creatures in-
habit the moon are waging this war of death
on our earth perhaps they do not know
that we live there any more than we have
been aware of their presence their science
shows them an ideal planet within arms
reach-theirs for the taking they need it
for some reason or other but the pressure
of the atmosphere may be many times too
great for them to bear i dont know but
if true their science comes to their rescue
with this cathode ray of just the proper fre-
quency and presto the pressure drops to
less than a fifth of its normal value wher-
ever the ray strikes

men i believe that just as soon as they
can assemble power enough they are going
to ray every bit of nitrogen out of our at-
mosphere every living thing on earth
will die and then the moon-creatures will
come there and take over the earth for their
own i think the destruction of norfolk
was more or less accidental-the end of a
random range of frequencies they will
try once more lo make sure while they are
building up the necessary power and then-
poof-and were out of the picture for all
time weve got to stop them and do it
quick

if thats how it is im all with you to
the limit put in red i suppose youve


wonder stories

got somethin to keep us from blowin up
ourselves when we get there

yes space suits for all of us they
have weighted shoes to take care of the
gravity but we will have greater mobility
if we do not use them we can decide when
we get there

be sure brockton gets everything
straight doc put in dick if were sep-
arated or killed he may have to know what
to smash there wont be much time to
waste when the scrimmage starts

thats all right said red my business
made it necessary for me to learn somethin
of science i know what he means an
what to smash when i get there an i think
ill leave off those lead shoes if i can
when im in a hurry i want to move fast
another thing do i get my gun back now
i have a hunch ill need it before we get
through

sure red i answered here you are
youre one of us now dick have you an-
other one for me

right in the cupboard when you need
it better put yours there brockton you
wont need it for a while yet

ok but you can trust me honest
and i wish youd call me red thats my
real name no matter what else i call myself
for a while

come on dick i said loosen up a
bit dont be such a crab reds just as
good as any of us here and dont you for-
get it maybe he slipped up a few times-
who hasnt there arent many ways you
can get the thrill of adventure and fighting
out of your blood except by bucking up
against authority of some kind you did it
plenty in college im not forgetting some
things if you cant get it out of your head
that youre the million-dollar citizen of
norfolk and the united states of america
why i ay youre no man to lead us

the second attack

ont take it that way hank its
l only that we three are old friends
and hes an outsider i cant just take him
as an old-timer right off the bat

well i can said doc my memory

can lapse as well as the next mans if we
get back but just now im remembering a
few things ive read in the papers and
books mainly im remembering an old
englishman by the name of robin hood
and wondering if his hair was red shake
red

thanks doctor i sure appreciate it
it hurts always to be on the outside lookin
in-on the defensive against everyone
maybe you think i came along just to get
clear of the police but i didnt i liked
the way hank here put things up to me
when he dragged me out of the dust-pile
and i liked your looks yes an his too i
thought then you were men i could fight
alongside of for a while-sort of gang up
against the things from the moon an what-
evers makin it id still like to if hell
let me in on it all the way

right red teamwork it is from now
on and stop us who can im dick-dont
forget that between us well have em lick-
ed or i miss my guess here doc for the
love of mike take these controls while i get
some clothes on these birds weve been
talking so dead serious that we never real-
ized that they look barer than fijians in their
bathing suits red may stick out of my
clothes in places but hank is your size near
enough we have to be dressed right up to
the hour when we meet the man-in-the-
moons daughter

during the three days that we were in
space on our way to the moon i explored
the rocket until it was thoroughly familiar
and learned the technique of the control-
board below the control-chamber were
store rooms packed for any emergency and
the mechanical maze of the discharge-
room at the very bottom of the ship with a
confusion of orderly-disorderly machine-
giants feeding astron to the jets at the
very top of the rocket was the great room
where red spent most of his time a huge
quartz-windowed observatory with metal
shutters that could be opened from inside
and a twelve-inch refracting telescope with
all the attendant instruments of modern as-
tronomy-spectroscope micrometers bolo-
meters and all the rest

the view was wonderful-of stars and
dust of destruction



nebulae and planets with the milky way
strung in a great necklace of suns across the
black throat of space and the pock-marked
white desert of the moon dead ahead we
had flexibility enough to maneuver the sun
to our rear where its blinding light would
not interfere with our view of the  heavens
the little laboratory in space showed too
for a while a faint speck of light against
the dappled earth doc was busy most of
the time making observations and red who
never tired of the view helped him more
than any of us would have suspected

as we neared and passed the neutral
point of attraction between moon and
earth we took advantage of the lack of
gravitational pull to put on the heavy space-
suits and practice maneuvering in them a
constant tension of every muscle was neces-
sary to prevent any sudden motion that
might wreck us and the ship alike by dash-
ing us into the midst of the controls but
before it became necessary to decelerate the
ship for the landing we were reasonably
adept at the art of walking in a field of
reduced gravity 

red and doc were by far the best reds
uncanny control of his every muscle was
simply amazing he was one of those rare
individuals who can twitch parts of their
skin like a horse and practically every part
of his body obeyed his mental control a
few times only did he experience the sensa-
tion of utter helplessness that comes from
moving too suddenly with the accompany-
ing suspension in emptiness like mahomets
coffin

with doc it was not the control that was
so perfect but a knowledge of exactly what
motions were or were not safe still he
took a few pretty tumbles and once red had
to drag him out of the very top of the ob-
servatory after he had been thrown off his
seat by the lurch of dodging a meteor
swarm meteors incidentally bothered us
very little and as we traveled well below
our top speedvwe were able to avoid the big
swarms with little or no damage to the ship

we were about an hour from the moon
decelerating continually when the great ray
stabbed again straight from the mighty crat-
er of tycho we were watching the image of

the moon in the ground-glass and as a pale
shaft of light darted from the heart of the
giant crater dick rocked the ship with the
laterals to get a view of the earth from the
side ports almost instantly the center of
the darkened disc of earth was marked by
a stab of brilliant white light a pin-prick
against the red-rimmed black the moon-
creatures had struck again for certainty
and now we had barely time enough to make
tycho before they should loose their ray
for the final time we must stop them be-
fore they began their last awful barrage of
death and we must stop them for good

we dropped slowly into a great crater
at the southern apex of the mare
nubium-the sea of clouds as the old as-
tronomers called it the region near tycho
was a blistered wilderness of craters and
ring-plains great and small but in that
desolate labyrinth of crevice and crater it
would have been next to impossible to find
the rocket again hence we chose a prom-
inent spot and dropped the rocket well
under the eastern wall where the shadow
of the great cliffs would hide its polished
brilliance from hostile observers

by common consent doc was the first
through the air-lock scrambling awkward-
ly through its rather narrow port he jumped
and dropped with uncanny slowness to the
ground throwing up a thick spray of pumice
from the foot-thick layer that covered the
crater floor indeed this fine pumice cov-
ers most of the moon deepest in those great
rolling plains known to men as seas where
it often buries entire craters and but a
fine dust on the lofty tops of the crater-rings
and mountain-ridges the rest of us fol-
lowed him as fast as we could and we
raced across the crater floor for the south-
ern rim shooting high with every leap and
despite our recent practice sprawling awk-
wardly to the ground again on landing

red forged ahead rapidly with doc not
far behind him and when we reached the
foot of the cliffs they were clambering from
crag to crag high above us i at least
knew how to fall having had considerable
practice so i threw caution to whatever
winds the moon might have and went up the


wonder stories

first almost perpendicular slope in three
great bounds then i dived for a higher
pinnacle jumped from there to a knife-edge
of lava that ran up at a sixty-degree angle
scrambled along this for about half a mile
and then tackled the last up-grade in a series
of flying leaps that took me past the scramb-
ling forms of doc and red who had not my
momentum i popped like a released cork
over the final ridge and started headlong
down the other side in a growing avalanche
of bleached and weathered pumice

when the others reached the summit i
was perched on a spire a quarter of the way
down the outer side of the ridge ten or
twelve feet above the level of the rim it-
self the panorama was certainly magnifi-
cent about one hundred and seventy miles
to the south rose the great rampart of
tycho jutting mile on mile into sheer empti-
ness between it and our crater lay a jagged
maze of craters great and small through
which threaded the dazzling white streaks
of tychos mighty ray-system streamers of
white spreading in a huge network across
the entire surface of the moon from the
rim of the crater they looked like cracks
that had been filled with a dull white ena
mel

behind beyond our crater lay the great
dark plain of the sea of clouds while a
narrow streak of dark stuff lay off to the
right running straight for tycho like a
somewhat broader crevice that had not been
filled with the white stuff of the ray-system
a bay of the sea of clouds ran up on the
left the lunar west as it is reckoned from
the point-of-view of earthly directions
and everywhere rising in a wonderful chaos
of sun-bleached rock with here and there a
streak of delicate color were the southern
craters of the moon

i could have stayed there for hours just
looking out over that wonderful panorama
of planetary wreckage but we had no time
to waste we were all connected by radio
in addition to having microphones to pick
up sounds from the outside so i threw in my
switch and caught doc in the midst of an
excited lecture to the effect that there could
be life of sorts here after all as he had seen
a very very faint flicker of convection cur-

rents rising from the hot rock of a small
craterlet in the wall

dick reminded him that we already knew
perfectly well that there was life here we
had come he said to find and wipe it out
if we could or make terms if it was neces-
sary there was no time to listen to lec-
tures if we were going to have a stab at
saving life on our planet from utter des-
truction and so perched there on our
pinnacles at the craters rim we planned our
campaign of attack

chapter iii
the army moves up

first of all we would proceed separ-
ately and as secretly as possible in
order to keep all our eggs from being
smashed together we would go straight to
tycho unless we discovered anything to
change our plans in which case we were
entirely on our own we would scout out
the situation reach the ray or the power
source if possible and put a spoke in the
lunar wheel in any way we could if we
couldnt carry on alone we would hunt for
the rest of the gang and wade through in a
body after we left the crater and until
we grouped again we were our own mas-
ters proceeding as we saw fit but wasting
no time in gaping at the lunar landscape

red as the best walker of the bunch was
to advance through themaze of craters to
the left doc would go straight through for
tycho i would cut in from the right along
the dark ray that came up from the north
and dick as napoleon of the expedition
would do as he pleased-all perfectly clear
and all too simple

we already had concentrated food in our
belts enough for a weeks ration and had
strapped on our weapons-an automatic
and a sort of short-sword or bayonet red
and i as best shots were given two rifles
and so with waves of the hand we set out

as i leaped awkwardly off to the south-
east i saw doc slipping down the crater-
wall in a cloud of pumice red striding like
a bulbous colossus through a minor inferno
of small pits and sraterlets and dick stand-
dust of destruction



ing alone on the rim staring off toward
tycho and i wondered what his plan could
be-a plan that only doc and he knew

it was about thirty miles to the dark
strip i made it in about an hour thread-
ing an erratic way through the jumble of
crags and craters with more than usual care
as half of the rifle-squad it behooved me
to move quickly then for very nearly
fifty miles i hopped and floundered through
a two-foot layer of dark pumice and ash
along the course of the black streak it
wasnt really black but more of a dark grey
from the quantity of powdered lava and ash
that was mixed with the white pumice

 the streak itself was a great low-walled
crevice that had been widened by erosion
and volcanic action through which black
lava had welled up here and there were
little pits or blow-holes in the lava and i
thought i could detect billows of vapor in
their depths-moisture of some sort now
and then i had to rest for ten or fifteen min-
utes and ate a capsule of the concentrated
food from the container in the cheek of the
helmet for the going was hard and i over-
exerted shamefully most of the time all
in all it was about ten hours before i reach-
ed tycho and plenty had happened in the
meantime

 as i advanced to the south the walls nar-
rowed and the left-hand ridge became a
more or less continuous dyke so that i
climbed up to its top in order to make bet-
ter time and get an idea of the country i
was headed into there wasnt much new
in it-a few pretty big craters and a flock
of smaller ones between me and tycho a
few short rays of the white stuff running
out and sinking into the surface here and
there cracks ridges deep pits with their
sides and bottoms in shadow-just another
lunar landscape it was going to be the
easiest going off toward the southeast where
a bigger ray than usual cut off straight for
the horizon like a polished white rib among
the bleached rocks i crossed the crevice
and struck off in its direction

all this time i had seen no signs of the
life that we knew must be here in the
deeper pits and the bottoms of some of the
crevices i saw vapor that might well have

been water and there were faint convection
currents above the heated rocks that told of
an atmosphere of sorts but the sun shone
down with such fury that the rock must
have been at a blistering temperature my
suit kept out most of the heat pretty well
but the suns glare on the white rock hurt
my eyes even through darkened lenses

not much life could live here-
the moon-creatures must be underground or
in the larger craters like tycho and coper-
nicus and then in the shade of a small
deep crater i found what would have set
doc off in a whirl of excitement-lichens

they were real honest-to-goodness lichens
sun-bleached to a yellowish white with
huge bulbous spore-cases of bright crimson
how they could live on this volcanic desert
i do not know but there they were just as
if this were a mountainside at home i
went on with a distinct thrill at this first
life on our supposedly dead satellite

by this time i could regulate my leaps
better and so make far better time and as
the rib or ray of white stuff drew nearer i
put on full speed and reached it in a helter-
skelter flurry of dust and rock chips

as i had guessed it was a low rib of
some white porcelain-like material
running out from tycho to parts unknown
the top was only about ten feet above the
mean level of the surface and its section
was decidedly oval rather than circular
as far as i could see from my vantage on a
pinnacle there was no opening in it any-
where-just a long flat tube of dusty white
porcelain or enamel threading its way
among the craters straight for its goal

it would be easier going on top so i
launched myself from my pinnacle in a
great flying-leap for its top i must have
been traveling pretty fast for when i hit
there was an instants checking and then
i shot on through and fell thirty or forty
feet to the floor of the crevice that it roofed
the stuff was very thin and let quite a bit
of light through so that i could take stock
of my suroundings with success at last i
had ample evidence of intelligent life on the
moon

a low form of plant life formed as a fungus
on trees rocks etc


wonder stories

here was a natural crevice that had been
roofed and floored with white heat-insu-
lating porcelain with metal ribs shoring up
the sides sunk in the smooth floor were
little parallel metal grooves running the
length of the tunnel some six or eight feet
apart down the crevice a hundred feet or
so another tunnel ran at a steep angle down
into the rock and in the darkness below i
could hear thinly the roar and grind of
machinery and the gurgle of water

even as i was crouching at its mouth try-
ing vainly to pierce the darkness my micro-
phone registered a swift whirr and click
from the direction of tycho and i pressed
back into the tunnel-mouth as a great fif-
teen-foot wheel swept past along the farther
groove at its center was a little cube of
perhaps two feet on a side with a round
crystal port in the front no sooner had it
passed than its sound died-it stopped i
was discovered

there was no time for hesitation in-
stantly i stepped back into the dark of the
passage felt its steep slope drop beneath
my heels and slipped swiftly back into the
dark for half a minute or less i shot be-
tween crowding walls then a bright light
burst on me and i fell with a great splash
into a deep eddying pool the deafening
throb and beat of machinery dinning on all
sides for one breathless instant i seized
the impression of huge polished metal forms
and whirling wheels of globes of white
light set in a low ceiling then the vortex
sucked me down and into a great conduit
through which the water raced toward dis-
tant tycho

for maybe ten minutes i was swept along
in the rushing torrent buoyed up by my
space-suit i could tell that i was being
borne deeper than ever into the bowels of
the moon down god knows where into the
heart of the realm of these moon-things
would i escape would earth be saved
or would we die horribly all four of us
and earth become the plaything of crea-
tures such as no man had seen or imagined

again light burst upon me and i fell for
hundreds of feet through space to bring up
with a breath-taking spat on the surface of
a great body of water enveloped as i was

in a buoyant space-suit it was hard to see
much especially as i was lying face down
in the water by dint of much writhing and
kicking i managed to assume an erect posi-
tion and look around me

i floated in a huge metal reservoir hun-
dreds of feet in diameter into whch poured
great jets of water from far above where
the walls of a cavern closed into a narrow
cone from which flooded the blinding white
light up from the hidden region beneath
the tank wound a spiral stairway to an
opening in the cave-roof above it was of
metal with two-foot treads and no rail to
speak of-merely a strip of metal on either
side opening out of the great reservoir
were myriad open channels into which the
water poured and toward which i was drift-
ing helpless in the grip of a strong current
i felt for my rifle-battered water-soaked
and useless my automatic was in a sealed
belt-pouch safe

just as the current sucked me into the
nearest channel my roving eyes caught a
weird shape toiling up the metal stair-a
glistening biped-thing with globular cran-
ium and goggling glassy eyes neckless
with short thick arms and stubby legs and
hands like metal claws-some strange mon-
ster of the moon then i recognized it
even as a blaze of flame burst from the
dome above us and the metal stair crackled
with blue fire hurtling the long thing head-
long into emptiness-the figure of a human
being in a space-suit

the great deluge

the lunar water-system was a gravity-
flow with all the dips and thrills of the
wildest earthly roller-coaster i was whip-
ped through great caverns of roaring mach-
inery through narrow dark tunnels bitten
into the rock across great chasms opening
to the outer air then came a last mighty
upward swoop and the stream slowed and
dropped into a pool that lay open to the
heavens at the bottom of a huge cylindrical
pit all around me in the half-dark bulked
towering shapes of glittering metal half
alien half familiar my eyes strained into
the darkness and the truth leapt to my mind
dust of destruction



here were the rockets of the lunar races-
waiting to leap out into space at the signal
of the success of the destruction of the
earths atmosphere

i scrambled out of the shallow pool ran
to the nearest rocket there were no ports
-merely ten-inch openings with curved
tight-fitting caps little loading ports of
some sort how could the moon-things en-
ter-or were they even now sealed snugly
within these metal walls waiting to drive
forth to the conquest of the planet they had
killed i stared around me this was the
floor of a small deep crater smoothed and
altered for its single purpose no doors
opened into it but in the walls close to the
floor were sealed circular holes the mouths
of some sort of tube

now my microphone caught a whine and
whirr as something hurtled by beyond the
wall bound for the great crater of tycho
the lunar metropolis through whose heart i
had rushed in the grip of the flowing waters
and now i knew-they were pneumatic
tubes for communication between the cities
of the moon where lay my duty-here
helpless with the ships or there where the
ray still burned or was it even now too
late which must it be i turned to the
tube jerked open the scuttle of the air-lock
crammed myself inside there was a dim
glow of light and a little trigger of sorts
edging forward i jammed against it it
gave way with a mighty rush of pent
gases i was hurtling toward tycho and the
ray

	 

and now for a moment i must digress
to make clear the movements of the others
as i later learned them doc took the short-
est course straight across a fairly open ter-
rain to the looming rampart of the great
crater it had taken him perhaps six hours
-uneventful hours-to gain the rim he
had not even seen lichens such as i had dis-
covered from the summit of the ring-
mounlain he looked out over the barren
waste of the crater nearly sixty miles
across with a giant central cone of ragged
rock otherwise it was utterly bare-no
cities no life-only rough rock and pumice
and a scattering of small crevices and cra-

ters it was more than an hour later when
he had worked through the thick dust to the
central peak and here he found the evidence
he sought-a narrow black tunnel leading
down into the core of the mountain

his subsequent trip was short the tun-
nel opened directly into a great arching hall
of many metal levels where huge strange
machines poulded unguided-an automatic
metal world into one end of the great ser-
ies poured molten metal vanishing into
metal maws from the other rose huge
polished hulks rocket-ships to drop into
a tunnel and disappear like those i saw
there were only little hooded holes in their
sides like oil-cups on terrestrial machines

he found a plunging stream of water
dropping out of the upper heights of the
mountain followed it and came at length
upon the great cavern of the reservoir
where a narrow spiral stair rose to the far
distant roof halfway to the top there
came a flash of blinding light a numbing
thrill of electric energy and he toppled
from the stair missing the tank entirely
bounding from girder to girder until he
struck the floor and lapsed into uncon-
sciousness

	 

red saw much more far to the west
he had like me burst into one of the porce-
lain runways but when a great wheel
swept past him bound for tycho he was
able to grasp its protruding axle just above
his head and draw himself up the speed
must have been dreadful and even his
great strength was nearly broken but he
managed to cling unnoticed to the end

the runway dipped under the craters rim
and opened into a spacious hall under the
central cone a hall into which other tunnels
converged and pneumatic tubes opened
it was huge beyond all words soaring clear
up into the summit of the mountain and
wonderfully carved with strange geometric
grotesqueries and laced with metal spans
above his head but he noticed only its
filth for the place was literally crawling
with vermin-with great disgusting shaped
insects they were all of a foot long
crusty green things with many-branched
wiry antennae


wonder stories

their feet were broad and flat like green
snow-shoes and had suction disks on the bot-
toms with which they clung to walls and
floor the things swarmed over him in
great wave-like clouds over his arms and
helmet clogging his motions and sucking
at the joints of his armor with a sort of sac
that was slung under their bodies as they
crept over his helmet and peered evilly into
its interior with many-faceted eyes that
were filmed with playing color he noted
other strange organs clustered on their und-
ersides-suckers and toothed cups and
more-perhaps adapted for sucking food
from the rock itself on their rough green
backs were the remains of rudimentary
wings and also round prismatic structures
that seemed to glow in the light and fluc-
tuate with its shading

they were everywhere all over every-
thing crawling with a rasp and pop of
suction-disks that his microphone brought
clearly to his ears evidently the air was
much denser here shuddering he swept
them from him these were the things
that were driving the lunar peoples from
their planet to ours these were respon-
sible for the doom of earth he strode
angrily across the floor crushing them be-
neath his lead-shod feet with vicious satis-
faction where a pneumatic tube entered
the hall a buzzer was sounding shrilly
he yanked viciously at the scuttle as it
burst open a flood of insects broke over
him from the tube within and he wheeled
in disgust and horror and rushed madly
across the room and through an open arch-
way mashing the things in scores beneath
his feet

they were everywhere in here too but
not so bad as in the great hall here were
the huge metal girders that supported some
sort of tank and a spiral stair of many
steps winding up and up through a maze
of beams and girders to a distant roof
whence a bright light was pouring on the
floor beneath the stair lay a queer crump-
led form over which the insects were
swarming striving to tear at its joints with
their devilish suckers they were prying at
every crevice a huge filthy wave of dis-

gusting life that rasped and creaked like
rusty machines in their eager hunger it
was a globe-headed thing with queer short
arms and legs heaving slowly with its
heavy intermittent breathing god it was
one of the other guys

he leaped forward and even as he drew
docs unconscious form from beneath the
sea of clinging bugs a great wave of rasp-
ing and a shrill ear-splitting whine rose in
the first hall while a mighty torrent of the
insects poured through the arch and over
him piling up a yard deep on the lower
part of the stair they were coming then
attacking at last the lunar people driving
these vermin before them snatching out
his automatic he fired point-blank at the
thing that loomed in the archway

	 

with the glancing blow of the slug on my
helmet i stumbled and fell grabbing at
my gun then saw who had fired and yelled
frantically into my transmitter here i was
back again in the room i had left-return-
ing here still in search of the ray lower-
ing his gun red stepped back against the
base of one of the great props that held
the tank resting doc against it and calling
to me to come i came back to back
doc and the girder behind us we fought
the advancing horde i mowed savagely in-
to the crusty sea of green life with my club-
bed rifle smashing them in great swaths
that oozed thick yellow slime and were swal-
lowed by the thousands that poured over
them to do us battle god no wonder
these things had driven the lunar people to
contemplation of the destruction of a planet
and with all their teeming millions and
billions it could not be long before they
too would clamor for escape from this dead
hulk in space

doc had come to now and was leaning
weakly against the girder fumbling at his
-belt his hand came away with an oval
metal canister - a hand grenade it
flashed at the low arch struck just above
its summit and in an awful blast of shat-
tering sound the wall before us collapsed
shutting off the outer hall again again
and mangled insects were writhing in their
death-throes in the two great pits he had
dust of destruction



blasted in the cavern floor but still they
came seeping through the crannies of the
wreckage worming out of narrow slits and
crevices in the masonry of the walls rising
high about us and flooding over us in a
rasping tide of green horror that crept and
clung and dragged us down

the foot of the stair had been blown clean
away by docs second bomb but the free
end hung loose ten feet above our heads
there was no escape that way and my rifle
swung and reds great boots kicked and
trampled and doc beat and slashed with
the flat of his bayonet-blade and still
the tide of green rose about us and bore us
down

chapter iv
toward the tube

ittt ey bellowed red above the din
jl x his voice thin and resentful in the
microphone wheres your loud-mouthed
friend haverford now is he still cud-
dlin his precious hide back at the ship or
has he got some slinky plan to sneak in and
get all the glory while we do the dirty
work

he had a plan gasped doc he was
coming here by air in a little one-man rock-
et plane we had stowed away for explor-
ing  he figured the ray would be in the
top of the cone    that he might be able
to get at it with grenades after we got here
but he hasnt come-he hasnt tried may-
be they got him damn them

who got him the moon things
yes these insects i-i think these are
really the creatures that are attacking earth
i have seen no other form of life as advanced
as they are-they have a language use the
pneumatic tubes and the machinery seem
to have a definite purpose in their attack
but it cant be these maybe the real
things are besieged up there in the peak like
us

i hope so these are too hard to kill
for us to ever be really safe and i think
they can live in the open when the sun is
up maybe there are other things that we
have not seen but these insects are intelli-

gent-they have the ability to survive
perhaps we may never see those others if
they exist

well gasped red you two settle it
out of court as for me im goin up-
an that now

with the words he kicked free of the
crawling sea of life and jumped for the
end of the stair caught it fairly hung
dangling by one arm slowly he pulled
his body up flung a leg over the lowest
step and was up he lay a moment pant-
ing then wound his legs around a metal
rod and reached down for doc with my
gun i cleared a small space and he jumped
fell short by inches tried again and catch-
ing reds outstretched arm was up and
then after a moments wild slaughter i fol-
lowed felt reds hand on my arm and
scrambled to safety just as a newer greater
wave of the insects broke over the place
where we had been

none too soon had we made the trial
for now bright bursts of light stabbed from
high on the walls of the cavern white flames
of heat that fused the support against which
we had leaned and sliced it through in a
shower of flaming metal slowly it buck-
led dropped and then as the enormous
weight of the water above surged across the
mighty reservoir the huge tank sagged and
toppled crashing into the wall deluging
the floor with thousands and thousands of
tons of foaming water a hundred feet
from the swinging lower end doc fainted
and we paused in our mad scramble up the
metal thread of the stair again the rays
stabbed at us the stair beneath melted
and fell hissing into the flood intelli-
gence directed those rays-the intelligence
that threatened the earth

we had marked the places of attack
niches in the walls of the great hall with
crystal ray-tubes set behind stone barricades
in the mouth of tunnels from which the in-
sects were pouring to join the swarm below
quickly red unstrapped his rifle took care-
ful aim fired at a moving bulk in a tunnel
mouth the thing went still i grabbed
doc by the shoulder and began to drag him
up the stair while red crouched at the end
snipijfcg at the things in the dark niches


wonder stories

a hundred feet below huge waves were
surging about a tangled metal wreck alive
with green things that fought vainly for life
all attack forgotten

ten huge torrents dropped thundering
from the shadows above smashing at
crumpled metal and crushed insect beating
the welter into foam red had scored an-
other hit a ray-tube burst in a flare of blue
light they had stopped raying us now
afraid for their lives as the walls crumbled
into muck beneath them wherever a form
moved there a bullet spat evilly against the
rock and there was no more motion

slowly we toiled up the wisp of metal
that wound up and up into the hollow heart
of the peak-up to the great cathode ray
and the unseen things that guarded it
slowly red followed covering our retreat
a sudden ray blazed searing the stair be-
tween us as the lower steps sagged he
launched upward in a mighty leap wormed
to safety and fired at the niche from which
the ray had come a dim half-seen shape
squirmed erect with a queer chirping cry-
a thing seemingly unlike the things below
larger differently shaped more-human
or was it a shadow-distorted insect some
larger more advanced form like the rulers
of the termitary that rose and toppled into
the seething cauldron beneath

the light of the place was fading and
our minds strained by fear and peril
which did we see-master insect different
from his fellows as in the breeds of the ter-
mites and ants of earth or-something else
-something far more terrible we never
knew

u p inch by inch clutching wearily
weakly at the narrow railing stumb-
ling with heavy feet over too-low steps with
doc half-creeping half-carried at my side
up endless feet twenty a hundred-toward
the narrowing cone where the stair dis-
appeared into the rock i saw a great diaph-
ragm like the iris of a camera stopping the
opening to the summit of the peak the
stair vanished through a tiny hole in the
rock beside it disappeared into a pocket of
black dark where something stirred-new
danger

i screamed hoarsely to red the rifl
barked and a tube burst fusing half the
upper stair with its furious heat as the
stair sagged i saw the freed diaphragm
snap open with a mighty clang beyond
lay the chamber of the ray

for an instant clinging to the tilted stair
we saw it lit by the blinding glare of the
great tube that perched high on jetty insu-
lators into its base ran huge twisted ca-
bles through it coursed a mighty awful
flame of loosed energy dazzling electric
blue and blinding white driving out from
its blazing target of the grey metal poured
a great shaft of shimmering luminescence--
out into space-out to a dying earth

but in the wall of that little chamber in
the peak was a great gap through which the
sun poured its brilliance revealing that
which lay in the shadow of the tube we
say a tiny form-a human being-battling
bravely fiercely for its life and the life of
its race struggling against things that
numbed our comprehension-moon-things
of horrid leaping shadow-or were they
insects fearfully altered by a sportive evo-
lution from the pattern of the hordes below

for a single second of time the form
ripped free hurled off the figures vainly
clamoring at him and raced up the side of
that gigantic pyramid of black that held
the ray-up up to the shimmering shaft
that beat out into emptiness to another
world for an instant it hung poised weap-
onless silhouetted against the mighty crys-
tal sphere of leaping flame then hurled it-
self straight as a dart for that fiery chaos
there came a roar of unleashed lightnings
a blaze as of the fires of creation a beat-
ing tempest of thin wind that strove to rip
us from our narrow perch and the summit
of the mountain crumpled and fell shatter-
ed into the deathly silence that followed

we found an exit a tortuous hole through
the wreckage that led us down again through
those great rooms where once mighty mech-
anical giants had thundered the energy of
death to man they bulked silent in the
darkness their driving power gone no
water flowed no globes of light lit the cav-
ern no thin air circulated through the swift-
ly fouling corridors
dust of destruction



somewhere the insect-thingg gasped in
death or crept torpidly about using again
the strange organs of life that evolution had
given them in adaptation for the conditions
of this barren waste somewhere perhaps
those other half-seen things lay still at last
masters or robots-god alone knows which
and not tycho alone had died but coper-
nicus and ptolemy and those other great
crater-cities that man has never seen for
all the moon fed its power its very life into
the giant tube-that would strip a planet
of its life in preparation for a new era of
weird horrors

in a way i hope that life is not entirely
gone from the moon for that would be a
terrible price to pay even though that self-
same doom must otherwise have come to
earth dick would not have wished it
dick who somehow came too late or per-
haps too early to his destination we who
live can plan otherwise now the deed is done
and over but its doing was none the less
magnificent and worthy of a man of earth-
richard haverford a titan

 we did not wholly prevent the horror of
the green death-dust on earth in a broad
swath the ray had cut across asia and half

of europe slaughtering millions outright
and rendering millions more homeless in
the storms that followed in its wake the
air of the world is rarer noticeably so and
its pressure less much as on a mountain-
top but many of the diseases of the low-
lands are passing before the elixir of the
rare clean air

the green dust of death remains spread
by the tempests over all the face of the globe
from pole to pole no chemical has yet
altered it nor any of the weapons of physics
but men have much to learn and when it is
at last disrupted it may provide a source
of the great energy poured into its making
so that the moon will at last prolong life
where it had once dealt death

we may return to the moon or adventure
to another planet-doc red and i others
surely will the rockets of the lunar races
are there and their great cities of machines
and mighty underground system of commun-
ication raying out from their greatest cities
man will certainly acquire their secrets the
secrets of a race that no man but one has
truly seen and that man dead i think
that we will again follow the call of space
and lead the way for science dick would
have done so v

the letter thats you georg you want
to follow it up

a trickster this fellow roberts this
thing some publicity
trick a charlatan no
doubt - himself not
all the other scientists
in the world whom he
so glibly contemptu-
ously accused   

i had anticipated
from his letter that he
would be an old man
but i was not prepared
for the ancient aspect
which was his a man
of eighly-or if he
had told me a hun-
dred i would have be-
lieved it yet there
was about him-de-
spite his shriveled
frame his palsied
hands his cracked sen-
ile voice-a sense of
driving power a per-
sonality vaguely sin-
ister i recall that at
once i no longer
thought him a mere
trickster and i feared
him-feared at least
this necromancy i was
about to witness   

it was sundown
when i arrived at the
lonely little house set
upon the edge of a
moor    they had
looked strangely at
me when in the village
i inquired for the
place   

he had a daughter

i could have thought
her his grand-daughter
at the very least-a
slim pale girl of per-
haps sixteen he called her edith a somber
girl queerly poised a girl who who have
been beautiful without that mantle of appre-
hension which so obviously enwrapped her

they entertained me at supper we
were four in that household we three
humans and the ape   

we sat after sup-
per in a small room
which was the library
i had not yet seen the
ape  

there is said the
old man no quality
of the human mind
which differs essenti-
ally from that of the
beast

i had found him
pleased to have me ar-
gue with him there
is the soul i said
if you could call
that a mental thing-
a birthright young
blake the soul is a
heritage nothing
mental nor physical
hah you could call
it spiritual as they do
and still not know
what it meant a her-
itage and a promise of
futurity nothing more
science is not con-
cerned with that-
ah i can say now
how great a fallacy he
voiced

science is not con-
cerned with that
young blake we
deal in tangibilities
the human mind
works in thus and
such a fashion we
humans reason with
logic - because we
have had the training

-	the evolution
through millions of
generations we have
the qualities which now we call human be-
cause we have developed them respect
for the property and life of others desire
for law knowledge of justice-those things

j alt hough science has
changed our whole
world in a wonderful man-
ner it is only a blind or
foolish person who would
say that the changes have
not brought many evils
man cannot interfere with
the laws of nature without
doing himself a great deal
of harm even while he is
improving his lot by great
leaps and bounds

many of the broadest-
visioned scientists are be-
ginning to have grave
doubts as to how far we
should go in upsetting the
balances of nature that
have been built up over
millions of years

we wish to stimulate
genius by means of work
on our glands we wish to
transplant glands from
monkeys to prolong our
own bodily mechanism al-
though these things may
provide a temporary boon
to us their ultimate effect
on the delicate mechanism
that is our bodies is un-
known they perhaps start
in motion some unknown
forces that may succeed in
wrecking our nervous sys-
tem

mr cummings had these
dangers of modern science
in his mind when he wrote
this perfect gem of a story

he has poured into these
pages all of his accumu-
lated wisdom and keenness
and wrought his words into
a picture whose sheer
drama cannot be surpassed 
the great transformation



which raise some of us above the level of
beasts

and we have th soul i repeated

yes the consciousness of a creator
the wonderment of the hereafter a philo-
sophy which tries to envisage the universe
and make it mean something a mere abil-
ity to reason we learned it in a million
years of upward struggle we give it to
our children as a heritage and we call it
the soul it is nothing but the quest for
the unknown-

he raised his skinny palsied hand he
turned to the girl as she sat regarding him
with her brooding dark eyes why in those
eyes of that girl i could see more than he
said was the sottl some-
thing-in your eyes as
you read this and in
mine as i write-which
no millions of genera-
tions could breed upward
from the level of the
beasts

he appealed to	the
girl this young	fel-
low would lead us	into
theosophy edith

she said timidly i
do not understand these
things father-these
things you talk about so
much-

his sudden cracked
laughter made me shudder demented this
dotard but he said very quietly nor do
i edith you speak like a true agnostic
you do not understand and you are too
intelligent to blindly believe he waved
away the subject with a vehement gesture

i was saying young blake the human
mind is the mind of a beast who has been
trained to think more clearly the brain
-do you know the difference between the
mind and the brain

i stammered at his sudden question

the brain he said is the physical
mechanism by which the thinking is ac-
complished a physical thing of cells and
membranes and blood flowing through it
with sugar for the chemical energy to en-
dow it with consciousness why it is so

physical a thing that if for one second you
stop the supply of sugar consciousness
vanishes    the beasts have brains-
one species a brain quite comparable to
that of man-

the apes-

exactly the anthropoid apes and we
call them ihat because they so closely re-
semble mankind an ape is only a man un-
developed-a man backward a million
years but still a man-

the divine elixir

it seemed to me that the girl was shud-
dering i heard the sharp involuntary
intake of her breath she
was half turned away so
that i could not see her
face

the brain of an ape
young blake is convolut-
ed like yours the
brain case in some indi-
viduals is only slightly
smaller-

i sat as the girl was
sitting and listened
to his sacrilegious talk
numbly he had secured
the brain of a man re-
cently killed in an acci-
dent a young man in-
telligent of gentle birth
and breeding and he
had a living ape to whom now-tonight-
he was about to give the qualities-the es-
sence-of that human brain to make the
backward man we call an ape a man of
human developed reasoning like our-
selves   

this thing so horrible    his words
so cold and precise hewing to scientific
logic when every instinct within me denied
them with revulsion this horrible thing
   but was it because i as the man was
revolted at taking the ape upon an equality
with me was it mere vanity is that
what makes us look with revulsion when
they tell us we have ascended from the
apes is it vanity causing us to endow our-
selves with a soul-something intangible
not to be understood-to pander to our

ray cummings


wonder stories

vanity so that we may say ah this at
least i have to make me superior to the
beast-

is it my vanity-and yours-that makes
us think we see in human eyes the light
of the soul something no beast could have

i shuddered as he led me to the ape i
tried not to show it j smiled you keep
him-it-indoors  

yes he is very gentle we have him
in a room here-edith feeds him he likes
edith-

words so horrible he said calmly i
had my distillation ready this morning-

my thoughts were flying far afield but
i strove to hold them on his words at
what we call death he said the conscious
human brain ceases to function the heart
is stilled the blood no longer flows yet
the brain momentarily is unchanged if
the heart were again to beat-the lungs
again to breathe to cleanse the fouling
blood-then the brain could function again

there is no precise moment of death it
is gradual with the ceasing of the func-
tions disintegration begins-a mere dis-
solution of the physical cells he had ob-
tained this human brain before the disso-
lution had progressed far enough to harm
it he had cleansed it and by a process
which he had over years perfected had dis-
tilled from it an essence-an elixir--carry-
ing in a few drops of fluid the living mic-
roscopic sperms which are mans heritage
of divinity   

heresy blasphemy

we passed through his laboratory the
room was unlighted save by the shafts of
moonlight that slanted m through its win-
dows the sashes were raised this hot sum-
mer night the breath of the moor came in
to mingle with the smell of chemicals   
the old man paused his tottering step the
girl stood aside-slim white figure in the
moonlight

he fumbled at a shelf i have it here
   edith have you the apple- the girl
clutched an apple in her hand-he likes
apples- that sudden chuckle of a mad-
man -he likes apples-

he pressed us on through the dim labor-
atory i saw that he was carrying a small

hypodermic syringe he showed it to me
but i shrank away fom it this thing-in-
fernal  

i stood silent while under a light he care-
fully filled the syringe i will inject this
young blake and in a few moments the
living sperms will be absorbed into his
blood-carried to his brain-to function
in a moment    have you a note-book
you are my witness-

i steadied my voice you will have the
ape-what he becomes will prove-

yes of course and you will recall
and testify what the ape was before we en-
dowed him he is a beautiful physical
specimen just matured    come edith-

the ape  he was in a small room
at the end of the wing the old man
was carrying a blue vacuum lamp its glow
mingled with the silver shafts of the moon-
light it threw swaying shadows of us on
the walls we passed the length of a hall
and came where it ended to a barred doorj
edith unlatched it she was the first to
enter   

a small room on the ground level its
rectangles of windows were crossed with
metal bars the moonlight cast monstrous
patterns of the bars on the floor there was
a further door leading down a step to the
ground it stood open i could see a small
yard out there enclosed with an iron cage

our front door from the corridor opened
inward we passed through-closed it af-
ter us and put the lamp on a table i no-
ticed its glow reflected from a full length
mirror on the wall behind me   

the ape  i saw it crouching in a
corner on a litter of cloth frightened at
us shrinking back but soothed by ediths
quiet words    the old man sat in a
chair by the small wooden table he laid
the apple at the base of the lamp there
was another small chair he waved me to
it

sit down i want you to study him a
moment    edith make him stand up so
we can see him properly-he is really very
gentle-

i listened with outward calm i stared
trying not to shudder this man-crouch
the great transformation



ing here on his litter backward a million
years but nevertheless-a man    the
old doctors words were calmly precise pe-
dantic as though he were upon a lecturers
platform    these cold calm details   

this was he said a young male gorilla
family of simiidae i would notice the am-
ple capacity of the brain case i would ob-
serve that the supra-orbital skull ridges
were not yet clearly defined it would be
evident to me also that in this youthful
specimen the face bore a very close re-
semblance to man since it had not yet at-
tained its full brutality of expression the
carines had not developed fully and the
thickening of the skull with its growth into
crests and ridges was not yet noticeable
the skeleton was the same as mans the
teeth the same number the shape of the
jaw-not so curved as man an angle on
each side with a canine tooth set at the
apex of each angle   

oh the cold passion of science for detail
but what i saw was a thick black hairy
body crouching in the shadowed room cor-
ner a face black of skin with features
cast in a mould to mock mankind   

the beast was chattering as edith ad-
vanced upon it there i immy dont be
afraid-

its human name mockery

the ape reared suddenly and the girl
retreated afraid i could fancy so   
i turned to eye the closed door behind us
the old man said weve got something
nice for you timmy an apple-you like
apples-edith keep him back-

the great transformation

she stood confronting the ape wait
timmy keep back-edith give it to
you-

her very words and tone as though this
great brute were a small helpless child   
grewsome  i know too that the girl
was revolted forcing herself to this task

 wait timmy-father shall i-shall i
feed it to him now

no presently-

the ape stood nearly as high as a man
thick bulging chest great muscular arms

dangling to the middle of its shank it
took a step backward walking upon the
clenched knuckles of its feet the moon
fell upon its face it was eyeing me the
stranger    and then i saw it stare into
the mirror-staring at its own image and
then staring again at me

i sat tense its gaze held me those dark
pools of its eyesi what lay down in there
what thoughts what gropings was this
brute indeed a man   

its gaze turned to edith did i see it
soften i thought so    the ape relaxed
it sat down suddenly upon its litter crouch-
ing in an attitude horribly human

the old man held up the apple see
timmy look whats for yon

the black lips bared the pointed teeth
travesty of a human smile

the old man drew from his pocket a
long clasp-knife he opened its blade he
cut the apple into quarters
there edith-give it to him

he laid the knife still opened by the
lamp-base i recall that clearly but at
the time i scarcely heeded it my heart
was pounding seeming almost to smother
me    ediths face was white as the moon-
light as she came and took the pieces of
apple

youre sure-father-

i heard myself murmur had we better
not-wait outside

fools he is very gentle-like a child
soon he will be a man-like us a kindly
-man amazed no doubt to realize him-
self  sit still young blake-

ah i was as irrational as both these other
humans to have been there a confusion
was on me i sat transfixed

the ape was grinning pleased with an-
ticipation of this coming delicacy it
stretched out a thick hairy arm and took
the segment of apple it was absorbed in
eating and the old man mustering courage
held its forearm punctured its thick in-
sensitive skin injected the fluid into its
veins

the room was very silent black and
white with the shadows and patches of
moonlight and a glow by the table from


wonder stories

the lamp where now the old doctor and i
sat watching

edith stood back against the wall her
slim white figure was blurred in a shadow
moonlight lay upon the ape it sat gob-
bling its morsel like a pleased child it fin-
ished and stretched out its arm again   

give it another edith-

she handed it the rest of the apple we
were waiting for the injected fluid to take
effect

heresy    blasphemers all of us   

but of course nothing would happen we
would wait and this old madman would be
chagrined this poor terrified girl would
be relieved and i would go back and my
chief would laugh   

a minute passed or an hour i could
not say the ape had long ago finished the
apple edith was standing back again away
from it   

the ape sat crouching we sat like carved
statues waiting    nothing-would-
happen-that injected fluid would not take
effect    nothing would happen   

but there was something what was this
nothing-

but the ape suddenly was trembling
crouching and then it passed a shaking
hand across its black forehead as though
dazed

a terror swept me but i could not move
what horrible thing was this with that
one simple gesture of the apes it seemed
to me that everything was changed this
black hairy beast-or was that a man im-
prisoned there in that thick powerful body
a man dazed confused frightened   

the ape hitched shuffled on its litter
and slowly reared up on its hind legs stood
with long dangling arms stood swaying
as though dizzy   its fists were tight  

a panic must have swept us i heard ed-
ith give a sharp horrified cry the old
doctor shoved back his chair i stood up
sharply my chair overturned with a crash

an instant the apes gaze was roving
the narrow black forehead was wrinkled in
a frown it stared at its mirrored reflection
it was puzzled it held out an arm as though
regarding it and lowered its head to gaze

at its hairy flanks puzzled    and then
it turned to stare at edith   

a moment    all its muscles tensed
it leaped but not at the girl leaped for
this table beside which frozen with horror
i was standing the hairy body struck me
and struck the table i was flung back
scrambling the table and lamp crashed
the lamp was extinguished but in the
moonlight suddenly vivid i saw the apes
hand holding the knife which it had leaped
to seize the old doctor screamed-a long
shuddering last scream he was fumbling
at the door and the scream died in a gurgle
as he fell with the knife buried in his back

i do not know what i may have shouted
or what i did the wizened body of the old
man blocked the door the ape stood again
with the knife-dripping crimson now-
upraised   

i found myself in the center of the room
with edith clutching at me my arms around
her-the ape advancing upon us   

a second oh there can be an eternity
crowded into a single second of terror
whirling thoughts things horrible to be
seen in a second   

i stared for that single second across a
patch of moonlight into the eyes of the
ape and there were many things i saw  
my frightened fancy if you will yes call
it that   

the apes black lips were mouthing with
words it could not form and i saw back
in those eyes of the beast things that should
not have been there a soul something
human a human realization a man-the
consciousness of a man tortured with real-
ization a man imprisoned in the body of
the beast-suddenly realizing    and
gazing at me and at edith-the woman
realizing with horror and despair    and
acting with desperate frenzy but not the
acts of a beast the acts of a man-de-
spairing irrational with his sudden hor-
ror    he had murdered the old doctor
who had brought this upon him    and
perhaps too an all-wise creator was stamp-
ing out this necromancy

the ape raised the dripping knife it
seemed in that second as though with the
eyeballs of a beast but the look of a man
the great transformation



his gaze turned again to edith-the woman
and softened-wistful   

the knife-blade plunged down into the
bulging black chest not the act of a beast
a suicide   

the monstrous body of the ape fell at
our feet writhed and lay still lay in a
patch of moonlight on the floor with a
black pattern of the window-bars crossed
upon it

rescue from jupiter	

those who read mr edwards tremendously gripping story of the depopulation of the earth
and the rescue of its last two inhabitants by an expedition from jupiter will be thrilled
to their very being by the even more powerful sequel there are many problems left
hanging by the rescue the earth is still barren and depopulated will it remain so
will the last earthling and his beautiful daughter be content to remain as guests of the
neinans inhabitants of jupiters satellite or will they wish to return to the planet of
their birth this story of the salvaging of a fair world the enslavement of a race and
the tremendous forces of greed heroism and martyrdom marks a new triumph for
science fiction

from the pen of

r f starzl

another of te rising stars on the horizon of science fiction we offer

the terror of aryl

a strange story of strange deeds on a strange world like marooned in andromeda the
present story excels for its vivid descriptions of the plant and animal life and the tre-
mendous cosmic forces released on a planet closer to the sun than mercury the struggles
of the two buddies of the interplanetary police ar heartbreaking on this hostile world
but they succeed in their great mission and mr tarzl brings the story to a smashing
finish

francis flagg

is always welcome in the pages of our magazine his present story
the synthetic monster

is one of those realistic bits of life that despite the amazing details convince the reader
that they could happen the monster remains in the background of the story menacing

he rose and found himself grasping an arm-a prosaic th
century arm he had returned


a flight into time



i suppose it had to be storrs-or an-
other impractical artist like him if the
thing had happened to edison or millikan
or any of a half dozen others think what
we might have learn-
ed even if it had
been one of the rest of
our crowd standing on
that street corner   

but it was fate giving
with one hand and
taking back with the
other that vouchsafed
to ted storrs the
vision we have
to piece it together as
best we can from what
he noticed and remem-
bered

he was standing at
the foot of market
street where the gold-
topped ferry building
is silhouetted against
san francisco bay and
the oakland shore

around him was the
press and rush of the
noon crowd the clat-
ter of street cars and
the whistles of police-
men directing traffic

it was the twenty-ninth
of september -
that much is sure for
we were going over to
berkeley that after-
noon to see the first
football game of the
season-and the hour
according to ted was
exactly noon wait-
ing for i he rest of us
to show up he had
stopped to set his
watch by the ferry
building clock just
twelve it was the iwo
hands straight together and as ted matched
his watch with them he let the second hand
touch sixty before snapping in the stem

may i bother you for the time came

a voice tve let my watch get hours slow
certainly ted obliged without half
thinking holding out his own timepiece at
the end of its chain

the inquirer was an
oldish man with white
hair and beard calling
to teds mind a con-
federate general his
shirt collar was open
and without a tie and
his ensemble was a
variety of heavy silk
loose fitting garments
resembling tel
thought humorously
pajamas and his
watch on which teds
attention had uncon-
sciously focussed - a
watch strangely wafer-
thin-was marked un-
mistakably with ten
hours and a hundred
minutes

it was that together
with the silence sud-
denly striking his ears
as few noises  could
have done that caused
ted to look around

what he saw made
him gasp almost di-
rectly above his head
hung a mammoth sus-
pension bridge stretch-
ing far out to the east
and across the bay
behind him a market
street five times as
wide as before was
dwarfed into a narrow
canyon by pyramidal
skyscrapers stunning
in the mass of their
bases dizzying in iheir
pointed heights along
the street along airy
causeways swung between the buildings
sped myriad vehicles that in the distance
were but hastening dots through the air
and swooping down now and then under one

 rw ime is but a stream n
says the modern scien-
tist and if we could get out
of the stream for a moment
we could project ourselve
into another part of it and
therefore actually travel in
time

or as einstein said
space is curved and since
time and space are sister
i and brother it may well be
that time itself is curved
perhaps into some higher
dimension in that case
also time traveling should
be possible if the proper
apparatus can be devel-
oped

no doubt the traveler in-
to the future will see and
experience things beyond
all imagining but what
of his own feelings about
them suppose he were to
find himself in a veritable
utopia would he wish to
stay on and enjoy it
would he find himself at
home with people of that
new day and age might
it not happen that among
his own race even among
his own descendants he
mil find himself a stranger
and that he will have such
an overpowering homesick-
ness for the dirty drab
and muddled atmosphere
of the  that he would
feel he must go bark mr
wilson answers some of
these questions in this in-
tensely realistic and excit-
ing story


wonder stories

of the bridges wingless torpedo-shaped sil-
very vessels were sailing and all in such
perfect silence that you could hear the
breeze sweeping in off the bay

the glorious white and silver of the build-
ings with their window crystal and roof-
garden green the gigantic unearthly beauty
of tjhe picture held storrs for a moment
his art is by no means altogether an excuse
from working then his mind recovered
from the first paralyzing impression and
he turned back to the man with the strange
watch

would you mind telling me he began
just where and-for the thing incredible
as it was had begun to dawn upon him-
and when i am

the man who had
started to walk away with-
out ever really looking at
storrs was nonplussed

if you want to know the
street-	

hang the street is	

this san francisco

yes certainly

then what year is it fjf
why eighty- twen	s

ty-one eighty nine

you mean- and
your clothes arent right

they stood staring at
each other

i mean that five min-
utes ago by my watch i
was standing on this same corner in the year
 and now you tell me its two hundred
and fifty years later the things non-
sense

not at all time motion is a theoretical
possibility though the chance of its work-
ing is far less than that of your being an
impostor lets see he pulled on a pair
of glasses your clothes seem to fit the
date your watch is a museum piece-the
mechanical type went out a century ago
still you might have got hold of one
this view of the impossibility was too
much for ted look here if you think
im lying what about this he pulled out
the days newspaper from his pocket and

shoved it in the old fellows face

as the man looked at the fresh nk and
fingered the texture of the paper be seemed
more convincd and a pocktful of ancient
coins and bills completed his conversion
well have just one more test and then ill
believe you but i never really thought it
could happen certainly not in front of me
then growing conscious of an omission
my name is rodgers im sorry to have
treated you the way i did but the thing
shocked me too

walking still a little dazed storrs fol-
lowed rodgers down the elevated sidewalk
on which they had been standing they
rounded the corner and entered a small
brilliantly sunlit of-
fice in spite of the
attractive appearance
of the place it was a
police station with a
sergeant at the desk in
white uniform and gold
braid wrho took teds
fingerprints then mo-
tioned him to a bench
and watched him stern-
ly while rodgers and
a higher officer car-
ried the sheet into an
inner room

teds thoughts such
as he can remember
them were highly con-
fused once away
from the actual sight
of this new san francisco his disbelief in
the reality of his experience increased he
must at least be dreaming and he tried sev-
eral times to pull himself awake he play-
ed a little with the idea that he was mad
then as time dragged on the very prosaic
reality of the station-house showed how far
from fantasy was his plight

he spent at least five minutes in the ef-
fort to shift his position unobtrusively so
as to gain a reflection of himself in the cur-
tained glass inner door and thus settle the
feeling growing upon him that after such a
long time his hair was bleached white and
his face shrunken beyond recognizability
he was almost ready to risk a reprimand

and walk over when the door opened giv-
ing him a fleeting but perfectly normal
image of himself-rodgers stepped out

its all right now mr storrs he had
a slightly chastened look from his commun-
ications with the higher powers but you
see we had to be suspicious theres rath-
er a big prize out for the first man to achieve
motion in time and a number of fakers have
appeared however we just got a check
on your fingerprints and they arent those
of anyone on earth fifty years ago or born
since though youll probably be ruled
out of the money because your experience
was involuntary the committee will want
to see you as soon as it can assemble
meanwhile i am deputized to make you
their guest and mine

he took storrs by the arm and led him
out into the bright street again so it was
tiue somehow he had got into the year-
what was it  ted had less diffi-
culty in believing it than more workaday
people and he followed willingly enough in-
to the rest of his strange adventure

the walk gave him a chance to get his
bearings further diverting his mind from
the maddening problem of how his transfer
in time had been accomplished he began to
pay more attention to his surroundings the
buildings huge even to his first glance at
a distance became positively monstrous at
close range the base of one would cover
a whole block and the upward-glancing eye
could not take in all at once a single vast
front only from far off could he compre-
hend their roughly pyramidal shape with
continual broad set-backs

but especially in the less strictly business
district the green of roof-gardens on all
these flat surfaces called to mind far more
the hanging gardens of babylon than
egypts dead piles and although the gen-
eral plan of each building was the same
there were subtle differences-number and
depth of set-backs straight angle or vary-
ing curves of upward slope-that saved the
effect from monotony instead the whole
city ted declares had an indefinable mul-
ti-dimensional symmetry that was strange-
ly beautiful giving the effect of an elabor-
ately planned design

a magic city

the route rodgers took led for its first
part along the broad sidewalk level
with the show windows of the buildings
it was a dozen feet above the street level
proper and constituted a first though com-
paratively narrow setback continuing in
its same width it passed in bridges between
every two blocks leading foot passengers
directly and safely above the traffic the
vehicles most of them were a sort of glori-
fication of the cut-downs of present-day
college boys small low-slung with a sort
of rakish beauty though they swept down
market street twelve abreast there was no
odor of exhaust from them in the air they
moved in almost total silence even from
the bridges directly over them all ted
could hear was a faint hum of their many
motors and a slight swishing of tires

then as storrs and his conductor turned
to their left a huge escalator carried them
up to a new level just above a vehicular
way a somewhat narrower path and wide-
leaping bridges made a road for them more
than halfway up the buildings sides the
sky was visible now in its whole spherical
shape and the wind swept along whistling
in the wires of the guide rails here pedes-
trians were fewer and perhaps this very
fact drew teds conscious attention to them
just as here and there they began to slow
down from brisk walking to notice him in
his antique attire

in spite of the wind the direct sun was
warm and clothes could be as scanty as
taste prescribed among the men the paja-
mas similar to those of rodgers were
decidedly predominant although there were
sometimes a sort of riding-breeches in mili-
tary-looking uniforms coats if present at
all were of a light blazer type or of loose
flannel again by the unbreakable tradi-
tion of a thousand years women still wore
skirts but they were far above the knee-
cloaks being worn for protection if needed-
and above the top of light buskins touching
the calf of the leg stockings were unknown
some womens hair was bobbed others
long and put up that of a few caught back
fell down to their shoulders ted does


wonder stories

not remember seeing a single hat on either
sex both women and men wore bright
colors and yet in the large it was a note of
soft creamy white that predominated

all this last part of the way rodgers
seemed abstracted absorbed in his own in-
terrupted thoughts and almost forgetting
his guest even when they had turned off
to one of the buildings and left the set-
back garden for his apartment he was silent
ted tried to seem as preoccupied examin-
ing the room intently but his inspection
was only forced and he remembers practi-
cally nothing furnishings are very much
alike in all periods except to their amateurs
aside from a passing interest in the silent
clock apparently run by chemical or radio-
active means like rogers watch there was
only one thing that claimed his attention

this was a picture on the mantel above
the electric fireplace with its resistance
coils a nude and apparently a photograph
though in color and with a three-dimen-
sional quality more to be expected in hand
work the subject a girl with straight
body and soft short brown hair was really
beautiful and made doubly so by the treat-
ment in profile with one arm outstretched
she stood against a billowing rose-colored
mist where faint silver arabesques seemed
almost to move and which brought out in
strong contrast the coral and white of her
skin the blending of real and fantastic
of the solid and the tenuous was perfect
the thing was a work of art and ted who
ordinarily scorns photographs had to share
his enthusiasm

a marvelous picture there he declared
as his host came up beside him

my daughter said rodgers in his voice
only pride and not a trace of resentment
my daughter anne

storrs met anne herself at dinner
her dress blue like her eyes was a
clinging silken wisp sleeveless and falling
but a little below her hips like a grecian
tunic her bare feet were in soft jewelled
sandals and there were diamonds in the
silver net over her hair synthetic she
explained to him later and the jewels were
as cheap as glass but they had all the

sparkle and beauty of natural gems

mr storrs who has got to us somehow
from the year  rodgers introduced
him to his daughter her handclasp was
firm like a boys the old man seemed re-
lieved at the presence of a third person and
transferred to anne the none too easy task
of finding subjects of conversation with the
strange visitor before the meal was over
he excused himself terribly sorry-have
to unload a new shipment at the museum-
my daughter-home on her vacation-take
care of you

except at meals and on a few necessary
occasions ted never saw rodgers again
during his stay in anno 

dads an old dear anne explained
but hes simply too absorbed in his early
twenty-first century if you had arrived
here from a hundred years later he would
have monopolized you utterly she
laughed

chapter ii
a visitor from venus

they sat across the table from each other
finishing an ice whose refreshing flavor
was strange to ted coming apparently from
some new fruit the meal served from the
common kitchen of the building had been
full of such new vegetable compounds com-
pletely replacing meat as the sky turned
grey through the casement windows anne
leaned over and switched on the light three
tubes overhead arranged in a triangle that
glowed like molten silver and gave out a
pure white  soft radiance storrs thinks
now we bring it to his mind that this uni-
versal source of illumination was almost
wholly without heat but he did not notice
particularly and cannot be sure and then
suddenly as they were about to rise a blind-
ing purple beam flashed in the window
it was gone in an instant but only after
another did teds eyes recover from the
brilliance

i thought so declared anne springing
to her feet the venus accommodation is
overdue again lets find out whats the
matter without waiting for a reply she
dashed out into the hall snatching a cloak
about her ted followed a little dazed
a flight into time



it was hard to keep up with her as she
hurried ahead running along the narrow
bridges hung over darkness then an im-
posing gateway where she showed a pass to
gain admittance an elevator shooting up at
breakneck speed and they came out upon a
vast landing field in the midst of the city
it was blocks square resting upon the tops
of buildings from a tower at its center
flashed the great purple searchlights beams
a dozen ships hovered and wheeled above it
maneuvering for a landing and more were
rising

anne left storrs in the crowd at the edge
behind a railing barring the field proper
it was his first chance to examine the inter-
planetary and air vessels at anything like
close quarters the latter were torpedo-
shaped and except for small stabilizing and
steering fins at the sides bore no trace of
wings instead while propellers at their
noses provided forward power lift was ob-
tained directly from big helicopter screws
along the top the blades were larger than
those of the propellers spiralling in row
upon row around their shafts they seemed
more than a little flexible and made a flap-
ping noise at low speed they could float
a vessel at any chosen height and three sets
of them lifted bodily into the air a ship as
big as a pullman car

smaller speedier machines with their
steering fins at wide angles and their heli-
copters slanted forward put up their noses
and used their propellers to gain height
more quickly in the purple light darting
here and there or hovering almost motion-
less they seemed to storrs the most incredi-
ble things that he had ever seen

when anne returned she had the explana-
tion of delay number three ship again
the other two got through the squall on
coming into the atmosphere but the man let
it come down too abruptly and twisted a
wing which threw him off his course he
even lost the radio beam and had to limp
back to it on his batteries and then hop-
ing to speed up later and hide his fault he
didnt radio that things were all right this
makes the second time no more interplane-
tary flying for him hell be in any min-
ute now

it was true the searchlights had been
turned horizontally to the west their pur-
ple beams sheared straight through the
growing mountain of fog in another in-
stant there became visible in the heart of
the cloud the approaching flyer and the dots
of its escorts even far in the distance it
gave the impression of size and as it hurt-
led toward them its apparent dimensions in-
creased

in an incredibly short time it was bulking
overhead large as a good-sized steamboat
its shape was that of two torpedoes lashed
together sideways giving it a big blunt
front its rocket tubes were silent now as
it glided in-the great wings supporting it
almost directly above ted so that he had
to crane his neck to see it the ship came to
a dead stop with the drag of a small brak-
ing screw in the tail immens solid five
hundred feet up it seemed about to fall and
crush everything in a great cataclysm ted
took a step backward

instead it seemed to descend slowly
almost imperceptibly to the stretch of
field cleared for it its passengers-ted
could see them easily through the windows
yellow-faced venusians and returning amer-
icans-were undisturbedly pulling on their
coats in their faces he could see a little
annoyance but no trace of fright at the
experience of their voyage the ship had
scarcely alighted on row after row of big
rollers projecting but an inch or two from
its bottom when they were swarming down
the companionways dropped from its side
in fifteen minutes the vessel was empty and
with a gang of overalled workmen steering
it along its brake propeller towed it back-
ward into a shed

and then more to make conversation than
from any of the scientific curiosity that
should have been gripping him storrs asked
the one intelligent leading question of his
stay in the future i gathered from what you
said that aside from rockets these ships have
electric power just how do they manage
it

annes reply made with all the sketchi-
ness of one so familiar with her subject that
she cannot appreciate her hearers ignorance

one but a small group of super-trained
minds-of whom anne frankly admitted she
was not one power so generated was in-
credibly cheap ted did not dream of get-
ting figures and without knowledge
rency basis and price levels they might be
worthless but suffice it that the use of
labor-saving devices was limited only by the

heard and remembered as
sketchily by a casual and un-
scientific mind is yet-and
perhaps a little just because
of its vagueness-one of the
most fascinating parts of teds
story i give it here all he told
us at first and all he has man-
aged to remember in response
to questioning the hopelessly
brief and tantalizingly sugges-
tive outline of the foundations
of a new world

practically all the power of
 was-or should i say will
be-electrical and in origin
sub-atomic common earth
mined in quantities so small
relatively as to give no effect of eating up
the ground beneath ones feet was so treat-
ed that its mass was transformed almost
wholly into energy and gave up that energy
in electrical form the process was not so
knuch secret as so complex and delicately
involved as to be incomprehensible to any-
a flight into time

proficiency and not the efficiency of their
design

moreover this power was supplied to all
freely moving vehicles-airships seagoing
vessels automobiles as well as interplane-
tary flyers-and to substations in places
too small for generators by a system of ra-
dio transmission the method made use of
an involved combination of inductance and
capacity effects of electrostatic and electro-
magnetic principles to fill the ether not
with waves eternally broadcast but with
lines of force tapped only when and for as
much power as needed a network of trans-
mitters kept up a concentration over all
civilized lands and great beams were laid
along the coasts and the transportation
routes over ocean or waste

for journeys to mars or venus-the fly-
er was transmitted over a gigantically pow-
erful beam-rockets being used as auxiliary
power but that is so distressing in that
ted gave us just about enough information
to meet our curiosity without explaining
how things worked

all this storrs had explained to him on
that huge eerily purple-lit landing stage

it does not seem to have impressed him as
much as it should it was only when they
were walking home in the cool night over
the airy bridges and anne systematically
bringing her discussion back to its starting
point was explaining the aircraft safety
devices-higher possible speed for the mo-
tors of uninjured screws separate power
supply circuits for each helicopter and pro-
peller emergency storage batteries of radio-
active gold which could keep the heaviest
vessel running for hours-that he even real-
ized the perhaps unusual extent of her
knowledge

miss rodgers have you studied up on
these things he asked

studied up she laughed well
once i work as pilot on the polar special
to moscow

as j have said storrs had less trouble be-
lieving his situation than would have some
of the rest of us his mind simply refused
to grasp the incredibility-i had almost said
the impossibility-of it all besides when
one has actually experienced a thing the

evidence of the senses ishighly conclusive
still even ted when he wakened the next
morning was much inclined to count the
whole thing a dream he lay in bed he
says for fully fifteen minutes burrowing
under the covers to escape the sunlight
fully satisfied than when he chose to look
around he would find himself in his own
room

sport in 

it was a voice that called him out of som
nolence and brought him back to the
reality cf his trip to the future good
morning mister  like to play some
tennis annes head peered around his
half-opened door

betcher life ted replied realizing as
soon as he had spoken that the slang would
be as antique as ods bodikins today

i dont know what that is but here are
some things catch

the things landed squarely in teds
face they proved rather less than the
equivalent of a modern track suit and he
donned them with a little hesitation thinking
that something had perhaps been omitted
at breakfast however anne was wearing
very much the same costume abbreviated
shorts and a mannish shirt with brief
sleeves and throat open in a deep v both
of silky white mr rodgers was just fin
ishing his meal as ted entered beyond a
perfunctory greeting and a good-bye kiss
to his daughter as he departed for the mus-
eum he paid no attention to either of them

when they arrived at the tennis court
out on one of the broad setback areas of
the building there were half a dozen other
young people playing and waiting mr
ted storrs one of our ancestors anne in-
troduced him to them they were greatly
entertained by his account which half of
them doubtlessly believed to be humorously
fictitious of his marvelous leap to thei
era

the court a pleasant creamy brown was
constructed of a springy composition very
easy on the feet the dimensions seemed
the same as those of today-although ted
who would never think of pacing them off


wonder stories

reports that the service line looked a little
farther back the rackets likewise had a
normal appearance although cast in one
piece out of some sort of condensation pro-
duct with a marked whip strings were
opaque the balls while keeping the tra-
ditional white had no covers their sur-
face instead possessed an inherent rough-
ness that never wore off-the result it was
explained to ted of the constant breaking
open of bubbles in the rubber sponge-
and that gave such friction as to permit the
cutting of all but the hardest balls played
the rules and scoring had not been modi-
fied by two hundred and fifty years except
for the abolition of the second chance at ser-
vice

but if the external character of the game
was not greatly changed the play itself had
been marvellously improved speed hair-
breadth accuracy of placement service that
broke like baseball pitching all testified
to centuries of scientific study and these
as anne confessed were far from champion-
ship players yet one girl especially-her
name was margaret and she wore what
would pass for a modern bathing suit with
dark blue trunks and white top while a rib-
bon of flexible copper held back her au-
burn hair-had a game that not only out-
classed all the men present but would even
ted insists make serious trouble for tilden
r lacoste

before the mornings play was half over
seemingly bothered at its restriction she had
yanked off the shirt of her suit her
bronzed torso as she swung into dazzling
service or drives made ted think of a
boxers though without any masculine sug-
gestion

a clock somewhere had just struck nine
 it would be in our time when
anne suggested a swim the crowd fol-
lowed her to a man as she ran off along a
path through potted shrubbery putting
all his force into it ted was glad to find
that in this exercise of pure strength he
could catch up to her could have passed
her they reached the pool together the
water was smooth and clear with a marble
rim and a strip of grass around it it was
shut off from the sun by the mass of the

building anne raced straight for the edge
lagging behind a little led watched her
as she pulled the garments from her sweat-
gleaming body stood poised white and
naked overhead between the spans of
two bridges a silvery airship hung glitter-
ing in the sky

then she had plunged into the blue-green
limpid water the others hurried up
shouting noisily some having thrown off
half their clothes as they ran one girl
stooping too near the edge to untie her shoes
was shoved in fully dressed those already
swimming splashed up at the others come
on in the waters fine that banal con-
juration ted reflected must have now all
the connotations of quaint antiquity

chapter iii
a perilous age

the water was cool as ted stripped and
plunged in the rush of it along the
skin refreshing to his hot body he swam
until he was tired-the easy almost mech-
anical stroke of the others carried them at
racing speed without apparent drain on
their energy-then stretched himself out on
the grass to dry from there he could see
that much of the new effortless speed came
from a strange twisting thrash of the legs
together with a careful exactitude of arm
movements that looked the result of mathe-
matical study

but what most engrossed teds attention
was the picture before him the flashing
bodies of various shades of brown-some
of the womens were a light creamy tan in
spite of all their exposure-and their green-
ish glimmer beneath the water the white
background of the building with its great
mass towering overhead his fingers itched
he says for a brush it came over him
too a little lying there that besides the
material spotlessness he had noticed in the
new san francisco there must be a spiritual
cleanness about this civilization to permit
of such glorious nakedness

that afternoon anne took him to see the
sights her car occupying an exceedingly
small space in the apartment garage on a
a flight unto time

level with one of the vehicular causeways
was a snug fit for the two of them the
machine ran from radio power with a silent
electric motor and although steering was
done as at present a small panel of push-
buttons along the inside of the wheel con-
trolled speed transmission and ordinary
braking traffic in the streets and on the
higher levels was fairly easy facilitated
both by the small size of the vehicles and
as anne explained by a housing system
which so far as possible incorporated a fac-
tory the apartment residences of its em-
ployees and a complement of retail stores
in a single great building

riding mostly in the streets proper al-
though at times climbing long inclines to
the upper causeways they visited the great
manufactories of the city the foundries
where out of common earth was extracted
the aluminum used in the alloys incredibly
light and strong that had taken almost com-
pletely the place of steel the textile mills
where automatic machinery spun its own
synthetic threads and wove them into the
finished product almost without human in-
tervention where a huge loom furnished a
single canvas for an artist-workman to vary
constantly the colors and patterns as they
came forth the generating plants where
looking guardedly through solid feet of fil-
ter glass they could see rriatter as it disap-
peared in a seething flame giving up the
energy that ran the wheels of this new civi-
lization they went to a number of public
buildings auditoriums libraries museums
-ted noticed in passing a  air-
plane among the exhibitions-buildings
beautiful in their long straight lines and
great light-filled spaces it was late after-
noon when they came to the cathedral

the marble pile cruciform at its base
rose by scarcely perceptible set-backs in a
single spire that towered almost twice as
high as the other buildings within its
architecture was such a glorification of the
girder as had been gothic of that equally
mechanical device of the pointed arch an
airy tracery that yet carried the suggestion
of the mass it supported the lines of the
place carried the eye upward up to the
great cross-beams where people walked

dwarfed almost to nothingness before the
majesty of the house of god up to where
windows that were solid jewels made of the
slanting sunlight a rainbow mist up and
up to a luminous infinity that the eye could
touch at but could not grasp

for a minute ted stood looking at it
then anne drew him off to one side in a
corner of the transept where they could be
undisturbed her voice was low befitting
the silence of the holy place when she
gpoke

i brought you here for the last place
to show you and tell you a great truth
we could not have you stay here or go
back to your own time thinking that our
material achievements are the heart and
height of our civilization that was the
worlds ideal once and by that it nearly
called down its own ruin

tt had been a rich world that early

x twenty-first century whose garish re-
lics dad collects so carefully until in its
love and fear of war its use and misuse of
science it had built up huge populations
that threatened the very food supply and
made food sources a cause of conflict it
was an ugly world so full of blind toil and
hectic amusement that man almost desired
the relief of strife it was a cruel world
with god and good forgotten in material-
ism with exploitation and crime rampant
in every land and with the two great con-
federations of the east and west eyeing each
other across the pacific and the russian bor-
der with mingled greed and hatred and
fear then in the year  came the
cataclysm

the oriental scientists discovered atomic
disintegration six months before the west
and plunged into war with atomic bombs
and all the terrible engines developed in a
hundred years they almost won at the
first plunge sweepingdown to the line of
the rhine and the danube laying waste
australia and all north america west of the
rockies then the west rallied and held its
lines on land and in the air while scientists
on either side worked desperately to dis-
cover more deadly and better controlled


wonder stories

forms of the horror of disintegration now
common to both parties

for twenty years hopelessly the strug-
gle raged the americans now pushing the
chinese back into the sea the russians and
indians retaliating by seizing all but the tip
of africa and the people suffered they
died by tens of millions in the arfnies died
in ever greater numbers from explosions
and poison gas and disease germs in the fac-
tories at home

toward the last when both sides had set-
tled down to a stalemate policy of mere
raids and devastation they even began to
starve in the big cities and class warfare
broke out against the rich and the farmers
those last five years when the whole world
seemed about to go under the birth rate
dropped almost to zero and the worlds
population had fallen to a quarter of its
pre-war level before the conflict and its
after effects were over russia france
and central europe were almost wholly de-
populated in a last sortie with newly
developed ray disintegrators an american
air fleet manned by women and fifteen-year
old boys simply blew japan off the face of
the globe-theres only a shoal there now

it was then when it seemed just possi-
ble that at huge cost the oriental peoples
might be annihilated that the war-weariness
and reborn conscience of the west refused
to permit such sacrifice or such slaughter
the west offered peace and the east
though with a new weapon of its own in pre-
paration as gladly accepted it at hono-
lulu in  without conditions without
victory was signed the peace that has en-
dured until today-and shall we hope for-
ever

the next fifty years were the dark ages
of modern times a struggle at times seem-
ingly hopeless to reclaim the world from
devastation and ruin to restore agriculture
and civilization before the remnant of man-
kind starved or returned to the brute it
was a hard painful time and yet it proved
to be the foundation of our world today
in the time of their misery the peoples of
the earth called upon the god they had for-
gotten and he was there to answer their
prayer joined together by a common loss

a common struggle and a common hope
they forged ahead in a new unity toward the
ideal world we think we are approaching

we have learned much from the history
and the precepts of those days we have
learned that if civilization is to endure and
advance the world must consciously strive
to make itself just and beautiful and happy
as well as prosperous we have learned
that the key to science is not its acquisition
but its use-the principles of all our devices
were known in the last century and turned
to destruction we have learned not to be
too proud thinking how near we once came
to the edge in the heart of each of us is
still something of that spirit which brought
the world up out of its danger literally the
spirit of god moving over the face of the
earth

an astounding discovery

the next day-monday he subcon-
sciously persisted in calling it although
he knew it to be friday in this year-storrs
was left to his own devices all the morning
rodgers of course was at the museum and
anne remembered she had to fly down to
los angeles to keep an engagement not
trusting himself to find his way in the new
san francisco ted kept within the apart-
ment spending most of his time in the lib-
rary

he had counted on looking through the
books on rodgers shelves but to his con-
sternation he found himself incapable of
reading them their language when he
puzzled it out was the same as that spoken
or practically his own-since the english
tongue stabilized by printing had been al-
most entirely unchanged by centuries but
the phonetic spelling and symbols that had
been developed made the sounds as hard to
get at as in say shorthand and storrs had
not the pertinacity to go through more than
a sentence here and there

other books on the shelves were spanish
that most phonetic of modern tongues in
close to its present-day spelling but ted
knew only enough of the language to recog-
nize it a third bookcase contained vol-
umes whose sounds were pure gibberish but
a flight into time



which he judged from the illustrations and
ornaments must be chinese in the standard
phonetic spelling it occurred to him as
very likely that after the destruction anne
had described these three were the peoples
who had survived in sufficient preponder-
ance th spanish in south america to
make their tongues as nearly a universal
language as the world could hope to achieve

turning from the useless books ted de-
cided to risk injuring the machine by ex-
perimenting with the radio in one corner
of the room it had he found single dial
tuning and he let the various compensa-
tors alone jacked into the set was a sort
of mask containing light-weight earphones
with goggles over the eyes remembering
a vague something of modern experiments
in television he put the thing on and turn-
ed the dial slowly in the dark

the first station he reached was audible
only a talk of some sort in sing-song chin-
ese the next one he caught not by music
which he might have missed altogether but
by a rainbow flash before his eyes as he
turned the dial past he went back more
carefully and music and scene became clear-
er though the latter remained for a while
badly blurred he finally discovered that
the goggles were adjustable for focus and
as he turned them the picture came out
startingly clear in its colors and even more
startingly solid

the bright-costumed dancers that whirled
about the ballroom were as real and close
as if he had been standing among them
it seemed as if he could touch one couple
as they spun and he almost toppled over
the receiver in his involuntary attempt to
do so the music too was dimensional-
the two phones apparently being fed by
different currents-so that he could judge
to which side of him were the various in-
struments of the unseen orchestra

the thing was a marvelous toy and grow-
ing more expert in its manipulation he turn-
ed for hours from scene to scene from a
glimpse of the black sea-bottom with a self-
luminous monster swimming straight at him
to the opera at calcutta where the tradi-
tional costumes and the familiar melan-
choly strains of la boheme brought him a

pang that had in it a sort of homesickness
at length however the weight of the eye-
pieces became a strain and it was rather
disconcerting to keep turning his head and
have the view remain the same he turned
the machine off he was really glad when
just as he had finished a dinner ordered
up on his hosts account rodgers appeared
to inform him that he was wanted by the
committee on motion in time

he met the committee there were five
members two white-haired men who
looked like brothers an ample german
frau a young fellow of teds own age
with a wild shock of hair a withered old
chinese woman fingering constantly a bit
of jade they had already heard the out-
line of teds story and seemed in the main
convinced of his honesty however there
were a few test questions for him-fine de-
tails from their ancient archives as the
early transoceanic flights and baseball
standings and a long list of prices he
answered correctly such a great proportion
of these and so frankly confessed his ignor-
ance of the rest that their remaining doubts
were stilled at once they poured out the
flood of their own queries

young man now that you can speak in
confidence tell us what were your methods
was the prime agency physical or psy-
chological

do you think you could do it again-
this from the artistic-looking youngster

what were your sensations as you passed
through two centuries

storrs answered them one by one feeling
just a little ashamed that his real accom-
plishment was so far below their anticipa-
tions he had had no methods and his leap
into space wholly involuntary had proba-
bly taken place through external and phy-
sical means his only reason for thinking
the process might be reversed was that it
had already taken place the one way he
had felt no sensations whatever his shift
in time being unnoticed and if one could so
use the word instantaneous

then you did not simply speed up the
normal flow of time as we have been hoping


wonder stories

lo do the fraus pronouncement mir-
rored the general disappointment

for perhaps fifteen minutes the five pon-
dered the problem while ted shifted rest-
lessly in his chair and rodgers was ab-
sorbed in his own speculations there was
not even the ticking of a clock to disturb
the silence for the radioactive machines
worked noiselessly at last the chinese
matriarch who had hitherto remained silent
spoke

would you mind telling us again just
what year it was before you made the
jump

she almost shouted two hundred and
fifty-six years dont you see the nn of
my helical theory two hundred and fifty-
six four to the fourth

chapter iv
the last evening

all five began talking at once arguing
articulating wildly scribbling mazes of
formulae on the table cover ted could
only catch a word here and there the rest
when english at all was in vocabulary and
thought simply over his head at last they
seemed agreed and the old man who acted
as chairman turned to ted

mr storrs you have performed a great
service to our investigations your exper-
ience has proved in confirmation of mad-
ame ngs hypothesis that our time stream
is curved helically in some higher dimen-
sion in your case a still further distor-
tion brought two points of the coil into con-
tact and a sort of short circuit threw you
into the higher curve the verification of
the helical theory is beyond reasonable
doubt

he paused and cleared his throat

now as to yourself you may if you
wish remain in our era the committee
will be glad to take care of you and for a
while at least the history people would
pay high for your services in settling some
of their problems about your period on

she meant four raised to the fourth pow-
r or xxx-

the other hand we would be more than glad
to make the attempt harmless if it fails and
very likely to succeed to send you back to
your own times

we have an electrical space-distorting
coil whose side thrust perpendicular to the
time-stream we have tried hitherto to sup-
press but which we shall now emphasize
if you stand at the same spot and the same
time of day as your first jump this will
have a good chance of throwing you back
to your own curve of the stream

in case you wish to avail yourself of
this opportunity the sooner you decide to
do so the better-both because the two
curves must be separated rapidly and in
view of the fact that adjustment of your mind
to our time would make the jump progres-
sively harder we can have the machine
fixed up by tomorrow noon and perhaps
you had better make up your mind by then
either way you decide you have our thanks
for what you have already done

the company rose together and storrs
took the signal to leave outside the door
was a group of newspaper reporters who
tried to persuade him to don his old clothes
which he had sacrificed for more congruous
attire for a photograph this much of
civilization had not changed in centuriesl
ted got rid of them at last with a brief
statement referring them to the committee
for technical details then in company
with the still more irritated rodgers he set
out for home again

when they arrived anne had got back
already and had dinner coming up for
them she was silent during the meal while
they told her of the days developments-
ted of the conclusions of the committee
and its projected experiment rodgers of

them up to the small flat roof and they
climbed the tower that stretched still farther
above at its top with their feet braced
against a battlemented edge they could sit
secure and gaze out over the city

in the west the sun was sinking beneath
a growing pile of clouds up where they
sat its light still made day but down in the
streets the shadows were creeping in gray
growing ever darker they climbed the sides
of the building with clutching fingers in
the increasing gloom the great pyramids
bulked larger than ever black and a little
terrible now only a few of their high tops
were afire now the sun had set and the
cathedral spire alone shone a faint rose
i the afterglow the night rushed in

with its coming as at a common sig-
nal the lights of the city flashed
forth in windows along streets and cause-
ways projected from the single headlights
of the little cars there were no electric
signs they were not glaring but of the soft
silver storrs had noted before looking a
little bluish in the distance as the dark-
ness became complete they were all that
could be seen gleaming insubstantial
lovely the bridges-the little ones across
the streets the great spans thrown over the
bay and the golden gate-hung from their
cables that were loops of light like things
out of another world it was like a fairy
city a city built of gossamer and dreams
overhead the stars were coming out and
against them glowed here and there the
firefly lights of airships as they passed

beside ted with her chin resting on her
knees anne had remained silent now she
spoke reading his mind

youre going back then

yes it may be foolish of me but some-
how-

i know you could get along very nice-
ly here work is not too hard and very
interesting while we have tilings that the
millionaires of your day could not possess
some of us-would like you to stay and
yet it would seem to you as it must seem
now a sort of unreal dream that is one
absolute thing about time in spite of their

theories i could never be satisfied in the
future or the past

the fog was rolling in in a great wave
white and soft and cool and still now
one then another of the bridges over the
water was shrouded in it and disappeared
the city itself was blotted out only leaving
the vapor faintly luminous when over the
faint glitter of lights that was oakland the
moon rose its rays fell upon a white billow-
ing sea that had covered san francisco
here and there as where the two of them
were sitting a black peak rose above the
high-piled fog the rest was a dazzling
solid barrier that left them isolated for the
moment from the world then a cold wind
from the sea blew in whirling ghostly mist-
tendrils in the air they rose and turned
to go

the morrow passed like a flash one
minute so it seemed to storrs anne was
mockingly reading to him the morning pa-
per with his full-colored picture on the
front and beneath it the headlines un-
willing visitor arrives from
 may try return trip the next
he had placed himself as well as he could
guess upon the spot where he had made
his entry into this world and the members
of the committee with their assistants were
assembling around him a complicated ar-
rangement of coils and plates

it made him feel he says and he smiled
a little then to think of it like the filament
of a vacuum tube there was rather a
crowd outside with motion picture photo-
graphers and a radio televisor to catch the
scene as he disappeared into nothingness
anne was there too and her father she in
her uniform ready to pilot the polar spec-
ial at one as the preparations drew on
endlessly storrs became nervous he even
thought of giving up the venture only to be
dissuaded strangely by the consideration
that it would disappoint these people

at last they were ready all but two of
the indicator lights on a many-dialed control
board were glowing brightly storrs felt
a little giddy and judged that the prelim-
inary circuits must be getting in their ef-
fect

he murders on

the moon-ship

the last case was aboard the final
handshakes were over the last pas-
senger a fussy little fellow in a check suit
had at length given heed to the frantic hoot-
ing of the siren disengaged himself from the
powerful embraces of an oversized yet
lachrymose female and clutching his ticket
in one hand and a tenanted parrot cage in
the other made a breathless and hatless
dive for the gangway

to old and seasoned space-fliers like pro-
fessor galloway and myself there was
something ludicrous in all this emotional
bustle this fuss and pother over a little hop
to the moon but then in all probability the
majority of the voyagers had never before
left the earth while there might even have
been some incredible though it may sound
to my twenty-first century readers who had

never before travelled beyond the boundar-
ies of their own continent

nevertheless as the captain radioed the
starting signal for the first atomic explo-
sions to propel our bullet-like liner through
the twenty-mile starting tunnel in the
welsh hills i fancy that even my bald-
headed and fossilised old friend must have
felt an odd thrill although the only emo-
tion he displayed was extreme irritability
at the departure time being at least two
minutes behind schedule

whatever old galloway felt i know that
i dso explorer one-time secret service
man and erstwhile war correspondent
though i was never left for a trip to the
moon without a sinking feeling in the pit
of my stomach as we commenced that tre-
mendous acceleration through the tube and



terror stalked among the passengers of the space
ship - as the unknown struck

he pressed the button of his torch and saw the creatures head being
forced through the aperture  he attempted to write   

despite all the refinements in the way of
gravity stabilisers velocity equalisers these
stats and those stats with which all
modern moonships were equipped on this
particular occasion that sinking feeling
seemed more intense than ever before it
was as though my reactions were warning
me of the terrible events which were to take
place before the x reached its destina-
tion

the x was one of the packet companys
latest vessels with eight-cylinder atomic
propulsion engines and a host of mechan-
ical gadgets which did not interest me in
the slightest for i am no engineer what
did interest me was the excellent cuisine
and the really comfy little cabins to say
nothing of the varied and extensive stock
of sparkling wines laid in by the discrim-
inating purser and noting the general air
of luxury comfort and home-from-horne-
ishness as we made our way through the
earths atmospheric belt i forgot all about
my premonitions and began cheerfully to
anticipate this two months trip as a veri-
table oasis it would be after the hard-

ships old galloway and myself had under-
gone on the wil mesas of south america
during the past two years collecting his
confounded specimens and contracting
malaria once we reached the professors
lunar observatory i knew the old grind
would begin again but for the next two
months i told myself i was just going to
vegetate in blissful tranquillity and friend
galloway could go to the devil and take
his beloved fossils with him

the professor had other ideas however
we had scarcely reached the zone of outer
space when i encountered him in the bil-
liard room surrounded by a group of ad-
miring passengers who were plying him with
questions about the moon his work space
the fifth dimension the missing link and
a hundred and one other scientific puzzles
for galloways brilliance and catholicity of
accomplishment were by-words throughout
the whole world

a born showman my old friend rose
superbly to the occasion his eyes
sparkled his long white mutachios which

wonder stories

always reminded me of a comic opera bri-
gand seemed to take on a fiercer aspect
and even his polished bald head seemed to
glisten with greater iridescence as he
spoke of his wonderful laboratory and ob-
servatory on the moon
of the artificial pro-
duction of air and the
synthesis of water on
the satellite of the
strange two-dimension-
al natives of the moon
who could live intelli-
gently without water
food or atmosphere
and finally of our two
years search among
the rocks of the little
known south ameri-
can plateau for fossil
specimens of missing
links in the evolu-
tionary chain final-
ly with a soft graci-
ousness which was in
total contrast to the
vicious irascibility
which he was wont to
display in controversy
he hoisted a chubby
little fellow of about
seven years old who
had asked him if he
found any birds eggs
in south merica  
and promised to show
him on the morrow
not only birds eggs
but alligators eggs
and strange animals in
stone that had roamed
the earth ages ago

the next few days
passed peacefully
enough with profes-
sor galloway very
much in the limelight

through the windows
of the lounge he would point out the beau-
ties of the heavenly bodies set like jewels
in the dead blackness of outer space he
would discuss orbitary navigation with the

spatial officers or repeat his little scientific
talks to the passengers who were delighted
and surprised to find such an eminent per-
sonage as accessible and agreeably inform-
ative but wherever my old friend went
he was accompanied
by little jackie hil-
liard whose parents
had much ado tearing
the young rascal away
at sleeping time to get
him to bed

in all my long ex-
perience i had never
seen galloway unbend
to such a degree nor
had i ever known him
show so much affec-
tion for anyone as he
appeared to do for this
small boy who i
should imagine must
have tried galloways
colossal mind with his
infantile queries but
then space flying like
sea voyaging seems to
make people more
friendly the childs
parents were a good-
looking young couple
none too well off if i
might judge by ap-
pearances and no
doubt making their
way to the moon with
a view to settling down
there and improving
their prospects

our other passen-
gers were more inter-
esting to the student of
humanity most in-
teresting was docteur
emile fouchard of
psychic and meta-
physical fame a tall
gaunt man with a trim
beard a air of mystery and the clothes of
an undertaker he had little to say but
when he did speak he gesticulated like a
circus contortionist and almost invariably

j jmagine a handful ov
 people travelling on a
space ship between the
earth and moon in their
midst is a merciless de-
stroyer he strikes not
once but five times-each
time in a different manner
the crew and passengers
are terrified-they suspect
each other - madness be-
gins    such is the ma-
terial that this story is
made of

it is enough to say that
fear is the greatest aid of
the murderer just as it is
ultimately his own undo-
ing if he wishes to kill
any person he need only
make them aware of the
fact and arouse in the vic-
tims mind such a feeling
of terror that he will be-
tray himself to his as-
sassin for when terror
grips us we cannot reason
we cannot take the ordin-
ary precautions that should
be used to defend our-
selves

then too it is fear of
apprehension that leads
the criminal to ultimately
leave some track that will
betray him for in the
game of chess that he
plays with the forces of
order it needs only one
false move to lead to dis-
aster

we are sure our readers
will enjoy this engrossing
story of humor tragedy
 and mad terror in the in- 
a terplanetary spaces	
the murders on the moon ship



in a low musically intoned yet uncanny
voice he would quote some adage anent the
insecurity of human life or throw out some
dark hint of coming peril after the first
day or two the other passengers made a
practice of seeing him first and giving
him the air and for hours he would sit
musing in a chair fingering an exotic ring
which he had informed me came from the
tombs of the pharaohs or poring over his
favorite volume a leather-covered copy of
shakespeares hamlet

the fellow got on my nerves there was
something sinister about him thats the
word sinister although the american
purser minott used another characteristic
yankee term something to do with insects
ah yes bughouse that
was it at least that was
how i remember it

a goodly crew

t was almost a relief
to turn to mrs van
stokes who if she was
fat and vulgar and over-
poweringly reminiscent
of pork was at any rate
cheerful and happy she
claimed to be the widow
of a rich pickle packer
although i suspected her
widowhood was of the
grass rather than the
common or garden variety she furnished
a sort of comic relief to our scene

then there were the ruttledge twins
beatrice and cornelia sprightly young lad-
ies of twenty summers apiece honorable
leaders of the bright young people who
attempted to paint london red and only
succeeded in imparting a rose pink tinge
to some of the more insignificant suburbs
born practical jokers they found dr fouch-
ard and poor old galloway ready made
butts for their rather broad humor which
consisted in such silly tricks as binding
fouchards feet together while he browsed
over hamlet or neatly tying the printed
legend lost to the back of the professors
smoking jacket while one of his impromptu
lectures was in progress next to fouch-

ard i liked the ruttledge twins least of all
among my fellow passengers	x

then there was adolph bratz the piano
virtuoso long haired and unkempt but with
a lurid reputation alike as a hammer
breaker and home breaker he was very
friendly with mr and mrs hilliard and i
later found that he was financing their trip
though why i couldnt imagine for neither
of the hilliards knew a beethoven sonata
from the five-finger exercise

and last but not least in self-importance
was the fussy little fellow in the check suit
who rejoiced in the name of henry v john-
son he was a physics teacher in a small-
town high school and was out with the
purpose to teach the world his trip
to the moon being the re-
sult of his winning a prize
offered by a sunday pa-
per place the most pop-
ular planets in order
first prize a trip to the
moon all found you
know the kind of thing
anyway johnson had
won and here he was
with his parrot priscil-
la in the bargain he
confided to galloway
as one scientist to an-
other that he was taking
the parrot to test the
lunar atmosphere before
he stepped out of the ship to risk a breath
himself to his mind it was a new way of
trying it on the dog which somehow got
to the ears of the ruttledge twins after
which johnsons life became a misery

so you will see that we were rather a
mixed lot mcfee the scottish engineer
put it very pawkily when he whispered to
me on the second day out present com-
pany awllways excepted majorr theyre
a gey queer carrgo this trrip

the personnel of a space-flier is not of
course very extensive captain brant i
knew well we had played in the same foot-
fall team and i had perfect confidence in
his courage and ability in all emergencies

for wear these days but there was plenty

given many a younger man a good run for
his money at half a dozen forms of ath-
letics with minott the purser mcfee the
engineer olsen the radio-man and shep-
pard the navigator we had as hard-boiled
a group of officers as ever stepped aboard a

there was no sign for the purely menial
tasks were carried out by robots of striking
design and characteristics i had almost
forgotten a most important member of the
personnel mrs mcnamara the stewardess
a cockney with an accent you would cut
with a knife and a temper that made old
confirmed bachelors like galloway and my-
self thank our lucky stars

chapter ii
the first disaster

here we were then seventeen souls
speeding away from the earth as fast
as atomic disintegration could carry us
each with his or her own secret ambitions
and aspirations each with his or her own
secret fears from the first our isolation
welded us together into a large family and
before we had been a week out we felt
we had known each other all our lives

then like a sudden thunderbolt came the
first blow which heralded the reign of ter-
ror through which we were to pass the
first blow which was to undermine our con-
fidence in one another and to make us go
about suspecting each other and fearing for
our very lives

the first blow was comic ludicrous
damned silly nonsense as galloway put
it johnsons blessed parrot was found dead
in its cage just that nothing more
there was no sign of molestation the
cage was undamaged  it stood on the cen-
tre table in johnsons abin just as he had
left it when he retired for the night in
the morning the parrot was lying dead in
its cage everyone sympathised with the
little physics teacher to his face and smiled
at his forlorn countenance behind his back
but johnson was not so easily pacified he

openly accused professor galloway of poi-
soning the bird and raved and ranted for
an hour or more to captain brant who had
great difficulty in controlling his own sense
of risibility nothing would please john-
son but a thorough examination not only
of the carcass but also of the bird seed
and water	

the matter was somewhat complicated as
galloway was the only one aboard who had
the necessary technical qualifications for
such a task and the professor was unfor-
tunately prisoner at the bar so to speak
questioned as to why a eminent professor
like my friend should stoop to such a petty
and unnecessary act johnson reiterated
again that it was professional jealousy he
had got the better of an argument with the
professor the night before galloway had
got very angry ergo galloway had poi-
soned the parrot out of spite

everyone took the matter as a joke ex-
cept johnson and of course galloway who
lost all of his amiability and gave vent to
a string of expletives that almost upset the
ship we left the two reviling one an-
other and i turned in with captain brant
for a smoke and a yarn

come to think of it you know major
the professor was a little bit rude to the
dominie last night	

oh i ejaculated for i had spent the
evening discussing brahms with herr bratz

yeah the old man had been displaying
some of his fossils and lecturing a select
group about the discrepancies in lamarcks
theories when johnson butted in with a
query about suspended animation this up-
set galloway who inquired -whether he
wanted any more irrelevant information for
his kindergarten cranium such as the nam-
ber of legs a caterpillar possessed or whe-
ther elephants lay eggs but little john-
son stuck to his guns and told a cock and
bull story about a toad that was found by
some miners blasting embedded in rock
formations at least a thousand years old
the miners thought it was a fossil but some
director of natural history thought other-
wise applied oxygen and restoratives and
the toad came to life and for a matter of
three weeks or so frisked about at the end
the murders on the moon ship



of which time he was attacked by another
toad in the laboratory and died

old man galloway fairly snorted at that
he was sore at his little lecture being inter-
rupted with such twaddle but johnson with
a smile of triumph produced old faded cut-
tings authenticating his story this fairly
riled the professor who described the whole
affair as a silly hoax one thing led to an-
other until galloway so far forgot himself
as to call johnson a liar to which john-
sons parrot made the classic retort and
galloways sense of repartee was worn so
thin that he could only reply that if such
states of suspended animation really exist-
ed the sooner johnson entered one the
better and he had better take his con-
founded parrot with him and that con-
cluded the programme for the evening
both went to their own cabins looking dag-
gers at one another

ttm i see still surely no one be-
u lieves galloway would do such a
stupid act

no only johnson can conceive such ac-
tion and he is suffering under a sense of
grievance when he comes to his senses
hell realise like the rest of us that the
damned thing died a natural death its
just coincidence that he quarrelled with the
professor the night before

as i made my way to my own cabin i
could hear galloway and johnson still at
it the one arguing angrily against the other
much to the secret amusement of the rutt-
ledge twins come to think of it if there
was foul play about this beastly parrot
business it looked much mote like these
mischief-making young females work than
poor old galloways but then although
they were fond of fun i could not picture
these young ladies descending to such use-
less cruelty the day wore on and for
the first time galloway did not lecture in
the billiard room truth to tell this con-
founded parrot business had got on every-
bodys nerves and one and all were glad
when sleeping time arrived and we could
make excuses to steal off to our own cabins

personally i felt awfully disturbed even
a stiff peg of op whiskey could not woo

for me sleep and i lay tossing from side
to side after all there was something
damned funny about a healthy parrot pop-
ping off suddenly like that and galloway
had behaved very strangely for him since
coming aboard at length i fell into a
troubled sleep in which parrots with beaks
like pterodactyls chased me all over the
moon a loud gurgling woke me i sat
up fully awake my heart pounding with
the sudden start footsteps yes then a
cry for help it was galloway was john-
son attacking him i grasped my auto-
matic and made my way to the place from
which i guessed the cry to have come it
was johnsons cabin switching on the
light what a sight met my eyes galloway
stood supporting johnson both were in
their night attire from johnsons neck
the blood spattered and spurted like a foun-
tain despite galloways efforts to swab it
in johnsons face was a drawn look of ter-
ror such as i had never before beheld and
on the floor i was horrified to note the pro-
fessors ivory paper knife in a pool of
blood

the noise had attracted the others and
passengers and officers alike were crowd-
ing into the doorway brant waved the
women back and closed the door john-
son was already beyond help a jagged
wound through the carotid of the size he
had experienced was more than any man
could survive the captain took in the sit-
uation at a glance mcfee stood over the
professor with my automatic but galloway
seemed too dazed to comprehend the situa-
tion when at last he realised he was un-
der arrest for murder he protested his in-
nocence bitterly and vehemently and called
brant and the rest of us all the fools and
dolts urging us that while we fooled about
with him the murderer was making his es-
cape

pro and con

but the damning evidence of the paper
knife and the wound in johnsons neck
which was just such a gash as the ivory
knife would make at length made him real-
ise that further protest was useless and


wonder stories

with a sigh he resigned himself to the in-
evitable what an object lesson i thought
to myself for those with uncontrollable
tempers a few hasty words over some
scientific triviality had led one of the most
brilliant men of science to commit a cow-
ardly murder i couldnt bring myself to
believe in his innocence despite his pro-
tests i knew his bursts of passion too well
but i listened to his faltering account of the
incident with a quaking heart for we were
friends of old standing

according to galloway he had been
awakened by a peculiar swishing noise
which he could not describe he arose to
investigate and switching on the light
grasped the paper knife as the only avail-
able weapon although what he feared
aboard the moonship he had to admit he
could not say then he heard johnson cry
out a deep gurgling sound followed he
raced into johnsons room and by the glim-
mer of light from his own cabin opposite
saw that johnson was lying back in his bed
bleeding grievously from the neck drop-
ping the paper knife he attempted to ar-
rest the flow of blood with the bed covers
and was so doing when i made my entrance

we all listened politely but none
of us were very impressed the defence was
just a shade too complete it covered all
the obvious points as for instance why gal-
loway had not switched on the light and the
presence of the paper knife and we were
all really relieved when captain brant had
him conducted to a spare cabin under guard
so that we might talk more freely

of course the only thing to do under the
circumstances was to radio the spatial sta-
tion from which a speedy magnetic rocket
with a police official would be dispatched
to take charge of the case but we were one
and all bowed down with the horror of the
tragedy that is all except dr emile
fouchard the inhuman wretch seemed in
his glory and punctuated our gloom with
his horrible fatalistic quotations of which
his crop seemed at all times to be full

suddenly he veered round excitedly
captain you av ze wrong man i am sure
in ze first place look at ze daggair it lies
in a pool of blood zat is true but note

carefully ze point does not lie in ze blood
and for two inches from ze point is it
not white and glistening innocent of blood
has the assassin then used ze haft of ze
daggair to make ze puncture no for ze
haft is blunt it looks then that ze pro-
fessair is of an innocence as he declare

considair too he made a cry for help
would he have made that cry if he had been
guilty before the murdair ad been smooth-
ed ovair and he made his escape he was
assist ze victim when he knew that if guil-
ty recovery would spell disaster for him-
self

the latter part of le doctcurs speech did
not impress me much for galloway would
have acted just so i knew had he in a mo-
ment of passion struck johnson he would
have done everything in his power to undo
the wrong but the evidence of the paper
knife was conclusive for a couple of
inches from the point there was not the
slightest trace of blood and its general ap-
pearance bore out galloways statement that
he had dropped the paper knife to render
first aid to johnson

brants face was a study well if the
professor did not kill johnson who the
hades did can you tell me that docteur
fouchard smiled that horrible sinister smile
of his ah who can zay there are now
sixteen of us aboard it may be any one of
us who knows but one of us it must be
unless a spirit     

tush put in brant roughly pretty
hefty spirit made this mess besides none
of us here believes in spirits

no zat is a pity there are more things
in eaven and earth that are dreamt of in
your philosophy who knows who
knows and the docteur glided out of the
room

that bird puts years on me said min-
ott the purser betcha life he knows more
about the job than he says

i  hats quite enough minott re-
x buked the captain tell olsen to
radio the spatial station and inform them
of the occurrence its out of my depth
and i need help in the meantime major
let us have a talk with the professor and
the murders on the moon ship



see if we can do anything to solve the mys-
tery

we moved to galloways prison my old
friend looked twenty years older than he
had the previous night the terrible ac-
cusation was bearing heavily upon him he
welcomed us with a wan smile of hopeless-
ness but when we informed him of our
finding of the knifes innocence in the af-
fair his face brightened perceptibly and
he wrung our hands with delight

there was still much to clear up how-
ever as brant said if galloway was in-
nocent who was guilty and even more
mysterious if the paper knife had not madex
the fatal wound in johnsons neck what
had we had searched the apartment but
no trace of a weapon could be found gal-
loway was as nonplussed as the captain and
myself while we were investigating i
noted some scraps ofburnt paper by the
side of the lamp well there might be a
clue here the three of us took up the
scraps whoever had done the burning had
made a bad job of it for there were several
scraps containing words in a feminine hand
it was a tedious business smoothing out the
fragments but what a reward what a clue
when we had finished it read with many
a gap between-

you must	me see you

my husband knows all s n r game
if rent h w intrigued
cad rotter m you remember
i just love sneer t make a false
move i kill sight	sin

trice

brant gave a low whistle a most in-
criminating document yes said gal-
loway we never thought of the women
but its a case of cherchez la femme once
more

um question is which woman trice
i obviously beatrice but there are three
beatrices aboard one of the ruttledge
twins but we can count her out as shes a
spinster the van stokes female who may
or may not be a widow and mrs hilliard

well i bet its the fat woman put in
the captain i hate the sight of that amor-
ous overfed creature just the kind to be

carrying on an intrigue with every man she
meets in fact shes been chasing me around
since the moment she came aboard

um yes but i never heard of a fat man
committing murder captain

no major but this is a fat woman and
belle guinness wasnt exactly two-dimen-
sional yknow

even under the horrible circumstances
we had to laugh at the captains prejudice
still that wasnt getting us any further i
was inclined to agree with galloway that
the most likely beatrice was mrs hilliard
modest and demure though she had always
appeared for one thing she was the only
woman who could be definitely proved to
have a husband for another that husband
was aboard and the note seemed to me to
reveal the fact that the husband had discov-
ered the intrigue since coming aboard even
if it had been of long standing

chapter iii

another tragedy

my own theory was that hilliard had
dispatched johnson in a jealous
frenzy but there was such an inglorious
uncertainty about the whole affair that
brant could hardly arrest anyone finally
it was decided to keep hilliard under sur-
veillance while i kept an eye on the beat-
rices i made my way to the lounge where
the women were huddled together as yet
they merely knew that johnson had met with
some accident or other and when i entered
i was plied with questions from all of them
well im not much of a bad news breaker
and i blurted out the truth before i knew
what i was doing

mrs van stokes had hysterics mrs hil-
liard was visibly affected the stewardess
crossed herself and only the ruttledge
twins seemed cool damned callous in fact
didnt turn an individual or collective hair
so to speak still they busied themselves
looking after the other females fetching
water and smelling salts and all that kind
of thing

i suddenly remembered i had a bottle of
brandy in my cabin and was hastening

along the corridor when i met minott the
purser with a face on which sheer funk was
written all over

we hastened to the room olsen was in
a standing position his right hand on the
electric light switch as though he had just
entered the room his posture was almost
lifelike but when i looked at his face my
god what a look of loathing and terror was
there i have seen scores of dead men on
the battlefields but i never saw such a
haunting look of dread as i beheld on ol-
sens dead face minott and i closed the
door retraced our steps to my cabin and
each took a tot of brandy then we search-
ed out captain brant

when the captain heard of the second
murder he was almost beside himself
there was something devilish uncanny
about the whole affair a murder or two on
land in an hotel say well it was bad
enough but one could get away from the
location but here driving through a vac-
uum in a shell-like contrivance here we had
some fiend in our midst and we could not
get away from the peril there were only
fifteen of us now and it must be one of the
fifteen yet who who who

brant having himself radioed the spatial
station rounded up the passengers and of-
ficers alike it was then that we missed
herr bratz the pianist come to think of
it we hadnt seen him when the first mur-
der was discovered and he had never turn-
ed up since putting two and two together
he seemed a bit sweet on young mrs hil-
liard was often in her company looked
as though hilliard wasnt the murderer af-
ter all but that bratz and johnson were
rivals and bratz had dispatched the physics
teacher and then hidden himself olsens
death squared with that bratz had over-
heard the captain suggesting the calling of
the spatial station and fearing immediate
detection he had disposed of the wireless
man

the problem was where was he hiding
an organised search was commenced bratz
cabin lay at the further end of the corridor
it was empty nor was there any indication

that anything was amiss a large quill peri
lay in a bottle of ink and on the same desk
a pile of music manuscript paper was ar-
rayed the chair in front of the desk had
been pushed aside slightly as though the
musician had been interrupted in his com-
position by some noise outside and had
arisen to investigate the cause

outside the cabin the corridor hereabouts
terminated in a cul de sac which was rather
dark even when the lights were on in the
passage we were just about to leave the
cabin when mrs hilliard who had fol-
lowed us uttered a little cry and darted
into the dark corner where she fell to her
knees sobbing jack oh jack

a dark object lay by her it was
bratz dead as a doornail here then
was the end of the mystery bratz was the
murderer and he had committed suicide
even as we assisted the grief-stricken wo-
man i couldnt help thinking that it was
funny a noted pianist should have jack
for christian name a silly womans pet
name i supposed

it was while we were grouped around
bratz that mcfee announced sighting the
spatial stations rocket and in a very few
moments we were conversing with marshal
merrivale the investigation officer from the
station now if this account was a fiction
thriller instead of an authentic narrative of
cold fact merrivale would be introduced
as an exceedingly brilliant amateur detec-
tive with a knowledge of all branches of
science half a dozen unheard of detection
machines a private fortune and a liking for
opium on these lines merrivale was rather
a disappointment

he was a small man with rather nice
gray eyes a moderately high broad fore-
head protruding ears tight-set lips and a
good deal of chin he was about thirty-six
or so to judge from appearances and ob-
viously physically fit although by no means
of the ultra-athletic type he didnt take
drugs he didnt smoke incessantly nor
drink absinthe he didnt even chew gum

of course we had all solved the mystery
by this time the culprit was dead by his
own hand we handed over the evidence
the murders on the moon ship



in the form of the ivory knife the in-
criminating document and what few other
odds and ends there were to merrivale and
then we all informed him of our own pet
views on the matter to all of which he
listened with grave politeness the truth
is we were all immensely relieved now that
the murdered was dead three deaths in one
night were horrible enough but infinitely
more horrible had been the suspense with
suspicion hanging over everyone and with
the relief our tongues were loosened mer-
rivale must have been fed up with all the
twaddle we talked but he heard us out

only dr fouchard dissented from the
popular view that bratz had committed sui-
cide hilliard was attempting to pacify his
wife who was almost beside herself with
grief funny kind of cuss hilliard must
be i admitted but i could not agree with
fouchard that the husband had dispatched
both johnson and bratz at length mer-
rivale must have tired of our chatter for he
turned to the captain abruptly and inti-
mated that he would like to inspect the
rooms where the murders had taken place

i accompanied merrivale and for some
hours we worked together although i must
confess my contributions consisted in fetch-
ing and carrying of the most elementary
kind examination of olsens body showed
that he had been poisoned but the poison
was one which merrivale could not identify
the administration had been through a
puncture in the back of the neck as though
a minute hypodermic had been used in
bratzs case a similar puncture was found
on the wrist of the right hand and several
punctures on the back of the left hand the
same poison was evident in johnsons case
no trace of poison was found the big jag-
ged wound being evidently the only cause
of death nor were there any traces of the
tell-tale punctures of the skin

i could see that merrivale unlike the all-
triumphant investigator of tradition was all
at sea so to speak two things puzzled him
greatly the fact that if the murders had a
common source the murderer had varied his
technique if he possessed such a subtle
means of poisoning why had he resorted to
the comparatively clumsy method of stab-

bing in the case of johnson and then again
where was the weapon which had dispatched
the little schoolmaster merrivale unlike
the usual tec was only too glad to talk
about his deductions probably on the prin-
ciple that two heads are better than one
even if the second be only of the mutton
variety and we discussed the situation to-
gether for a long time

too many theories

iivfou know major i am sure of one
x thing and that is that the pianist did
not commit suicide for one thing you see in
the case of olsen the radio man the poison
evidently acted so rapidly that he had no
time to stagger toward a chair he just
died where he stood with his hand on the
light switch that he saw his assailant is
evident from the look of horror on his face
he was evidently attacked the moment he
switched on the light and died the next in-
stant bratz died from the same poison
administered in the same way but where
olsen has but one puncture bratz has sever-
al on his hands now if the solitary punc-
ture on the right hand was self-inflicted
an ambidextrous pianist such as bratz
could of course easily operate a hypodermic
with his left hand even if the poison did
not kill him instantly it would most cer-
tainly act with such rapidity that the right
hand would be instantly rendered powerless
certainly it would be paralysed to such a
degree that it would be impossible to trans-
fer the hypodermic syringe from the left
hand to it much less inflict the other wounds
on the left hand and even more elemen-
tary how is it we have not recovered the
syringe or other injection instrument the
assumed suicide could not have had the
strength to have thrown it far or to have
risen and concealed it yet we have found
no sign of it in the darkened cul de sac

i	had to confess that our theory of suicide
did not sound so probable after all merri-
vale continued-

there is another very elementary point
which everybody seems to have missed al-
though bratz was the last victim to be dis-
covered examination of the bodies clearly


wonder stories

demonstrates that he was the first to die
there is little doubt that he was killed about

	p m last night while johnson was not
killed until about  oclock in the morning
it is therefore evident that not only did he
not take his own life but that he could not
possibly have killed johnson nor silenced
olsen

ah then johnson killed him and then
took his own life i suggested

and i suppose rose from the dead and
bumped off olsen at  am comment-
ed merrivale satirically hardly admissi-
ble of course as olsen died last of the
three hes technically the most likely to
have killed the others and then slipped his
own cable but there are several factors
against that theory first theres that look
of horror then olsen was a big burly mus-
cle-bound individual who would have found
it a physical impossibility to put that punc-
ture in the back of his own neck then
again theres no sign of the weapon no
i believe all three were murdered and there-
fore the murderer is still at large

um not a very pleasing prospect mar-
shal still one thing puzzles me olsen
was leaning against the jamb of the door
his assailant was evidently directly in front
of him from the look of horror in his eyes
yet he had just as evidently been attacked
from behind although there is very little
space between his head and the wall

merrivale was about to reply when
dr fouchard strolled in with his
usual insolent suaveness he commenced
right away to air his views much to merri-
vales apparent amusement and i must con-
fess my own annoyance

 ave you obsairved monsieur de police
zat juist by ze place where olsen died ze
wood of ze jamb is damage as though a
blunt instrument ad been forced against
it

he was obviously excited and gesticulat-
ed wildly throwing his arms about as he
did so i subconsciously noted that there
was a difference about his hands but could
not think what it was we examined the
jamb and sure enough to the left of the
spot where olsens head had been the wood

was splintered as though someone had
made a vicious jab with a ragged edged
jack-knife fouchard smiled in triumph
he turned to me and wiggled his middle
finger

and you monsieur le majeur ave you
noticed the ragged tears in herr bratzs
smoking jacket

i quickly seized his gesticulating hand and
held it firm no we have not but we have
observed the startling fact that you no
longer wear that massive egyptian ring
fouchard tried to withdraw his hand but
i held him firm his face blanched sure-
ly he stammered you do not tink i ave
commit ze murdairs for what motive i
ask

look here spat out merrivale what
the blazes has the disappearance of your ring
got to do with the murders major burnett
never mentioned murder still it seems to
have turned you a bit queer

yes no he knows ze ring was not or-
dinaire it ave ze subtle egyptian poison
so zat ze great pharaoh may himself release
from ze bondage of life  carry it and
tink i may sometime grow tired of life too
yterday i lose the ring i search i can-
not find him and you suspect me it is
terrible terrible

um gets nuttier anyway whether your
story is right or wrong docteur youre un-
der arrest right now if we can find the
ring well analyse its contents if any and
compare the poisons if they are identical
then you can only be innocent by a devilish
long coincidence

despite fouchards gesticulations and
protests merrivale had him locked up in
his cabin pending further inquiries per-
sonally i was quite convinced of his guilt
merrivale had an open mind if the doc-
teur had mislaid the ring it was possible
a third party had found it and committed
the murders with its aid on the other
hand-well-i was developing a headache
over the whole affair

we commenced a thorough search of the
passage in which bratz lay we verified
the fact that there were several ragged tears
in bratzs attire we also found several
scratches and jagged holes in the flooring
the murders on the moon ship



about the body but i for one did not over-
look the possibility of fouchard having
made these marks and also the mark by
olsens head to throw a red herring in our
path of investigation as we were about
to conclude our investigation i noted
something glistening in a corner of the orna-
mental skirting i picked up the object
it was fouchards ring the marshal and
myself made our way to my cabin to talk
things over here we encountered gallo-
way who had been sleeping for the last
hour or so and captain brant we ac-
quainted them with the latest developments

well was the captains verdict it
looks to me as though you have the right
man fouchard did the murders and at-
tempted to fasten them on bratz by leav-
ing his ring in the pianists hand so that it
would look like suicide but the ring slip-
ped from the pianists lifeless fingers and
being round rolled along for a considerable
distance before lodging in the skirting that
upset the docteurs plans and he evidently
searched the spot for the ring without suc-
cess while you were examining the radio
room he then conceived the plan of mak-
ing the ragged tears in his jacket and when
he got you safely out of the radio room
he duplicated the performance there on the
door jamb to throw you off the scent

very likely but perhaps not captain
if that were so why should fouchard be
the only one to contest the general idea
of suicide on the part of the pianist in the
first place surely it was in his interest
to foster the idea anyway if professor
galloway will assist me well make a thor-
ough examination of the ring and its con-
tents

chapter iv
muddied trails

we were advancing down the corridor
to galloways cabin when we heard
the most terrible row going on below we
hastened down the companion way fearing
the worst to find mrs mcnamara engaged
in a fierce altercation with minott

when we finally could arrest the flow of

billingsgate from the fair stewardesss lips
we learned that tabloid foods and vitamin
concentrates had been disappearing myster-
iously minott had called mrs mcnamara
to account for the discrepancy in her stock
of these goods and this was the result

we all laughed heartily this bit of comic
relief was welcome enough after the tension
of the last twenty-four hours the incident
sufficed however to delay the examination
of the ring and merrivale must have mo-
mentarily forgotten about it for on ascend-
ing he announced his intention of inter-
viewing the hilliards with a view to ascer-
taining the connection between the incrim-
inating letter and the affair there was
also the undoubted affection of the lady for
bratz to consider

when we entered we saw that mrs hil-
liard had composed herself somewhat the
boy was sleeping peacefully in his cot
while hilliard was resting on the arm of
his wifes chair as we entered the woman
rose and came towards us saying i hope
you will excuse me gentlemen but you
know my brothers death has come as a
fearful shock

johnson your brother i cried astound-
ed

she shook her head no the man you
knew as herr bratz was my brother he
was no more german than you major but
at an early age he realised that talent alone
would not get him far with an english audi-
ence who always dote on foreigners he
studied for a time in germany became
herr bratz and was lauded to the skies
by the public as plain jack wilson from
rochdale he would never have had a look
in in the west end so thoroughly did he
practise the deception that he learned ger-
man like a native and seldom spoke any-
thing else we all kept his secret he was
good kind and generous though he was
a bit wild and mrs hilliard fell to sob-
bing again

well that clears up one mystery said
merrivale now we do not want to hurt
you in your sorrow mrs hilliard but there
is certain information of vital importance
which you alone can give us do you re-


wonder stories

member writing a note to johnson shortly
before he died

why yes she said frankly enough i
sent him an invitation to come along and
see us jackie ran along with it and popped
it through the door you see frank her
husband and i once met him on a con-
ducted tour in holland and we did not
recognise him at first he had changed so
so as soon as it came to us who the little
man in the check suit was i sent him an
invitation to come along for a game of
cards with us

that was all

why yes

now i do not want to pain or offend
you mrs hilliard but er-that was noth-
ing in that note which a married woman-
er-no impropriety

mrs hilliard flushed slightly but looked
very puzzled i do not understand she
said slowly

well nothing that you would not like
your husband to know

frank hilliard jumped up angrily but
merrivale waved him aside

no of course not protested mrs hil-
liard indignantly

hank you now do you mind writ-
x ing your usual signature on this
piece of paper

the lady complied taking the pasted
note from his pocket merrivale compared
the writing on it with the signature there
was not the slightest doubt that the two
were written by the same hand 

then you admit you wrote this note

yes but- her face went white

theres something missing i-

her husband picked up the note what
is the meaning of this he demanded mad-
ly is this your innocent note ive no
idea what it means but evidently you have
been carrying on with johnson and thought
i had discovered you-

but frank i can explain its really
quite innocent i swear the missing words
and letters oh how can i prove it

the note is in pencil i observe put in
merrivale calmly perhaps you used a
writing pad

yes i did ill get it

merrivale took the pad and taking off
the top leaf he held it up to the light the
indentations of the pencil were clearly
seen but the fact that other notes had been
written on the same pad before made exact
decipheration difficult at length however
he turned with a smile

mrs hilliard we all owe you a most
humble apology for our most unfounded
suspicions im only too glad to say that
what i have discovered proves your story
and innocence to the full the original
note you wrote was as follows was it not
dear mr johnson not dearest
henry as we had thought

you must really come along andlet
us see you my husband knows all
sorts of wew card games quite difierent
from those which so intrigued you at
the arcade at rotterdam as you will
remember

 just love to see you two sneering at
one another when you make a false
move ts a killing sight

do come and renew an old acquain-
tanceship yours sincerely

beatrice hilliard
and marshal may i trouble you for a
reconstruction of the letter as you thought
it would read put in mrs hilliard

merrivale was embarrassed well real-
ly major burnett looked after that depart-
ment

it was my turn to flush um i stam-
mered it was something like this

dearest henry

you must let nie see you my husband
knows all it is the end of our game
 the rent he art of a woman intrigued
by a cad a rotter weans nothing to
you remember i just love you sneer
at me or make a false move and ll
kill you on sight

i paused and coughed we couldnt
quite make out the sin bit at the bottom
but of course now we know it was part of
yours sincerely

and you really thought that of me ma-
jor burnett

well im really awfully sorry you
know we that is- i commenced apol-
the murders on the moon ship



ogetically but i never finished the sentence
for i received the finest slap on the face it
has ever been my pleasure to accept and
mrs hilliard swept indignantly from the
room

on watch

hilliard rated us soundly too for a
bunch of damned idiots and altogether
my interest in mystery elucidation fell with
a wallop merrivale seems rather pleased
no doubt because this little drama repre-
sented the destruction of the final link in the
chain of evidence we had so magnanimously
presented to him on his arrival no doubt
now that he had so effectually blown down
our house of cards he felt he could start
afresh

as sleeping time was drawing near it
was decided to lock up the passengers in
their cabins for their own safety the offi-
cers together with merrivale and myself
electing to form a guard as merrivale was
really the only man who could not possibly
be guilty of the murders he was given the
keys of the cabin and as everybody sus-
pected everybody else despite the fact that
we had fouchard locked up the guard on
each occasion was double

first minott and merrivale were to keep
watch then sheppard and captain brant
and in the final watch mcfee and myself
it was the most uncomfortable guard i ever
was on with three corpses in the refriger-
ator and a homicidal maniac at large or at
the best only held from us by a flimsy par-
tition the patrolling of the eerie corridor
was a sinister business add to the fact
that one did not know whether ones mate
on guard was the guilty party or not and
the horror of the whole business may read-
ily be imagined of course i was sure dr
fouchard was the man but then the captain
with a total lack-of reason was equally em-
phatic that the van stokes woman had some-
thing to do with it

when sheppard awakened me to take my
turn with mcfee i had strangely enough
been dreaming of my old home in somerset
oblivious to the horrors of the preceding
hours hyt i woke curiously alert for all

that i noted at once that the vanes of the
door ventilator of fouchards prison cabin
had been opened to their full extent a matter
of perhaps two inches each i questioned
sheppard but he simply laughed if fouch-
ard was trying to escape that way he wasnt
likely to achieve much success besides
where could he escape to on a moon flyer

anyway what were ventilators for but
to let air in he had no doubt opened the
contrivance himself to secure more air cir-
culation during the night mcfee was still
sleepy like most scots he was pretty calm
in an emergency he certainly didnt seem
to fear the murderer very much for after
patrolling the corridor with me once or
twice yawning the while he sat down on
a box in a shaded corner nodding in a som-
nolescent way which provoked my soldierly
ire finding it useless to get the engineer
to keep intelligent guard i paced the corri-
dor myself reviewing the situation as i did
so

come to think of it it was damned fun-
ny that a man should be so negligent
of his own personal safety as to go to sleep
in this fashion i had overlooked the fact
that mcfee had been working harder than
any of us all the voyage out and was sub-
jected to high temperatures all the time but
my mind was hardly functioning normally
yet mcfees behavior told me only one
thing at that moment-that he hadnoth-
ing to fear from the menace because of
course he was the murderer i stirred him
gently he was fast asleep i hurriedly
searched his pockets there was nothing
to connect him with the crimes some chunks
of tobacco a few valve tips and washers
a wallet with a photo of a girl in kilts not
a shred of evidence

i paced the corridor again this thing
was getting me i was perspiring i felt an
overpowering sense of horror i could swear
i smelt an earthly graveyard odor pervad-
ing the whole corridor i could stand it no
longer i must have a stimulant i made
my way to my cabin confound it i had
pulled the door to and that snap lock
had shut merrivale had the keys too i
continued the pacing reproaching myself


wonder stories

for my weakness what conduct was this
for a soldier i squared my shoulders but
it was all of no avail this wasnt a bat-
tlefield and my nerves that had stood a
thousand barrages had gone to pieces under
the strain i must have a drink i must i
must merrivale was sleeping it wouldnt
take an instant to get the keys from him
i made my way to his bunk his door was
open securing the keys was the work of
a moment and in another minute i was in
my own cabin gulping down neat brandy

with a sudden revulsion of feeling i
realised what a coward i was i made my
way into the corridor again anyway id
better wake up mcfee before i got a re-
turn of the blues i hastened down to the
engineer the lazy blighter was still asleep
gone to the world his head fallen forward
on his chest i shook him but he never
stirred i gave him a vicious kick and an-
other and another i raised his head but
it fell back on his chest again a horrible
fear assailed my mind i dragged the scot
into an erect position and shook him fran-
tically then in a frenzy i pulled him into
the better lighted part of the passage and
looked into his face

the murderer had struck again mcfee
was dead and all round his throat were
vivid purple marks in symmetrical pattern
to show that the life had been choked out of
the stalwart scot

i cried aloud in terror and the others
came running into the corridor and then
well its hard for a dso to fiave to con-
fess it but i must hpve fainted gone clean
over

chapter v
i am accused

when i came to i was in my own
cabin and merrivale and galloway
were looking at me with a queer sternness
i made to rise when merrivale suddenly
covered me with his automatic

oh no you dont my gallant major
weve got you at last you may as well
make a clean breast of it we cant figure
out your motive unless the brazilian fever

has warped your mind but weve got enough
circumstantial evidence to convict you i
figure it out this way you stole fouchard
ring you were the only person aboard who
seemed to know it contained poison killed
bratz why i dont know polished off olsen
when we was about to call assistance from
the station after doing a bit of curiously
amateurish work on johnson just to fill
in the time i suppose

then with devilish ingenuity you pro-
duced the mutilated note to johnson to in-
criminate the hilliards when fouchard
began to doubt your red herrings you ac-
cused him and showed his ring was miss-
ing then it was you my dear major who
managed to find the ring again curious
coincidence isnt it but fouchard knew
too much for you you hastily evolved a
new plan i may as well tell you now i
never suspected fouchard i locked him up
for his own safety but equally i made the
tragic mistake of never suspecting you

i let you retain the ring pending exam-
ination what a fool i was in the night
you strangled your fellow-guardsman stole
my keys unlocked the prisoners cabin and
killed fouchard with his own ring

what i cried fouchard dead too

what the hades do you expect dead
as a doornail but the time for dissembling
is over we have ample minor proofs for
instance youre the only person aboard with
the strength to strangle noiselessly a man of
mcfees build galloway has told me all
about your south american exploit with
the puma when you have him by throttling
the brute with your naked hands now
weve got the rough outline id like you
to fill in the details

for a long time i sat speechless bowed
down with this fresh horror fouchard
dead too where was it all going to end
of merrivales idiotic accusations i didnt
think very much we had pretty nearly all
been suspected in turn still what a fool
id been over those keys eventually i
told the truth about the whole affair mer-
rivale smiled incredulously but i could see
that galloway half believed in me

anyway marshal its up to you to ex-
amine the ring three people are supposed
the murders on the moon ship



to have met their death through its agency
so there cannot be much poison left in it
now

galloway took the ring and carefully
pressed the stones catching the dripping
fluid in a watch-glass it was at once ob-
vious from the quantity collected that the
hollow ring must have been full of the
liquor

merrivale frowned proves nothing the
poisoner evidently has a reservoir from
which he refills

hardly applicable to me considering
i stole the ring marshal i retorted but
examine the mechanism of the ring when
the green stone is pressed inwards two
fangs protrude in every wound i have
examined on the bodies there is but one
puncture not two again the fangs pro-
trude on the inside of the ring not on the
outside the idea being that the would-be
suicide pressed the stone while wearing
the ring it would therefore seem to be
impossible to murder a person with the
ring excepting by first placing the ring on
their fingers and then pressing the green
stone it is certainly obviously impossible
to inflict wounds on the back of the hand
or the neck such as we found on bratz and
olsen with this ring again you accuse
me of strangling mcfee but ne human fin-
gers ever made that symmetrical design on
the engineers neck it is as though a broad
hand of watered silk had been compressed
with titanic strength round the scots neck
leaving a record of the pattern on his neck

while i had been speaking merrivale
had been pacing up and down rest-
ively he could see he was wrong butdid
not want to admit it meanwhile the pro-
fessor was busily engaged in testing the
poison in the watch glass at length he
turned to us im afraid i cannot tell you
very much about this it is certainly a rare
reptilian venom and in some respects may
be said to resemble the poison found in the
bodies but the lack of suitable reagents on
boord forces me to confess that any accur-
ate determination or comparison is impossi-
ble

i turned to merrivale come marshal i

think you must admit you are wronging
me but handcuff me if you like i would
like to see fouchard

wel major somebody must be guilty
you know and it certainly looked black
against you after that key business by the
way why did you try to break down the
shutters of fouchards door when you had
the key

um suppose thats a trip question but
as i dont happen to be guilty it doesnt
act what do you mean

well all around the ventilator there
are small irregular holes as though some-
one had been trying to force open the vanes
with a screwdriver or similar instrument
you know something like the marks we
found over olsens head and on the floor
by bratzs body

well i know nothing about that but i
did notice the ventilator was open when i
went on guard and it was shut last night
and it was tight when  concluded
guard agreed the marshal then the
murder must have happened while the cap-
tain and sheppard were on guard

captain brant and sheppard were ques-
tioned closely and when the captain ad-
mitted that he had left the corridor on sev-
eral occasions to attend to other duties i
could see that merrivale had immediately
mentally pounced on sheppard as the guil-
ty one but a mild form of third degree in-
quisition failed jo produce any result and
in the end we all tailed into fouchards
shrine that was yesterday a prison and the
day before a cabin to see if we could fur-
ther elucidate the mystery

fouchard was sitting bolt upright in a
chair in front of a small sheridan table he
was facing the door in his left hand he
held a pocket electric battery pointing
straight at the ventilator his lifeless thumb
had fallen from the press-button so the
light was no longer on but had it been the
zone of the ventilator would have been com-
pletely illuminated his right hand sprawl-
ed with the index finger extended over
the table on his face was a look of hor-
ror but there was something more-there
was a look of recognition

without doubt fouchard had seen the


wonder stories

murderer and what was more he had recog-
nised him before he died i had been
standing a little to the left of the others
when i noted a peculiar wavy line on the
highly polished table by the docteurs left
hand i drew merrivales attention to it
and standing behind fouchard we saw that
the dull line travelled obliquely from left
to right in a series of waves and terminated
at the right hand it could only be seen
from certain angles and-my god ma-
jor its a word ejaculated merrivale
fouchard has wet his finger and written
a message on the highly polished table top
knowing it would dry dull see-
c-o-r-n-e-i-l-and then the
poison had done its work i suppose

um took a long time compared with
olsens case then i could not help saying

not murdered

uvtes thats puzzling but its evidently
x a message a name by jove one of
the ruttledges is called cornelia too i
have it how blind ive been those young
demons would do anything another loeb
and leopold type of crime quite obvious
these two have had every thrill in the world
theyve made the world hum with their mad
caprices since they wore pinafores thats
it sheer ennui the motive jaded with the
ordinary vices and jokes theyve planned
this super practical joke on the world all
these deaths on a space-ship what more
intriguing what more thrilling captain
arrest the pair of them at once

one minute marshal you know corneil
isnt the exact way to go about spelling
cornelia you know and anyway i dont
quite see how one of the young ladies could
get through the ventilator for you know
you held the keys and again you havent
solved the problem of how fouchard lasted
out long enough to write that word after
being poisoned

merrivale glared angrily um you
cant expect a frenchman even if he is a
doctor of philosophy to spell a damned
outlandish name like that correctly as for
the keys well if you could steal them so
could she

you forget she was locked in her own
cabin by your own good self i said test-
ily

merrivale flew in a rage ive a jolly
good mind to arrest you for obstruction
major burnett what are these women to
you by jove i begin to see light you
are working wonderfully well you are im
by no means convinced of your innocence
yet despite the evidence of the ring you
are right fouchard could not have written
that word after being poisoned no you
did after you had killed him so that you
would throw the blame on the girl but
you are bound to have left finger prints on
this table and merrivale began with
febrile haste to examine the table

i was not so much angry as amused this
time despite the seriousness of the situa-
tion there was something funny about the
pendulum attitude of the investigator pro-
fessor galloway was really wild however
about this fresh accusation he had just
finished conducting an examination of the
corpse and he tackled merrivale with all the
vitriolic eloquence in his makeup in my de-
fence when he had concluded he observed
calmly and it may interest you to know
most perceptive of marshals that fouchard
did not die of poison

not die of poison repeated the be-
wildered merrivale

no there is no trace of a puncture on
the body nor of poison in the blood
then what the blazes did he die of
heart failure said galloway tartly
then he-he-wasnt murdered after
all

directly no indirectly yes he un-
doubtedly saw something to horrify him
he undoubtedly recognised somebody and
saw clearly that they had come to menace
him he then evidently scrawled or was
scrawling the warning message when his
heart succumbed to the shock

for a moment merrivale hesitated and
then-well that bears out my first
theory well interview these young dev-
ils
the murders on the moon ship



chapter vi
the stowaway

the ruttledge twins received us graci-
ously look here began merrivale
brusquely theres been a couple of fresh
murders through the night despite the
guard

oh i say put in beatrice this voy-
age is getting too like the ten little nigger
boys for my peace of mind

yes well we think that is as he caught
my frown  think you young ladies know
a good deal about this it may interest
you to know that the latest victim left a
message in which one of your names ap-
pears

indeed mr detective put in cornelia
how positively thrilling	

yeah itll be more thrilling still when
we land and the judge puts on his black
cap

dont be so damned silly put in
beatrice as she lit a cheroot you surely
dont think we have got anything to do
with this nasty sticky business do you

of course we dont reallyi put in
but unfortunately fouchard the latest vic-
tim scrawled a few letters which read
very similar to your sisters name and we
were wondering if you could throw any
light on the mystery i am afraid the
marshals enthusiasm has evaporated his
sense of chivalry i can assure you the
only person the admirable merrivale
hasnt suspected yet is himself and our
inquiries are purely routine

i see

do you by any chance happen to know
dr fouchard well i mean-theres no
hint of romance they both snorted and
commenced to speak at once from the
babble i gathered they had never seen
the doctor before this journey and thought
him perfectly horrid no he had never
sought to pay either of them attentions in
fact on the few occasions they had met
he had been rather rude

this information rather upset a new
theory i had been formulating-that
fouchard had died from a perfectly na-

tural heart attack and feeling life slip-
ping he had scrawled subconsciously the
name cornelia because he admired the
girl

how long the inquisition would have
proceeded i dont know merrivale was get-
ting ready to fire a few more shots when
a terrific din was heard in the direction of
the galley we all made our way in that
direction and were astounded to find mrs
macnamara belaboring a gigantic african
negro who seemed to have sprung from
nowhere with a quart bottle

merrivale pulled out his automatic but
the negro stood quietly enough and gave
no sign of resistance

mrs macnamara explained volubly that
her stores of tabloid foods had been con-
tinuing to diminish with astonishing rapid-
ity finally like the bold woman she was
she had laid in wait armed with the quart
bottle to see which of the staff was pilfer-
ing and had been nearly knocked backwards
to see the huge son of ham emerge from the
trap door leading to the hold

nothing daunted however she had at-
tacked him right manfully with the result
that we overheard the row the africans
story was that he had been touring england
with a travelling circus which had gone
bust as he picturesquely termed it he
had tramped about the country for some
time and eventually had lit upon the space
ship watching his opportunity he had
crawled aboard and concealed himself
stealing out now and then to purloin the
stores from mrs mcnamaras larder

merrivale heard him out then and what
is your name

cornelius twinkle sah

mr cornelius twinkle in another couple
of minutes was safely down the hold again
but this time with massive leg irons and
manacles about his herculean form

here then was the murder we all
felt relieved most of all merrivale
who was most amiable and apologetic of
course i had the stowaway idea back of my
mind all the time but i had to badger you
ladies and gentlemen in order to find out
as much as i could thats how we investi-


wonder stories

gators work you know anyway we dont
need to fear any more

i had to confess i was puzzled as to mo-
tive but merrivale airily assured me that
he had it all cut and dried the negro evi-
dently knew and hated dr fouchard but
he had made a mistake on several occasions
and killed the wrong men to me this
seemed a bit thin particularly in mcfees
case but merrivale was sure the negro
had strangled mcfee as he was the only
person aboard excepting myself who had
sufficient muscular development

however that might be there were no
more murders during the next twenty-four
hours although i noted everyone paid great
attention to the locking of the doors and
the thorough closing and securing of the
ventilators at sleeping time

i couldnt sleep for one thing mer-
rivale had sniffed so avidly at every red
herring which crossed his path that the
mere fact that we had discovered a stow-
away named cornelius did not seem to me
at all convincing to my mind the crimes
were the acts of a maniac and the big nig-
ger seemed a perfectly sane and rational
person in fact i took a decided liking to
him from the first time i saw him an-
other thing if he was such a terrible be-
ing why had he refrained from attacking
mrs mcnamara the more i thought
aboutit the more clearly i recognised that
the marshal like most officials was intent
on getting a scapegoat first and then prov-
ing that he did the crime the advent of
the big ethiopian was no doubt like manna
from heaven to the bewildered investigator
who had seen clue after clue crumble to
nothing i verily believe he had reached
a point of such mental instability that he
would have accused johnsons parrot had it
been alive um funny job that parrots
dying should herald all these murders of
course if people had just died it might have
been a case of parrot-fever spreading
through the ship but there were stabbings
poisonings and a strangulation

very ill-rested i arose at the appointed
waking time to join the others who were
overjoyed to find a full roll-call we had
breakfast in the dining room and at this

meal we managed almost to capture a spirit
of light heartedness merrivale was in fine
vein and was just recounting a thrilling
episode in his career when minott dashed
in-

say folks the chunk of ebonys done
himself in overnight

mrs van stokes fainted immediately and
captain brant rebuked the purser for his
tactlessness merrivale galloway and my-
self accompanied minott to the hold yes
sure enough the big nigger was a mass of
congealed blood across his chest and in
his right hand he clenched a small but
ugly looking knife merrivale was over-
joyed this put the crown on his work
proved the negros guilt galloway on ex-
amination thought there was a spark of
life in the huge carcass yet so we began to
unshackle the negro as we did so i noted
that there was a nasty gash almost as high
as the collar bone

say merrivale how do you account for
this when the half hundredweight hand-
irons only allow the nigger to raise his hand
a little above his waist and they are un-
broken yet he no doubt had the knife
concealed about his waist but how did he
make that wound also with a knife like
that about him why didnt he attack the
stewardess if hes the guilty party

a big black crow

there was no time to spend in argu-
ment however if we were to fan the
glow of life into a flame again wc bathed
his bloody torso with warm water and
then wc discovered that there were not just
one or two wounds but that his whole
chest was a mass of ragged tears not clean
cuts as one would imagine a knife to make
but jagged affairs something like the wound
in johnsons neck

the poor negro looked just like well
like an apple that a birds been pecking at
we bound him up roughly and took him
upstairs meeting the ruttledges on the way
the sisters lost all their attitude of cynic-
ism at the pitiable sight and insisted on
cornelius being taken to their cabin so that
they could nurse him powerful restora-
the murders on the moon ship



tives were poured down bis throat the lisle
rays were applied and every possible means
we had aboard used to revive the negro but
though the man still lived he remained un-
conscious

leaving him in good hands i took my
flash-lantern in one hand and my automa-
tic in the other and stole back into the
shadowy hold i examined the stool on
which the negro had sat and the wall be-
hind it the former revealed nothing but
the wooden partition of a radius of per-
haps a foot around where the nigger had
sat was one mass of irregular indentations
as though someone had been playing a game
of darts with outsize weapons something
like bad grouping with a machine gun but
the marks registered were ragged not at
all clear cut the thought of a murderer
using a kind of machine gun with some
elementary form of bullet crossed my mind
but i dismissed the idea as too fantastic
one thing was clear whatever had made the
marks on the wall had made the wounds
in the negros chest and very obviously he
had drawn his knife not to slay but to de-
fend himself

i prayed that he might soon recover con-
sciousness so that we could learn the na-
ture of the menace for it was evident the
murderer was still at large i made my way
back to the lounge

there i found mrs hilliard almost be-
side herself with her husband and gallo-
way not very much better jackie had dis-
appeared they had searched every cabin
without result not a trace of the youngster
could be found excepting his handkerchief
which was recovered by minott about the
spot where bratz was murdered

well there was nothing for it but fur-
ther organised search armed with auto-
matics we split up into two groups and
commenced to search throughout the whole
ship minott merrivale the professor and
myself undertook to search the fore-part
of the vessel as we moved forward mer-
rivale whispered damned funny thing
minott always seems on the scene of these
affairs he found olsen and the nigger
now hes found the handkerchief

poor merrivale he would be suspecting
himself next

 we searched here there and everywhere
but we found no trace at length there
only remained the little room in the nose
of the ship where the professors fossils
were stored in the happier earlier days
of the trip galloway had often taken the
boy along here to show him the funny
beasties and it struck me that possibly the
child had felt a longing to visit the museum
once more and had unobserved slipped
along sure enough as we emerged from
the shadowy bottle neck passage leading
to the room young jackie emerged from the
door holding his finger to his lips he had
heard us coming and evidently did not
want us to disturb something or other when
we got near enough he said shush youll
wake the funny animal

galloway started the funny animal
yes fessor one of your funny stone
animals is breathing i can see its sides go-
ing wiggly woggly and it has such a funny
long tail and a head like a big black crow
a big black crow somewhere at the
back of my obtuse mentality a subconscious
train of thought was trying to burst through
i found myself repeating an old french
lesson of forty years ago what was it
bird-oiseau
eagle-aigle
buzzard-bus e

crow-c  r n e i l l e 

so that was what fouchard meant by his
message he was warning us against this
thing with a head like a big black crow

thrusting the boy into the passage we
entered the room with -automatics drawn
a strong earthy musk-laden smell pervaded
the chamber at first we could see nothing
so gloomy was the place and then we saw
iu

a large chunk of stone of the meso-
zoic period retained because of its
covering of fossilised vegetation had been
split in twain as though pried open and
there on the top of the pieces reposed the
strangest living thing i have ever seen as
the boy had said it had a head like a big
black crow but its beak was the beak of a


wonder stories

flying lizard a pterodactyl its body was
fish-like yet snake-like but it had the pecu-
liarity that it was practically two-dimension-
al although nine inches or more in depth
it was not more than a quarter of an inch
to half an inch in thickness the body
terminated in a long snaky tail while a
couple of protuberances like fins folded
close to the body that the animal lived
we could not doubt from the slight respir-
atory movements

my god cried galloway the meso-
zoic missing link the sound of his voice
awoke the creature it stared at us an in-
stant with its malevolent cobra-like eyes
and then without warning it spread its
fin-like wings and soared with great veloc-
ity over our heads merrivales automatic
spat out and the creature fell at minotts
feet as it did so it curled its long tail
round the pursers leg and buried the sharp
spine into the fleshy part of his calf with
a little cry minott dropped to the ground
we riddled the beast with shells but poor
minott had gone to join the great majority
for the poison had been exuded from its
sac through the spine of the creatures tail
just as in the case of bratz and olsen

as the creature writhed in its last agony
the powerful beak struck the floor again
and again making the same kind of splin-
tered marks we had observed so often be-
fore

we covered poor minotts face and took
the boy to his harassed parents then we
all gathered together in the lounge and of-
fered up a prayer of thanksgiving for our
deliverance from the menace

there isnt very much more to tell when
galloway who was fearfully shaken by the
whole business had recovered a bit we dis-
cussed the whole affair

you see said the professor the study
of evolution is even yet but in its infancy
for one thing our fossil record is very in-
complete the oldest igneous rocks na-
turally yield nothing from their fiery ori-
gin many of the earlier sedimentary rocks
too have been so denuded or metamor-
phosed by the action of heat and pressure
that they preserve no fossil records of the

creatures which roamed the earth in by-
gone days

all my life i have found the study of the
evolution from one type to another intrigu-
ing and the fact that when a higher type
evolves from a lower the latter does not
entirely disappear is most interesting such
survivals are sometimes called sports the
idea being that they are freaks of nature
but when we remember that in the mesozoic
period the reptiles were predominant and
these cold-blooded beings were of giant size
herbivores carnivores flying and marine
forms alike while in the following caeno-
zoic period the warm-blooded mammals at-
tained ascendancy and the reptile now only
survives in the insignificant crocodile snake
or lizard it can be seen that these sports
represent rather the gradual discarding of
the former types they are rather natures
throwouts

an explanation

ii a gain while there are examples of

jtjlsudden change and acquisition of new
parts to enable the individual to conform to
altered environment such as the develop-
ment of bird-like forms from the reptiles of
the mesozoic period there is not as darwin
imagined a clear-cut line of demarcation be-
tween species and attributes of earlier spe-
cies often linger after they have lost their
usefulness

for instance in the eocene period mon-
keys with arboreal limbs have yet teeth dif-
ficult to distinguish from the eocene horses
carnivores with hoofs exist and herbivores
with sloth-like claws

it is these seeming paradoxes which
make the subject of evolution so interesting
to me and it is in the study of the missing
links of the chain that major burnett and
myself have spent the last two years in
south america with what tragic success you
know the specimen which has caused all
the trouble is undoubtedly a link between
the birds and reptiles of the mesozoic per-
iod the scorpion-like spine of the tail
must be looked upon as a further sport of
nature probably surviving from a still
older form although we must admit that
the murders on the moon ship



as we reconstruct the dinosaurs from bony
skeletons we hardly know whether they
were equipped with paralysing or lethal
venom or not although the provision of
such would be quite logical

but how did the damn thing come to
life after hundreds of centuries put in
merrivale

ah that is where i owe johnson poor
chap an apology you remember he spoke
of a case of reptilian suspended animation

i had heard the tale before and i am afraid
i lost my temper for i always looked upon
the yarn as of the aesop vintage in some
sedimentary rock formations at butte a
foreman and three miners swore affidavits
mind this is a hundred years ago that
they they had chipped a toad which they
first took to be a fossil from the solid rock
they then realised the thing was hibernat-
ing but it was of a different species from
any other they had ever seen 

so they sent it on to the bronx new
york zoological park where the director re-
vived the toad and it ran about for a short
time all alive and kicking the director com-
ing to the conclusion that it was an authentic
case of suspended animation the reptile hav-
ing crept into lhe soft mud thousands of
years before with the passage of time and
pressure the mud had formed stone and en-
cased the toad

ive seen the preserved carcass myself 
but i never thought the story possible but
here we have had most terrible proof of the
authenticity of suspended reptilian anima-
tion what awoke the creature in this case

i know not probably some unknown ray
emanating from the operation of the atomic
motors the splitting of the stone is easily
explained as it is in easily divisible lamin-
ated strata and we have had ample demon-
strations of the reptiles strength

yes but i dont understand why it should
adopt different methods of killing said
merrivale

there is nothing inconsistent in that
many creatures are armed with several types
of natural weapons a scorpion for in-
stance uses his poison spine tail to attack
some creatures and his strong claws to
attack others what i think actually took

place was this-the creature escaped from
its prison of stone and flew through the
fore-part of the ship into the living quar-
ters working late on his composition
bratz heard the thing fluttering in the cor-
ridor went to investigate and was struck
on the hands as he was trying to ward off
the creatures beak attacks by the venomous
tail spine the tears in bratzs jacket were
of course made by the beak

tttn the case of johnson who always

xslept with his door ajar it looks as
though the creature maliciously attacked
him in his sleep and as the first blow sev-
ered an artery he merely woke momentar-
ily to give one cry in olsens case it had
- taken refuge in the radio room and as
olsen turned on the light he saw it that
accounted for the look of horror it must
have been near him too for while the mark
on the jamb of the door was made by the
beak it curled its tail around his neck and
pierced the poor devils neck with its poison-
spine

in dr fouchards case it was different
the doctor was sitting at the table undoubt-
edly disconsolately reviewing our unfair
accusations of him when he heard the crea-
ture no doubt startled by something trying
to edge the vanes of the ventilator open
you remember that its body was practically
two-dimensional if it could get its head
through then the rest would be easy

fouchard pressed the button of his
torch and saw the creatures crow-like head
being forced through the aperture an in-
telligent man he immediately connected
the beasts appearance for he could read-
ily see it was no ordinary crow with the
murders and fearing his hour had come
he attempted to write the word corneille
crow on the table to warn us then his
heart always weak gave out either the
animal was frightened by fouchards torch
or else it couldnt get its head through
but it must have lurked about the corridor
perhaps under the very box on which mc-
fee went to sleep

you remember burnett you complained
that the passage smelt earthy like a grave-

the sleeping war

ptlhere was a chinaman in town to-
-l day announced william buzzard
the recorder of deeds of monroe county
he slowly placed his feet on top of his
desk and started to blow smoke rings
through the dead air of
the closed office

the county treas-
urer laughed at him

what are you try-
ing to do bill kid
me think i never
took my collars to the
laundryman long
as i can remember
there has always been
a chink in town

this was not that
kind of a chinaman
slowly retorted buz-
zard talking out of one
corner of his mouth

thats news to me

is there more than one
kind of chink

you would think so
if you ever saw a real
one this one today
was only a yellow boy
but believe me han-
kins he had class he
drove here in a swell
car and he had on the
very latest in new
york haberdashery
and i ought to know
because i just had a
chance to read an arti-
cle called what the
well dressed man will
wear in  he
gave me this elegant
piece of tobacco i am
smoking

you will observe
from the smell that it
is no cheap five center

and then to show you that i know what i
am talking about when i say that he had
class he had me record a deed for him
which shows that he had just paid four hun-
dred thousand dollars for the four thousand

acres of land around resica

im dreaming wake me up murmur-
ed the county treasurer you dont mean
to tell me that the new york people have
finally unloaded that resica land

i do and i re-
s member when i could
have bought that land
for five dollars an
acre

all i have to say
remarked peter han-
kins is that they
must have put the deal
over when the chink
was asleep i thought
those yellow boys were
smart

they are smart
nodded buzzard
smart as the old boy
himself i have read
about them and seen
moving pictures about
them until i almost
feel that they are
smarter than the aver-
age white man i bet
that this chinaman had
some reason for want-
ing that land at resica
perhaps h e would
have been willing to
give more if the new
yorkers had held off a
while you will find
out some day he has
something up his sleeve
about that land he
knows something
about it that makes
him want to own it-
oil or something like
 that and i could
have bought that land
r for five an acre

a few days after the
deed for the resica land had been recorded
a well-dressed chinaman wandered casually
into the main offices of the highway depart-
ment in harrisburg pa there was a slight
difficulty in finding the correct official to



tt often happens that
some of the great advan-
tages that men expect to
gain by gathering together
in large cities turn out fin-
ally to be boomerangs
people collect into com-
munities of hundreds of
thousands and millions tq
take advantage of mutual
economic and social advan-
tages and give up their
own identity so that they
may have the strength of
the whole group they are
thus better protected
against disease and poverty
these of course are the as-
sumptions but when
trouble does come to a
large city it comes as a
great disaster epidemics
of diseases great fires out-
bursts of crime etc are all
prices that we must pay to
enjoy city life

think how easy it would
be to spread abroad in our
great cities a contagious
germ to decimate thou-
sands or how easy it
might be to poison our wa-
ter supply suppose that a
great evil force wished to
strike at our national life
and he started with the
large cities how might he

talk to but at last he was in conference with
a politician who was smoking as fine a cigar
as it had ever been his good fortune to light
with such a present in his mouth it was im-
possible to be anything but polite to the
donor so he asked in his best manner as he
gazed at the visiting card in his hand

what can i do for you mr wand foo
i trust that my request is a very simple
one began the chinaman opening a map
and spreading it out on the table condes-
cend to gaze upon this map of monroe coun-
ty here is a little place called marshall
falls from it a road runs through a thinly
populated country and finally it ends up in
pike county in what is called the deer coun-
try this road runs
through a four thousand
acre tract of land recent-
ly purchased by my asso-
ciates we regret the
existence of this road and
desire your honorable aid
in closing it

the politician looked
at the map closely

wheres your land
he demanded

around a place called
resica

hemmm there is a
good iron bridge there

exactly the exis-
tence of the bridge an-
noys us

well its there isnt
it asked the politician sharply he was
beginning to be slightly annoyed you
knew that the road was there arid you knew
the bridge was there when you bought the
land didnt you we cannot close roads
and tear down bridges just to please peo-
ple how do you suppose the hunters
would get up to the deer country

if you look at the road carefully you
will see that there is another road that
could be used that road could be im-
proved and i am sure that its immaterial
to the deer hunters as to the specific road
they use so long as they finally arrive at
the hunting ground

it cannot be done declared the high-

way official with an air of finality

a peculiar smile played over the
orientals face he slowly pulled a
red leather wallet from his inside coat pock-
et opening it he took out a pile of bills
one of which he handed to the politician

have you ever seen one of these he
asked

the pennsylvanian looked at it picked it
up looked at it again and handed it back

its a grand he murmured at last

it is at least i presume you call a
thousand dollars in your currency by that
name now watch me i am placing these
bills one at a time before your honored
eyes when you feel
that your department
could close that road and
permit us to enjoy the
privacy we desire please
indicate your willingness
to cooperate with us i
presume you are sure of
privacy it would be so
annoying to have visitors
-while i am placing the
bills in front of you

the highway official
hastily left his desk he
did not return till his of-
fice door was locked and
the window shades drawn
then and only then did
he seat himself and whis-
per you can start your
argument there was a slight trembling
to his voice

the oriental took the sheaf of bills in his
hand and with a gesture that was almost
grandiose placed one of them in front of the
politician there was a slight pause and
then another bill was placed on top of the
first and then a third bill followed silent-
ly they fell like autumn leaves only with a
iriore definite regularity as far as their
landing was concerned

the official simply looked at the bills
trying to realize that each was worth a
thousand dollars and that if he did not say
stop at the right time he might fail to
win one of them twenty-five- twenty-

nix- twenty-seven what was the china-
man aip to what did he want to close the
road for why thirty-nine- fifty-
three- was it the same wallet or had he
taken another one from another pocket
was that last one sixty-nine or seventy-
three hell he had lost count some-
thing snapped and he heard the chinaman
speaking to him

i am afraid that you are no longer in-
terested perhaps i had better take my mon-
ey and leave there are other pieces of
land that we can buy besides resica we
do not have to have resica for our pur-
poses

oh i am interested all right insisted
the politician just a little hot in here and
i lost count how many are there in that
pile

i am laying them down not counting
them whispered the yellow man gravely
still if you wish to i will lay down some
more no doubt the money will have to be
divided and you will have to keep a little
for yourself

if you only knew mr foofoo how hard
a thing like this was to put over you would
turn your pockets inside out

my name is wand foo and not foofoo
explained the chinaman now suppose
we ask your honored attention while i con-
tinue to place the pieces of paper you think
so much of on the pile in front of you
once again the gesture of placing the
bills one at a time began at last the
official held up his hand

that will do he sighed

and you will close the road

yes of course it will take a little
time i shall have to see some of the boys
and talk the matter over with them

the visitor arose and bowed courteously
i thank you for your attention i neg-
lected to say that when the road is closed
and all the details attended to i will see
that you have a sum equal to the small pit-
tance i have placed within your worthy
hands i might add that if you fail or try
in any way to evade the terms of our gen-
tlemans contract your lovely wife will be-
come your lovely widow

without a gate

james johnson was a hardened politi-
cian but his hands trembled as he gath-
ered up the paper money and jammed it in
a tight wad into his pocket

not trying to scare me are you he
sneered as he started toward the door

i never try to do anything murmured
mr wand foo as he sauntered towards that
door at least i never try to do any-
thing without succeeding i shall expect
the road closed mr johnson either closed
or the cash returned and i am sure you do
not want to return it

the official slammed the door on his vis-
itor and locked it back at his desk he
started to count the money one hundred
and twenty thousand and the ghink had
said that there would be as much more
when the road was closed how much
would he give the other boys and what
did the yellow fool want the road closed
for anyway two times a hundred and
twenty thousand made a quarter of a mil-
lion that was a lot of cash to pay for an
old road well he had better get to work
that was a mean thing to say about what
would happen if he failed he ought to
have slapped the chink in the mouth

but a quarter of a million was a lot of
money even if a part of it had to be split
off to other interested parties so james
johnson lost no time in starting the strictly
legal proceedings necessary for the aban-
donment of the road leading through the
resica property of course the affair
caused some comment but relatively few
persons were interested and johnson saw
to it that the local newspapers made no great
objections

there followed a number of busy months
at ilesica the road was not only closed
it was torn up several deep ravines were
filled with the debris which wras in turn
covered with several feet of rich earth and
planted with laurel and rhododendron from
the stroudsburg nursery the road bed
was also planted

soon there was but little proof that a
hard-surfaced road had ever bisected the
resica tract then something more unu-


wonder stories

sual happened a contractor from new
york appeared on the scene and started to
run a fence around the four thousand acres
it was not an ordinary fence the old peo-
ple in monroe county had been accustomed
to fences of stone of split rail of barb
wire and even of roots of pine trees but
this fence was a novelty to them it was of
wrought iron twelve feet high the tops end-
ing in lance points of needle-like sharpness
woe betide the man or animal who at-
tempting to climb that fence slipped on the
top

another peculiar feature of the fence
which was not noticed till it was finished
and then observed by only one person was
the fact that the fence had no gate there
was no place of entrance or egress work
had been finished all the construction ma-
terial taken away even the nearest neigh-
bors had ceased to be interested- in the
strange behavior of the rich fools in resica
before a single person realized that the fence
had no gate

chapter ii
the story of resica

luke hoofer east stroudsburg philan-
thropist was drowsing idly on his front
gallery one hot afternoon in august 
he was not an old man but his lilfe had
been a busy one and he had reached the
time when he appreciated long periods of
relaxation he had been born on dutch
hill without a cent in his pockets in fact
without any pockets and had attained
wealth and some degree of local fame solely
through his own efforts he was somewhat
surprised when he was aroused by the unex-
pected appearance of a nephew whom he had
not seen for years it was not to be won-
dered that the first question he asked the
young man was what he was doing in mon-
roe county

i am doing a little loafing uncle luke
was abe summers reply

rather young for that arent you
was the caustic answer when i was your
age i never loafed

well you know how to do it now ser-

iously i am up here on a little mission for
ihe government

 that so seems i did hear the girls
say that you had some kind of a govern-
ment job

 that is about right that is one-reason
why  came to see you what do you know
about resica falls

i know i could have bought it once for
a few dollars an acre

i dont mean that what kind of a
place is it were you ever there

i have been there several times hoofer
replied first time when i was a little lad
i went up there and stayed all night that
was in  when i was full grown i used
to see it now and then when i was deer hunt-
ing lately one of my partners had a sum-
mer shack near the falls and we used to go
up there for sunday dinner

then you know about the place tell
me about it

in a way there is not much to tell way
back in the last century some men from new
york bought a large tract of land around a
place called moonshine falls there was a
fifty-foot drop of marshalls creek at that
place and they figured that a lot of horse-
power could be developed from the water
falls there was a fine grade of building
stone there and no grist mill for many a
mile so it seemed like a fine location

they were city people and must have put
the cart before the horse because they fig-
ured that if there was a mill people would
grow grain to take to the mill i under-
stand it was their plan to make flour and
haul it to the delaware and send it to phil-
adelphia by durham boats

they dug the mill race and built the
mill and that was some mill abe at least
two hundred feet by sixty with three-foot
walls and as fine windows as i have ever
seen all the woodwork hand-made and
nailed together with hand-forged spikes
they built over twenty-five stone houses for
the working men and a mansion for the
boss and when they -finished they had a
real town just then news came north that
the states had won the battle of la resi-
ca in mexico you see we were fighting
the mexicans then and that was big news
the sleeping war



just like the battle of gettysburg manila
bay and belleau woods were later on so
they had a big time and free eats and the
new yorkers decided to name the new town
resica instead of moonshine

i dont know what happened to the town
i suppose they ran the mill for some time
and perhaps they never had grain enough
to make it pay at least the place was
abandoned by the time the civil war was
over and when i first saw it it had al-
ready decayed everybody moved away
there seemed to be some kind of a curse on
the place no one wanted to live there and
yet i never could find out why and when
the land was offered for sale four thousand
acres of as nice woodland as you ever saw
but no one wanted to buy it i understand
that it has been bought lately by some for-
eigners

n  it is marshalls creek that makes

o	the falls

exactly the same creek that makes
marshalls falls lower down before it emp-
ties into the delaware you see marshall
was one of the men hired by the proprietors
to make the celebrated indian walk the
time the indians were robbed of the shaw-
nee flats right up there was where the
walk ended the indians were never satis-
fied fever that business deal and i guess
they were robbed in good fashion

let me tell you something uncle luke
said the young man in a low voice i was
sent up here to look into the resica business
and there are some peculiar details about it
i have just been up there on foot in fact
i walked around the outside of the four
thousand acres they have a fence around
the whole place

i have heard about the fence

it is there all right and it is a real
fence too i walked around it tied my
handkerchief on one of the iron rods and
kept on walking till i came to the hand-
kerchief again it is one of the finest fences
i ever saw and must have cost some money-
but there is not a sign of a gate

whats that

there is no gate i thought that there
might be a removable section serving for a

gate but i do not think so there is just
a fence no way to go in and no way to go
out except by airplane and the place is all
woods so there would be no place to land
that is rather odd commented the old
man but let me tell you this abe sum-
mers that is not the only peculiar thing
about that place first is the price they
paid-four hundred thousand dollars and
it is not worth it then there was the mat-
ter of the road they had the road closed
and the bridge torn down i dont know
what it cost them but i believe some of the
county bosses made a good thing out of it
and no doubt the highway people at har-
risburg were in on it anyway the road
was closed course you know about the
fence more than i do because i have not
been interested enough in it to drive up to
see it from what i hear those people
have put about a million dollars into that
investment and that is a lot of money to
pay just for land

what do they want it for

how should i know summer resort
lumber electric power no nothing
like that did you examine the deed
yes but that does not tell anything
just gives the price and the description and
the parties concerned

it tells one thing abe remarked the
old man slowly and it seems to me that
that one thing is the most peculiar thing
that has happened at resica for a number of
years and enough strange things have hap-
pened there that place was bought by a
chinaman by the name of wand foo
anytime a chinaman buys four thousand
acres of land in the deer country of monroe
county and puts an iron fence around it
why that is a matter of real importance
i am not working for the government but
if i were i would keep the chinaman in
mind

i will do that uncle guess i better
be going say hello to the folks for me
where are you going abe

back to resica i am going to find
some way to go through that fence or over
it

you will find that marshalls creek goes
under it whispered the east stroudsburg


wonder stories

philanthropist as he shut his eyes and went
back to sleep the young government em-
ploye heard and remembered the remark

the next morning he slowly walked up
the road from marshalls falls it was
early in the morning but already hot one
of those days without wind when the grass-
hoppers whirr through the air and the upper
sky of deep blue is dotted here and there with
dragon flies darting like miniature warring
planes after impotent foes it was just
hot without a breath of moving air sum-
mers took things easy and at noon came to
the end of the road an abrupt pause em-
phasized by the tall iron fence there was
no sign of a road on the other side of the
fence just a forest of fern shrub and trees
turning to the left summers followed the
fence

under the creek

it was growing dark when the sound of
running water warned him that he was
near marshalls creek it was running at
the bottom of a heavily wooded ravine and
he was tired from his all-day walk he
made a hasty supper of chocolate bars and
peanut butter sandwiches washed it all down
with water almost as cold as ice made a bed
from some ferns and had no difficulty in
going to sleep he was only thirty years
old but he had slept on the sands of the
sahara the muddy shores of the amazon
and the snow-clad mountains of alaska
the fern bed alongside of marshalls creek
was real comfort compared with some of
his couches

the next morning he was ready for some
more chocolate bars the water was still
cold too cold to use for shaving with com-
fort yet true to his training he simply had
to shave before starting on the days work
his belt was pulled up an extra hole and
he was ready

and i hope he said to himself that i
get something to eat before another day
passes

from close up the fence looked more for-
midable than ever it ran down into the
ravine over the creek and up the other side
it looked as though the iron bars went

down into the bottom of the creek bed
previous experimenting had shown sum-
mers that the bars of the fence went several
feet into the ground and were connected
there by many strands of heavy barbed wire
it all seemed very difficult in fact impos-
sible to get through in order to obtain a
better view of the top of the fence he lay
back on his bed of ferns just then he heard
a squirrel scold and a blue-jay cry across
the ravine he heard a twig snap raising
his head cautiously he saw a man at the
top of the hill on the other side and that
man was walking down into the ravine
along the inside of the fence summers
hardly breathed he was glad that the
ferns and shrubs around him were so thick
even after the man had gone for fifteen
minutes he still lay there then he cau-
tiously sat up

that was a sentry he exclaimed
those people are patrolling the fence
and unless i was dreaming it was an indian
and what is an indian doing inside the
fence an indian working for a china-
man some combination but now is the
time to cross the fence wonder how cold
that water is

rapidly undressing he tied his clothes
into a bundle and threw it over the fence
then he dived into the creek the plunge
took him to the bottom of the creek bed
he was hunting for something that he was
not sure existed an opening under the fence
made by the swirling water in the spring
freshets the first time under brought no
results except to show him that the bottoms
of the bars were as sharply pointed as were
the tops and that there was a lot of barbed
wire in between again and again he went
under each time at different places until
at last he found what he was looking for a
place where he could go under

it was a chance and a rather desperate
one but one worth taking he came out
on the other side fighting for air and shiv-
ering from cold his back badly cut by the
barbed wire the warm air felt good after
the cold water his clothes felt good he
was hungry and tired and sore but the im-
portant thing was that he was inside the
fence
the sleeping war



the next thing was to go to the falls
resica falls where the mill race was where
the grist mill and the village of twenty-five
houses had been built during the mexican
war resica the mysterious there he
hoped to find a chinaman and an indian
and there he hoped to find an answer to the
mystery of resica

he followed the course of the creek sat-
isfied that it would lead him to resica
falls at or near the falls he was sure that
he would find the new owners of the pro-
perty his course was slow not only be-
cause of the necessity of caution but also
because he was held back by berry briars
large rock and rhododendrons so thick that
the place well deserved the name given it
years before by the early settlers of devils
hell it was hot in the woods and he was
tired and very hungry by the time he heard
the sound of falling tormented water which
announced his proximity to the falls

to his surprise he saw a small bungalow
ahead of him and remembered his uncles
saying that one of his partners used to have
a summer camp at that part of the property
just on the other side of the iron bridge
the bridge was gone but the little house re-
mained and was no doubt in use

abe summers belonged to the new school
of detectives who believed that a straight
line was the shortest distance between two
points at times their code is a dangerous
one often it results in the unpleasant death
of the operator but always there is a gam-
ble in it that makes life worth living and
more often than not ir brings results

the old style detector of crime would have
secreted himself in the woods spied on the
house and the inhabitants for some days
formed conclusions as to their activity which
way have been right but just as possibly
wrong and would have avoided any con-
tact with the parties being observed

summers was hungry and tired he had
accomplished one of the objectives of his
program and had reached resica falls
now he walked up to the door of the little
house in the woods and knocked no an-
swer coming to his summons he opened the
door and walked in through the little

rooms-no one there but there was a com-
fortable chair and on the table in the back
room a meal apparently served for one per-
son

and that person is abe summers ac-
knowledged the detective to himself i ad-
mit that it is not the act of a perfect gentle-
man to eat without being invited but i am
hungry besides there are certain features
about this house and this meal which makes
me wonder if i was not expected a man
who spends a million to insure privacy has
no doubt a very efficient secret service of
his own and there was the indian not
surprising to see an indian but it was a
thrill to see him roam through the primitive
woods dressed in the costume of his ances-
tors

he ate slowly and then cleaned up and
washed the dishes when he was through
after that he walked leisurely through the
house examining everything thoroughly but
disturbing and touching nothing he spent
over an hour studying a large map of new
jersey and eastern pennsylvania it took
him a long time to grasp the meaning of it
but at last he began to smile and relaxed
in the comfortable morris chair which
seemed to be provided for his special com-
fort

very clever he acknowledged to him-
self remarkably clever that explains
the absence of a gate now that i am warm
and fed and a part of my curiosity satisfied
 think that i will take a little well earned
sleep

chapter iii
wand foo explains

it was late when he awoke candles in
a silver candelabra were burning on the
center table on the other side of the table
a man sat his fingers interlaced his gaze
directed into vacancy summers took out
his watch looked at the time wound it and
replaced it in his pocket

i fear that i overslept myself he stated
simply

when i saw that you were asleep i did


wonder stories

not wish to disturb your honorable person
mr summers

hyou know me

how could i forget an antagonist of
years past surely you recall your activi-
ties in china when you gathered details
concerning our russian friends how can
you forget wand foo

i have not forgotten him confessed
summers

i am so glad purred the chinaman
ever since you blocked my game in china
i have had you on my mind when we
came to america i hoped that you would
be selected by the secret service to investi-
gate our activities not that it made any
difference you understand but i felt that
it would add to my pleasure to have you
interested in our plans everything worked
out nicely and now you are our guest i
am sure you will be pleased to meet some
of our compatriots strange bedfellows in
a way but united by a common bond of
hatred	

he clapped his hands and two men came
from the doorways of the room where they
had been concealed in the shadows the
oriental introduced them

this swarthy gentleman is georgius
sergiov you can call him george for
short it will be so intimate and informal
he represents the great russian republic
and comes to america thoroughly commit-
ted to aid us in every way possible when
the time is ripe his countrymen will come
to the united states and reorganize the coun-
try according to their own ideas of equality
and fraternity at present this is a rich
land but when we finish it will simply be a
province of a new nation yet to be organ-
ized when tty time comes however for
this to happen the directing force of that
new world empire will be in russia

and not in china interrogated sum-
mers

ah the question of a cunning diplo-
mat in trouble and starting at once to raise
discord among his enemies why should
china crave power we were cultured gen-
tlemen when the slav was a painted savage
and the anglo-saxon a skin-clothed animal
we were writing and using gunpowder

when the other world nations were in the
stone age our history was lost in antiquity
when egypt was in her swaddling clothes
china can wait china has always been able
to wait four hundred million population
and dying like flies but back of those yel-
low flies a national consciousness of world
supremacy we are willing to allow rus-
sia to occupy america

this other gentleman has a rather dif-
ficult name to pronounce but in english it
means troubled water he is a full-
blooded indian and as such is more entitled
to the name american than you or any of
your people his being here has a singular
history he is a lineal descendant of the
indian tribes who once owned all this land
they were cheated out of it badly deceived
at the time of the indian walk his fam-
ily lived here at resica naturally they
never forgot the treatment accorded them
by the white race for four generations
they have been made to live on the western
reservations but always they remembered
their home when the time  came they re-
turned to it-not all of them of course yet
all who were left of the family

but troubled waters retained the tradi-
tions of his family and their knowledge of
resica and the falls after he became rich
from the sale of his oklahoma oil lands he
traveled and i met him in china and after
we talked matters over we became friends

he told me about the falls and the tunnel
and i saw possibilities enough in the idea
to propose a certain plan to the russian
government so we three are here just the
three of us and now you have joined us

nd that makes four commented
summers

and i am sure that you will be interested
in our plans mr summers because you
have always had such a flair for being in-
terested in other peoples business brief-
ly speaking we are going to conquer the
united states just the three of us is not
that interesting of course our armies
later on will come into the country and mop 
up the place but the main work will be
done by the three of us
the sleeping war



mbut i thought there were four of us
asked summers

you are going to be just an interested
spectator remember that we did not in-
vite you since you are here however we
intend to have you stay here is our plan
centuries ago a race who lived here before
the indians built a tunnel from resica
falls to the ocean at the far end we have
a very pretty summer home built and no
one not even the clever mr summers would
suspect that one could walk from the cellar
of that home to resica falls our precious
supplies are being carried from there some-
day government officials may come to our
iron fence and demand admission and we
will very gladly let them in and show them
everything but at the end they will have
learned nothing

our machinery is very simple at the
top of the falls at one side in a cave we
place the barrels one at a time these are
connected with a little silver pipe which
empties the contents of the barrel a drop at
a time into the water just as it dashes over
the falls to mingle with the troubled wa-
ters that is the part of our indian friend
so very much enjoys he sits there and
watches the drops disappearing so evenly
over the falling water his race died that
way one at a time like dropping water or
falling leaves in autumn now as he
watches the medicine falling into the water
he sees the doom of the descendants of the
people who destroyed his ancestors and
robbed them of their homes

that is our modern method of making
war did you know your nation was at
war no doubt you are ignorant but war
las begun we have started now-the drops
are falling sixty a  minute and thir-
ty-six hundred in the hour soon we will
have results in philadelphia and the small-
er cities around philadelphia then we
will do the same thing to new york and
new orleans and los angeles and when
the morale of the people is destroyed when
fear covers the land like a panic then our
troops will move in how-you need not
know but it means the end of the war

that is very interesting but i am not
sure of your conclusions said summers

i cannot see how three of you can accom-
plish all that disturbance

you weary me with your arguments and
objections answered the oriental with an
air of finality friends suppose you show
him the pipe and the barrels and then place
him in the tunnel and lock the iron gate i
might say mr summers that the tunnel is
many miles long and you can wander
through it as you wish at the other end
you will also find a gate so you can stay
there and think and while you are doing it
your nation will begin to die

the detective saw that resistance was use-
less these three men were not in any
way ordinary beings life to them was a
commonplace murder a banality for
some reason they did not kill him at once
but he knew that they would change their
mind in a split second if he showed resis-
tance he allowed them to search him and
followed them into the twilight

the last rays of a setting sun were turn-
ing the boiling water of the falls into a fairy
land of fantasy the three of them the
russian the indian and the young amer-
ican walked through the wood till they
came to a little shining pipe which seemed
to come out of the rock on one side of the
falls the free end hung over the falling
water

the barrels are in a cave over there
growled sergiov the chinaman said
we were to show you the barrels but whats
the use i think he must be foolish to even
let you live

if i had my way commented the in-
dian i would take him out on that rock
and slit his throat and let his blood join
the medicine still orders are orders and
i suppose we might as well carry them out
but what the idea is is too much for me
come along with you have you the key
sergiov

i have the key and here we are an-
nounced the russian orders were to
turn him loose in the tunnel but nothing
said as to how with that he struck the
detective a crushing blow on the head with
a blackjack

it was hours before summers really knew
what had happened to him


wonder stories

the great epidemic

the events of the next two weeks will
always remain as one of the great
tragedies in american history there had
been previous disasters by war fire flood
and tornado cities like san francisco had
been leveled by earthquakes other cities
like chicago razed to the ground by fire
but never before had two million people
gradually gone to sleep and kept on sleep-
ing

the first cases were so scattered and so
unconnected that the real peril of the situa-
tion was not realized here a few and
there a few of the people of the lower dela-
ware valley went to sleep and could not be
aroused the next day there were hun-
dreds more of the sleepers but even then
the symptoms were so mild the sleep was
so natural that there was no realization on
the part of the authorities as to the mean-
ing of it all in fact it was not until the
epidemic had taken thousands into the arms
of morpheus that real apprehension began

it was thought at first that it was a wide-
spread epidemic of lethargic encephalitis
but certain symptoms of that disease were
uniformly absent in fact there was no
symptom except a natural sleep perhaps
heavier than usual the women and chil-
dren seemed to be the first affected and
they simply feeling drowsy went to their
beds the men because of a greater resis-
tance were the last to be overcome inside
of a week over two million persons were
asleep

it meant an end of all activities in the
great city transportation stopped the pro-
duction of power ceased commerce the
ordinary relation between people came to
an end the waitress in the restaurant the
mechanic at his bench the broker at his
desk the surgeon operating on his patient-
one and all became sleepy and yielded to
their desire to rest

j it did not take long for the great medical
minds of the nation to realize that some-
thing terrible menacing deadly was at

a variety of brain fever known aa sleeping
sickness

work in philadelphia two things had to
be done one was to take proper care of
the victims the other was to determine just
what was causing the sleeping epidemic

it is to the credit of the medical frater-
nity that at this time there was no end of
volunteers who went into the doomed city
to care for those who lay in a death-like
trance the greatest medical minds of the
nation volunteered to determine in spite of
the obvious danger the cause of the epi-
demic they went into the city saw the
streets crowded with the inert forms-the
traffic now silent a mass of confusion
then they too joined the lifeless throngs
few returned to tell the story

the thought of a great city devoid of all
protection helpless to the last degree stirr-
ed the imagination of the underworld at
once a small army of degenerates reckless
to the last degree gamblers all moved like
a devastating army towards the city of the
sleeping people they went to rob and
they remained to sleep on the streets
with their bundles of loot beside them they
fell down to their tortured dreams victims
of the same dire fate that stilled the activi-
ties of their intended victims

it was felt that in spite of the best inten-
tions little could be done for those already
suffering from the weird disease the
government threw a line of soldiers around
the city and finally forbade either entrance
or egress ships evaded delaware bay a
silence greater than even the silence of the
dead hung over the dreaming metropolis

a nation trembling from sympathy exert-
ed all its mental resources to solve the prob-
lem that had destroyed the consciousness of
one of its great cities the world apparent-
ly a unit in sympathy offered any resource
at its command philadelphia long jeered
at as the sleepy city was remembered at
a thousand altars in prayers as earnest as
they were impotent

and then a message came from the sov-
iets the red nation of the world it sug-
gested that other american cities in addi-
tion to philadelphia might fall asleep and
offered as an alternative submission to a
peaceful conquest by russia and china
the sleeping war



the message was delivered secretly to
the president of the united states
whatever his motives his decision was to
keep it secret there is no doubt that had
he done otherwise a national panic might
have resulted millions of men were still
out of work the classes were disturbed over
the philadelphia situation the masses were
ripe for revolt rightly or wrongly the
president decided to allow a few days to
lapse before arriving at a decision

meanwhile the coast guard of new jer-
sey had taken an unconscious part in the
course of world politics they had had
under observation for some months a very
ornate but isolated summer home it was
according to theiv conclusions the head-
quarters of an aristocratic set of bootleg-
gers now and then a ship steamed in and
unloaded a number of small barrels which
were carried via boat and wheelbarrow to
the summer bungalow in spite of their
closest watch they had failed to see any of
it leave the house for distribution

a wild night had been selected for the un-
loading of the next lot of kegs the rev-
enue officers were on hand and the attack
on the house was a perfect success the
russian crew were captured and in the cel-
lar of the house two chinamen escaped a
similar fate by committing suicide the
guards were just leaving the cellar when
they heard a call for help following the
sound they came to an iron gate hid behind
some empty kegs a hoarse feverish voice
cried to them desperately and explained to
them that the keys to the gate might be ob-
tained from one of the dead chinamen

a few minutes later abe summers stag-
gered out into the cellar and collapsed on
the floor the first thing that he did on
recovering his consciousness was to go to the
telephone and tell mr wand foo in very
excellent chinese that the ship had just
come in and had succeeded in landing thir-
ty-seven kegs of the drug

summers had not been very happy the
days spent in the tunnel with an iron gate
at each end had been tortured years he
had found water in abundance and a few
living things like salamanders and toads
he had groped his way through the dark all

the distance from resica to the shore of the
atlantic ocean only to find another gate
his life had been an adventuresome one but
never before had he come so close to the con-
sciousness of death and his sufferings
were made all the more horrible by his reali-
zation of an unknown danger which in some
way was threatening the people of the dela-
ware valley and which danger he was un-
able to prevent

now for a wonder fate had not only
saved his life but had placed him in control
of one end of the tunnel first he made
the effort to keep the three conspirators in
ignorance of the fact that the outlet to their
fortress in resica was in the hands of their
enemies the next thing was to find what
had happened to the people of philadel-
phia during the long tedious tormenting
days he had wandered a hungry desperate
man in his tunnel prison

it did not take long for the coast guards
to answer his eager questions the people
of philadelphia and the vicinity had fallen
asleep victims of a peculiar and terrible
epidemic that up to the present time had
not even been given a name that was it
that was the explanation of the liquid drop-
ping through the silver pipe into resica
falls even though greatly diluted it had
drugged the city it must have taken so
little to produce such mighty results and
there were many barrels left thirty-seven
had been landed that night enough if
properly distributed to numb the sensibili-
ties of the nation certainly enough to so
stagnate the life of the great cities so that
the conquest of the united states by the
soviets would be simply a matter of time

summers sat in a chair in the summer
bungalow and thought it all out the rus-
sian and the indian were just pawns in the
game wand foo was the real brains it
was the chinaman who had formulated the
attack it was his shrewd brain that had
determined just what drug to be used it
was no doubt something that was unknown
to the occidental pharmacist the yellow
man had boasted of the superior knowledge
of his countrymen

summers was a detective not a physician
but it did not take a medical mind to leap


wonder stories

across the picture puzzle and arrive at the
next step in the solution if wand foo
knew the poison he also knew the antidote
there was only one thing to do get the
man and make him tell

chapter iv
tracks of mud

the detective slowly ate crackers and
water sweetened with sugar he was
weak but gradually as the sugar began to
circulate through him he began to think
more clearly the only way the chinaman
could be taken alive was by surprise ev-
en if resica was captured there still re-
mained the long dark primitive tunnel a
bad place to capture a man in especially if
the man was desperate

summers felt peculiarly alone he had
been sent out by the secret service with the
instructions to clear up the resica mystery
the final statement made to him was that
in no emergency was he to do anything that
would cause publicity it was to be a one-
man game and more than ever did the
detective see the wisdom of this advice if
the peoples of the united states learnedthe
real facts war could not be prevented and
war with russia china and mexico would
mean war also with japan it might be a
successful war and no doubt it might be a
popular one but it would mean the loss
of millions of lives it would rock the
peace of the world

meantime the coast guards were growing
more curious they felt the air of mystery
and were anxiously awaiting the time when
they could ask a thousand questions it
had been useless to question the russian
prisoners but who the starved white man
was who had shown them his secret service
badge and what interest he had in the boot-
leg game they did not know whom had he
telephoned to summers could not satisfy
their curiosity

youll have to consult my chief he ex-
plained but i will say that these men
caught me and nearly starved me lucky
for me you raided the place when you did
better be careful of that liquorl not or-

dinary stuff by any means give me a
gun and let me watch these foreigners while
you go and report the affair to your head-
quarters

he spoke with an air of authority and
they believed what he said when they
came back they found two dead russians
there was a note pinned to one of them with
the simple explanation that they had tried
to escape the detective was gone it was
not till some minutes later that some one
suggested that they look in the cellar
when they did so they found that the iron
gate was locked outside the house they
found the muddy tracks of a motorcycle-
leading to the cellar door

they were members of the coast guard
but they were clso very human men the
statement made to them that the liquor in
the barrels was no ordinary stuff interested
them they tried some when the relief
guards came they found two dead china-
men in the cellar two dead russians in the
parlor and three sleeping americans in the
kitchen there was no one left to tell the
story of the starved man in the tunnel

  

wand foo was rather happy he had
every reason to believe that the morale of
the nation was baflly undermined by the
calamity in philadelphia thirty-seven
more barrels of the drug had been success-
fully landed in the summer home which
secreted the other end of the tunnel sum-
mers who had done him great harm in past
years was slowly starving to death in the
tunnel perhaps it would have been best
to take the russians advice and killed him
at once but it certainly was pleasant to
think of his slowly dying with ever-increas-
ing hunger gnawing at him like a fox ev-
erything was working out nicely but there
was one thing that worried him and try as
he would he was unable to determine what
it was

he wondered if he was growing old losing
his cunning in the meantime he formu-
lated plans for the attack on new york
city an assault that would end in the sleep-
ing death of eight million persons per-
haps after that the president of the united
the sleeping war



states would realize that it was best to ans-
wer letters from foreign nations

summers had had one experience with
the prehistoric tunnel bleeding from
the scalp wound from the terrific blow of
the russian he had recovered consciousness
in that tunnel and had staggered under the
delaware river and under the width of new
jersey only to find at the end of a wild
delirious staggering walk there was an iron
gate at the other end during those days
of starvation hope had remained in his
heart for no other reason than the fact that
he was an anglo-saxon fighting for the
very life of his country

for the second time he entered the tun-
nel but this time he went in voluntarily
wheeling a somewhat muddy but serviceable
motorcycle with an excellent head lamp to
light his way on the wild ride back to resi-
ca he had locked the gate behind him
because he did not want any interference
with his plans he had also two automa-
tics and plenty of ammunition several
packages of creckers a can of sardines and
unlimited hope he was not sure that the
key to one gate would unlock the other
one but he hoped so

back of his anxiety to return to the falls
was a curious interest in the tunnel he
had been told that it was very old now
with the light guiding his way his hands
gripped about the handlebars and the roar
of the machine filling the cave he was able
to confirm this statement the floor was
worn smooth by the millions of feet that
long centuries ago had walked from the
ocean to the falls on the walls were rude
carvings of animals who ruled america
when the gulf of mexico began at st louis
and who now remained only as rock pictures
and fossil bones summers determined
that he must not be the last one to travel
through that tunnel when this little af-
fair was cleaned up he must make the exis-
tence of the tunnel known to the smithson-
ian institution

he chugged on and on with the regularity
of a machine there were short periods of
rest to be rid of the deafening roar of the
machine and scant periods for eating at

last with a sigh he saw cracks of daylight at
the other end of the tunnel and heard the
thunder of the falls beyond the gate day-
light indeed but little more for once again
in his mind he saw resica at the close of
the day at the crimson purpling of a sun-
set

now for the key would it open the
gate it did summers took that as an
omen from now on it was to be a poker
game but the cards were stacked one
man against the representatives of three
great nations two living and one dead and
the one man held all the aces

he locked the gate behind him his first
thought was to stop the constant dropping
of the drug into the water after that was
done he would attend to the russian and the
indian he was  longer a calm metho-
dical detective he had become from neces-
sity a killer

lady luck was with him troubled wa-
ters was lonesome and a trifle bored
there had been long periods of complete
inactivity and a gradual deepening of the
feeling that the chinaman did not consider
him a vital factor in the program prepared
for the conquest of america he was not
even confident that if those plans were car-
ried out successfully the remnant of his
nation would be happier or more prosper-
ous he had seen something of the russian
temperament in the last few months and he
was not sure that the russian would be as
kind a ruler as the saxori had been

he had hoped some day to be able to live
at resica but who was there to live with
his race was almost gone there was not
a pure blooded indian maiden in his tribe
and the half breeds would rather live in
new york than amid the solitude of resica

he sat cross-legged on the rocks at one
side of the falls and thought over these
matters the thunder of the water lulled
his caution while the shimmering sheen of
the sun in his eyes hypnotised him into a
twilight sleep he awoke for a second with
the crash of a bullet in his brain died as he
plunged downward over the falls and went
to sleep eternally in the dark green of the
whirlpool below

and now for the russian whispered


wonder stories

summers as he started to walk to the little
bungalow luck was again with him
the two men he was hunting for were in the
living room laying their plans to leave
resica the next morning they were seated
on opposite sides of a table and the rus-
sian was facing the window

a lesson in torture

mt have it now cried the chinaman

a with a complete departure from his
usual suave manner something has been
troubling me and now i know what it is
we will not wait till tomorrow to go to the
cottage by the ocean we will go tonight
listen to me and learn how the little things
of life are of the greatest importance my
servant telephoned to me that thirty-seven
kegs of the poison had been successfully
landed and were stored in the cellar but
that servant is a well-educated man he has
the blood of mandarins in him and was
educated in england he spoke to me in
chinese but one phrase he used was not
inflected in exactly the manner of a man-
darin i heard that phrase but my mind
slept now it is awake georgiov that
was not my servant who spoke to me over
the telephone

then who was it asked the russian
somewhat annoyed at the sudden garrulous
behavior of the oriental

that was none other than my friend
abe summers

just then a shot filled the silence of the
room the russian slumped in his chair
and dropped to the floor once again the
killer fighting for the security of his coun-
try and not willing to take a single chance
had spoken

and do not make a single false move
wand foo commanded summers and you
better keep your hands up till i frisk you

i do not want to kill you but i may have
to if you dont behave

had the chinaman been dealing with a
stranger he would have taken a chance but
he had come in contact with summers once-
before he felt that for the present he was
in a precarious -position at any moment
he expected the indian to come and then

even with the russian dead there would be
two to one summers might be persuaded
to talk the white man might be bluffed out-
witted wand foo hoped for the best but
at the same time obeyed the command and
raised his hands

the detective tied those hands with the
orientals own sash he tied his feet and
bodyto the chair with a rope he had carried
with him from the sea-side bungalow when
he finished the cjiinaman was trussed in
no uncertain manner the dead russian
was dragged into the next room the center
table pulled to one side and then summers
started to talk

no use to spill a lot of words wand
foo i know what you tried to do to my
country in spite of your efforts i lived on
though i nearly starved in the tunnel now
i am back and i hold all the aces in this
poker game poor troubled waters is dead
at the bottom of resica falls your rus-
sian friend is dead so are your people on
the atlantic coast just you and i left
and you are rather helpless

now i know that you are no fool you
know a lot more than i do-about some-
things you know all about this sleeping
drug you have put into resica falls and
from there into the delaware river but
you know another thing about that dope
you know the antidote and you are going
to tell me

of course you will refuse you think
that i will kill you and then you can save
your face and join your honorable ancestors
i would not think of killing you not all at
one time but when you had me in your
power in china some years ago you gave
me some personal lessons in torture do
you remember well i am going to pay
you back-teach you the same lessons and
maybe show you some new tricks but just
as soon as you tell me how to save those
unfortunate sleepers in philadelphia i will
stop the education now do you under-
stand

you cannot torture me mr summers
announced the yellow man with a smile
you are a white man and white men do
not use those methods you would kill me
but you would not torture me
the sleeping war



is that so well all i can say is that
you better watch me for the next hour you
are going to tell me what i want to know
and i know that you are going to in the
meantime i will build a fire in that fire-
place and start to work

half an hour later wand foo agreed to
come across with the information he
was not at all happy for various reasons
but the part that hurt the worst was the con-
sciousness that he had made a mistake in
estimating the character of an anglo-saxon
who was aroused

both men were sweating no one will
ever know what abe did to wand foo but it
was sufficient to break the determination
of the oriental to die rather than surrender
the information

enough he cried stop the rem-
edy is simple a few drops of a ten percent
solution of sodium bicarbonate injected by
hypodermic under the skin will wake the
sleeper

wait a minute till i write that down
that is the truth is it

absolutely

 have you any in this house

yes in that table drawer i always
have some hypodermics loaded-in case of
accident

summers confirmed the statement placed
a hypodermic syringe on the table and left
the house twenty minutes later he return-
ed and explained his absence

i went to get some of that poison you
lied to me in the past and you might do it
again i am going to make you drink some
of this stuff and then after you fall asleep
i am going to give you the antidote if
it works you will awaken now open your
mouth oh yes you will want some
more persuasion here drink this i am
going to give you a big dose and then i am
going to find something to eat and take a
little sleep myself

he enjoyed that meal but before it was
over he heard the oriental call him

ah mr summers a little matter i
forgot-in the excitement of the last hour
there is a little vial of tablets in the draw-
er i am not sure of their latin name but

i am sure that your chemists will be able
to identify it one of them has to be dis-
solved in the sodium bicarbonate before it
is effective i thought that you should
know that

i thought there was something like that
answered the detective with a grin now
you just go to sleep and when you start to
snore i will shoot you with the needle and
wake you from bye-bye-baby land i hope
you have a happy dream

summers did not mean to sleep so long
but he was completely tired and it was day-
light before he awoke there was no doubt
about the sleep of the chinaman it was a
narcosis from which no amount of yelling
shaking or pinchingcould arouse him the
detective fixed the antidote injected it and
then started to eat breakfast in an hour
the chinaman was awake

it worked agreed summers now you
and i are going to washington just as fast
as we can to tell our story there

i cannot walk through the tunnel said
wand foo decisively not with my feet
the way you left them

we are not going through the tunnel
we are going through the fence you will
walk with your hands bound and i will ride
behind you with a very muddy motorcycle
until we get an automobile

there is no gate to that fence

think that i do not know that but
you know how to get out secret panel or
something and you are going to show it to
me either that or i am going to hoist you
up on top and stick one of those iron points
through you you are positively the hard-
est man to handle i ever argued with you
do not seem to understand that i mean busi-
ness

six hours later luke hoofer received a
call from his nephew the young man did
not even have time to leave the automobile
but called the old man out to the street

just how bad are things in philadelphia
uncle

bad enough abe millions of people
asleep and th whole district quarantined
wtiere have you been

to hell and back again by the way

an incredible nightmarish monster ten yards long was
warily feeling his head with a set of antennae 
the world without



above the subdued din around the din-
ner-table where in the fashionable even-
ing clothes of the day were gathered all the
white people worthy of
note in cairo could
be heard the dictator-
ial voice of mr part-
ing the mathemati-
cian broad-should-
ered stout but not fat
with legs set wide
apart like the colos-
sus at rhodes he dom-
inated the company
and delivered h i s
speech with the gusto
and rhetoric of an ora-
tor he was a perfect
type of dinner guest

he would emphasize
a point of his discourse
with a blow of his fist
on the table which
threatened to spill the
wine

opposite him with
glowering eyes sat dr

klington philosopher
and amateur archeolo-
gist his lean hard
frame long ascetic
features and hair of
the colour and texture
of fine copper wires
were in utter contrast
to the appearance of
the speaker

for more years than
either of them would
care to admit they
had waged a wordy
war mainly through
the medium of the
press few were the
scientific controversies
in which the one parti-
cipated without the op-
position of the other
and now for the first
time they had encountered each other in
person the guests who were in the know
smacked their lips in anticipation

their amiable host had realised too late
and with a deep sense of chagrin the
trouble he might cause by inviting them
both to the same din-
ner he trembled at
the thought of the con-
sequence of this tact-
less act what non-
sense was mr parling
saying now-

    and it is my
firm opinion based
upon irrefutable the-
ory that our universe
is composed of a grerft
number of three-di-
mensional worlds ex-
isting side by side in
a fourth dimension
just as the two-dimen-
sional leaves of a book
lie side by side in a
third dimension   
mr parling droned
on while the host won-
dered if his new ocial
idea of allowing ev-
eryone present to
speak upon his own
special subject hobby
was as good as he had
first thought it his
mental peregrinations
were suddenly termin-
ated by the sound of a
low highly-cultivated
insistent voice the in-
evitable had happened
at last dr klington
had interrupted the
thread of mr parlings
discourse

i beg to question
that latter statement of
yours mr parling
such an utterly absurd
idea can have no foun-
dation when opposed
by the doctrines of the
very keenest brain of the last century i
mean the eminent and profound scientist
the frenchman henri poincar

accustomed as we
are to our world in
which the laws of nature
are well-known to us we
are apt to forget that what
seem to be absolute laws
are really only approxima-
tions since cause and ef-
fect seem to follow with
precise regularity we con-
struct from them laws of
nature

the truth is that our
laws of nature are just
convenient explanations of
things but it is possible
that the real and ultimate
laws of the universe might
be very much different
than we imagine our uni-
verse might stand in the
same relation to the uni-
verse of reality as the
universes of microscopic
creatures stand to us as
alphonse her get said writ-
ing in candide paris re-
cently by the side of the
microphysics of the infin-
itely little we have a cos-
mophysics of the infinite-
ly great and beyond
may not our universe it-
self huge as it seems be
for some vaster being noth-
ing but an aggregation of
molecules of which each is
a solar system what un-
imagineable physics must
govern the movements of
the vast solid made up of
such units but is it not
fine that the brain of man
is able to rise to the height
of such thoughts the
present story dealing with
this theme is one of the
vy most unusual we have read


wonder stories

henri poincare he was a mathemati-
cian yet he was also a philosopher and like
all philosophers he was a dreamer

a buzz of excited voices swept around the
table for this was a direct attack upon
klington

developments after that threatened to de-
part from a mere discussion and become a
brawl in which the excited guests did not
hesitate to join the affair promised to be
a welcome relief from the boring speeches
which had hitherto marred the evening
mine hosts voice was heard occasionally
above the tumult pleading but futile now
gentlemen do be a little more quiet please
events were brought to a sudden silent
standstill broken only by
faint whisperings by the
booming voice of parl-
ing stop he cried

dr klington he said
in a quieter tone now that
silence had been restored

would direct experimen-
tal evidence convince you
of the truth of my asser-
tion

i klington smiled sarcas-
tically it certainly
would

if you care to call at
my bungalow tomorrow
morning i shall be
pleased to offer you such
evidence

  

klington did not fail to keep the appoint-
ment he was let into the bungalow by
parling himself they were both a little
stiff and cold in manner as they walked to
the sitting-room and klington haughtily
took a seat

he was instantly aware of a strange
sweetish aroma which faintly prevaded the
atmosphere of the room but on looking
around he could not see its source his
antagonist stood before him in the charact-
eristic rhodian attitude legs wide apart
and began to speak

you probably know that the firm of con-
structional engineers for which i work is at
present building a dam across the white

nile in order to facilitate irrigation

the philosopher nodded assent

while excavating for the foundations on
the bank of the river the workmen cam
across a sealed chamber hollowed out in a
rock face and within the chamber was dis-
covered a sarcophagus it was temporarily
transported to my bungalow en route to the
british museum there it is behind your
chair

klington turned his head and per-
ceived the origin of the odor it was
a stone burial receptacle of the usual type
an inspection of the interior showed noth-
ing more startling than mummified remains
and a scroll of some ma-
terial probably papyrus
with an inscription on the
outer surface 

i understand you
know something about
archeology said parling
can you tell me what
these hieroglyphics
mean

certainly hum this
i s rather strange it
means-before isis exist-
ed cthis was very pe-
culiar but what has this
got to do with the quesi
tion

you will soon see
parling took the scroll
unrolled it and revealed
within a flexible bar of some bright pur-
plish material about three feet long and two
inches wide one end of the bar was fitted
into a small transparent globe containing a
yellow liquid the bar could apparently
slide right through the globe a groove hav-
ing been made for it

parling had assumed a confident over-
bearing manner and the light of triumph
was in his eye he pushed the rod till the
end projected about four inches beyond the
other side of the globe

i found it entirely by accident he said

found what said klington manifestly
puzzled and a little contemptuous

the secret of course said the other

benson herbert
the world without



now watch the end of the bar carefully
with these words he continued slowly to
push the rod through the bowl and then
it was that klington began to think he was
being hypnotised he could no longer see
the end of the rod up to four inches from
the bowl there was firm solid matter but
beyond that nothing

parling chuckled at his astonishment
youre wondering where the end of it
has gone eh well you see its perfectly
flexible just where it ends off it has
undergone a double right-angle bend and
through some unique property conferred
upon it no doubt by the presence of the
liquid in the globe one of those bends is in
the fourth dimension the other bend na-
turally brings it into some other world par-
allel to our own it certainly is not in our
world-and he passed his hand through
the space where the missing end of the bar
would normally have been i defy you to
explain the phenomenon in any other way
klington was decidedly sceptical

how do i know you are not tricking
me he said

parling scowled and thrust a finger be-
fore the others eyes it was stiff lifeless
and almost brittle

see this finger i had placed my hand
on the rod and moved it aloflg towards the
vanished end in order to attempt to follow
the bend into another world i succeeded
-to my cost the chances against the oth-
er end of the rod being on the surface of a
planet were billions to one so it is not sur-
prising that my hand emerged into the
frightful cold of the outer space of some
other world i quickly withdrew it but
the result is as you see

klingtons lean face showed a curious
mixture of expressions as doubt struggled
with conviction parling was speaking
again while he clamped the rod and globe to
a mechanism on the table

with the aid of this vernier arrangement
i can project the bar along the fourth dimen-
sion any desired distance correct to a ten-
thousandth part of a centimeter i rigged
it up this morning in preparation of your
coming in order thoroughly to convince
you i propose we make a journey into one

of the many universes parallel to our own
is your philosophic courage equal to such
a trip

there was only one answer which a man
like klington could give to such a chal-
lenge

but how can you be sure that the world
we enter will be hospitable it is not just
necessary to land on the surface of a plan-
et it will have to be moving at about the
same rate as ours and in the same direction
or else it will be impossible to transfer from
one to the other also of course the cor-
rect atmospheric and temperature condi-
tions will have to be found

thats easily arranged nothing simp-
ler well first of all fix jie end of the
bar at a certain distance and slide a ther-
mometer along it and other instruments of
course such as a barometer a container to
get a sample of the air to be analysed and
a camera to see how far from the surface of
the planet we are that universe not being
suitable well simply alter the distance by
means of the vernier and try another shall
we start now

and so they began the hunt for a suitable
cosmos klington very soon lost the last
traces of doubt and the two men forgot all
their former antagonism in the common in-
terest of the search they became in fact
as enthusiastically excited as a couple of
schoolboys

the method adopted for projecting the
thermometer along the fourth dimension
was at once ingenious and simple a loop
of cord was passed round the rod and at-
tached to the instrument with the help of a
clcse-fitting flexible sleeve around the bar
the thermometer could easily be pushed
along it without the hands of the operator
coming in contact with the other world
since the thermometer was bound to the bar
it was forced to follow the bend into the
fourth dimension other objects were
treated similarly

in all the first few attempts the mercury
in the thermometer was frozen solid af-
ter a weeks work they found a small piece
at the end of the bar was melted clean off
apparently the last attempt had projected
it into the interior of a sun

by this time the sarcophagus had been
removed but parling secretly retained the
purple rod and globe in order to continue
the experiments

at last they discovered a world whose
temperature was quite tolerable only eight
degrees centigrade disappointment await-
ed them on analysing a sample of the atmos-
phere however an uncomfortably large
percentage of chlorine was present but
this did not deter them klington suggest-
ed obtaining gas masks with small tanks
for liquid oxygen on taking a photo with
a clockwork-shuttered camera weighted so
as to swing the lens towards the centre of
gravity of the new world a firm greyish
ground was perceived about forty feet away
with long slender black stems growing ten
feet high and five yards apart the clear-
ness of the print indicated that the ground
was almost at rest relative to our earth

having obtained a rope ladder they came
to their final difficulty the flexible bar
could not possibly bear their weight this
was overcome in the following manner

all the ladder except about a foot of one
end was projected into the outer world
the visible end of the ladder was then fast-
ened to a stout stanchion in the wall and
disengaged entirely from the bar

the vertical in the other world was in-
clined at an angle of thirty degrees to that
of the earth to transfer themselves from
one world to another all our dimension-
travellers had to do was to grasp the visible
rope of the ladder feel along it with their
hands till they came to the next invisible
rung grasp it and pull

a fortnight after their first meeting all
was ready for the journey of exploration
they intended they donned their masks
with eager haste strapped on haversacks
containing a fortnights supply of food and
also oxygen tanks and attached leaden
weights to their feet in order to counteract
the effect of the small amount of gravita-
tion in the new world

parling stood by the ladder are you
ready he enquired of klington who nod-
ded too excited for words parling fum-
bled about for a moment with invisible hands

for the invisible rung gave a tug arid van-
ished silently

after an instant of hesitation klington
followed

chapter ii
the new world

the first sensations klington experienced
were the change of direction of the puil
of his weight through an angle of thirty de-
grees and an immediate drop in tempera-
ture as he clambered down the ladder
swaying with the motions of parling below
him he became aware how necessary was
the thick coat he had brought with him
rung by rung he advanced towards a land
never trodden before by earthly feet the
chlorine gas present in the atmosphere
though not sufficiently dense to prevent dis-
tant vision gave to everything an unearthly
green tinge shortly the tops of the forest
of black stems became apparent and he ob-
served that the tip of each stem branched
off into several short and pointed spikes

a few more rungs and with a thrill of
anticipation klington stepped from the lad-
der to the ground vision was remarkably
clear except for the upper heavens which
were blotted out completely with clouds of
green

the widely separated black growths of-
fered almost no obstruction to the view
the ground was pitted with innumerable
straight deep ruts varying in width from
eight to ten feet and leading in every di-
rection where two ruts ran together there
occurred a circular pit whose depth could
not be estimated owing to the jet blackness
of the interior

some indefinable quality of strangeness
about the landscape seemed just to be elud-
ing his attention something was puzzling
him and he could not locate it something
that was entirely differentiated from any-
thing he had previously experienced his
confused mind groped as if in blindness
he turned to express his bewilderment to
parling and found him closely examining
the nearest black bole

its texture was smooth and glossy its
the world without



width a mere inch surprisingly thin for
such a length and every few seconds it
quivered gently were they plant growths
if so they had no terrestrial counterpart

parling cautiously put out his hand and
felt the velvety surface with a cry of af-
fright he recoiled suddenly but too late
the thing gave a sudden tremor and lashed
about with irresistible violence parling
was instantly flung off his feet and precipi-
tated over the edge of a circular fissure be-
hind him

klington rushed to the hole and peered
over the edge nothing was visible but he
heard a curious slithering sound-and a
despairing voice

quick klington for gods sake help
im on a kind of slippery ledge and i cant
hold on much longer

now the ladder was a hundred feet long
in case by chance this new world they had
entered moved away relatively to the earth
with great presence of mind klington flung
the loose end into the pit and held it firm
while parling clambered up none the worse
for his scare

phew what kind of a plant is that
was that a reflex action said parling
that darkness has reminded me wait
here a minute

parling climbed up the ladder and van-
ished into the world of their birth shortly
reappearing with two electric torches re-
marking that they might require them
despite all of klingtons philosophy he
could not forbear a twinge of uneasiness as
he waited along in this world of unknown
perils suppose parling prompted by their
former antagonism pulled the ladder back
into the bungalow leaving klington strand-
ed but parlings immediate return put
his thought to shame

all was now in readiness to start a tour
of exploration before they left parling
attached a large white sheet to the top por-
tion of the ladder to serve as a guide on
their return journey then from a point
half way up the ladder the surrounding land
was surveyed to determine the direction
they should take

notice anything peculiar about the hori-
zon asked parling

that was it the horizon it was that
which had been puzzling him there was
no horizon the desolate plain on which
they were situated moved upwards in front
and behind and on the right in a great con-
cave sweep-and never ended it contin-
ued on and on mounting higher until hun-
dreds of miles away it was lost to view in
the green mists of the sky only on the
extreme left was there a short semblance
of a horizon where a definite edge could be
seen this was assuredly no ordinary
planet which they were visiting there was
no sun in the heavens but a brilliant glow
on the left which lit up everything clearly
seemed to proclaim the presence of some
solar body below the brief horizon

parling discerned a mighty chain of
mountains on the right almost having
the appearance of hanging over their heads
about fifty miles away as near as could be
judged and it was towards these that they
finally decided to make their way

with their rifles and a plentiful supply
of ammunition they set off walking was
by no means difficult the fissures were
easily cleared at a step owing to the fact
that the leaden weights were insufficient
completely to supply the gravitational defi-
cit and it was simple to avoid the widely
spaced stems they covered about twelve
miles without a single mishap or an en-
counter with any inhabitant of this desolate
region and then called a halt for a meal

perhaps it should be explained that the
masks parling and klington were wearing
were quite different from the type used in
the great war they permitted free move-
ment of the mouth and were adjusted m a
moment

after a short meal the march was re-
sumed and within an hour they emerged
from the forest of black boles and found
themselves on a gently sloping plain en-
tirely free of fissures and of a much harder
though not rocky character which led di-
rectly towards the foot of the mountains

these latter far surpassed any earthly
heights and formed a tremendously awe-
inspiring spectacle composed of a dazz-
ling smooth white material they rose sheer


wonder stories

in an absolutely vertical line from the plain
to a height of at least twelve miles

imagine the confoundment of our little
terrestrials at this breath-taking revelation
consternation dismay terror admiration
seized them in turn agthey gazed upon the
glorious albous magnificence of those sharp
peaks crowned in green mists in perfect
order they stood in a straight line all of
similar shape like a line of guards shield-
ing the mysteries of the land beyond
broad at the top as at the bottom many
overlapped or were in actual contact in
parts and at most only a narrow crevice
separated them each peak was of a uni-
form width of four or five miles and seem-
ed exceedingly thin as measured in the
direction in which the travellers were go-
ing for their height

parling and klington pushed on rapidly
across the plain with burning curiosity to
discover the secret of those celestial crags
wtiat manner of world was this in which
nature was so lavish and so-regular

such was the slightness of gravity that by
the time as indicated by klingtons watch
cairo was in darkness they were but a mile
from the nearest peak speechless with as-
tonishment at the close view of the mon-
strous mass and weary with exhaustion
they struck camp on the plain and com-
posed themselves to sleep all this time
the brilliancy of the illumination had neith-
er diminished nor increased

parling was suddenly awakened by a hiss-
ing whisper from klington

parling sh lie quite still and tell
me what you hear

a moment of silence

not the slightest sound

put your ear on the ground then

yes yes a faint thudding sound

there could be no doubt about it ev-
ery thirty seconds a distinct booming noise
was heard and-was it imagination-the
ground appeared to rise and fall gently at
each noise did this portend the approach
f some unknown danger

attacked

barely had they fallen asleep again
when parling was aroused by a pecu-
liar sensation on his brow he opened his
eyes and started up in horror unable to
utter warning to klington his vocal cords
momentarily paralysed an incredible
nightmarish monster ten yards long and
with ten spidery legs on each side its head
set on a long thin arching neck was warily
feeling his head with a set of antennae eman-
ting from the place where its nose ought
to have been

parling stumbled over klington instant-
ly awakening him obtained his rifle and
fired haphazardly the stygian beast im-
mediately turned and galloped with tremen-
dous velocity towards a crevice between two
mountains and vanished the two men
gaped for a full minute before recovering
their wits then klington spoke shakily

well thats the first sample of other-
world animal life weve had and if the rest
are like that we shant have to protract our
visit too long

after that one watched while the other
slept the lack of fuel was much regret-
ted for the cold seemed more intense when
lying still

at six a m cairo time they prepared to
set off once more parling stood up and
faced klington

we have a choice before us he said
we can either return at once to the ladder
or continue to the other side of the barrier
through the crevice where we will meet
heaven knows what perils for myself i
am extremely curious to discover what lies
behind that white wall but seeing that the
object of our expedition is accomplished
namely that you are thoroughly convinced
of the truth of my theory i am quite will-
ing to retrace our steps if you do not care
to proeeed

klingtons answer was brief and to the
point

i move that we push on at once he
said calmly

that settled the question in a few min-
utes they were at the foot of the nearest
mountain and examining with great wonder
the world without



the smooth polished surface thereon the
wildest imaginings filled the brains as they
surveyed the colossal structure

surely this must be artificial said
parling in an awed tone as klington tested
its hardness by kicking it

an artificial barrier ten miles high is
quite incredible retorted klington

nevertheless we have seen many incred-
ible things in the last few hours it is my
opinion that on the other side we shall find
the builders of this wall think what a
tremendous degree of civilisation they must
possess for their engineers to construct such
a huge barrier

before he could theorize further the two
were fighting for their lives a horde of
creatures similar to the one previously seen
were rushing down upon them from the
mountain pass useless to flee-they were
galloping along at over two hundred miles
an hour the terror of despair gripped the
hearts of the terrestrials as they fired into
the midst of the advancing mass as if by
magic the leviathans instantly dispersed to
all sides and sought shelter it was ap-
parently the sound of the explosions that
they could not withstand

frequently in their journey through the
pass the travellers were attacked by these
horrible denizens of the mountains but
noise never failed to frighten them off

the way through the pass was rough and
difficult often parling and klington
could barely scrape through between the two
crag-side the path moreover was steep
and rose to an elevation of several hundred
feet about half-way and descended as steep-
ly on the other side if it were not for the
advantage of lesser gravity they could never
have performed the feat as it was over
five hours were required to pierce to the
other side the latter portion of the jour-
ney was beset with dangers owing to the
increasing slipperiness and unevenness of
the road

then at last their arduous trouble was
rewarded they safely maneuvered a tor-
tuous gully wedged themselves through a
narrow cleft and came in sight of the con-
cealed domain behind the barrier

chapter iii
where red ruled

the most striking thing about this new
territory was the fact that every object
in it except the cliffs behind was red a
great red plain stretched before the daring
terrestrials traversed by numerous folds
and covered with a low red bushy vegeta-
tion in which swarmed a myriad forms of
almost microscopic life not unlike mundane
insects-but all red each step they took
a squelching noise and a red viscous ooze
emerged in slow trickles from beneath the
vegetation several miles away from the
cliffs the land appeared to be in deep dark-
ness

of parlings anticipated mighty civilisa-
tion and great engineers there was to his
keen disappointment not a single sign
he still hoped however that they might
live underground or else how to explain
the regular beating sound they had heard
on the grey plain apparently emerging
from the bowels of the earth

while parling was cogitating thus kling-
ton suddenly became alarmed and seizing
his pair of binoculars he stared intently
through them vertically upwards at the
green sky

parling look straight up he said tense-
ly theres a vast white thing falling
through the green clouds

parling extremely startled looked up al-
so were his senses playing him tricks
had his mind given way under the strain
of the recently uncanny happenings if so
how did it come about that klingtons illu-
sion was the same as his the appearance
took the form of a line of huge white cliffs
hanging upside-down in the sky at least
fifty miles away and falling straight tow-
ards those other cliffs below which they so
greatly resembled he was also conscious
that the illumination which up to now had
remained steady was gradually fading
what could this new development mean
were they to be plunged into darkness and
crushed helplessly beneath countless tons of
rock and where was the rock falling
from a sudden fantastic thought enter-


wonder stories

ed his tortured mind almost too bizarre for
utterance

klington gasped parling seizing him
fiercely by the arm and slowly pointing
upward with the gestures of a fanatic
klington it is as if-as if a colossal mirror
were falling above our heads and what we
are seeing is the reflection of the while
ranges we have just passed through

indeed klington readily imagined that
one was the reflection of the other so alike
were they in every visible detail all at
once he sprang to life come he said
and spun parling round we have no time
to lose if the apparition is really a rock
falling from an immense height it will take
over an hour to reach the ground we re-
quired five hours to pierce the pass to re-
turn is therefore foolhardy only one way
lies open to us and that is directly across
this red plain away from the mountains
it is our only hope of life we must flee
as far as possible from here before the catas-
trophe occurs come

and the two dispensed with some of their
leaden weights and began to run across the
red ooze in mighty leaps of fifty yards each
the seeming utter impossibility of what
they had witnessed had staggered their
minds all logical connected thinking
ceased a dull apathy settled upon them and
only the motor centre of their brains kept
their leg muscles in feverish activity on-
ward they progressed in herculean strides
they did not even dare stop for meals but
ate as they ran

no word but only unpleasant squelching
sounds broke the silence they reserved all
their breath for running ever the light
continue to fade ever they approached the
dark shadows of the farther side of the
plain but what was the use of their
flight such a mass crashing down from
the skies would shake the whole planet to
its very foundation anything was better
than inactivity to stand still and watch an
awful doom approaching would have been
inviting madness often klington and
parling wondered if they were not already
insane and undergoing illusions rivalling
those of an opium dream

suddenly they were both flung on
their faces by a terrible continuous
cracking noise interspersed with frightful
peals of thunder as if thor were splitting
the earth in twain with his hammer they
were unable to do anything but cling hard
to the vegetation and stare at the monstro-
sity in the heavens while the medley of
sounds accompanied by a terrific blast of
hot air swept over them had the falling
rock at last reached the ground but no
they goggled in their amazement the line
of rocks now only half a mile from the
topmost peaks were no longer accelerating
but were actually slowing down their
speed now was reduced to not more than a
few feet a second

whence then came the awful sound and
the wind the last vestige of reality left
the scene as the lone human beings stared
about with frightened eyes and failed to per-
ceive the origin of the dread tumult there
was a vague mass faintly in sight far away
to the left and shadowy outlines above in
the skies indicated something huge like a
canopy as if supporting the suspended rocks
the light now reduced to a mere dim twi-
light gave them no cheer they had been
saved for the nonce by a miracle so incredi-
ble that their benumbed wits had not as yet
even realised the situation

then as suddenly as it had begun the
deafening din ceased but the warm blast
continued blowing without noise and left
the world once more a wilderness of si-
lence the men staggered to their feet and
found that they were just within the region
of dense shadow they had perceived before
seeing that all immediate danger was ap-
parently over they decided to recuperate
their fatigued bodies with sleep and food

parling was the first to awake while
his fellow-voyager slept on he occupied
himself in throwing away an empty oxygen
tank and replacing it with a full one

an unexpected peril

klington was aroused from his deep
sleep by a light touch on his shoulder
he opened his eyes stared upwards at parl-
ing and grunted interrogatively parling
the world without



had unconsciously assumed the old familiar
attitude legs stiffly apart like a statue his
arm outstretched pointed over klington in
the direction of the white mountain-chain
look he whispered the other slowly
got up and turned around the two simply
stood and watched absolutely incapable of
further wonderment while the new danger
rapidly advanced

a wall of some liquid apparently water
at least a mile high and so long that it
stretched out of sight on either hand was
bearing down upon them with the velocity
of a tidal wave with one accord they
turned and fled into the darkness

they soon found themselves going steep-
ly downhill and it became so black that it
was necessary to use the torches the lat-
ter saved them from countless mishaps as
they sped through the gloom in gigantic
leaps their velocity was now almost
equal to that of the oncoming wave but how
long would it be before they tired and their
doom overtook them they were now
practically falling down the precipitous
grade and making good progress but while
the slope no doubt aided them it also
speeded the water behind them the swish-
ing and roaring of its passage had just be-
come audible when the ground suddenly
smoothed otit to a gentler slope

gasping for breath they raced on side by
side and ever as one stumbled the other
tarried to help him up after many weary
miles were covered in this manner their
overworked muscles were forced to slow
down not so the waters however which
inexorably swept on the latter could no
longer be seen owing to the dense black-
ness but their nearness was easily judged
by the increasing noise they made dully
klington and parling realised that their ad-
venture was at an end and their story would
never reach the world

rut wait klington had an inspiration
parling he sobbed almost incoherently
turn the oxygen regulator throttle full on

no sooner had they done so when renewed
life flowed through their veins they felt
rejuvenated intoxicated once more they
struggled onward with the roar of the wa-

ters always present in their ears like mon-
strous grasshoppers advancing inexorably

the respite was brief however for a
time it worked well but the extra flow of
the life-giving fluid used up their energy
at an enormously increased rate with the
result that after a short interval of super-
human activity they fell inert to the ground
utterly exhausted nothing now could pos-
sible save them it appeared as they lay
groaning in the oozing vegetation waiting
hopelessly for the end they became once
more conscious of that regular booming
sound emerging from the bowels of the
earth which they had remarked before but
now at a greatly increased volume

and now the mighty swirl of waters was
upon them and all wild speculations as to
help from the originators of the mysterious
beating were engulfed in the lashing fury
of the wave up up it swept them right
to the top of its lofty crest klington
feebly trying to float on the smoother up-
per surface felt himself borne along irre-
sistibly whither his torch was still firm-
ly grasped in his hand as the drowning
man is supposed to clutch the straw and
the ray inadvertently fell upon parling a
few feet away

klington could barely credit his senses
surely the weird effect of the solitary gleam
playing about in a sea of darkness com-
bined with the fatigue of his faculties was
deluding him with an effort he swung
the torch round until it again illuminated
the figure of parling no it was impos-
sible impossible he was reminded of the
days of his far-off childhood when the old
bible tales of long ago were related to him

for an amazing miracle was being enact-
ed before his very eyes parling who ap-
peared quite as startled as himself was ac-
tually-walking the waters klingtons
blood ran colj as he turned his attention
to himself and realised that so far he had
never yet been submerged in fact he wa
merely lying on the surface as naturally as
one lying on a couch he stood up and be-
gan to walk towards parling

imagine if you may the amazement of
that incredible meeting these two who
had never expected to see each other again


wonder stories

in the flesh had once more been saved in a
miraculous fashion

they walked to each other shook hands
and grinned in delighted astonishment
then it was noticed that the water gave way
a little under their feet but that the surface
was not even broken it was as if a tight
impenetrable skin was stretched over the
entire seething liquid

it was comparatively quiet up here so
far above the noisy tumult where the water
came in contact with the ground and con-
versation was unrestricted the inklings of
a great idea had come to parling when first
the wave swept him up in its embrace and
now he became wildly excited whooped
with joy and slapped klington on the
shoulder so that he fell flat for it was a
difficult task to keep ones feet on the smooth
skin-surface  have it  have it he
cried in tones suggestive of a man who has
suddenly solved an almost insoluble prob-
lem

have what enquired klington rather
annoyed at his companions unaccountable
exuberance

parling calmed down somewhat then said
grandiloquently with all your philosophy
you have no doubt been unable to see the ex-
planation of all the mysterious occurrences
which we have recently undergone

klington assented bewilderedly

ah klington it must be due to bad
training in your youth your philosopher-
masters have told you that everything is re-
lative and you believed them but such is
your mind that you are unable to apply it in
even simple cases klington it requires
the mind of a mathematician to do that
my explanation at once elementary and
logical embraces everything from the black
forest to the flood which now carries us
along and if it is true tfien it also indi-
cates another danger ahead far more ter-
rible than the ones we have yet exper-
ienced- and parling stopped for a mo-
ment and peered into the gloom ahead

before he could say another word before
the astonished klington could utter a single
question the surface of the water tilted and
assumed an angle so steep that it was no

longer possible to remain upright kling-
ton and parling instantly were upset upon
their backs and began glissading down to a
fate that was at least to klington unknown

they had no time to remark upon this
frightful contretemps it was as much as
they could do to keep their feet foremost
but extinction was not yet to be theirs
the waters swept round a gradual curvelo
the left ever steepening but the terrestrials
since they were not actually immersed in
the fluid did not partake of its friction and
hence careened on in a straight line owing
to their own inertia in the direction of the
tangent they were crushed with stagger-
ing force against a rocky rough mass-the
first elevated land they had encountered
since leaving the albous mountains-jutting
up out of the water to a considerable
height

with the energy born of despair they
clung with all their weight to the slightest
projections the island afforded and kling-
ton with great difficulty managed to haul
himself upon a narrow ledge in the process
dropping his lamp which was instantly
swept away in the current

parlings torch however indicated the
precarious position of his companion who
had obtained a grip on the ledge but could
not pull himself up klington carefully
made his way along the ledge bent over
and removed the torch from parlings grasp
placed it in a cranny so that it shone upon
parling and heaved him out

a few feet further on the ledge abruptly
terminated so they were obliged to walk
along it in the other direction not far
however had they progressed when they
were forced to stop an impassable wall
blocked the way and they stood helplessly
flashing the torch around yet there was
still a hope the beam revealed no passage
round the obstruction but about twelve feet
ahove their heads the ledge seemed to con-
tinue

klington the lighter of the two climbed
upon parlings shoulders and thus enabled
him to reach the upper ledge it was then
an easy matter to help parling up the rock-
face the new ledge sloped steeply up-
wards and the slipperiness and narrowness
the world without



of the path made it extremely difficult to
walk for an eternity they plodded on-
wards in silence broken only by a discon-
certing gurgling sound that became louder
and louder as they mounted

the path took a sharp turn to the left fol-
lowing the contour of the island and the
travellers weary and hungry found them-
selves on a wide platform surrounded by
rock on three sides and having blank space
on the other klington and parling shud-
dered with horror as a flash of the light
revealed a ghastly pit of unestimable depth
into which the waters plunged in the form
of a vast whirlpool originating the gurg-
ling noise but for the timely interven-
tion of this island they would now be lost
in its depths

as i thought just as i thought said
parling gazing into the abyss

chapter iv
an explanation and a tragedy

when the terrestrials had made them-
selves as comfortable as possible on
the rock-bound square and partaken of food
they slept for some six hours parling
refused to say a word until he had rested
as for klington his mind was in a whirl at
the anticipated explanation had parling
really the solution to all the peculiar pheno-
mena which they had seen-the lack of
horizon the sensitive black boles the inter-
lacing regular furrows the unchanging il-
lumination the abrupt and orderly white
mountains the hideous denizens of the pass
the strange underground beating with its
accompanying quake the plain where ev-
erything was red the falling rocks which
never reached the ground and lastly this
turbulent sea sprung from nowhere-or
were the hints he had thrown out merely the
gibberings of a maniac

in the morning or rather when he awoke
he was agreeably surprised to find that the
lamp was now unnecessary the light
though faint was good enough to enable
him to perceive nearby objects he
aroused parling and after they had eaten

he immediately enquired of that which he
was intensely curious to know

it is really very simple said parling
in fact almost obvious at least to a dis-
cerning intellect like mine

klington was much too interested to par-
ry and parling went on

the key to the mystery lies in this-we
are not on a planet at all

an exclamation escaped from klington
parling rose up and stood on the edge his
back to the gulf in his favorite attitude of
emulation of the rhodian colossus he was
the triumphant man now

wo he said dramatically we are not
upon a planet-but on the skin of a mon-
strous gargantuan animal is it not ob-
vious we landed on the lip of the beast
where sensitive stems no doubt were analo-
gous to down in our world and travelled
down to one side of the lip there was no
horizon almost on every side because we
were on the slope nearest the mouth and
the ground curved upwards all around un-
til it was out of sight you can understand
that at least

the mountains we encountered kling-
ton were indubitably teetk and i suppose
the large swift-footed organisms we met
there can be likened to the bacteria in our
own teeth which cause decay if not removed
by toothpaste well we journeyed between
two of the teeth of the monster and thus
entered its mouth time and space seem
both to be greater in this universe than in
ours for the heart-beats we heard were quite
slow

the similarity between the creature and
humanity is so great that the interior of its-
mouth is red as we saw the sea that swept
us here is of course merely saliva and
the cracking sound we heard during the gale
must have been some tit-bit the monster was
crunching at the other end of its mouth
we shall soon see it

but how do you explain the miracle of
walking on the waters interposed kling-
ton excitedly

i dont quite understand that said
parling slowly as if unwilling to divulge
any flaw in his theory

they fell silent for a moment klington


wonder stories

was reflecting deeply suddenly his face
lit up ive got it he cried

why its quite obvious and is a strong
corroboration of your idea

it was now parlings turn to be con-
fused indeed he said

yes said klington it was due to sur-
face tension have you ever seen a micro-
photograph of a fly crawling on the surface
of a stream the surface tension common
to all fluids gives the appearance of a tight
elastic skin stretched over the water-just
the effect we observed compared to this
brobdingnagian animal we were much less
than any insect the phenomenon is not
due of ceurse to the large volume of liquid
present-or else no boat on an ocean could
ever sink on our earth-but to the fact that
the molecules themselves composing the
saliva are correspondingly bigger than
earthly molecules

parling was pleased at this support
of his theory

the philosophers mind he said can
lead on to fresh facts once the mathemati-
cian has shown the way

the apparently falling rocks which
caused us to depart in such a hurry as i
suppose you have guessed by now were
none other than the upper set of teeth of
the monster

parling turned around and pointed to the
tremendous hole below him

and this klington is undoubtedly the
creatures throat think of it man think
of it it must be at least five hundred
miles deep

then swift and sure on the heels of this
statement came death the island which
had stood them in such good stead gave a
sudden spasmodic twitch as if revolting at
the thought of these presumptuous and dar-
ing mortals from another world with a
terrible despairing cry parling who had
been standing on the very edge toppled
over hands madly clutching at empty space
and vanished into the boiling maelstrom

klington was flung against the hard side-
wall and knocked unconscious by the shock
when his senses revived the light was as
bright as day no doubt the monster was

again opening its mouth for several min-
utes he lay dully while slow realisation
came to him of the loss of his companion
and of the fact that he was now absolutely
alone in a strange world aye imprisoned
in the jaws of a nightmare animal

how long he remained there he had no
means of telling for his watch had stopped
at the impact many times the island was
shaken by spasms but none so violent as
the first he kept as near to the inner wall
as possible in fear of sharing the fate of
the unfortunate parling then came the
dread moment when he fitted the last oxy-
gen cylinder to the breathing tube and still
the waters had not subsided he remember-
ed parlings haversack which lay where
parling had had his last sleep to his joy
it contained a plentiful supply of the essen-
tial cylinders at that instant the roaring
of the waters ceased and he went to the
brink and looked over the whirlpool was
now reduced to a mere trickle it was nec-
essary to go at once before a second deluge
appeared

klington fastened his haversack replen-
ishing his diminished supplies with those of
parling and climbing down the narrow
ledge jumped up to the floor of the mouth
he had gone but half a mile up the slope
towards the white barrier far away in the
distance when a fresh surprise greeted him
the ground curved upwards much steeper
than he had observed it before to a height
of several miles and ran flat for a time un-
til it encountered the tops of the white moun-
tains 

he could not imagine what had occurred
for a considerable period then it came to
him in a flash the monster had merely
raised its tongue the tip of which was now
resting on its teeth

it was no good climbing to the top of the
teeth so he made a detour to the left in
which direction he thought lay the nearest
edge of the tongue

after a journey of many miles he came
at last to the edge clambered down the
rough side and stood upon the mouth-floor
proper he continued along the five-mile
wide channel between the cheek and the
tongue until he came to the teeth the
the world without



short journey over in the pass between two
of them where he encountered the usual
microbe-like creatures he stood on the clear
plain which alone separated him from the
vicinity of the one link with the earth

klington raised a powerful pair of pris-
matic binoculars to his eyes and scanned
the forest of black stems for the white sheet
which indicated the position of the ladder
imagine his horror and dismay when it was
nowhere to be seen-for half an hour he
searched while a cold tightening grip at his
heart made itself more and more felt

then to his great surprise his attention
was attracted upwards with an unpleasant
jolt he perceived that some chance move-
ment of the beast which bore him had
caused the ladder to ascend to a height of
four or five miles it was also much near-
er than before he could even make out
the end of the rod beside the rope laddeif
and the sheet what a terrible predicament
he was in hope seemed lost as he gazed
with hungry eyes at the precious connection
to his world

desperate moments

it was moving so quickly that he could
just perceive its motion it was almost
half way between its former site and the
nearest tooth a faint hope surged in his
breast it was his only chance for life for
soon the last of the oxygen would be utili-
zed if the motion continued in that di-
rection the ladder would shortly be close
to the peak of the tooth instantly for no
time was to be lost he flung away much of
his provisions and all the leaden weights
retaining however the remaining cylinders
and returned through the gap in huge hops

without a pause he trekked alongside the
tongue until it was near enough to the
ground to make the ascent practicable
without daring to delay for meals on he
climbed up the steep difficult slope of the
lower portion of the tongue until he ar-
rived at the flatter upper portion here
going was much facilitated but he djd not
relax his efforts and by exercising hid will-
power to the utmost he forced his tired
limbs toward the tip of the tongue

while down in the pass below he had

noted the tooth towards which the ladder
was moving and counted how many teeth
lay between it and the end of the row with
this to guide him he hurried on hunger
now added to the fatigue

within five hundred yards of the tip he
paused and flung himself prostrate with a
cry of despair the tongue had been slow-
ly contracting and arching upwards and
now the tip was a good eight hundred yards
from the opposite peak as if in mockery
there dangled the ladder above the tooth
just within reach of a vertical jump by
the time the ladder passed over the tongue
it would be too high

klington stood up with sudden firm re-
solve there was but one thing to do
casting away his haversack he ran to the
very tip and flung himself bodily through
the air in a mighty attempt to span the gap

the feat was by no means impossible
but there was a large element of risk for a
man in klingtons weakened state despite
the slight gravity up up he rose to the top
of the parabola and then began to fall with
a slow acceleration his mind reeled at
the thought of the terrible gulf of twelve
miles which lay below him but he deter-
mined not to look downward

presently his heart froze with horror as
he realized that he could never attain the
opposite side his weary limbs had failed
him at the last he would fall short by
about three yards a small distance true
but as good as infinity in his present con-
dition

he had but two or three seconds in which
to consider the position before he passed
below the level of the opposing brink his
subconscious mind or subliminal ego
unknown to himself was working with light-
ning rapidity

suddenly there flashed into his conscious
mind two facts which he had learned when
a schoolboy projectiles have the maxi-
mum range when they leave the mouth of
the gun at an angle of forty-five degrees to
the horizontal was the first and the sec-
ond was the principal of the goddard rock-

what has gone before

george marlaml meets an old college instructor barton
wiley and on resuming their friendship marland dis
covers that wiley has found the secret for nullifying
gravity they build an experimental ship and with the
succcss of the material they obtain support for the
building of a spae ship they travel to the moon and
discover on this dead world some queer phenomena
which point to the presence of an illuminated lunar
satellite travelling over the moon to investigate it
they run across a cone shaped ship which flashes a rag
against them and stuns them they awaken to find
themselves in the hands of a colony of human beings
who are living on the moon the colony is presided
over by a dr forscher who is a super-scientist the
two explorers are given to understand that they are
guests of the colony-whose purpose they cannot
discover-until they meet- and talk with forscher
the colony lives beneath the moons surface but by the
genius of forscher they have all he advantages of
food sunlight etc as they could hare on the earth
surface with thevr guide a doctor langley the two
explorers are invited to travel on one of th cone
ships called tractors on a tour of inspection of one of
the air plants whose machinery has brcken down the

tractors they learn are propelled by synthiuip another
of the products of dr forschers genius

meeting forscher the iwo explorers learn that he has
established the outpost in order to investigate a queer
bombardment of sulphur particles that occurred on
earth many years ago from investigations he had
deduced that the bombardment originated in the neigh-
borhood of ganymede satellite of jupiter and he be-
lieved that  was either a threat to the rarth or the
effort of sentient beings there to communicate with us

marland returns to earth lo enlist for the outpost
the aid of a noted astrtiomer to operate the giant
telescope on the moon for observations on ganymede
marland induces quaile to return with him to the
moon where after a number of observations quaile
deduces that ganymede is able to support human life

under the command of marland an expedition sets
out to ganymede in a specially built tractor to explore
that world and establish communication with any
life that may exist there his crew consists of dr
 von fichten dr ernst m lafourchette and mr
dalton after some exciting experiences in space with
meteors they find themselves nearing the giant jupiter
and its puny satellites

this story began in the december  issue

the outpost
on the



moon


they rushed in hot pursuit firing darts dalton whirled and emptied

the magazine of his automatic

now go on with the story

i continued to watch through the peri-
scope for the remainder of my turn be-
tween looks at the instiument board the
difficulties from the magnetic field were de-
creasing rapidly and we were now nearly
half a million miles from jupiter there
remained about three hundred thousand to
cover which would lake the next eighteen
hours dalton was as delighted as  with
the view of the heavens and remarked on the
appearance of this or that body from time
to time during his watch the fifth of jupi-
ters moons in order of discovery a little
globe which revolves close to the surface at
an amazingly rapid rate came into view
its tiny disc peeping around the crescent of
the giant planets illuminated surface

when at length we turned over the engine-
room to von lichten and ernst and climbed

to the living quarters we found lafourchette
cleaning and loading a huge automatic
what is that for demanded dalton

i am prepared said lafourchette wav-
ing the gun dramatically i alone had the
toresight to bring means of protection if
we are attacked by the gatiymedians it is i
who will save you dalton snorted

a fine attitude for an interplanetary am-
bassador he exclaimed what if they
should attack us they must be as big as
elephants they could carry cannons around
with them

as big as elephants indeed retorted
lafourchette is not their world smaller
than the earth and will they not be smal-
ler than ourselves in proportion

not at all not at all ejaculated dal-
ton i weighed one hundred and eighty




wonder stories

pounds on earth here i will weigh only
thirty-six pounds if they are to weigh one
hundred and eighty they must be five times
as large as i

and who says they are to weigh one hun-
dred and eighty pounds exclaimed la-
fourchette they do
not fatten themselves
like hogs

certainly they are
too intelligent to starve
themselves down to
your weight return-
ed dalton i felt that
the discussion was be-
coming too personal
so i took a hand

what is the use of
idle speculation i
asked when in a few
hours we can see for
ourselves what they
are like we must not
be surprised if they re-
semble nothing we
have ever seen i
would advise too that
we be as peaceable as
possible with them
for we are here to un-
derstand them not to
conquer them

nevertheless i shall
have my pistol handy
said lafourchette

to prevent further
bickering i suggested
that we inspect the air-
envelopes and have
them ready when we
wished to leave the
machine we charged
the oxygen-producing
apparatus of each
tested them for air-
tightness adjusted the
microphones which
were to bring us the sounds from outside
washed the glass of the helmets and hung
them on the well near the air-lock this
occupied most of the next eight hours at

the end of which it was time for lafour-
chette to take his post at the instruments

dalton had stood the last watch with him
so it was now my turn for with only five
of us in the crew someone must stand an
extra trick once in a while we took fre-
quent glances through
the periscope at gany-
mede now only a few
thousand miles away
an unbroken stretch
of clouds covered the
surface hiding  the
configuration of the
ground from view
there was no way of
knowing what we
would find below
them we could not
pick a landing-point
so we headed for the
center of the disc hop-
ing to learn something
of the terrain after we
had passed through
the atmosphere

at the end of the
watch our speed was
reduced to about three
miles per second we
were so close that i de-
cided to remain on
duty for we would
soon enter the atmos-
phere and i preferred
to guide the comet to
its landing place

i shut off the driver
entirely and let the
machine coast along
under its own mo-
mentum the cloud
bank drew nearer min-
ute by minute the hor-
izon spread away to
 right and left and in
all directions an hour
passed and we were less than a thousand
miles away i swung into position the di-
minutive wings which would serve to steer
us like a dirigible through the atmosphere

 rt he climax of this ex- 
citing story must come
as a surprise to everyone
no one could have read
the preceding installments
and not be aroused to a
high pitch of curiosity and
intensity of interest we
know that in jupiters
satellite little ganymede
there exists a mystery
whose solution may mean
tragedy and destruction or
possibly the reverse for the
people of the earth

our expedition to gany-
mede must face all those
dangers of contact with a
strange race that any in-
terplanetary expedition
must chance there is no
knowledge in advance of
how the race lives and
thinks and feels we can
be sure that in order to
establish mental communi-
cation with them we will
need the most intense ap-
plication of our wisdom
shrewdness and tact when
two strange species meet
there is needed only the
minutest show of hostility
or misunderstanding in or-
der to erase forever the
possibilities of peaceful in-
tercourse

this story as an example
of the practical problems
that whl face an inter-
planetary expedition is al-
smost a classic
the outpost on the moon



as the seconds passed i watched the acceler-
ation indicator for the first sign of any
drag several times i felt sure that we were
slowing down but the indicator was un-
moved then at last it crept up curving
into a more rapid rise i turned the for-
ward wings at a slight angle the comet
swung horizontal with a sharp thrust as they
caught the rush of wind while in the peri-
scopes field the cloud bank wheeled dizzi-
ly i leveled off and headed downward
slightly letting the friction of the air re-
tard us

even at this height which i estimated at
a hundred miles our barometer indicated
six millimeters pressure of atmosphere on
this world because of the
slight pull of gravity a
given volume of air
weighed only one-fifth as
much as on earth conse-
quently the density would
ncrease only one-fifth as
fast as we descended
and we might expect to
find an atmosphere about
half as dense as the
earths at the surface

first experiences

e drifted ap-
proaching die cloud
bank beneath us and los-
ing headway rapidly

the machine warmed up
a little at first but i kept it high enough so
that the thin air would not heat it danger-
ously we drew near the clouds then dip-
ped into their upper limits and were en-
gulfed in a sea of gray-white vapor it grew
darker as the layer above us cut off more
and more of the pale sunlight i wondered
whether the mist extended clear to the
ground if so we might suddenly crash into
a mountain  had about decided to head
up again until we stopped when we burst
through the under side of the clouds and
ganymedes surface lay in a vast panorama
below us on all sides as far as i could
see in the gathering darkness lay a body of
water a dark forbidding sea there was

no guessing at its depth or extent but at
least it offered a perfect landing place 
nosed down more steeply opening the grav-
ity screen a crack to counteract the buoy-
ancy of our weightless space-ship

we fell at a steep angle toward the wa-
ter it became increasingly difficult to see
and i wondered at the darkness we were
well below the clouds the light should be
as strong here as at their level i recalled
my view of the heavens several hours be-
fore the thin crescent of jupiter the sun
close by him ganymede almost opposite-
of course an eclipse the satellite passed
into jupiters great shadow for a few hours
once in each revolution with the unvarying
regularity of all celestial
things and this fact had
helped navigators to de-
termine the time and lo-
cate their position for
years we had chosen
the hour of eclipse to ar-
rive the face of the sun
was being rapidly ob-
scured by jupiter and
unless we landed soon we
would find ourselves in
total darkness

i hastened our descent
as much as possible
when we were within a
few yards of the water i
leveled out opened the
gravity screens wider and
we settled like a seaplane
on the waves skipping over their crests as
we lost speed then coming to rest on the
long smooth swell just as the satellite was
shrouded in darkness

despite the fact that iot a few hours
there would be nothing to see we donned
our air-envelopes with one accord and
hastened outside the ship lighting our way
with pocket flash-lamps the comet rested
easily on the surface of the water rising and
falling with the long lazy swell all about
us was the intense blackness of a cloudy
night lighted by neither moon nor stars
the waves were unruffled by the slightest
breeze we walked from end to end of the
slippery hull glad for even this liberty

wonder stories

lafourchette eager to begin gathering
data on ganymedes weather conditions
had brought a thermometer which he fasten-
ed to a string and dropped into the for-
bidding water dr von lichten took samples
of it for analysis to determine whether it
was fit to drink of course under no cir-
cumstances would we touch it until it had
been boiled but we would be glad of the
opportunity to recharge our tanks and in-
sure an ample supply for the return journey

a shout of laughter from dalton attracted
our attention lafourchette was staring in
dismay at the end of his string from which
the thermometer had been neatly bitten

our friend has taken to fishing roared
dalton

the monster stormed lafourchette
the unspeakable pig to swallow my best
thermometer i hope he gets indigestion

our merriment at his expense was tinged
with other reflections however this posi-
tive indication that the little world harbored
living creatures was gratifying but what
sort of fearless denizens dwelt beneath the
surface of this murky sea and what un-
tamed terrors might inhabit the land be-
side the people we had come to seek the
same vague doubts lingered in the minds
of all of us instinctively drawing us to-
gether as though for protection the inky
darkness was not conducive to high spirits
and presently we retired below to await the
termination of the eclipse before permit-
thing us to enter dr von lichten insisted
on spraying the air-envelopes with disin-
fectant in order to kill any germs which
might have settled on them this was a
tedious procedure but wise for we had no
knowledge of the bacteria of ganymede

when the first streak of gray appeared
overhead we got the comet under
way skimming above the water in search
of the shore line since we had no idea
which way to turn we arbitrarily chose the
north and held our course for upwards of
an hour before i spied a hazy line on the
horizon which quickly resolved itself into
a smah island we steered close to it fly-
ing low but a few minutes scrutiny suf-
ficed to show that it was a barren stump of

rock a volcanic peak upthrust from the
ocean bed as we continued our way we
sighted another larger and still another
presently we were skimming over a maze
of islets of increasing size some covered with
dark mossy vegetation excited comments
burst from the scientists peering through the
forward portholes

suddenly lafourchette uttered a shout
pointing ahead of us

another thermometer-eater asked dal-
ton 

no cried lafourchette a huge
bird a flying monster its coming to-
ward us its going to attack us

i turned my periscope and saw an im-
mense ungainly creature in the act of
alighting on our prow it suggested some-
what a monoplane come to life and en-
dowed with savage ferocity there was a
long gray-black body torpedo-shaped and
scaly beginning in a prodigious mouth
armed with double rows of dagger-like teeth
and extending without any semblance of
neck to a four-vaned tail like that of an
airplane underneath were four stubby
legs with which the creature tried vainly
to gain a foothold on the surface of our
machine thrashing its twenty-foot wings
madly spying the periscope it made a
rush for the projecting tube jaws agape i
cringed from the spectacle of that huge
maw seemingly bent on swallowing me
alive the comet quivered at the impact
of the gigantic body as it tried to wrench
the periscope loose then angered at its
inability to dent the shining surface it cir-
cled about us above and below keeping
pace with our swift flight i put on more
speed and the creature dropped behind
plunging into the blazing gas-discharge we
saw no more of it without a doubt it had
been incinerated alive by the tewific heat

whew exclaimed dalton i hope
that wasnt the reception committee of the
ganymedians for my part however his
jest fell on unreceptive ears the spectacle
of that horrible mouth was too fresh in my
memory

we flew on in silence for another fifteen
minutes the islands became larger and
more frequent while in the distance ahead
the outpost on the moon



of us appeared a dim line of unbroken shore
extending to the horizon i slowed the ma-
chine down watching for signs of civilized
life presently i sighted a break in the dark
vegetation on one of the large islands near
the shore a patch of lighter color steering
closer it resolved itself into rows of dwell-
ings of some sort nearly circular as seen
from above and apparently built of stone
without question it was a village designed
by intelligent reasoning minds i headed
for it shutting off the power and dropping
into the water close to the nearest of the
stone buildings the tractor drifted toward
land grounding gently on a shelving muddy
beach

no one made the first move to go outside
we remained at our vantage points i look-
ing through the periscope and the others
out the windows there was apparently no
doorway to the building before us it pre-
sented a regular stone wall roughly circular
and pierced here and there by narrow open-
ings suggesting the windows of medieval
castles the inhabitants if there were any
were either unaware of our arrival or sus-
picious of us we waited some time for
them to put in an appearance but saw no-
thing

shall we go outside asked ernst at
length it may be that the creatures take
the comet for some sort of animal

his suggestion appeared logical we put
on our envelopes and went out looking
warily around for signs of other flying
creatures i led the way stepping gingerly
onto the oozing beach and we approached
the stone building we were within ten
yards of it when we saw an unmistakable
movement behind one of the window-like
apertures the next instant there was a
hair-raising shriek followed by a bedlam
of indescribable sounds suggesting the
cries of a multitude of beasts in awful tor-
ment

stand still directed ernst well on-
ly alarm them by moving perhaps if we
wait theyll come out

the noises died down gradually giving
place to low rumbles now and then inter-
spersed with another note-inarticulate yet
with a rising inflection as if in question

theyre talking it over said ernst in
a stage whisper we continued to stand
motionless while the rumbling went on
suddenly we saw the ground apparently
rising up in front of one of the buildings
a trap door leading underground was being
pushed open from beneath it rose to a
vertical position and from behind it
stepped a ganymedian

chapter xiv

a reception committee

there could be no doubt that the crea-
ture standing before us was a rational
being despite its fantastic appearance a
walking carrot-a fish on stilts-but no
simile can describe the apparition which
met our astonished gaze on the large end
of the body which faced toward us a
broad wicked mouth and two enormous
eyes represented a face which nevertheless
lacked any suggestion of a nose the head
joined directly to a tapering body slanted
downward toward the rear two pairs of
legs as poorly matched as those of a giraffe
raised the creature on skinny supports to
a height of five feet at its forward end be-
hind the head where there should have
been a neck and shoulders projected some-
thing like a pair of arms jointed at the
center and again near the ends here they
divided into tentacle-like fingers several
inches in length the arms must have meas-
ured fully four feet from body to tip save
for a belt about its midsection the creature
was unprotected by clothing or fur expos-
ing a shiny slate-gray skin to the weather
in its left hand it carried a weapon which
i judged to be a sort of rifle it consisted
of a bright metal tube a couple of feet
long fastened to a cylindrical chamber sev-
eral inches in diameter the creature
grasped the weapon in its skinny tentacles
half raising it as though in doubt whether
to turn it on us

ernst slowly raised his hands over his
head in a gesture of peace but the gany-
median evidently did not understand for
it levelled the weapon lafourchette reached
for his pistol but he was too slow the


wonder stories

barrel was trained on him in the twinkling
of an eye there was a slight pop and
a missile struck his envelope squarely at
his chest he was uninjured though startled
and fired his automatic wildly into the air
at the noise the ganymedian disappeared
behind his trap door slamming it shut while
a chorus of shrieks filled the air

now youve done it stormed dalton
theyll never come out after that

but we had not seen the last of the gany-
medians on all sides of us trap doors
opened pouring forth creatures armed
with weapons like that of the first they
formed a semicircle and at a signal from
one they fired a volley of shots missiles
struck our envelopes our helmets and the
ground about us in a perfect hail they
were unable to penetrate our thick covering
though not a few stuck in the fabric until
we fairly bristled then abruptly the fusil-
lade ceased and the ganymedians fled to
their stone dwellings

whats to be done i asked

i suggest that we return to the comet
and talk the matter over said ernst

accordingly we left the hooting gany-
medians and returned to our ship dr von
lichten picked the darts off our envelopes
before permitting us to remove them sav-
ing a few for examination

poisoned perhaps he said by way of
explanation	-

gathered once more in our living quarters
we considered how to make our peaceable
intentions known dalton immediately took
lafourchette to task for firing his gun and
the two had little to offer in the way of
constructive suggestions it was ernst who
first saw through the attitude of the gany-
medians

let us reason from their point of view
he said suppose it was they who had
come to earth knowing nothing of its ge-
ography where would they land in the
most conspicuous place-the largest body
of water or the greatest plain now sup-
pose that having landed there they went
to the nearest settlement what would they

this later turned out to be the case the guns were
glorified blow-guns fired by compressed air stored in
the cylinders attached to them

find a fishing village or a country town
certainly not the home of our scientists
that is exactly what we have done we have
met with a group of uneducated suspici-
ous beings to whom we are outlandish and
frightful what more natural than that they
should fear us it is not here that we shall
find those who have tried to communicate
with us we must seek a larger settlement
a civilized settlement perhaps

without further ado we left the settle-
ment by the water and turned inland as
before i steered while the others stationed
themselves at the windows armed with bin-
oculars we swept back and forth in a zig-
zag course covering a strip of land a hun-
dred miles wide the vegetation gradually
lost its dark color acquiring the greeil
shade of that on earth and there were taller
plants sometimes reaching a height of a
hundred feet there were many small crea-
tures in the air they might have been birds
though they did not come close enough to
be seen clearly

presently ernst who was stationed on
the left side called out

heres another of those flying animals
steer away from it exclaimed lafour-
chette i have seen enough of them to
satisfy me

no steer closer said ernst this one
is different perhaps-yes it is its a fly-
ing machine

a flying machine repeated dalton and
lafourchette in chorus they rushed to
ernsts window and quickly verified his
statement yes it is

i picked up the machine in the periscope
and swung after it keeping pace the
pilot must have sighted us for he increased
his speed buti was easily able to follow
him i remained several miles behind not
wishing to alarm him but he seemed deter-
mined to shake us off he executed a num-
ber of maneuvers diving as though to land
then climbing to a height of several miles
i followed him with ease however and he
presently gave up the attempt heading off
in a different direction and keeping steadily
on this new course

as i swung in behind him the radio sets
the outpost on the moon



of our air envelopes began to speak-high
pitched jerky sounds resembling somewhat
the signals of our international code i
surmised that the plane ahead was report-
ing our appearance by some kind of wire-
less then the pilot slowed down to barely
fifty miles per hour and traveled along at
an altitude of a few thousand feet

fifteen minutes or so-later dalton re-
ported the appearance of a second machine
on our right it had crept up behind us and
was now keeping pace a thousand feet or
so away presently another appeared and
another looking back i saw a huge fleet
overhauling us spreading out around us
until we were surrounded on all sides above
and below ahead and behind whichever
way we looked there was a vast throng of
planes-hundreds of them following us
in a silent convoy there was no sign from
them they kept their distance in perfect
formation we could not guess their inten-
tions there was not a hostile move from
any of them the members of our party
fell to discussing them

perhaps its a reception committee
suggested dalton theyre escorting us to
a landing place

but then why are there so many of
them inquired lafourchette

an accomplishment as great as ours de-
serves a big reception returned dalton

however our wondering was cut short
in the distance a pall of smoke appeared
surrounded by circular buildings like those
in the waterside village we were approach-
ing a ganymedian city our convoy drew
in closer descending slowly it was ob-
viously their wish that we should land as
we drew closer to the city our speed was
further reduced the planes below us with-
drew those above came closer and those
on our flank formed a circle about us
wheeling about as though to cut off our
escape in any direction we were being
forced toward a large field about which
were more planes and large buildings re-
sembling hangars

we descended perforce half the ma-
chines followed suit surrounding us in a
close circle while the others remained aloft
forming a moving dome over our heads

from one of those on the ground appeared
several four-legged ganymedians who ap-
proached the comet boldly and peered into
the windows waving their tentacle-like
arms

they want us to come out said ernst
we donned our envelopes and left the ma
chine through the air-lock lafourchette car-
rying his gun despite daltons admonitions
the ganymedians stepped back forming a
semicircle about the air-lock obviously in-
viting us to descend to the ground we
closed the air lock and jumped down not
without some misgivings but the creatures
seemed friendly enough waving their arms
and giving voice to questioning hoots one
of their number advanced and extended his
arms in a reassuring gesture ernst stopped
forward to meet him and endeavored by
pantomimic gestures to show our peaceable
intentions i was intent on watching him
and did not notice for a moment that the
passengers of the other planes had come
out and were slowly advancing toward us
then von lichten uttered a shout

look out behind

trapped

but he was too late a dozen of the
skinny creatures had climbed over the
comet and as we turned they jumped up-
on us pinning us to the ground before
we realized what had happened we were
overwhelmed by the crowd strong metal
cords were fastened about our arms and
legs and we were bound helpless prison-
ers amid shrieks of anger we were picked
up bodily and carried to the nearest plane
thrown roughly into a dark compartment
and locked in the plane took off with a
rush bound we knew not where

i strained at my bonds but it was use-
less the darkness was pitchy i could not
tell where the rest were or whether they
were all in the same plane i called softly

ernst

here came the whispered response

are we all here i asked four whis-
pers assented at least we were not divided

what does all this mean i asked


wonder stories

they seem to take us for enemies said
ernst

what shall we do asked dalton
nothing now said ernst wait until
we can see

as we spoke the plane landed with a
slight jar the compartment was opened
and we were carried out one at a time onto
a flat room we appeared to be in the midst
of the large city on top of one of the build-
ings but i had time for only a fleeting
glance before i was bundled with the other
onto a platform which descended swiftly
into the depths of the building we must
have been carried down a hundred feet or
more when the platform came to a stop
and we were carried into a small room with
stone walls it was devoid of furniture
and had only one window a tiny slit near
the ceiling beyond a doubt we were in a
prison cell

our captors removed the metal cords
from our hands and feet and departed clos-
ing a massive stone door behind them

well said dalton explosively what
do you make of this

we are prisoners said lafourchette
dejectedly we have come four hundred
million miles to make friends with them
and they treat us like invaders

thats not the point said ernst we
have aroused their anger in some way we
must explain the situation to them and gain
their confidence

what do you suggest i asked

i believe they will presently return to
feed us and examine us said ernst i
shall try to communicate with them tell
them who we are and where we are from
perhaps we resemble some other race
which inhabits this globe with whom they
are at war but when they know that we
come from the earth they cannot fail to
realize their mistake and welcome us ac-
cordingly

and if they do not- said lafourchette
producing his gun

no exclaimed ernst we must not
antagonize them in any way that will only
confirm their suspicions of us

i should prefer to return to the comet

and leave this inhospitable race said la-
fourchette

dont be discouraged said ernst we
have come a long way for the opportunity
to meet these creatures dr forscher would
be disappointed in us if we failed to reach
an understanding with them

i admired the mans level-headed cour-
age in spite of the alarming turn of af-
fairs he had not lost sight of the purpose
of the expedition his attitude buoyed our
spirits greatly and we looked forward eag-
erly to the return of our captors

to pass the time we examined the walls
of our cell they were built of heavy
blocks of a kind of granite and there was
not a flaw anywhere it was obvious that
escape from the cell was out of the ques-
tion i hoisted lafourchette to my shoul-
ders and he examined the window it was
about two feet high and a little over a foot
wide the blocks were joined together by
a tongue and groove in each neatly polished
to a perfect fit several heavy bars of metal
ran crosswise blocking the opening effect-
ively lafourchette reported that he could
see a large circular park outside surround-
ed by tall buildings of similar shape evi-
dently this circular form was the predom-
inant note of their architecture just as
man-made buildings are almost universally
rectangular

we heard footsteps beyond the door
and presently it swung open admitting
a number of ganymedians they were with-
out clothing as usual and each was armed
with a mechanical blow-gun shooting poi-
soned darts one of them advanced and
singling out ernst took him to the oppo-
site corner of the cell where they began
a close examination of him they peered
through his helmet and tried to remove it
but without success apparently they were
puzzled for they uttered hoots of amaze-
ment and stopped from time to time to
raise their arms and move their fingers
rapidly i perceived that this was their
method of conversation their language con-
sisted of finger-signs like those of deaf
mutes they searched ernst closely for
weapons turned him about plucked at the
the outpost

 
heavy envelope and subjected him to an
intense scrutiny when they had finished
they led him back to the rest of us and
took dalton next perceiving that each of
us was to be similarly searched i whispered
to lafourchette

hide your gun theyll seize it if they
find it

he withdrew behind the rest of us and
concealed the gun in the corner of the
room the movement attracted the atten-
tion of our examiners and they stared at
us searchingly for a moment but seeing
nothing wrong they finished their scrutiny
of dalton lafourchette came next and
to our relief they had not noticed that he
carried the gun when we were captured
however they realized that the heavy en-
velope was not his skin and motioned him
to remove it he refused and one of them
produced a sharp knife-like instrument
dr von lichten cried out in protest and
started forward but he was immediately
seized and held we were forced to watch
while the ganymedians slashed open la-
fourchettes envelope and clothing he
winced as the knife-blade scratched his skin
and the ganymedians emitted howls of
amusement

this has gone far enough growled
dalton and with a swift movement-he
picked up the gun uttering a yell which at-
tracted the attention of the ganymedians
the wielder of the knife drew back his arm
to throw and dalton pulled the trigger the
gun roared the smoke cleared and the
knife-thrower lay dead on the floor the
others fled in terror slamming the door be-
hind them we heard the bolt snap into
place and we were alone once more

are you hurt demanded von lichten
of lafourchette

not at all replied the latter a mere
scratch but the devils have ripped my en-
velope

dr von lichten examined his cut from
which blood was trickling

if only i had my medicine case he
exclaimed an open wound in this strange
atmosphere-there is danger of infection

do not worry said lafourchette i
shall be all right i am only sorry that it

on the moon	

was necessary to shoot they will never for-
give us

i fear you are right said ernst how-
ever let us learn what we can from this
dead creature

we dragged the ganymedian to the light
beneath the window and dr von lichten
set about examining the body i possessed
myself of the creatures blow-gun and knife
and stood back corpses human or other-
wise have never had much attraction for
me

the doctor brought to light several in-
teresting features of the physical nature of
the ganymedians each hand had six fing-
ers of nearly equal size about eight inches
long there were five joints in each which
were capable of bending in both directions
enabling the hand to close either forward
or backward there were likewise six toes
if they may be called such on each foot
but with only one joint in each and entire-
ly covered with a scaly substance instead
of the nail at the tip of the corresponding
human members the skin of the creatures
was likewise scaly and glistened like that
of a fish

prying open the mouth the doctor dis-
covered that there was no tongue explain-
ing the lack of an articulate language
among the creatures between the head and
shoulders were tiny openings which evi-
dently served as ears though their form
suggested that they might be remnants of
what had been gills in prehistoric times
the striking resemblance of many physical
characteristics to those of water creatures
of the earth pointed to the possibility that
they were akin to that family having per-
haps emerged from their abode in the ocean
to evolve into intelligent creatures on land

chapter xv
a race with death

after a time our attention was attract-
ed by a commotion outside our window
as of the gathering of a throng of people
i hoisted lafourchette to my shoulders
again and he reported that this was indeed
the


wonder stories

they are gathering from all sides he
reported they shout they gesticulate
they point toward this building toward our
cell they seem exceedingly angry some
are bringing tree-trunks or logs they pile
them in the center of the great circle now
they are setting fire to them they are build-
ing a bonfire they dance about it shout-
ing with rage still they point to our cell
can it be that the bonfire is for us-that
they intend to burn us alive

let them try exclaimed dalton as
long as we have this gun theyll have a fine
time getting us out

however our defense was not to be as
easy as that presently lafourchette re-
ported 

they are setting fire to something on
the end of a stick it burns with a blue
flame now they are approaching our win-
dow with the stick there is a lump of
something yellow on the end of the stick
it burns dully with heavy fumes it is
sulphur they are going to asphyxiate
us with burning sulphur then they will
carry us to the bonfire

give me the gun exclaimed dalton
let me up there ill stop them he
climbed to the window and leveled the au-
tomatic at the approaching throng the
gun barked and there was a shout of dis-
may from outside

theyre running away said dalton
thatll teach them not to monkey with us
but they were not through yet the crowd
withdrew to a respectful distance taking
with them the sulphur torch presently
some of them carried it out of our view and
we wondered apprehensively what they
were up to we heard faintly the tramp
of feet above us and shortly there was a
choking whiff of sulphur dioxide from the
window dalton pressed his face against
the bars and reported

they are hanging the torch from a rope
just above the window the fumes are hea-
vier than air and some of them drift into
the cell itll take longer that way but
theyll get us eventually

he climbed down and we faced one an-
other in despair

im afraid this is the end said ernst
if only-

the door grated open its lock twisted
and cherry red with heat beyond it stod
a ganymedian- a strange ganymedian his
attitude bespoke friendliness not ferocity
as we surveyed him we noted that the best-
iality which stamped the features of our
captors was lacking his massive head and
kindly eyes indicated a superior order of
intelligence somehow we felt this crea-
ture was our ally

he carried a peculiar looking instrument
whose lingering glow indicated that it had
been used to melt the bolt of our cell door
at its tip was a tiny glowing point which
was raised to a white heat in some manner
electrically or chemically back of this
was a parabolic mirror which caught the
emitted energy and focussed it at a point
a few feet beyond the instrument the fo-
cus could be shifted forward or back by
sliding the mirror along the handle it
served the purpose of a blow torch and
from the neatness with which it had severed
the steel lock an efficient one

the ganymedian motioned us to come
out of the cell the sulphurous fumes
left us no choice but to obey so we followed
him into the corridor we were led through
a series of passages to the far side of the
building where a barred window blocked
our path our guide neatly clipped off the
bars with his torch and we dropped to the
ground outside a row of circular build-
ings confronted us beyond which was an-
other open park we quickly made our
way there and saw before us a machine as
unlike those we had encountered as our
guide was unlike the hostile crowd which
had imprisoned us it gave every evidence
of being tremendously speedy yet withal
it was large and roomy

we ran for it at a signal from the gany-
median we had covered half the distance
when a shout announced the discovery of
our escape the crowd rushed in hot pur-
suit firing darts dalton whirled and emp-

	we later learned that the jany medians made use o
this instrument because their bodies would not stand
exposure to the temperatures necessary to cut atcel
-at close range
the outpost on the moon



lied the magazine of the automatic account-
ing for four while i stretched another on
the ground with the dead ganymedians air-
gun then we reached the machine and
climbed aboard through a lowered door
which clanged shut behind us the plane
shot into the air with a silent rush while
the enraged crowd below us fired futile mis-
siles and waved their arms in the air

from external appearances the machine
bore little resemblance to man-made ma-
chines to be sure there were similarities
here and there the ship had wings and was
shaped in general like the familiar type of
monoplane but inside things were be-
wilderingly different there were no seats
the four-legged ganymedians squatted on
their hind legs in the fashion of earthly
quadrupeds the controls were likewise un-
familiar-a dial here a lever there and
nothing commensurate with the size and
power of the machine i judged it to be
controlled by compressed air or electricity
strangest of all was the motor it aroused
my interest and lacking the ability to ques-
tion the crew i determined to discover as
much of its mechanism as i could

to begin with there were no cylinders
and this set me to wondering about its
source of power i quickly discovered an
odor identified it as some member of the
hydrocarbon group from which gasoline
springs yet instead of being fed into a cyl-
inder compressed by the upstroke of a pis-
ton and fired by an electric spark it appar-
ently burned continuously in a small cham-
ber where the gas was maintained under
pressure and fed into a set of rotating vanes
it was a gasoline turbine-the dream of
internal combustion engineers

the plane was heading away from the
ocean toward that side of the side of the
satellite which is never lighted by jupiter
the clouds thinned rapidly and below
them we could see the ground bare for the
most part-with clumps of desert vegeta-
tion here and there these grew more and
more sparse finally disappearing altogeth-
er and we flew over a vast waste of sand
overhead the stars shone weakly pushing
their faint rays through the pale sunlight
jupiters great body its darkened side

turned toward us sank lower and lower
finally disappearing below the horizon the
sun followed him a few moments later as
we crossed to the back side of the satellite

in the darkened heavens callisto and the
four tiny outer satellites threw a ghostly
moonlight on the swift panorama of the
desert we were flying low now yet the
brilliance of the starlit sky showed that
the air about us was thin and dry the
great pull of jupiter-four thousand times
stronger than that of the moon even at
this distance-had raised a permanent tide
in both the air and water leaving the outer
side of the satellite with little atmospheric
covering and no moisture to speak of dr
forscher had predicted a cloudless region
on ganymede we saw now the reason for
its existence

the plane suddenly slackened its pace
and began to descend looking ahead we
saw the lights of a tremendous city extend-
ing for miles in all directions tall cylin-
drical buildings marked a magnificent sky-
line above which many small planes scur-
ried in a bustle of busy traffic as we ap-
proached the air was cleared to make a
pathway for us and we settled gracefully
to the top of one of the nearby buildings
an elevator waited to carry us to one of
the lower floors where we were escorted to
a large circular room

it contained little furniture-a strange
looking table a carpet and a few bizarre
cushions in lieu of chairs the windows
were without glass for the temperature on
this world varied but little and there was
no need for protection against the weather
a number of large globes filled the room
with a soft heatless glow resembling intens-
ified moonlight in which the blue shades
of the room were brought out distinctly

the story of a destiny

our guides left save one who turned to
us and pointed to his mouth with a
questioning hoot i surmised he was ask-
ing whether we were hungry and respond-
ed to his gesture vigorously he disap-
peared and dr von lichten observed


wonder stories

theres no telling what sort of food hell
bring us wed best be careful

im so hungry i could eat a tree said
dalton

in order to do so youll have to take
off your helmet my friend said the doc-
tor its risky remember that

going without food and water is more
than risky its certain death retorted
dalton our oxygen wont hold out much
longer and we cant recharge the appara-
tus im for taking the envelopes off
suiting his action to the word he removed
his helmet and stripped off the flexible cov-
ering the rest of us followed suit with
some hesitation dr von lichten last of
all however there was no use trying to
refute the logic of daltons statements and
we felt rather secure since lafourchettes
ripped envelope had apparently caused him
no discomfort

presently our rescuer reappeared with
several metal platters bearing food it was
entirely unfamiliar but appeared to con-
sist for the most part of raw vegetables
and fruits of some kind if any food on this
world would be safe for us that should
so we decided to take a chance after a
cautious nibble or two we consumed the
whole meal with great relish a container
of water accompanied it and was emptied
in short order it had a queer fishy taste
but we did not mind it then we stretched
out on the rug for a nap the ganymedian
climate was quite cold and we found it
necessary to wrap the carpet around our-
selves but otherwise we slept comfortably
for several hours

we were awakened by the reappearance
of the friendly ganymedian who seemed
much taken aback at the spectacle of the
five of us unconscious on the floor he
seemed quite relieved however when we
sat up and waved to him but he was ob-
viously puzzled it occurred to me that
perhaps sleep was unknown to him some
terrestrial creatures are known to spend
their entire lives awake

he brought with him several sheets of
greenish parchment-like paper and a pen-
cil which deserved the name of lead-pen-
cil more literally than ours for it con-

sisted of a stick of lead sharpened to a
point with these writing materials he seat-
ed himself at the table and motioned us to
do likewise we gathered around sitting
on the cushions and watched he handed
the pencil and paper to ernst pointed to
him and hooted in evident interrogation
ernst wrote man and pointed to each of
us in turn then the ganymedian pointed
to ernst again and hooted once more ernst
wrote his name then that of each of us
indicating to whom the names belonged

from names he progressed to parts of the
body objects in the room and other things
on ganymede sketching them at times to
make himself clear the ganymedian ex-
hibited a remarkable aptitude for under-
standing the sketches and the words and it
took but a short time for him to learn to
write brief sentences in english for the
sake of simplicity ernst spelled words pho-
netically and gave all the verbs regular
endings writing hed for head fut for
foot runed for ran and so forth the
language thus evolved was clumsy but it
served the purpose of a means of communi-
cation which was all that was required

then they took up some simple arith-
metic writing out the arabic numerals a
curious yet nevertheless natural circum-
stance arose in connection with this our
number  represented  to the ganyme-
dian the explanation of this was easily
seen when we remembered that there were
twelve fingers on their hands when man-
kind first learned to count he used his fing-
ers as the base of his system of numbers

when he had counted up to ten he start-
ed over again counting ten and one ten
and two and so on indicating the ten by
a digit in the second column when a hun-
dred was reached being ten times ten he
added a third column the ganymedians
counted right up to twelve in the first col-
umn and the figure  represented twelve
 twelve and one  means twelve times
twelve or one hundred and forty-four in
our system

another difference between our phy-
sical make-up and that of the gany-
medians appeared when we tried to name
the outpost on the moon



the colors of the spectrum the four-legged
scientist wanted to assign the adjective
black to things which appeared red or
orange to us while he could distinguish
differences above violet which were invis-
ible to our eyes this meant simply that
the range of wavelengths which affect the
human retina was slightly lower than the
corresponding limits of visibility to the
ganymedian eye

we spent several weeks in building up a
vocabulary which the ganymedian could
understand we made no attempt to devel-
op a spoken language since the ganymed-
ians could not speak and we could not
learn their finger-language readily but
with the use of the table of words we had
recorded we were able to write intelligible
messages at the end of this time

at length we wert in a position to ex-
change ideas with considerable facility
then the ganymedian began to ask us ques-
tions about ourselves where we had come
from how we had happened to land in the
city near the ocean and the details of our
capture when we had satisfied his curios-
ity he explained the situation on his planet
to us in some detail for the sake of clear-
ness i will summarize his statements in
plain english what he told us was essen-
tially as follows

	  

on ganymede as on earthlife began in
the sea the land at that time was barren
and the air unbreatheable for lack of oxy-
gen certain forms of fish developed the
knack of gliding above the surface on their
enlarged lateral fins much as the flying
fish of the earth and when plant life ap-
peared on the land to provide food and
oxygen in the air they became amphibious
living both on the land and in the water
certain of these flying amphibians eventu-
ally came to live on the ground entirely
and gradually lost the ability to fly while
others soared in the air and preyed on weak-
er creatures you met one of these amphi-
bians shortly after you arrived here there

a later experiment showed the ganymedian limits of
tisibility to lie roughly between  and  ang-
strom units as compared with  and  for the
human eye  angstrom equals   centi-
meter

are many like them some still wild some
however we managed to tame to the use of
our race

my own people are the descendants of
that species which lived on the ground sur-
viving by its superior cunning rather than
relying on brute strength they became
civilized learned to cooperate with one an-
other and established a democratic gov-
ernment as our knowledge advanced we
developed industries a class of laborers
appeared to work for wages under the con-
trol of the capitalists unfortunately com-
plications developed from this situation
the laborers were dissatisfied with their
lot there was unemployment now and then
and the industries were run with a view to
producing cheaply and selling at high prices
with no regard to the quality of products

this finally led to the seizure of the gov-
ernment by the workers but in their poor-
ly educated state they were unable to man-
age it and chaos resulted finally a bril-
liant student of economics gathered around
him a following of intelligent people oust-
ed the laborers from their control and set
up a dictatorship under his regime and
those which followed our civilization ad-
vanced by leaps and bounds institutions
of learning were established and the study
of science assumed an important place in
our order of things more and more of the
laws of nature were discovered the scien-
tists published their discoveries for the bene-
fit of the world and the race grew prosper-
ous

however it seems that the nature of our
people is to scoff at that which they do not
understand scientists were well paid for
their work in those days and the working
class and middle class could not see the
practical value of theorizing about chemis-
try physics astronomy and the like they
became dissatisfied and threatened to con-
fiscate the pay of the scientific class and
force them into exile if they did not turn
their efforts to tasks which would result in
the immediate enriching of the world the
scientists gave little heed to the mutterings
of the multitudes until one day they rose
in open revolt the rebellion was quelled
but it became apparent that the rule of the


wonder stories

intelligent students of science economics and
politics was threatened

the final crisis was brought about by an
experiment with which you are doubtless
familiar i refer to the firing of projectiles
at the planets of the solar system in an
effort to elicit a response and so determine
whether or not they were inhabited this
experiment was misunderstood by the lay
public and a rumor circulated that the rul-
ers were trying to bring people from other
planets to keep the masses in subjugation
a bloody war resulted in which the ruling
class was driven from the land into this
desert which covers almost the entire half
of ganymede which turns away from jup-
iter

many of them died of thirst and starva-
tion but a number escaped to the spot on
which this city now stands and succeeded
in recovering from the air enough hydrogen
oxygen and nitrogen to irrigate a patch of
the desert fertilize it and raise food with
the aid of their scientific knowledge they
built this city supplied it with water and
plant-food and now a race of a million peo-
ple flourishes advancing their civilization
and adding to their knowledge

meanwhile the remaining classes of
the population around the ocean have
carried on their former form of democratic
government and have reverted to their old
form of cut-throat competition the gov-
ernment is run by the workers and manu-
facturers aiming as always at selfish prof-
iteering they lay waste the forests mine
coal and burn it without regard to the avail-
able supply release mineral oils and gases
with reckless abandon in a few generations
there will be no more natural fuel on the
planet unless they are stopped they make
use of the inventions our scientists had de-
veloped before they drove us out but there
is no progress among them at present ev-
ery student research worker and inventor
has been exiled

realizing that they will destroy the plan-
et in their greed if we do not intervene we
have tried several times to conquer them
and reestablish ourselves as their rulers
but without success they have defeated

us in spite of our scientific knowledge
through sheer force of numbers for this
reason we are now seeking means of rais-
ing a large army equipped with the most
deadly instruments of warfare we can de-
vise fully a third of our number is trained
to military service only the aged the very
young and the scientific geniuses being ex-
cepted

now that you are acquainted with the
state of affairs on ganymede you will re-
alize our need for help when the news of
your arrival and capture was reported by
one of our spies the machine in which you
were brought here was immediately dis-
patched and we rescued you hoping that
you might consent to send men from the
earth to assist us in capturing the land
about the ocean and regaining our rightful
place as its owners

	  

the five of us read the message of the
ganymedian in silence when we had
finished we looked at one another in amaze-
ment

the proposal is ridiculous exclaimed
lafourchette the outrageous presump-
tion of the creature to suppose that we
will supply him with men and arms from
the earth to interfere in a war which does
not concern us or the people of the earth
in the least

softly cautioned ernst i would sug-
gest that we consider the proposal without
committing ourselves definitely remem-
ber we must have the help of these people in
the desert to get the comet back

he took the pencil and a sheet of paper
and wrote

we appreciate your situation and sym-
pathize deeply with you we ourselves will
be willing to help you to the utmost but
we must of course return to earth ob-

the ganymedian did not mention females in this
list for a reason that we later discovered there is no
difference of sex among them periodically each ma-
ture creature on the planet lays eggs which are fer-
tilized by ultra-violet rays in the case of the lower
animals the sunlight performs this function and he
eggs are hatched by being buried in the soil where
the heat of decaying vegetation keeps them warm the
intelligent race makes use of ultra-violet lamps ana
incubators they are enabled in this way to select
only the most perfect of their young for maturity
and keep the population within the limits demanded
by the citys resources

this and later quotations are not literal translation
of tho dialect actually used
the outpost on the moon



tain permission of its governments and en-
list the necessary men to say nothing of
building the machines to transport them
the first thing to be done therefore is to
recapture our space-flyer the comet which
still rests in the city where we were cap-
tured

i understand that replied the gany-
median your acceptance of my proposal
is most gratifying let us now consider
means of recapturing your flyer

he explained to us that there were many
difficulties involved to begin with no
airplane was permitted to land on any fly-
ing field on ganymede unless it bore a li-
cense number issued by the government
furthermore each field had a particular
pass-word which was changed from day to
day these measures he told us had been
adopted to prevent the landing of enemy
planes in short a landing could only be
effected by force and in view of our es-
cape the comet would doubtless be heavily
guarded a surprise attack would be neces-
sary

i noticed he said further that one of
your number made effective use of a weap-
on which is strange to us i mean that
blunt instrument carried in the hand which
exploded with violence and dropped our
pursuers in their tracks if we had a num-
ber of those it would be comparatively
easy to drive off the guards and reach the
comet

you mean the gun wrote ernst
they are not hard to make if you have the
necessary tools and materials

we have excellent machinists replied
the ganymedian you need only give us
the principle by which it kills we will at-
tend to the rest

chapter xvi
a mutual discovery

with daltons help ernst explained
the construction of the gun the for-
mula for black powder presented difficul-
ties for it was necessary to first explain
something of our system of chemical nota-
tion the first two ingredients sulphur and

carbon were easily named but the third
and most important nitre potassium nit-
rate was not easy to describe however
by naming its characteristics dalton learned
that the substance was well known and used
by the ganymedians who had found de-
posits of it in the desert the scientist
wished to take lafourchettes automatic as
a model but we demurred as we felt safer
with it in our possession

it will take until the next rising of the
sun to make the guns the ganymedian
wrote at that time we will be prepared
to attempt the capture of the comet

it now lacked some thirty hours of sun-
rise during which we had nothing to do
we obtained the permission of the gany-
median to explore the city and he gave
us a map so that we might find our way
around we took with us the list of words
we had compiled so that we might ask
questions from time to time and we were
given letters of introduction explaining who
we were

armed with these documents we set out
the city presented many interesting sights
and not a few surprises the first thing which
struck our attention was the fact that there
was no vehicular traffic on the streets ov-
erhead the air was full of flying machines
of all sizes and types which served the
purposes of transportation these landed
on and departed from the roofs of the
buildings never descending to the level of
the streets pedestrians hurried about in-
tent on their own business scarcely giving
us a glance i thought ruefully of the mad
stampede for souvenirs which would have
followed the appearance of a party of these
creatures in the streets of an american city
and could not help admiring their dignified
self-control

we entered what appeared to be the shop-
ping district and gazed into the stores the
lack of gaudy display and high-pressure
advertising aroused our wonder and we in-
quired of one of the shopkeepers why this
was so he explained using our improvised

it is a queer anomaly that although the qanymediana
were able to shoot projectiles hundreds of millions of
miles into space they had missed altogether the ap-
plication of explosives to firearms the reason we
never discovered


wonder stories

dictionary that each store enjoyed a mono-
poly in its line the prices being fixed by
governmental regulation this did away
with the waste of time and money spent in
trying to influence the buyer to decide
among a number of essentially similar ar-
ticles

later we found our way to the univer-
sity at which this nation of scholars received
its education we inquired our way to the
department of astronomy and found it lo-
cated on the roof of one of the immense
circular buildings there were a number of
telescopes there the largest of which was a
reflector somewhat similar to those on the
earth its mirror was about fifteen feet in
diameter not quite as large as the earths
-inch-but it was remarkably well
built especially in view of the fact that op-
tical glass was unknown to the ganymed-
ians throughout the instrument metal mir-
rors took the places of lenses

i asked for a chance to look through it
and the astronomer in charge agreed will-
ingly i would have chosen to take a look
at the earth from this distance but that was
impossible at present the sun had set
and here the earth like venus was a morn-
ing and evening star close to the sun i
chose pluto whose great distance has pre-
vented the earth from learning much of its
physical nature

pluto repeated the astronomer which
of the planets do you call by that name

i beg your pardon i wrote pluto is
the name we give to the outermost planet
of the solar system

the telescope was trained on the heavens
and i peered into the eye-piece a tiny disc
of pale yellow so faint as to border on in-
visibility occupied the center of the field of
view i was puzzled the power of this in-
strument should have shown pluto much
brighter and larger

this is the outermost planet i asked
the astronomer nodded confirmation

the ninth i inquired

to be sure he replied

but surely this magnificent instrument
should show it better i persisted the
astronomer was displeased

perhaps you expect too much he said

at fifteen times our distance from the sun
it receives very little light

i saw that something was amiss pluto
is less than nine times as far from the swn
as jupiter could it be that this was the
trans-plutonian planet that the younger as-
tronomers on earth were talking about
yet the ganymedian astronomer called it
the ninth planet

i made a rapid sketch of the solar system
as i knew it showing the orbits of the
nine planets with their distances from the
sun and presented it to the ganymedian
astronomer comprehension dawned on
his features and he seized the pencil in
excitement

we revolve around the fifth planet from
the sun he demanded i agreed

then there are ten planets in all we
have never seen the innermost-it is too
close to the sun you have never seen the
last what i would not give for your van-
tage point and the knowledge you must
have of the inner planets

i would be equally glad of your oppor-
tunity to study the outer ones i returned
are you sure here are none beyond this
tenth

we cannot tell he replied if an-
other exists it is much too faint to be
found by accident some of us think there
are irregularities in the behavior of the
tenth which may indicate another but it
has been known too short a time to say
definitely our calculations show that it
takes hundreds of years to circle the sun
once until we have determined its path
accurately and eliminated the effects of all
the others upon it it is useless to consider
the question of still another world

i spent some time conversing with the
astronomer telling him what i knew of
mercury in return i learned that my the-
ory of the manner in which jupiters satel-
lites received their heat was correct elec-
tric currents induced by his magnetic field
were responsible the scientist also satis-
fied my curiosity regarding the shooting of
sulphur meteors to the earth he explained

the sighting of this planet was announced by the
lowell observatory after mr marlands departure
from the earth
the outpost on the moon



that they had built an enormous cannon
three feet in diameter and over two thous-
and feet long buried in the earth in the
manner of the columbiad around which
jules verne wrote his entertaining story
from the earth to the moon this can-
non he told us had been located very near
the building which housed the observatory
for the desert city was located at the point
farthest from jupiter where the sun and
the inner planets passed directly overhead
once every seven earth-days he also ex-
plained how the projectiles had been con-
structed so that their brilliant blue light
would attract our attention

this trip of exploration served to pass
the time while the guns were being made
finally the hour of departure arrived with
the rising of the sun and we set out to re-
capture the comet a crew of twenty
ganymedians in addition to ourselves
climbed aboard each armed with an auto-
matic pistol and a hundred rounds of am-
munition we took offwith a rush amid
shouts and hoots from the onlookers and
headed for the cloudy land surrounding the
ocean we five had worn our air-envelopes
for they gave protection from the poisoned
darts of the hostile ganymedians and pro-
vided an easy means of conversation at a
distance through the radio equipment as
the miles flew away below us a tension grew
on the entire crew we realized more keen-
ly now than at any time before our desper-
ate situation at all costs we must regain
the comet yet we would have a battle on
our hands with the ever present possibil-
ity of capture and death

the construction and functioning of the projectiles
were as follows there were three concentric shells
the outermost of heavy aluminum the second of brit-
tle clay and the third of copper between the first
and second was a layer of hydrogen chloride frozen
at - degrees centigrade between the second and
third was supercooled ice the shock of discharge
broke the second shell mixing the ice and hydrogen
chloride which were melted by the heat of the pro-
jectiles passage through ganymedes atmosphere and
at the same time kept the copper shell cool the solu-
tion of hydrogen chloride in water formed hydro-
chloric acid which destroyed the aluminum shell this
acid does not attack copper as it does aluminum
so the inner shell reached the earth intact inside
it was a mixture of sulphur manganese dioxide and
potassium chlorate the last contains oxygen in com-
bination which it gives up when heated to about 
degrees centigrade in the presence of manganese di-
oxide the heating was accomplished by friction with
the earths atmosphere sulphur burns in pure oxygen
with a brilliant blue flame the resulting gas sulphur
dioxide serving in this case to burst the copper case
and make the conflagration visible

the decoy

the plane began to descend and with
tightening about the heart i realized
the moment was at hand below us lay the
landing field and with a tingle of joy i
recognized the slender body of the comet
apparently unharmed but as we drew clos-
er i saw a swarm of ganymedians sur-
rounding it armed with blow-guns and
knives planes patrolled the air above the
field cruising slowly about i realized
that poorly armed as were the guards our
five men would stand no show against them
in a direct attack we must resort to strat-
egy

the commander of the plane evidently
thought likewise for he headed up toward
the clouds a council of war was hastily
called and i made a suggestion

i think it best i offered that you
land on the outskirts of the y and let
the five of us go to the field on foot mean-
while you can return in the plane and draw
the attention of the guards while you en-
gage them in battle and lead them away
from the comet we will dash out and take
possession of it

your plan is good replied the gany-
medians however we will send a few of
our number with you to guide you and as-
sist you in case you are attacked

accordingly the plane turned about and
soared across the city landing in an open
field near the outlying buildings the five
of us together with an equal number of
ganymedians disembarked and stole into
the city the streets were shrouded in semi-
darkness for while the sun had recently
set on this side of the world jupiter was
always above the horizon and his huge cres-
cent sent a diffused light from the over-
cast sky we wound our way through the
narrow streets keeping in the shadows
wherever possible the ganymedians
formed a circle around us so that our un-
familiar forms would be less likely to at-
tract the attention of a casual observer

at length we saw the lights of the land-
ing field ahead of us the plane of our
rescuers was nowhere in sight as we ap-
proached but it shortly made its appear-


wonder stories

ance diving through the clouds and head-
ing straight for the field as if to land the
planes of the guarding party rose to meet
it swinging into formation they soared
in a body above the attacker while from
one plane and then another appeared fiery
torches which they had hurled downward
in an attempt to set fire to it -the scien-
tists machine dodged cleverly and turned
away from the field leading the defenders
away as we had planned a large share of
the ground force followed at a run to meet
and destroy the scientists should they suc-
ceed in effecting a landing but we noted
with dismay that half a hundred remained
at their posts in a circle about the comet

my plan of decoying the guards away had
worked once however and i decided to try
it again i turned to the group

ernst i said we must get those guards
away from the machine somehow you and
dalton take three of the ganymedians with
you make your way around to the other
side of the field and stir up some excite-
ment shoot-yell-anything to attract at-
tention  make them think theres a large par-
ty attacking then retreat and hide mean-
while well sneak up from behind and board
the comet and then pick you up ernst
nodded his agreement and picking out
three of the ganymedians set off through
the streets to circle the field dalton with
him

dr von lichten lafourchette and i to-
gether with the two remaining ganymedians
kept our posts for perhaps fifteen min-
utes the silence was broken only by the
faint sounds of the distant commotion in-
dicating that the bulk of the ganymedians
were still pursuing the decoy plane then
from my radio receiver came the sound of
ernsts voice yelling like a comanche while
the microphone brought the rapid reports
of five pistols the fifty ganymedians
about the comet turned to face the noise
some advancing at a run a few lingering
i signalled to my companions and we dash-
ed for the center of the field ernst had
done his work well we were within ten
paces before we were discovered our guns
spoke in unison four ganymedians tum-
bled to the ground while the others rushed

about in confusion we vaulted to the top
of the comet and snatched open the door to
the air-lock one of our ganymedians
caught a poisoned dart in his shoulder a
flying knife cracked against my helmet and
then we were out of danger the door closed
behind us

in my radio receivers i heard faintly the
shouting voices of ernst and dalton re-
treating i sprang to the control-room
closed the gravity-screens and set the comet
in motion ernsts voice came again mar-
land have you got it

yes i shouted

come quick i heard were sur-
rounded theyve got us

where are you i yelled

north side of the field first street was
the answer hurry

i swung northward flying low a roar
from the sky announced the return of the
enemy planes as i reached the first street
beyond the limits of the field looking
down i saw a tremendous crowd milling ex-
citedly into the street but i could not make
out ernst and dalton in the semi-darkness
i dropped the comet down between the
buildings in the hope of scaring off the
ganymedians but they stood their ground
i did not dare try to crush them with the
machine for fear of killing my comrades at
at the same time i peered vainly about
trying to locate them

marland daltons voice

where are you i shouted again

on the field theyveknocked ernst
out and tied me up and theyre putting us
aboard a plane

coming i yelled and turned the
comets nose up noting with satisfaction
that the gas discharge enveloped a number
of ganymedians

the flying field was covered with planes
some in the act of landing others just tak-
ing off

marland came daltons voice again
were going up

which plane i asked

i dont know how to describe it i
cant see out-its dark in here try to
the outpost on the moon



fully a dozen planes were leaving the
ground at that moment i rushed for the
nearest shouting daltons name his an-
swer came fainter not that one i tried
another but with no better luck the planes
were scattering in all directions the gan-
ymedians saw what i was up to and knew
how slim were my chances of finding the
right plane before daltons radio would be
out of range desperately i tried to circle
the field and round up the planes but five
of them escaped with dalton aboard one
his cries grew fainter and finally faded
out i could not keep track of the speeding
planes in the dim twilight

von lichten and lafourchette were at my
side in the control room i turned to them

we must do something quick i said
we must find them and rescue them
what can we do asked lafourchette
hopelessly they are lost we cannot hope
to find them they are miles away by now
and theres no telling how far they will be
carried

but we cannot leave them to the mercy
of the ganymedians i protested they
will probably be taken to some city let
us fly over every one on the planet and
try to bring our radios within hearing
range

it would be useless said lafourchette
mthe radios are good for half a mile-
three quarters at the outside it would take
days perhaps weeks they will be killed
before we can reach them

true put in von lichten and further
the ganymedians may foresee that we will
search their cities and hide them in some
forsaken spot if we passed within half a
mile of every point in the inhabited strip
between the ocean and the desert it would
mean traveling a path thirty million miles
long he shook his head if only the ra-
dios were more powerful-

can we not make them so demanded
lafourchette suddenly the desert peo-
ple are excellent workmen perhaps they
could make us a powerful set

no i said it would take shem sever-
al days at the least then i recalled the
code-messages of the ganymedians which

had spoken from our receivers on our first
encounter with their planes

we can do better i exclaimed they
have radios already made we can borrow
one of their planes and fly along calling to
dalton and ernst i swung the comet
about and rose above the clouds seeking
the plane of the scientists after a moment
i spotted it some miles away and made for
it with a rush the commander recognized
us and flew to meet us then as we drew
close he headed for the desert to return to
his city this did not suit my plans at all
it was a six hours trip in his machine and
i must talk to him at once i headed in
front of him trying to indicate that i wished
him to land but he evidently did not un-
derstand for he only put on more speed
at length in desperation i decided to
climb out on the comet and attract his at-
tention i turned over the controls to von
lichten and entered the air-lock

chapter xvii
we search through ganymede

i was still clad in my envelope and the
magnetic shoes served to give me some
extra foot-hold in spite of the slight grav-
ity we were traveling at a good five hun-
dred miles an hour it was a desperate
chance but the lives of two men hung in
the balance fastening a rope to the air-
lock door i tied it about my waist and
climbed out

we were traveling at an altitude of many
miles and the rush of air though terrific
was not as great as it would have been near-
er the ground for which i was thankful
i lay flat on  the top of the comet clinging
to my rope and waving an arm above my
head the ganymedians finally saw me
and drew near a daring plan entered my
head the circular door opened and the
face of a ganymedian appeared i mo-
tioned him to come nearer the plane set-
tled slowly until it was a bare ten feet
above then dropped back slightly ten
feet on earth it would be impossible but
with the weak gravity-could i make it

i crouched and jumped with every ounce

of strength arms outstretched somehow
my hands encountered the rim of the door
i drew myself up against the drag of the
whistling wind and was safe aboard the
ganymedian plane

in the reaction from the awful chance i
had taken i was speechless for a moment
as were the ganymedians the commander
was waving madly in his excitement at my
jump he was trying to question me in his
language i motioned for pencil and pa-
per and quickly related the capture of
ernst and dalton the necessity of their im-
mediate rescue and our plan to use their
radio the scientist shook his head and
wrote

the instrument you call a radio passed
out of favor with us some years ago as
you know we are unable to converse di-
rectly through sounds alone so we have
devised an apparatus for projecting moving
images by means of electromagnetic waves
that is the only equipment for communi-
cation aboard this plane

a television machine interesting but
useless to us i thought for a moment

are not the planes of your enemies
equipped with radios i asked

yes he replied they send messages
by means of intermittent signals using their
code their instruments will not reproduce
actual sounds however

nevertheless i decided we may be
able to use them we must capture one of
their planes at once

we will help as well as we can replied
the commander

then let me return at once to the comet
i wrote give me a rope and i will drop
onto it

a metal cord was procured and after a
few breath-taking moments i was back
aboard the comet i explained the situa-
tion to the others as i turned it about and
headed back for the flying field

most of the planes had landed but there
were a few still in the air they saw us
coming and rushed out to meet us i sing-
led out one and cut it off from the others
threatening it with the blazing gas dis-
charge as i circled quickly around it the
pilot recognized his helplessness and al-

lowed himself to be shepherded away to the
edge of the city here i forced him to land
and armed with our automatics we ap-
proached it cautiously the scientists land-
ed their plane on the other side and seeing
that resistance was hopeless the enemy avi-
ator surrendered we tied him securely and
boarded his plane

the radio apparatus was mounted back
of the controls at first glance it appeared
hopelessly unfamiliar but on examining the
details of its construction we saw that the
essential principles were all there to be
sure the various part were strange and
bewildering but we recognized the vital
functions of each piece of apparatus in
its present form it would not serve to trans-
mit our voices but with the attachment of
our microphones and receivers and per-
haps a variation here and there it could
be made to serve we decided to trans-
plant the apparatus intact to the comet
and set to work at once

the ganymedians being familiar with
the construction did the work while i
showed them how to connect it to our gen-
erators with what tools we possessed we
set it up in the comet control room and
tested it out finding that it was in working
order we took off once more and headed up
above the city dr von lichten took his
place at the microphone while i steered a
course around the city then off to the
west he kept up a continuous fire of talk
dalton ernst can you hear me von
lichten speaking aboard the comet an-
swer if you can hear me a few seconds
wait dalton can you hear me- i
sent the flyer hurtling along at a terrific
pace above the inhabited strip zig-zagging
so as to come within a hundred miles or
so of every part

at the end of half an hour we had heard
no response we had covered nearly
four hundred miles in the direction i
thought the planes might have taken they
had two hours start on us but could not
have covered more than that distance judg-
ing from their speed evidently they had
not gone this way i circled about and
headed back passing to the north of the
the outpost on the moon



city toward the desert now and again we
flashed over a small settlement or crossed
a river or lake but the country was for the
most part bare lafourchette replaced dr
von lichten at the microphone and took up
the endless monologue still we rushed on
heading east now zig-zagging again we
seemed to be entering a range of low moun-
tains here and there signs of long-past vol-
canic activity appeared lafourchette was
waxing eloquent dalton ernst where
are you answer-it is i lafourchette
fear not mes amis we will rescue you
speak only a word and we shall come on
swift wings ah mes enfants can you not
hear half an hour more if we did not
reach them quickly the ganymedians would
have time to land with their cold-blooded
contempt for life and their devilish ingen-
uity-i shuddered to think of the fate of
my comrades

lafourchette stopped short in the midst
of his impassioned entreaties then uttered
a joyous shout

i hear him i dalton has answered

ask him where he is i exclaimed

he doesnt know replied lafour-
chette after a moment they have been
taken out of the plane and are imprisoned
in a stone building on the side of a moun-
tain he says a cloud of smoke is visible
through the window to the southwest of him
he thinks they may be on the north-east
slopeof a volcano

north-east slope of a volcano i re-
peated that should be visible for quite
a distance keep in touch with him la-
fourchette and tell me whether his voice
grows louder or fainter dr von lichten
look out for the smoke cloud

lafourchette kept up his conversation
with dalton

ernst has recovered consciousness he
reported but is too weak to talk yet he
is not seriously injured however daltons
voice is louder he added i looked out
through the jriscope but could see no
smoke we were definitely over a mountain
range now the peaks of some extending a
mile or two above the ground i noted a
mighty snow-capped patriarch to the north

of us reaching almost to the clouds i
pulled the comets nose up a bit in order
to get a better view of the landscape still
no smoke was visible

wait cried lafourchette daltons
voice is growing fainter

we must have passed to one side of him
i said swinging about we dashed back
over our course coming abreast of the
high peak i had noted

it is loudest here said lafourchette
he is north or south of here then i
said we shall see which listen close-
ly i swung south toward the ocean but
lafourchette quickly called not this
way i swung about once more and head-
ed for the snow-capped mountain it could
not be long now i put on an extra burst
of speed and lafourchette reported
louder still no smoke was visible i
wondered what range our radio outfit had
we could see easily fifty miles ahead

at the volcanos edge

the comet sped over the big mountains
snowy tip a few hundred feet below
the lowest clouds a vast panorama lay
ahead of us wild rugged and uninhabited
we were nearing the northermost point on
the globe yet there was no evidence of ice
and snow such as we might expect the in-
ternal heat of the satellite kept its surface
at a nearly even temperature throughout
and the polar region was much like the
rest of it

far ahead on the dim horizon lay a
murky patch of haze wavering rising fall-
ing even as i realized what it was von
lichten shouted

the volcano dead ahead

the comet quivered as i speeded up an-
other notch the terrific wind-pressure
made it heard to handle and we skipped
about through little air-pockets a tiny
flying creature tried to cross our path and
was impaled on the ships pointed nose
the volcano drew closer its murky umbrel-
la of smoke stretching out toward us i
slackened speed now north-east slope
i muttered dropping down

hurry exclaimed lafourchette sud-


wonder stories

denly the ganymedians are coming for
dalton and ernst

the comet was close to the ground now
i spied the planes of the ganymedians near
a small stone building half-way up the
slope and drew up to it letting the landing
skids plow the ground without bothering
to reverse and stop automatics in hand
we jumped out as a crowd of ganymedians
left the building starting up the slope with
our comrades in their midst seeing that
they were pursued they broke into a run
dragging ernst and dalton with them i
tried to take aim for a shot but they were
a good hundred yards ahead and at that
distance there was grave danger of hitting
one of our party i sprinted madly lafour-
chette and von lichten at my heels bound-
ing in long steps up the slope i saw only
too clearly their diabolical intent-to push
the earth-men into the smoking crater

we were gaining slowly due to their dif-
ficulty in dragging our captive fellows as
the distance lessened i decided to risk a
shot when suddenly two dozen or more de-
tached themselves from the rest and turned
to meet us i pulled up and fired into their
midst as did the doctor and lafourchette
they divided flanking us and closed in
i fired carefully dropping a ganymedian
with each shot but there were too many
we were suddenly surrounded pinned to
the ground deprived of our guns tied and
carried to the others it all happened so
quickly we had not had time to think we
had stepped from the frying pan into the
fire

this promised to be literally true-too
true the five of us were dragged up the
slope of the volcano despite our frantic
struggles i watched with fascination the
heavy pall which hung over the mountain
top like a vast death-shroud shifting swirl-
ing as though beckoning us to our doom
the earth trembled beneath our feet a
streak of fire shot up from the craters rim
a fine hail of volcanic stone rained about
us covering the ground blackening the
surroundings

a shout of terror came from the fore-
most ganymedians i looked to see what

had alarmed them and beheld a tiny trick-
ling stream of lava spilling over the edge
of the crater snaking down toward us
with one accord the ganymedians fell to
their knees extending their arms in suppli-
cation toward the mountain-top as if -in
answer a great crack appeared in the rocky
rim above us and a torrent of red hot mol-
ten lava gushed out the ganymedians
turned and fled in utter rout leaving us
bound on the slope i strained at the metal
cords which fettered my arms trying to
free myself but to no avail the blazing
stream came closer writhing and twisting
like a living tongue of fire desperately i
struggled to rise

come over here called ernsts voice
weakly they didnt tie my hands i can
get you free i rolled over to where he
lay too weak to rise he pulled at the
knots of my bonds and after an eternity i
felt my hands come free i loosened the
cord about my feet then i dragged ernst
to the others and between us we managed
to free them before the smoking lava reached
us i picked up ernst like a sack of flour
light as he was and fled down the hill
bounding like a mountain goat i have no
doubt that we five broke all existing records
for rapid travel afoot in the quarter-mile
between us and the comet we scrambled
aboard as the stream of lava licked against
the stone house and shot into the air a few
seconds later

up above the clouds we rose blessing
mother nature for our second escape from
death by fire we climbed into the high
thin air where no ganymedian plane could
penetrate and set off northward toward the
city in the desert i say north yet that is
incorrect there was no north from that
spot looking behind us we could see jup-
iters half-illuminated face bisected by the
horizon ahead directly opposite him the
suns pale rays divided on the sky-line the
plane of the ecliptic dotted here and there
with the tiny lights of the outer planets
lay about us its whole circle visible on
the horizon we were over ganymedes north
pole marked almost exactly by the erupt-
ing volcano
the outpost on the moon



dr von lichten assumed a professional
attitude as soon as we were above the
ground he examined the lump on the
back of ernsts neck where the butt of a
ganymedian gun had struck him just be-
low his helmet his envelope had lessened
the stroke somewhat and beyond some slight
dizziness he felt no ill effects a dose of
stimulant put him on his feet in short or-
der and he quickly regained his usual
cheery disposition lafourchettes  knife
scratch showed signs of infection causing
the doctor some concern the diminutive
frenchman grudgingly submitted to treat-
ment calling von lichtens liberal applica-
tion of antiseptic war paint and making
light of the whole affair

we made good time to the city in the
desert and found the scientists plane wait-
ing for us they congratulated us on our
success in recapturing the comet and
planned a banquet for the morrow in honor
of our safe return meanwhile we grate-
fully retired to rooms prepared for us
and reveled in the blissful relaxation of
sleep

on arising we were visited by a delega-
tion who wished to hear the details of our
raid they listened with interest to the
story of dalton and ernsts capture and
our efforts to locate them when we men-
tioned the evident awe of our captors for
the erupting volcano they showed consider-
able amusement

that is but one of the superstitions of
those people they explained our race
has long known that the heat of our planet
came from within the ignorant ones be-
lieve that the interior of ganymede is the
home of a fiery demon pyros who rules
their destinies they make sacrifices to
him from time to time a custom which
we condemned during our rule the peri-
odic eruption of the several volcanoes on
this planet they interpret as manifestations
of pyros displeasure of late the north
polar volcano has been unusually active
and their two attempts to incinerate you
alive indicate that they took your arrival
to be the cause of its eruption

the hour of the banquet drew near and

tbe ganymedian name ib synonymous with the finger
character for fire

our visitors excused themselves saying they
would return shortly to escort us to the cel-
ebration on our departure from the moon
we had made no preparations for formal
entertainment and had to be satisfied with
a hasty shave and change of clothes la-
fourchette exhibited a flare for gaudy rai-
ment and blossomed out in a well-saved suit
of pre-war cut a two-inch standup collar
and a brilliant necktie of many colors a
sickly green boutonniere picked from a
ganymedian garden added the finishing
touch to a makeup which would have taken
first prize at any masquerade ball

we were escorted to the banquet hall
where the leading scientists of the city were
gathered someone with courteous fore-
sight had prepared stools for us while the
ganymedians as usual seated themselves
dog-fashion in a great circle on cushions
food was served on little individual stands
placed before the diners by servants of
the uneducated race captured during battles
on our left sat the ganymedians with whom
we had conversed frequently and next to
him a venerable old fellow who presided
over the affair he had recently celebrated
his thousandth sunset and held in his
domed cranium the wisdom of the ages
during the progress of the dinner he made
a long speech in which according to the
interpretation of our friend he discoursed
at length of our daring accomplishments in
traversing four hundred million miles of
interplanetary space and defeating unaided
a host of their enemies at each pause in
his finger gymnastics the listeners threw
their arms in the air in silent applause and
turned admiring glances in our direction
when at length some sort of reply was evi-
dently expected of us i requested our in-
terpreter to announce that the possibility
of the trip and the credit for it belonged
to the men who had remained behind-
dr forscher wiley langley and quaile
in reply the orator declared that credit
would be given them for their theories but
to those who had taken the risks belonged
the glory

ure is xx or  ganymedian days each

the return

after the meal we were informed that
for our special benefit there would be
a moving picture of life and happenings on
ganymede at one end of the hall a cur-
tain was withdrawn exposing a translucent
screen it seemed that the apparatus for
projecting pictures was an elaboration of
their television machines there was the
usual receiving apparatus except that in-
stead of being connected to an antenna
which picked electromagnetic waves out of
the ether the impulses were recorded on a
fine tape and reproduced by a needle which
followed its markings

the scenes which flashed on the screen
dealt for the most part with industrial oper-
ations in and aroundthe great city there
were views of the great plants where nitro-
gen was removed from the air and fixed
for use in fertilizing the sterile desert
others showed the water works where hy-
drogen was recovered from decaying plants
from the air and every other conceivable
source burned in oxygen and the resulting
steam condensed and doled out through
pipes to the houses of the city the farms and
other places where it was required it was
one of the most expensive substances in the
economics of this city of scientists which
accounted in large measure for their desire
to return to the ocean-front in another
view we saw the governments great nurs-
ery where the eggs were hatched and the
young reared given their elementary train-
ing and fitted for life on reaching maturity

their period of growth was about ten
years at which age they were considered
adults and expected to take part in the
maintenance of their civilization consider-
ing the short span of their life we were
amazed to realize how thorough was their
education and how rapid their progress
the facts and principles which require eight
years of elementary schooling in america
were absorbed by these youngsters in two
or three from that point each individual
specialized in some line for which he was
considered suitable and his intensive train-

ing enabled him to reach the mental caliber
of our average technical school graduate
before his three hundred and fiftieth sun-
set

finally the banquet adjourned and in
company with our interpreter and a few
others we returned to our quarters the
scientists were anxious to discuss the sub-
ject which had been broached when they
rescued us and brought us there namely
the enlistment of aid from mankind in their
war to regain possession of the lands held
by their enemies as usual the interview
was carried on in the simplified english we
had taught them the interpreter came to
the point without formalities

you have seen pictures of the way in
which we struggle for existence he wrote
our supply of water is expensive and in-
adequate and the food is not much better
our race is badly nourished and in the
few generations we have existed in the
desert there are signs of physical deterior-
ation we ask help-armies and equip-
ment you five earth-men are strong intel-
ligent and resourceful you have given us
the secret of one powerful weapon and you
tell us there are others with a few thou-
sand beings like you armed as you are it
would be a simple matter to put the enemy
to rout give us this aid-enlist a force
of men and arm them teach us to build
ships like that in which you came and we
will be forever indebted to you in return
we can show you the construction of our
television apparatus our high-powered air-
planes and many other devices of which we
know our two races can exchange ambas-
sadors and maintain communication we
can pool our scientific knowledge and to-
gether rule the universe

acting as spokesman for the party i re-
plied we realize your situation fully and
so far as it is within our power we will help
you however you must understand that
we came to ganymede not as the accredited
representatives of a planet but as five
scientists exploring the solar system we
are backed at best by a colony of research-
ers numbering but a few hundred members
under the direction of the man who has the

ganymedian somewhat less than  years 
the outpost

on the moon



sole right to say who shall copy our
machine the implements of war known to
us we will describe to you willingly and
we will promise to inform the people of
earth of your request for assistance but we
must confer with dr forscher our superior
before giving you the secret of the comet
after a short discussion of my message
by our interviewers the interpreter wrote
we receive your promise with pleasure
and will respect your wishes we ask fur-
ther only that you make haste to send us
what aid you can meanwhile during the
remainder of your stay this city is yours
to inspect and our people at your com-
mand with which announcement the
scientists arose and took their leave

my first thought was to inspect the
comet i went over it from stem to
stern testing the apparatus and checking
up on our supplies i found to my chagrin
that we had unwittingly left the machinery
for renewing the air running during our
stay on the satellite with the result that it
now held barely enough chemicals for our
return trip on making inquiries i discov-
ered that the mineral salts necessary for the
manufacture of potassium chlorate from
which our oxygen was derived lay close to
the ocean and we were unable to obtain
them it was therefore imperative that we
start back as soon as possible

we had spent altogether about eight ter-
restrial weeks among this strange race the
satellite was past its nearest approach to
the earth and would not reach that point
again for another five days but the addi-
tional distance would mean only a few
hours more travel furthermore the earth
and moon had reached their least distance
from jupiter before our start and each days
delay increased the intervening space ac-
cordingly we bade the ganymedian scien-
tists a hasty farewell climbed aboard and
turned our nose skyward i picked up the
earth in the periscope and turned on the full
force of acceleration this time our course
angled away from jupiter and we did not
experience the annoying disturbance of his
magnetic field soon the giant planet with
his system of attendants was dropping

away behind us as we flashed along through
the ether in our little shell cut off from the
entire universe

five days ticked by on our clocks the
monotony of the trip held its sway over
the group causing us to cast about for di-
version dalton suggested that we draw up
a map of ganymede from the data we had
procured indicating our route on it the
idea was adopted at once i was elected to
do the drafting the others contributing sug-
gestions as the work went along the final
result was sketchy due to our meager knowl-
edge of the country around the ocean but
it would serve to give dr forscher and his
staff an idea of the physical characteristics
of the little world we discussed plans for
equipping an expedition to take part in the
wars of ganymede and day-dreamed over
the future relations of the two worlds some
of us imagining ourselves as diplomatic re-
presentatives to their government in future
years

on the twelfth day a shadow crept over
our high spirits lafourchette coming off
duty in the pilot hours complained that he
felt poorly dr von lichtens examination
disclosed the fact that his knife scratch was
badly infected the doctor ordered him to
bed at once and treated the reddened sore

at the next meal he felt no better refus-
ing food dr von lichten seemed worried
and at his suggestion we withdrew to the
engine room leaving lafourchette to sleep
quietly the doctor made no response to
our questions busying himself with his
medicine case and presently joining la-
fourchette his  elaborate precautions
against unknown bacteria in the atmosphere
of ganymede came to my mind could it be
that the little frenchman had contracted a
strange malady peculiar to that world the
idea was not comforting we had faced
death at the hands of our captors incinera-
tion in the crater of the volcano or even the
risk of annihilation by a wandering meteoric
rock without a qualm these were tangi-
ble things to be foreseen and understood
but the torturing anguish of an unknown
disease was enough to sicken the strongest
heart


wonder stories

presently von lichten appeared in the
doorway his face grave

what is it was asked in chorus

i do not know replied the doctor with
a gesture of helplessness the infection
has spread through his whole system in-
flaming the muscles which cramp his whole
body in spite of my efforts he grows rap-
idly worse so far his heart has not been
touched if it should be-

cant-we do something i demanded
the disease must be known to the gany-
medians why not head about and take him
back

it would be useless returned the doc-
tor we have been on our way nearly
two weeks his malady is progressing very
rapidly if he is to be saved through medi-
cal aid it must be at once in forty-eight
hours it will be too late

is it as serious as that asked dalton in
a whisper

i fear so he is very weak his breath-
ing is shallow and rapid with a strong
man it might be different we can only
hope for the best meanwhile significant-
ly no one save myself must go near him
you jyill be safer in the control room

but what of your own risk demanded
ernst

that is the physicians lot said the doc-
tor shortly i shall take every precau-
tion

he reentered the living quarters leaving
us to face one another in despair from his
conservative habits of speech i knew he had
not exaggerated the seriousness of lafour-
chettes condition

a tragedy in space

the door reopened dr von lichten
was a haggard ghost of his usual self
his face was drawn and gray his bloodshot
eyes stared from hollowed pits surmounting
blotchy circles which bespoke the ordeal
he had passed through he spread his hands
in a gesture of finality

gone whispered ernst the doctor
nodded

fifteen minutes ago it was hopeless

may we see him asked dalton

i think not he is-unrecognizable
there was a moment of ghastly silence
while the clock ticks jarred on our ears like
pistol shots von lichten pulled himself
together with a visible effort

we must get the body out he said
overboard protested dalton surely
he deserves a decent burial on earth

the risk of contagion is too great said
von lichten he understood

we stood in the air lock with its outer
door opened to the emptiness beyond our
envelopes hiding the emotions which filled
the four of us as we watched a shapeless
bundle drift slowly out of sight the mar-
velous courage of the dead man commanded
our utmost respect lying there in the
darkness of the comets close quarters he
had known that the life he loved and en-
joyed had but a few minutes to run that
he stood on the brink of a precipice which
was crumbling even as he spoke to plunge
him into the silent blank timeless eternity
of non-existence yet he had faced the
thought of his body being tumbled into
nothingness to wander through the solar
system drifting on and on-

back in the engine room dr von lichten
examined each of us for the slightest sign of
infection but found none to keep busy
we set about a general overhauling of the
comet we checked over the apparatus
carefully and cleaned and polished the ma-
chine throughout working like beavers we
asked only to be busy

at the end of thirty-four days we were
within three million miles of the earth and
its satellite as the hour approached when
we would turn on the power for our final
stop i fancied the colony on the moon pre-
paring for our return in all probability
quaile would be sweeping the skies in the
direction of jupiter with the hundred foot
telescope seeking the tiny blue-yellow
streak in his eye-piece which would herald
our return

the four of us awaited our arrival no
less anxiously than the members of the col-
ony our supplies were nearly gone and
the oxygen would not last over forty-eight
hours we should reach the moon in twen-
ty-two and be safe in the colony in two
the outpost on the moon



more twenty-four hours at the outside be-
fore we were to see the faces of our col-
leagues

we stood alternate watches in pairs as we
neared our destination the moon was not
yet full but it was past a line from our
vessel to the earth since the latter was two
months advanced beyond conjunction with
jupiter the direction of our flight carried
us toward the center of the moons disc a
tiny circle of blackness among the stars

half a million miles out somewhat less
than ten hours before our scheduled land-
ing ernst and i sat before the instrument
board i noted with a start that one of the
generators was running hot and hurried to
investigate the insulation of the armature
was giving way under the strain of many
hours running at full load i recalled the
sight of the tractor which had burnt out its
generators and flashed away into the sky
a mass of white hot steel i must cool off
the driver at once but to do so the electrical
apparatus must carry an extra load for a
moment

would they stand it obviously better
now than later i stepped up the rheostat
a notch their whine rose half a tone then
fell in slow diminuendo i pushed the con-
troller another notch the roaring gas grew
quieter like the baffled voice of a dying
tempest in another second it would be un-
der control one more notch the over-
heated generator resigned its task in a
blinding flash automatically the others
took up its load groaning under the in-
creased flow of current but they carried
it the driver cooled easing the strain on
the electrical apparatus  drew a breath
of relief

the burned-out generator had filled the
comet with smoke bringing the others
of the party at a run in answer to their
excited questions i explained our situation
we had three generators left to do the work
of four our deceleration must be cut to
three-fourths of normal after covering the
remaining half-million miles to the moon
we would still be speeding along at a pace
sufficient to outstrip the fastest bullet it
was out of the question to land here we

must steer past and continue slowly down
until we could return

but was there time the vital supplies
of oxygen were perilously low our margin
of safety was too small i peered out of the
periscope toward our fast approaching satel-
lite noticeably larger now a quarter of
a million miles further on gleaming cheer-
fully in the sunlight lay the only way out
of our difficulties-the earth we could
dive into the welcoming blanket of its at-
mosphere let it check our fall and coast to
the ground where we chose safe and among
friends at the city college our burned
out generator could be repaired and our
oxygen tanks recharged then we could
return to the moon at our leisure the
comets flaming tail would announce our
safety to dr forschers colony and from
our velocity and direction an astronomer
of quailes caliber could easily compute
our destination they would know that we
had sufficient reason for not landing on the
moon and would expect our return in good
time

meanwhile a question remains what of
our promise to interest the earth in sending
aid to the ganymedian scientists i cannot
visualize the governments of europe and
america lending ear to such a proposal nor
would i advocate detailing their armies
the majority of mankind is opposed to in-
terfering in affairs which do not concern
us and to send troops against their will
hundreds of millions of miles from their
homes would be a colossal injustice

nevertheless i am giving this message
to the world in the hope that it will be read
by some in whom the spirit of the pioneers
many linger i have spared no details of
our trip and the discoveries which made it
possible so that my readers may understand
the situation fully if they wish to see the
scientists of ganymede restored to control
of their planet they may lend a hand in
putting them there

the prospect is at once alluring and ter-
rifying they will find new and exhilarat-
ing sensations in striding as though in seven
league boots across hills and valleys cov-
ered with plants and animals which might
have materialized from the smoke of an

opium pipe they will behold wonders of
the starry heavens such as are never seen
from the earth but they will meet with
the hatred of four-legged foes possessed of
human intelligence and inhuman fiendish-
ness and they must beware of the attacks of
microscopic enemies

but i do not wish to act as a recruiting
officer let those whose love of adventure

surpasses their fear of the unknown decide
the matter each for himself they may
find me among them-i cannot tell as yet
perhaps dr forscher has other plans for
me

you read them dalton ernst dr von lich-
ten and i will be on our way back to the

uncle let me introduce mr wand foo the
owner of the resica falls property the
place is for sale and the price is low and i
have half a notion you could buy it

the east stroudsburg philanthropist
looked at the oriental in a very interested
manner

you have him all tied up abe

sure he has a habit of arguing and i
want to be sure that i always come out on
top-of the argument

	 

the president of the united states was
closeted with two of the greatest physicians
in america they had come at his request
to tell him the latest developments in the
philadelphia epidemic to their chagrjn
they were forced to admit that so far both
the cause and the cure of the disease were
unknown to them the sleepers were still
asleep and the weaker of them had wasted
away even the stoutest of them would soon
die of malnutrition

in came the private secretary there
were whispered conferences at last the
president yielded and the secretary left the
room to return instantly followed by the
chief of the secret service a weary looking
detective and between them a chinaman in
soiled clothes securely tied in every possible
direction

mr president began the chief this
is mr abe summers one of our men and

he has a story to tell you about this china-
man i though you would be interested
summers told the tale from start to fin-
ish parts he glossed over and he never did
explain why the chinaman could not walk
he ended by placing a bottle of the sleep
producing drug on the table and alongside
he placed the bottle of little tablets and
several ten cubic centimeter syringes filled
with the sodium bicarbonate solution
when he finished a physician sighed

i wish we had thought of that it sounds
plausible the story explains why certain
portions of the philadelphia community
were not affected like other parts some of
the reservoirs are filled from the schuylkill
instead of from the delaware with the
drugs in our hands we should have no
trouble in identifying them and then it is
only a question of time before we can inject
the sleepers those who are not too far
gone can still be saved the country owes
you a vote of thanks mr summers

you can pay me best by keeping out of
it i just did what i was ordered by the
chief to do but there are two things i
want to do i like the resica falls proper-
ty and if i can be made owner of it in some
way it will please me immensely and then
i have been carting mr wand foo around
a long time and i wish some one would
take him off my hands he needs hospital
care and after that he should be kept safe
he is really not a pleasant man to have
loose

a flight into time

continued from page 

if youll time us please sir by your
watch to get it exact- the assistant was
almost apologetic

ted pulled out his timepiece-just two
minutes before noon through the wires
and metal tubing anne stretched her hand
he squeezed it hard one minute left the
plates on the outside began to glow not
from heat but electrically with a strange
coldness that gripped him paralyzingly

he looked down at his watch following
the second hand around just as he had done
before his other time jump it seemed end-
lessly slow thirty-forty-five-fifty-five
-fifty-six-seven-eight-

there he said it quite calmly in
his ears was a whirring that changed to the
toot of a ferry-boat whistle as he went
sprawling to the pavement he rose and
found himself grasping an arm a prosaic
th century arm he had returned

pardon mehe automatically impor-
tuned the man who had collided with him--
an italian in rough clothes apparently some
sort of dock worker but the man only hur-
ried around the corner

it was not until storrs got back to his
room having decided to excuse himself
later for failing our appointment and
found two of us waiting for him in consid-
erable agitation that he discovered that this
was tuesday and he had most likely ap-
peared to the italian out of thin air-that
there is an absolute time which will not be
cheated out of so much as three days his
watch which he had held in his hand was
apparently uninjured by the fall but never-
theless had stopped dead at twelve exact

a jeweller took the thing apart without
finding anything wrong and when he put it
back together just as it was before it ran
again ever since however it has kept exe-
crable time and stops on the least provoca-
tion the double disturbance in its native
element of time must somehow have para-
lyzed it

such is the story of the vision of ted
storrs if it had been anyone else i

should have been inclined to doubt the nar-
rative in spite of its realistic semblance and
detail but give ted a thousand years and
he could never invent half the tale espec-
ially the way he has given it to us bit by
bit in answer to our questions besides
how else explain what happened to his
watch

as i said at first i suppose the thing
could have happened only to storrs or
another like him if someone with scienti-
fic knowledge had made the trip someone
who could observe and learn could under-
stand and remember the things ted never
noticed either the apparatus for sending him
back would not have worked or it would
have been a motor truck he collided with on
his return to our world otherwise if he
came back and reproduced things a hundred
years before they were invented they could
not be invented because they would be al-
ready known and he would have learned in
the future of his miraculous discovery of
them which he did not

and yet for all such theory the thing is
maddening surely he could have brought
back something some secret which would
disappear when he died like the lost ancient
arts of tempering metal or the premature
knowledge of roger bacon there are so
many little things he might have got the
secret of cold light or of that fog-piercing
ray or to ask only a little of fate the for-
mula for the cosmetic that must have been
used to stop the tanning at any stage

but storrs would not-or perhaps in the
grand scheme of things could not-learn
these or dozens of other things he never
thought of what he might bring back even
after he had learned that return was pos-
sible he does not seem to realize the
chances he missed instead all he talks
about when we bring up the subject which
is not often now is the cleanness and fine-
ness the beauty as well as the utility of
twenty-second century civilization

i wonder sometimes if that really might
not be the heart of his vision

yourself with brandy the reptile had stolen
from its hiding place wrapped its strong
body about mcfees stalwart scottish neck
and crushed the life out of him

the next night everybody was safe we
suspended guard because we had caught the

precaution saved some of us finding no

and attempted to defend himself but this
further enraged the reptile and it attacked
him again and again with its beak

fortunately the thing was so angry that
it must have forgotten to use its tail and
so cornelius has a remote chance of living

mean to tell me he said in anger to our
explanations  that you have suppressed
this most important piece of evidence from
me had i known about this i could have
cleared the matter up in no time and prob-
ably saved much of this expenditure of life
obviously the parrot was killed by the
brute it settled on the cage and when it
couldnt reach the bird with its long beak
it inserted the tail between the bars of the
cage and poisoned the parrot

i am sorry to destroy your last remain-
ing piece of deduction marshal merrivale
put in the professor dryly but i made an
autopsy of the parrot before we threw the
body overboard and it was perfectly clear
the blessed thing died of old age aggravated
by the atmosphere of the moonship

	  

oh cornelius did he recover rather

the sun and it energy

editor science questions and answers

if as soientists claim space is a vacuum or ab-
sence of air how then does the sun burn  has it
an atmosphere t and if so how is it that it has not
been exhausted in these millions and millions of years
that it has been burning

in how many years will the sun be exhausted and
how much mass does it lose each year

heat does not come simply from burning in the
sense of uniting with oxygen the heating of an
electric wire to incandescence for example as found
in electric lamps has nothing to do with that kind of
burning in fact the globe must be carefully exhausted
of air before it is sealed heat is created in many
ways all by the transformation of one kind of en-
ergy into heat energy a meteor striking our at-
mosphere is burned up yet no oxygen or air is used
in the process the burning up is caused by friction
the friction of the rapid passage of the meteor
through the atmosphere

scientists assume that the primary heat of the sun
was obtained by the condensation of its mass the
terrific pressure accompanying this contraction caus-
ing the gases to flame into incandescence and the
continued condensation keeping the mass at incan-
descence according to one authority a contraction
of only  feet in the solar diameter each year
would be sufficient to account for its radiation of
heat	

bat recent authorities have stated that such contrac-
tion continued over millions and millions of years

would inevitably have shrunk our sun much more than
it has the present explanation is that within tne
solar interior matter is being broken down and re-
built and in the process atomic energy is being re-
leased in the form of radiant energy heat light
ultra-violet light cosmic rays etc naturally the
enormous stores of energy released by even small
quantities of disintegrated and rebuilt matter would
explain how the sun kept burning as it has for tril-
lions of years according to eddington the sun is
losing  billion tons of its mass each year which
is the source of this transformed energy of this
energy the earth receives one two-billionth the sun
can keep on as it has for some fifteen billion years
without serious danger-editor

escaping gravitation

i cosmic rays are believed to be produced in
distant nebulae where matter is subject to such gi-
gantic pressures and temperatures in the birth throes
of great worlds the temperatures reaching two tril-
lion degrees centigrade that the very electrons and
protons themselves are both destroyed and rebuilt

into another and energy is frequently given out in

penetrating radiation which we call cosmic ray the
only possible use found for them so far is the elec-
troscope of millikan he uses a device which can
test the intensity of cosmic rays on the earths sur-
face at any moment and since this intensity varies
with the amount of atmosphere above the instrument
the atmosphere allows more or less of them to pene-
trate through at varying times he can get an index
of the shifting of the atmosphere and so of possible
weather conditions it is suggested that cosmic rays
might also be harnessed as power or used to trans-
mute elements for us but as yet these ideas are still in
a very speculative stage

	we have - never been able to determine the
speed of gravitation if it is a form of electromag-
netic energy as einstein postulated then it should
travel at approximately the speed of light it is be-
lieved also that its speed is infinite that it acts in-
stantaneously in any case an object having mass
and traveling at the speed of light would find by
the einstein principle its masb had become infinite
and therefore its kinetic energy would be infinite
it would be by that virtue beyond the power of any
ordinary heavenly body to attract it velocities

the same principle has been used on airplanes to
support them without wings as shown in the illus-
tration propellers carry the craft forward through
the air the air rushes toward the two rotating cyl-
inders if the cylinders are rotated clockwise
as seen from our view there will be a diminution of
air pressure above them and an increase below these
two forces will act to support the plane the scien-
tific principle outlined here is called the magnus

editor science questions and answers

for a number of days a group of my friends and
myself have been discussing an astronomical question
which has progressed into quite a debate i am writ-
ing to you in the hope that you may find time to
answer the following question if you find it of
sufficient general interest you may publish it in vour
splendid magazine wonder stories i would
consider it a great compliment

j jonld be indebted to you for a prompt answer
as  fear our group discussion will soon progress to

illustration of an airplane which is
sustained in the air by the magnus
effect the rotor cylinders revolve
in a clockwise direction which
causes a current of air to circle
with the rotors in that direction
due to the motion of the plane
there is a current of air from
front to rear by these two ef-
fects the pressuaj of air above the
rotors is reduced and that below
is increased the net effect is to
get a sustaining force to hold up
tbe rotors and therefore the plane
used horizontally instead of verti-
cally this magnus effect propels

the flettner rotor-ship

editor science questions and answers-

i recently engaged in a fruitless argument con-
cerning the method of propulsion used by dr flett-
ner in his rotor ship the baden baden it was my
contention that the vacuum caused by the rotating
towers was the only force used but my opponents
claimed that the power from the wind was used to
turn an ordinary propeller who is right f
f j macoauley

riverhead n y

neither of you is exactly right the ship operated
in the following manner the two towers which
were only upright cylinders of metal were rotated by
auxiliary power in the ship the ship was turned
so that it was broadside to the wind the rotation
of the towers caused the air about it to rotate with
it now on one side of the towers the rotating air
moved in the same direction as the wind and there
was a diminution of pressure which caused a partial
vacuum on the other side the rotation of the air
opposed the direction of the wind and the pressure
increased now the cylinders were rotated se that
the vacuum was caused at the front of the cylinders
and the augmented pressure in back with these two
forces the ship was pushed forward naturally the
wind was necessary for the propulsion and the ship
had occasionally to be turned as the sails of a boat

the point of blows unless the question is satisfactorily
bottled

we know that the earth is hurtling through space
in its orbit at about  miles per second what we
wish to know is if the sun is a stationary body or if
it moves and if so does it follow a certain orbit or
is it a freely moving body in space

h	d shafer s b

 hyde park blvd

so far as we know there is no body in space that
is absolutely stationary assuming that an absolute
point of reference can he found to determine whether
it is in motion or not certainly a stationary body
would presuppose one that was at the exact center
of gravity of the entire universe or was under
such a balance of forces from all other bodies in
the universe that it did not move a stationary body
is under general principles an anomaly our earth
as part of the solar system revolves about the sun
to keep itself out of the suns gravitational grasp
our sun is one of the millions of suns in the galac-
tic system known as the milky way now just as
the solar planets are attracted to each other and to
the sun so the galactic suns are attracted to each
other evidence seems to indicate that the whole
galaxy of stars which is the milky way is rotating
about its center of gravity and since the sun lies

editor wonder stories

the reading of an article of yours in a current
magazine on space flying stirred up an argument
between me and a friend of mine he declares no
rocket has ever attained an appreciable height where-
as i am under the impression that prof goddard has
designed a rocket which rose  miles can you
settle this for me

also sir i would be very much obliged to you jf
you could inform me where i could get the designs
and mathematics on rockets such as goddards and
yon opels my own calculations convince me that
a rocket can be built using liquid hydrogen and oxy-
gen as fuel which will fly to the moon and return
with a passenger provided it can be designed to have
at lease  efficiency there are several minor de-
sign problems which stop me so far and perhaps the
consideration of other mens work will help me a
lot you see i nourish an ambition to be the first
man to fly to the moon

any information you can give me will he much
appreciated

the rocket bhot of professor robert h goddard on
july   ascended to our best information a
few hundred feet the rocket on which dr goddard
is spending his time now under a grant of 
by the late daniel guggenheim is expected to rise
some three hundred miles for meteorological and other
exploration	v

there is no record to our knowledge of any rocket
rising to a higher altitude than goddards the ex-
periments that have been conducted thus far have
not been aimed at the attaining of altitude but firt
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the rocket principle
of propulsion and second to the finding of a means
of utilizing the various types of fuel

a letter from the german interplanetary society
appearing in these columns in the january issue indi-
cates the line of approach they are taking we venture
to predict that as soon as the fundamental problems
of design and engineering are accomplished altitude
records will be made and broken every month

the only published technical work of goddard is the
result of his early clark university experiments and
appears in the smithsonian institution miscellaneous
collections in this article entitled a method of
reaching high altitudes he gives some very interest-
ing figures on his accomplishments up to 

the other major works are those of hermann oberth
the leading german experimenter and robert esnault-
pelterie the french engineer both of these men have
outlined in great detail the science of space traveling
basing their conclusions on extensive mathematical
calculations the german book is entitled methods
for traveling through interplanetary space and the
french work is called  a xtronautics neither of
these has been translated

the american interplanetary society  west
nd street new york has been acting as a clear-
ing house in north america for all interplanetary
questions and we siiggest that mr myers communi-
cate with them both goddard and pelterie are
members of thib society the society has as its
aim the stimulation of men such as mr myers who
wish to make contributions to space travel and it is
now undertaking a campaign of research on the rock-
et that should be of great interest to those interested
in the question

we are happy to note the increasing interest in
interplanetary travel by men such as mr myerb wo
believe that great progress will be made and astound-
ing discoveries result when a great number of ma-
ture seriously-minded trained technicians and ex-
perimenters set to work to solve the many vexing
problems under the leadership of an organization
such as the american interplanetary society many
of these new discoveries may emanate-editor

editor wonder stories

in the may issue of wonder stories you pud-
libhed an article by mr dilworth luptou of the first
unitarian church of cleveland i take pleasure in
enclosing another interesting little tribute to science
which this scientist-minibter nas written it should be
of interest to you especially as it deals with the
word wonder which is the foundation of science and
the basis of wonder stories it expresses the
ideas of a man who reconciles science and religion
allan p stern

 lincoln blvd

cleveland heights ohio

the word wonder has two variant meanings it
may signify either curiosity or awe in the first sense
wonder is the souroe of much of mans scientifio
research and achievement in the second bense-as
awe-wonder is one of the vital elements of reli-
gious faith and life

science was born in mans prehistoric past it
was born when his curiosity first impelled him to un
derstand himself and the world in which he lived
often curiosity took him up blind alleyb of supersti-
tion and myth but eventually it led him to the high-
ways of knowledge and reality aristotle was the fa-
ther of modern science his spirit was lost to the world
for nineteen centuries but it reappeared with the
coming of copernicus only four hundred years ago

science-child of mans wonder-has empowered
him not only to penetrate many of the mysteries qf
stars and atoms man is finally turning the light of
science on himself he has discovered his antiquity-
not  years as the schoolmen taught-but at least
a half million years he has discovered the higher
cortex of his brain one-half ounce of gray matter
containing nine billion separate but interacting cells
man through science is now delving into the mysteries
of his own mind and behavior both personal and so-
cial

where will mans curiosity lead him an attempt
to anbwer that question would require the imagina-
tion of a wells or a jules verne only four centuries
of modern science lie behind us ahead of us-well
sir james jeans calculates mans future life on earth
to be at least a million million years

a million million years    that figure is impossible
to grasp but sir james helps us with an analogy
consider he says the length of cleopatras needle
as representing the age of the earth roughly a bil-
lion years place on top of the needle a penny-that
denotes the time humanity existed prior to the era of
civilization on top of the penny put a postage stamp
-the thickness of the stamp represents five thousand
years of civilization then continue piling up stamps
until you reach a height equivalent to the summit of
mont blanc there  now you have a glimpse of
the meaning of a million million years 

what will such an unimaginable period of time
mean in terms of scientific investigation and achieve-
ment wliat will be discovered in the fields of physics

for good or ill    in these words lies the destiny
of mankind a destiny not only in the keeping of
science but even more in the keeping of religion that

as a regular reader of science fiction magazines
from the time i discovered them on the bookstalls

ently attained in your stories h g wells and jules

ly i may venture to say previously unknown to the
reading public to earn equally well-merited encomiums
by their ingenuity skill and imagination in exploring
the vast hinterland of well-nigh unlimited possibilities
beyond

it is a difficult task where so many are deserving

more for special mention but please present bouquets

this tribute to american authors coming especially
from a countryman of h g wells ia all the more
appreciated science fiction is largely a matter of
having some new viewpoint on the relationship be-
tween future science and mankind and because there
i no monopoly of ideas in the brains of any group
of men we continually encourage men of imagination
and literary ability to write science fiction by this
means we have been able to develop a number of
first-rate authors to the benefit of the authors and
readers jointly we are surethat mr coles words

sexual education needed

editor wonder stories

many readers kick about the size of the magazine

riickness of paper size of the print etc but personally
believe this is a matter of the publishers and not
 the public the content of the magazine is what
we should be interested in and we should confine our
viewpoints and criticism to that and not to the form
in which it is published

if the publishers decide to better the form well and
good this i note you have been doing and it shows
good judgment on your part when the readers noted
your open-minded policy of improving the magazine
wherever possible they immediately took a personal in-
terest and tried to better the form along with the con-
tent but i was always under the impression that a
readers column was for the viewpoint of the readers
on the contents of the magazine was i right
i another point that i want to make is that many of
the stories by your authors seem to be incomplete
that is they are devoid of the sexual problem which
no doubt future races will have to contend with as
we do today

cant your authors give ub bome scientific solution
to this problem when they write about races of peo-
ple a million years hence

never once has it been mentioned in all your stor-
ies and every time i finish such a btory i stop with
disappointment because i feel that something was
missing sexual education without a sensual influ-
ence is what is needed

one thing about our human mind is that after wo
learn about a thing and understand it we try to apply
the knowledge so it is with a scientific sexual edu-
cation and this will in time elevate man from the ani-
mal level to a higher sphere of life where he would be
now if it were not for the primitive instinct born in
him-namely to reproduce and carry on his race

science in the future will play an important part on
this subject and i often wondered when reading stor-
ies of future and superior races i the authors ever
thought about this at all

donald hendrixbon

 watterson st

cinccinnatti ohio

mr hendrixson opens up a question that is not
only important to us but probably of interest to every
one who lives it is true that not many authors have
touched on it deeply in the utopias that have been
written the relation between the sexeb is deemed of
uch importance that the state tries to regulate it by
arranging eugenic unions this of course is artificial
for it takes no account of those intaneible things such
as natural affinity sympathy love and emotional com-
patibility in these pictures of utopias the individual
happiness is subordinated to the benefit to the state
that ib supposed to come from eugenic children

russia is now trying an immense experiment in the
jlations between the sexes by permitting the easiest
possible form of divorce-only the desire of the par-

ties to be divorced is necessary the point of view of
one of the russian psychologists in charge of this work
is that we western nations spend too much time think-
ing about sex because we are repressed and inhibit-
ed if marriage and divorce are made easy and peo-
ple can experiment with finding a suitable mate the
russians say then people will not hesitate to marry
early get their sexual problems solved for the time be-
ing and then devote their energies to more important
matters

the experiment is too young to indicate whether it is

new philosophy of sex is having on young russians
certainly the russians are tampering with very explo-
sive forces the only thing we can do is to watch
their experiment and see what it leads to

there is no doubt that we western nations are sex-
ridden and -that the problems brought up by sex are
always with us experimental marriages free love
separate homes for the man and wife- are all being
tried with no definite results we would be foolish to
expect that such a vital and age-old problem could be
solved for the masses by a few young experimenters

however it is quite difficult to put much emphasis
on the deeper relations between the sexes in a bcience
fiction story the story then becomes too psychologi-
cal

if any of our readers have any ideas as to what
future races will do about it we will be glad to hear
them our policy of open discussion columns means

a science-fictionists religion

editor wonder siories

it is a far cry from singapore to new york and
on down to havana but i have since the advent of
wonder stories traversed that long and glorious
road in each city and hamlet finding a copy of the
magazine today i pieked a copy of the book up on a
news stand on el prado in havana and saw the sug-
gestion of the editor that i say something more regard-
ing this religious belief that i have built up around the
tudy of science and the reading of science fiction

i cannot cut this short and really do justice to it
but perhaps a short explanation will suffice yet how
tm i to accomplish this when i have gone just a little
woozy with the fifth glass of beer during the course
of the afternoon then not being temperate i up-

rse you think i am not sincere in this religious belief
positively ami i have lived in the darkness of des-
pair when everything turned literally black and my
senses reeled as if some gigantic monster had stood
before me	

but after having trained the imagination to give
credit to the things that are probable but not in direct
evidence i have felt that just beyond the thin veil that
hangs between us and the vastness of the eternal there
atands something more powerful than all the armies of
the earth in the darkness when i almost cringed like
n weakling and hoped for the peace of death some-
thing reached out and took hold of my- soul and told
me that i had nothing to fear

i have gone the pace of the wastrel fool and have
made fairly good in business only to lose out again
and have to start all over and never onoe in my life
in any port in this world even when i saw mv last
five-cent piece go across the bar for a glass of beer
did i have to worry because i realized that this in-
finite intelligence that stands just beyond the veil and
looks across is at our service

this thing cannot be truly understood without the
training that science and science faction gives us it
takes imagination to perceive a real god i think
the unimaginative accepts what others hand down to
him tho orthodox the second-handed ravings of fan-
aticism but one who sees for himself cannot be mis-
taken at least after a few trials and ill try my
deity out before accepting it just as i would prove
anything else before accepting it when i am trying
to get over should have several pages at least but per-
haps this will do after sounding out everything with
the aid of scienoe fiction and science after looking
at what isand what is probable and looking for what
is not i realize the gigantic mystery that life is
al i arrive at the conclusion that it is so deep a
mystery that we cannot hope to solve it

it is too gigantic for words we are ot capable of
knowing more than our highest intelligence tells us
so we forget the problem of mystery and realize that
we are not supposed to know what it is all about
we stop believing in santa claus and accept the whole
as a mystery beyond us and vet we cannot be mis-
taken that the hand of tho infinite-or something
-reaches across the veil to still the turmoil of the
aoul and give us the peace that passeth understanding

we are not big enough to conceive infinite time and
space we are likely cogs in tho wheel though af-
ter training-it takes a lot of training-we come to

mr newtons experiences fighting between doubt
and faith are very interesting because they are simi-
lar to what thousands of people pass through natur-
ally we are not competent to pass upon his conclusions
no one is religion is such a personal matter that
one can sum up the thing by saying if you know the
truth of existence if you have an understanding of
the world and are freed from superstition and ignor-
ance then any religious faith that you embrace no
matter what its nature or even the lack of a faith
is the best thing for you

the belief that science can learn the most intimate
secrets of the universe is now being demolished-and
by scientists men like eddington jeans and ein-
stein are telling us that there are certain things we
will never know that materialism does not satisfy man
and that -he must have a certain amount of faith to
make hi life complete the cycle of agnosticism athe-
ism and doubt that started with darwin and huxley
is now passing on to another cycle einstein stated
recently in the new york times that the great religion
is a cosmic sense of harmony with the greater uni-
verse perhaps that will be a future religion quien

find out about her

editor wonder stories

as phil cook would say hold on to your seawk
folks cause its coming at you i have already
given you my opinion of the outpost off the moon 
so i wont go over it again the end of time
wasnt very bad but i must almit i wasnt engrossed
by it however mr  kirkham committed that atro-
cious error of tune-traveling stories which should not
be seen in these pages granting that travel into the
future may be possible a man could never come
back again you know the old grandfather business
he could travel into the future see a man travell
into the future see a man travel back in time and
kill the mans grandfather while the grandfather
was a little boy i thought you once said you wouldnt
let such an error occur again there wasnt much
new about the whole story

i will pass by the silent scourge without com-
ment the synthetic men was an interesting story
as are all of mr repps works you oould use more
of his stories i wish though that all the stories
didnt describe the heroine as the most beautiful girl
the hero had ever looked upon they have him fall
in love with her before he has a chance to find out
anything about her chorus girls are quite beautiful
as a rule but it would be a mistake to fall in love
with one before you have a chance to find out any-
thing about her nature but keep mr repp hes
worth it

the struggle for venus wa a very good story
it was a little different from the majority of such
stories there are only two things that i can criti-
cize in the first place i hate to think of that poor
man sailing through space all alone for two whole
months it would have been so easy to give him a
companion then theres the matter of blowing up
the enemy ship army bomberb using vaned stream-
lined bombs special releasing equipment delicate
range finders drift indicators etc and with years
of practice find it difficult to hit so big and station-
ary an object as a bridge in this story with none
of these assets the hero hits an enemy ship and thinks
it no great feat oh well i guess it comes natural
to some people anyway it was a great story

the air-plant men was a poor story hiere was
not a single point worthy of interest in the whole
thing it was altogether too brief and most of all
it was not science fiction if you are going to call
your material science fiction you ought to keep the
magazine pure especially when you have a story like
this one

mr waite gives us bis usual well-informed and
well-balanced comments perhaps as be says men
especially scientists should exercise a scientific judg-
ment of beautiful young women before proceeding
to fall in love in some future age they might an-
alyze scientifically the qualities and personality of
their prospective mates to determine with scientific
thoroughness just what lies beneath the beautiful
skin graphs might be constructed showing temper
as well as temperament experiments might be tried
to determine whether she would buy a fifteen oe
fifty dollar dress were the opportunity offered the
psychic curves of both the man and woman might be
plotted and compared to see how well they agree

but unfortunately for the present we are just
weak emotional mortals and faced with a pair of
dancing blue eyes science and analysis disappear
in the mist

we must disagree with mr waite with regard to
the air-plant men most of the readers who wrote
in liked the story very much rthough some would
have preferred it longer if the picture presented of
gteat bags of gas sentient beings who are able to
spread not only themselves but also their feeding
grounds over the entire earth is not science fiction
then we ask respectfully what is however that
question we leave to our readers we would like
some definition from them just what is science fiction
and what is not we will print the best letters-

cities on the cloud

editor wonder stories

where in the world did l taylor hansen get his
theory to write the city on the cloud t is there
any truth in the original story or is it just pure fic-
tion i have seen things on the same order as pub-
lished in that story

i am a young man and a miner and prospect in my
spare time in death valley and its vicinity at one
fime as stated in the story saw a city similar to that
described by hansen but not in death valley but
close to it in the cotton wood range of hills so
please let me know if there is any truth in this and
print it in your magazine for i am going back into
death valley

i am not sending my name for i dont want people
to think me crazy but it is true my saying that i aw
a city in the clouds and as for mirages you can see
of them around on the dry lakes of death

plenty

valley

talley i once saw a big body of water and a boat
landing and boats sailing on the water and a city close
by the city looked an awful lot like elsinore
city cal lake elsinore is about  miles from
lake close to silver lake about  miles from baker
city cal lake elsinore is about  miles from
silver lake

richmond cal

although it is not the cust m to print unsigned let-
ters the editors were impressed with the sincerity and
truthfulness of this letter we hope that our corres-
pondent reads this comment to know that mr hansen
did base his story on actual fact according to him
the story is based on actual occurrences and the pro-
fessor in the story is a real person

certainly we would be foolish to sneer at such
things as mr hansen and our unsigned correspondent
wrote about we know that mirages occur and that
they are projections against the horizon of scenes
many miles away the air in this case acts as a gi-
gantic reflector to throw images from far distant
places to the eyes of our death valley habitues we
mould not go so far as to say with mr hansen that
pictures of other worlds can be seen bv way of at-
mospheric refraction but we do believe that the range
of such phenomena may well be thousands of miles

we invite mr hansen to give us more facts upon
which he based his story the city on the clouds for
he has introduced a subject not only fascinating but
extremely stimulating to the imagination-editor

editor wonder stories

your mag is getting better every issue the new
size is a great improvement anyoue gets his moneys
worth out of less space i meau that the stories are
just as good if not better and they are in an easier
handled nook

any science fiction reader who doesnt like some
romance in his stories ought to wake up to the fact
that he is supposed to be a human being capable of
loving someone else on my part i enjoy a story
with some romance better tbau one without although
 like all science fiction

if i remember correctly there were some comie
scientification about a scientist who invented a seltzer-
mobile and several other comic ones can you get
some more like them

when are you going to put six more of those sci-
ence fiction library on the market and the scienco
novel as well im waiting for them this mag ia
certainly an improvement over the old mag you once
edited keep up the good workl

can you get a sequel to the interplanetary story
in which a jupiter princess came to earth in a spaco
ship which became a near meteor if i knew the
author i would tell his name but  loaned that mag
the stories are well regulated how about an inter-
planetary trip to some very distant star in some story
also a few more about the future as shown by tha
into the th century story

these mags are a great help to anyone taking up
a science course in college i can get points from
them when they are too deep in class

mr juve and mr repp are good i like their
stories they make even the most profound statements
clear their style is good and they include romance
in their stories readers who don t like them dont
like themselves

we do not know which jupiter story mr pyle
refers to but we can offer him as a fair exchange
for it a sequel to the rescue from jupiter by
gawain edwards beginning in the next issue mr
edwards the return from jupiter will delight
our readers there were many problems left unsolved
and hanging fire when the rescue was finished
in the opinion of the editors the sequel is even bet-

comment

we also have an interstellar story on hand from

the humorous aspecta of time traveling

editor wonder stories

some time ago you asked us the readers what
our opinions on time-traveling were although a bit
late i am now going to voice four opinions on henry
f kirkhams favorable pastime time traveling

	now in the first place if time traveling were
a possibility there would be no need of some scientist
getting a headache trying to invent an instrument or
time-machine to go back and kill grandpa in
answer to the age-old argument of preventing your
birth by killing your grandparents i would say  how
who the heck would want to kill his grandpa or grand-
ma i figure it out thusly

a man takes a time-machine and travels into the
future from where he sends it under automatic con-
trol to the past so that he may find it and travel into
the future and send it back to himself again hence
the time machine was never invented butl-from
whence did the time machine comet
wonder stories



	another impossibility that might result
would be

a man travels a few years into the future and see
himself killed in tome unpleasant manner---after
returning to his correct time he commits suicide in or-
der to avert death in the more terrible way which he
was destined to therefore how could he have seen
himself killed in an entirely different manner than
really was the case

	another thing that might corrupt the laws
f nature would be to

travel into the future find out how some in-
genious invention of the time worked return to your
right time build a machine or what ever it may be
similar to the one you had recently learned the work-
ings of and use it until the time that you saw it ar-
rive then if your past self saw it as you did he would
take it and claim it to be an invention of his your
own as you also did then-who really did invent
the conbarn thing

disturb the normal course of events as mr nicholson
has pictured it

however our publishing of such time traveling
stories as a change from our former policy is basea
on two thoughts

the first is that although logically the time traveling
episode will lead to the sort of absurdity mr nicholson
pointed out logic may not be the whole truth of the
matter time traveling neccessarily means a projec-
tion into the fourth dimension and an entering into a
new order of life before the einstein theory was
propounded people would have received its edicts with
derision as being contrary to logic the idea of the
constancy of the velocity of light for example is absurd
until it is explained by the reduction in length of the
body and the reduction of time even this idea of the
change of time between two bodies one of which is
moving at or near the speed of light as dr breuer
pointed out so well in the time valve is logically
absurd yet true

so we must realize that the laws of nature we per-
ceive and the things we call logic are not the whole
truth of nature and we must be prepared to see flomo
of our logical notions rudely shattered

this- leads to the second reason for permitting time
traveling stories once we admit that time traveling
is theoretically possible the allowing of the time travel-
er to take part in that world of the past or future
we are not inclined very much to permit such past
time traveling stories for the past is fixed gives
him the opportunity to develop a much better story
after all the reason for a time traveling story is nob
so much to travel in time but to show what our future
civilization is to be like if the story shows in 
vivid interesting and imaginative manner what our
race of the future is to be like then it has served its
purpose of course mr nicholson is right in saying
that the only safe way of preserving logic in timo
traveling is by suspended animation but who of our
readers would want every story to open and as he
opened his eyes they met a strange sight

we hope this explains our point of view on time
traveling of course if we ore wrong we want to bfli
told about it-editor

regarding a pain in the neck if anyone was en-
dowed with the ability to provide this sensation one
harry pancoast of wilmington is certainly a master
of art it is rarely that my fur is rubbed the wrong
way violently enough for mo to write a reply to an-
other individuals criticism but the above mentioned
individual took only about three minutes to stand my
hair on end

he claims you do not publish condemnatory let-
ters-holy smoke was booth codys epistle a love
letter right there was one of the most insolent out-
spokenly insulting outrageous pieces of blackguardism
i have ever had the ill fortune to read but you pub-
lished it put it up to the readers-and we know what
their verdict was i mr codys ears should have re-
sembled a miniature sunrise when he found out whafc
your loyal readers thought of him harry pancoaafc
is very little better although he is brave enough t
sign his own name

the quality of your stories maintains a high
level and i particularly approve of the outpost on
the moon the soulless entity besides intro-
ducing an idea which i believe is new was well writ-
ten and is that kind of a story that is not soon for-
gotten however the satellite of boom takes tha
prize in the last issue largely because of the realistic
way in which his characters talk and act it was not
the perfect english-and-clothes-model kind of story

glad to see an announcement that some of our older
authors will return in the next issue we need more
of them

love necessary to life

editor wonder stories

 many readers proceed to tell us where the auth-
ors fail in their science or where some one does no
know his science and so on others berate certain
authors for using female characters and embodying
romance in their stories judging by the language and
expression used in the various letters those who rave
nd berate the most seem to show the greater lack
of understanding of the things they criticize

just what is science is it not knowledge of the

khenomena of nature and tho employing of that know-
idge for the convenience of the possessors and the
seeking to extend that knowledge farther into the un-
known by ordered reasoning and experimentation
if one placed his hand on a red hot stove and would
not know that be burned his hand that would not be
science but if he knew the red hot stove burned his
hand that would be science if he did not know he
burfied his hand he might discover by reasoning and
experimenting that his hand was burnt and by further
reasoning and experimenting find that he did not burn
his band but as a result of the fire in the stove that
made it red hot the red hot stove caused the burn of
hie hand

one of the first things found out in life known or
perhaps felt millions of years before reasoning intelli-
gence began to evolve was the wedding of the two sexes
before life could be reproduced reasoning beings dis-
covered that one sex was not a complete entity that
one sex alone was not complete but required the other
sex to round out the full scheme nature intended the
texea are endowed with desire attraction and emotions
for one another that is the scheme of an life and
any one who denies this can not lay claim to being
scientific for he has denied one of the first principles
cf all lfe reasoning creatures have termed these
things romance love and the twain lead to marriage
and the perpetuating the species

in general i am firmly of the opinion that any
story that has not a reasonable amount of romance love
if you please a hero and heroine in it will be un-
satisfactory to all normal readers

henry s hatton

greentown ind

mr hntton injects a new element into the perennial
cold-blooded versus a little romance controversy
mr hatton attempts to turn the arguments of the die-
hards against themselves-with what result it is
true as he says that the mating of the sexes is one
of the most fundamental facts in all science we will
be fair and give the other side a chance to rebut this
thesis we suggest however that the shortness and con-
ciseness of mr hatton letter be taken as a model
think out what you wish to say and hen say it as
hortly and convincingly as you can-editor

quite a distance from this center of gravity it must
also be rotating about it

continued observation ever many years shows that
our sun is moving through space toward the star
tvega and at a speed of some  miles per second
carrying the solar system with it we are not cer-
tain that this is an absolute motion for it has been
determined only by isolating the velocities of a num-
ber of stars with reference to the sun

now since the sun lies about  light years from
the center of the milky way it is quite possible that
the sun is pursuing an orbit about this center its
orbit being some  light years in extent even
assuming that the sun has a velocity of  miles
a second with relation to this center then it would
take it some  years to complete one revo-
lution if we compare this with the  odd yeats
that we have had astronomical observations of any
valne we can see that in that period the sun will

the earth tube by gawain edwards
 pages stiff cloth covers size x
published by d appleton and company
new york price 

the author of the rescue from jupiter has re-
ally outdone himself in the present volume it is
truly what the publishers describe as a powerful
and vivid romance-of pan-hemispheric war mr
edwards has made the most of this opportunity to
use his personal knowledge of the world gained as
a newspaper editor to portray in the most realistic
fashion not only the progress of a war of science
but auo the ineptness of public officials faced with a
national crisis his dr angell secretary of war
of the americas who blunders his way through the
conduct of the war against the invaders yet makes
it up by his brilliantly oratorical speeches is a
character that oannot be forgotten the asiam
a race of emotionless scientists reminiscent of tho
soviets of to-day after conquering china and japan
bore a tube of some indestructible material through
the earth and begin their invasion of the americas
all defense is useless against their tremendous tanks
made of the impregnable material undulal south
america falls and the victorious asians advance
toward the isthmus of panama king henderson
a young scientist enters the earth tube and make bis
way into one of the asians cities searching for the
secret of undulal he is captured and condemned
to death he escapes and returns to the surface ia
time to build shells capable of destroying undulal
at the verge of dissolution the forces of north amer-
ica win a brilliant victory againbt the asians and
throw them back to south america where the inva-
sion collapses

despite the wealth of scientific instruments of tho
future that he pictures never does mr edwards
lose his powerful grip on reality the world he showa
us is one of people weak vain hesitating even
when faced with tho ruin of their race mocking our
social bystem mr edwards has the asians send
down a rain of gold upon new york in order that
the people may decorne feverish searchers for the
metal and our financial system be destroyed there
is but one way to counteract this national panic hen-
derson induces the president to declare martial law
and to promise to distribute free gold and freo pa-

eer money as long as the supply lasts he hopes
y that means to destroy forever the illusion of value
in that which glitters

it is a difficult book to read at a singlo sitting
yet it is equally difficult to lay it down before it ia
finished it is a serious book for it aims an accusing
finger at many of our social and national evils yot
to maintain the balance of justice it points an equally
accusing finger at the system which creates a state
as qod and crushes the miserable humans who dare
defy it

just imagine a musical talking film
produced by the fox film corporation
and exhibited at the roxy theatre new
york beginning november  

for those who do not take their science fiction too
seriously jist imagine a film portraying the new
york of  is cordially recommended tor with its
tongue in its cheek the picture shows us many of
the wonders that our science fiction authors have
been writing about

a man of  who has been killed revived in 
and finds himself in a changed world the laboratory
scene by the way depicting the apparatus used to
revive our genial comedian el brendel is one of the
best of the picture for humor has vanished there and
the gleaming apparatus the retorts the great coils
the sense of power and mystery will delight tho heart
of every science fiction fan

a thin story runs through the picture our hero has
been denied the right to marry the girl of his choice
because his rival is a man of superior accomplishment
the young man thereupon agrees to pilot the firbt space
ship to mars in order to distinguish himself tha
scenes on mars are among the funniest of the picture
the martians human beings all seem to come in pairs
wonder stories



book reviews

each one has a twin veritable jekylls and hydes one
of the two representing the good and one portraying
the bad qualities of the pair

falling from the hands of the good into the
dutches of the bad half of the population our pilot
with his friends finally escapes and returns to earth in
time for the pilot to claim his beloved

the new york of  scenes of which accompany
the story a flight into time in this issue is a
metropolis of gigantic towering buildings between
which flit the heliocopter planes used by everyone
food and even drink comes in capsules while babies
of desired sex are obtained by merely putting a com
in a slot		

the trip to mars maintains a semblance of veri-
similitude although the rocket ship with gravity
neutralizer appeared to be rather small and insub-
stantial it was a pity that more scenes of the heavens

from the space ship were not afforded the time
taken for the singing of several silly inconsequential
songs could very well have been used to portray more

vividly the dangers of the interplanetary voyage

as an experimental effort the picture was very well
done it is cordially recommended it is hoped how-
ever that with this humorous story as a start pro-
gressive enterprises such as the fox company can be
induced to try a more serious story in which the more
serious and tragic aspects of future existence can be
shown

ultimo-an imaginative narration of
life under the earth-with projections
by john vassos and the text by ruth
vassos  pages stiff cloth covers
size  x  published by e p dutton
and company new york price 

this book is what might be caned an aristocrat of
science fiction in a large sized book of beautiful
binding the finest printing and paper and with futur-
istic drawing with a tremendous imaginative appeal
there is told tbo story of the death of the earth s
civilization	 

the story is told from the point of view of a man
who has received permission to leave on a space ship
as member of a crew to explore the habitability of a
 a net in the third star system our sun has long
een dying and the civilization of the earth lias been
carried on with dignity but monotony within the
earths bowels but the lack of newness in the
standardized subterranean existence the lack of ad-
venture the monotony of color shade and sound have
all provoked a desire on the part of the more adven-
turous to risk the perils of an interstellar journey
to found a new race on a new world

the story accompanies the pictures and both have
a deep and profound appeal by their sense of the
gloom the compression and the endlessness of the
lives of the subterraneans as the sun gradually died
life was carried on precariously on the surface but
even that failed and by burrowing into the earth like
field mice the race founded a new home everything
for comfort was provided work was not hard there
were no dangers to this existence but the lack of
danger and uncertainty led some to venture to the
surface for the pleasure of hunting bears and wolves
as the cold became intensified even this pleasure was
denied and people sought an extra-legal pleasure in
hunting down the great bats that abounded in sub-
terranean caverns and matching two of them in battle

the children of the race were produced only by a
decree of the government by eugenically mated couples
sexual cohabitation for all other purposes was allowed
without restriction the only goal for these people
living almost endless lives lay in service to the state
and promotion from one rank to another

but man is as mrs vassos so eloquently points out
not an animal destined for a static existence the
very breath of his being demands change conflict
uncertainty and danger he lives only by escaping
as carlyle aid the death of attainment -

for those who wish a handsome addition to their
library of a story told beautifully and powerfully in
word and picture this book is enthusiastically reeom-

eer in the electrical and
radio field hugo gerns-

cent developments

tions which have
appeared from time
to time during the
past decade in
many newspapers

and magazines are
now realities every

ment they eagerly demanded piece after
piece-dance music ballads snappy longs

not practically forced to entertain with my

play has certainly made me popular

no talent needed

this story is typical people who once
didnt know one note from another are good
players today-thanks to the c s school
of music

for the it s school course presents ev-
erything in such a concise graphic way-
so clear and simple-that a child could un-
derstand it first you are told what to do
-then a picture shows you how to to it-
then you do it yourself and hear it so
private teacher could make it any clearer
