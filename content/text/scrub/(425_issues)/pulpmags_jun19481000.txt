the golden
   claws of raa

 by john peter drummond

  sam slaker cobra-eyed merchant in warrior-flesh mog the gorilla with
  human blood on his dagger-like teeth raa golden queen of the ape legions
  -these were ki-gors enemies in a battle that only the voodoo of destiny

  could decide

he woman was dead

  her small coffee-colored body lay
crumpled in an attitude of prayer her
forehead pressed against the base of a
tree her hands gripping the bark

  across the pygmy womans naked back
a whip had torn deep ugly gashes but
the gaping wound between her shoulder
blades told that a  sudden vicious spear
thrust had ended her torture

  ki-gor white lord of the jungle
leaned over the dead pygmy traced a
slow accusing finger over the inch-wide
circle of flesh rubbed raw about the
womans neck

  no spoken word was needed for the
masai warriors clustered about the body
to understand ki-gors meaning that
raw circle was the grim mark of a slavers
iron neckband chained neck to neck in
single file slaves can be driven like help-
less cattle

  the huge bull-chested masai chieftain
tembu george drew a slow deep breath
looked from the woman to the warriors
about him he spoke to his men but his
words were a promise to ki-gor

  this small one will be avenged he
rumbled this evil done to the people of
my blood-brother ngeeso is an evil done
to the masai



  ki-gor stood up his face grown harsh

  even among the tall powerfully-built
masai the great-thewed white lord was
a commanding figure he wore only a
leopard-skin breech-clout caught tight
about his lean hard loins with a toss
of his head he threw his blonde mane of
hair back out of smouldering grey eyes
his right hand twisted with restless
strength along the shaft of his war spear

  aye he said with ominous softness
she will be avenged but though a
thousand die this small one will never
know her fathers hut again his lips
twisted with swift bitterness will the
jungle never be rid of these human jack-
als 

  tembu george motioned to two of his
men they quietly lifted the corpse car-
ried it off into the jungle to be covered
with stones

  ten yards away the white lords
mate helene watched with troubled eyes
as the two masai carried their pitiful bur-
den from view after an absence of two
moons arbitrating differences between the
kamizuli and the bambala the looked-for
happiness of their return to their home
in the pygmy lands immediately was shat-
tered

  the fact that the woman was being bur-

	jungle

ied instead of taken to the pygmy kraal
told helene ki-gor judged he could over-
take the killers

  she ran to the white lord saying anx-
iously with only twenty-five masai it
would be suicide to attack armed slave-
traders 

  her slim fingers caught pleadingly at
ki-gors arm the sun reached through
the ceiling of branches above to strike
glints of fire from her long red hair the
lithe curved beauty of this woman was a
legend endlessly related wherever men
gathered in the jungle

  ki-gors grey eyes softened there
are chances one must sometimes take he
said gravely it would take a sun to
reach the pygmy kraal another sun to re-
turn here with ngeeso and his warriors
and if we give those aasvoels two
suns lead well never find them added
the deep-voiced tembu george for all
we know ngeeso may be one of those
taken by the raiders

  but what if    began helene
thinking of what could happen to her mate
then abruptly she stopped biting her soft
full underlip her fingers tightened on
ki-gors muscled forearm of course
she said its the only thing to do and
her voice was steady utterly sincere

what other way could there be for
a man such as her mate that
was the thought that stopped her even as
the sick gnaw of worry caught her heart
he was the jungle protector to the
black men regarded almost as a god by
half-a-hundred tribes beloved and trusted
by those who walked the paths of peace
and justice fanatically feared and hated
by those who followed the ways of evil
and injustice

  their spoor is fresh said ki-gor
perhaps we can overtake them by night-
fall

  tembu george grinned savagely they
knew you were busy elsewhere this raid
is some cowards cruel way of getting
back at you no slaver really wants pyg-
my slaves

  wah rasped ki-gor in agreement
its like caging wild birds they quickly
die and the most brutal master cant make
them submit

  the two warriors returned from the

stories

bush sweat gleamed on their stern faces
they recovered their spears stood staring
down the path there was no doubting
their desire to come to grips as soon as
possible with the slavers

  ill go ahead by the tree-paths ki-
gor told tembu george learn their
strength and work out a plan of attack
their spoor will be easy for you to fol-
low

  he handed the masai chieftain his
spear his bow and quiver of arrows he
could carry on his back without difficulty
but the spear would hamper his move-
ments in the trees

  shall i go with you or with tembu
george asked helene

  ki-gors glance avoided her his man-
ner grown uneasy

  neither he declared with unnatural
curtness you will go through the trees
to ngeesos kraal wait for us there

  he anticipated difficulty with helene
she would want to go with them it
would be awkward having her argue with
him before the masai natives did not
understand the freedom of tongue and ac-
tion which the wives of white men pos-
sessed

  but helene had no intention of making
her husband lose face before the blacks
she modestly lowered her eyes before her
husband as a proper wife should but in
truth the gesture was more to hide from
him their sudden flare of inspiration
rather than to indicate submission

  your wish is my command o hus-
band she said meekly using the masai
language rather than english she backed
away as though meaning to go immedi-
ately

  ki-gor looked startled then recover-
ing himself he gave a relieved sigh

  but after a few steps helene haltedthe
angular heavy-thewed bodies of the blacks
behind her provided a striking frame for
her provocatively feminine beauty a
beauty displayed rather than concealed by
her narrow halter and brief shorts

  her voice was soft almost apologetic
as she asked and if i find the kraal
destroyed by the slavers and the pygmies
gone elsewhere should i remain there
anyway  her blue eyes moved hesi-
tantly over the group somehow evoking
in those male minds the picture of her
the golden claws of raa



alone unprotected in a ruined village

 thats true exclaimed tembu
george the raiders may have burned
the kraal several of his warriors gave
grunts of agreement glanced questioning-
ly at ki-gor with a single mild question
helene had won the sympathy of the
masai

  ummm said ki-gor whether well
founded or not she had planted a worry
in both his and the warriors minds which
would make them keep her with them

  he frowned at her all right go with
the masai he sighed but remem-
ber   

  oh i promise not to be in the way
helene declared ill do everything you
say

  ki-gor the frown still on his face
started toward an ankle-thick length of
liana hanging from a branch helene ran
to stop him and raising on tiptoe brushed
his lips with hers he received the kiss
sternly

  then abruptly he swept her up in his
arms kissed her resoundingly to the de-
light of the warriors and holding her feet
off the ground shook her gently

  witch he said and his teeth flashed
white in a laugh beautiful cunning
witch

  he put her down took three running
steps and caught the liana great writh-
ing cords of muscle ridged out over his
arms and shoulders with a prodigious
bound he hurled himself upward

  at the very height of his swing ki-gor
released the vine drove free through the
air up up he went in arcing flight his
suddenly relaxed body twisting slowly so
that his arms came straight before him

then there was the leaping bulge of
muscles across his back as he braced
his momentum was nearly spent but at
the very moment he would have begun to
drop his spread fingers came against a
limb he caught the support whipped his
body under it like a pendulum

  he shot away from the limb feet-firsf
angling horizontally across ten yards of
open space for another branch in mid-
leap he curled into a ball snapped his
legs straight again and once more his
arms were before him in position to grasp
the limb

  though the masai had witnessed the
white lords hurtling flight through the
tree-routes countless times always they
watched with awed astonished expres-
sions

  it was a reminder that he was linked as
closely to the savage primeval animal
world as he was to the world of men he
had known the animal world first had
started life as fierce and wild as any beast
removed from the society of men hardly
identifying his kinship with them but he
had gradually come to know the natives
and through his unusual physical and men-
tal powers had won their respect

  his gloss of civilization though deeper
since helene had become his wife was
still barely more than skin-deep the red-
haired american girl who had been plum-
meted into his life by the crash of her
airplane in the jungle had wrought many
	jungle

changes in the white lord but he had
changed her even more for finding love
and happiness with ki-gor she had aban-
doned her whole way of existence changed
from a wealthy social butterfly to a fitting
mate for the jungle lord

 but now as ki-gor ranged alone
through the tree-paths in search of the
slavers he became a true jungle denizen
again the changing forest breezes
brought him many sounds and scents and
as instinctively as any animal his ears and
nose deciphered these subtle messages

  he knew that a lion lay couched in the
still wassa grass beside a waterhole he
knew that for a time a leopard silently kept
pace with him off to his right when he
dropped low to check on the spoor he
followed by sound the flight of a klipvard
antelope

  an ever-altering variety of sounds and
smells he identified all helping him know
what went on about him what enemies
were near

  but a persistant scent which puzzled
and interested him most was the harsh
ingagi smell the gorilla smell which lay
heavy along the way he travelled

  this was not the country of the ingagi
the fierce great apes lived further west
in a dense unpopulated section of the
jungle the natives only entered that
dark land in armed force for the mur-
derous strength and almost man-like cun-
ning of the great beasts made them fear-
ful adversaries for hunters armed with
only spears and bows

  three hours after leaving helene ki-
gor caught his first glimpse of the great
apes he scented moving silently through
the leafy heights he saw four of the huge
beasts passing through a clearing on the
jungle floor below him

  they went in single file in a shamb-
ling sort of trot knuckling the ground
with their long arms at every step they
kept parallel with the path turning and
circling with it but not once in the several
minutes the white lord watched them
did they ever actually set foot on it in-
stead they chose the much more difficult
going of the underbrush

  another strange thing was their sus-
tained fast pace the ingagi is usually an
unhurried traveller stopping often to
browse for choice green shoots or over-

stories

turn a fallen rotted limb in search of
grubs

  ki-gor though intrigued had no time
to waste on idle curiosity without ever
drawing abreast of the apes he turned off
to the right circled around them and came
back to the path they might not take
kindly to the sight of a hairless white ape
swinging over them

  but to ki-gors surprise he no more
than got around the first group when he
found himself over six more of the beasts
they behaved in the same manner keep-
ing well away from the path yet follow-
ing its windings exactly and they were
all bull apes not a single female

  he tried again to avoid discovery but a
sudden downcurrent of air carried his
man-scent to the brutes the creatures
abruptly halted uttering low rumbling
growls while their bloodshot beady eyes
searched for the human who dared come
near them

the ape that sighted ki-gor first
gave a roar of rage thrust up on his
hind legs and hammered his chest thun-
derously with giant knotted fists the
beast allowed himself only this single
surging outburst of wrath then he raced
to a low-hanging limb leaped high to
grasp it within seconds he was swinging
and leaping upward through the branches
toward the white lord

  ki-gor didnt want trouble but he was
unwilling to engage in a grim game of hide
and seek with six raging bull apes in
order to lose them he would have to
swerve far off his course uselessly wast-
ing both time and energy

  so instead of running he swung his bow
from his back snatched a long barbed ar-
row from his quiver and fitted it to the
bowstring he was drawing a bead  on
the rapidly climbing ape when the largest
of the beasts on the ground broke into
furious barks and snarls

  the outburst apparently was directed
at the bull going after ki-gor for the
shaggy giant immediately stopped climb-
ing he glared fiercely at the white lord
baring his fangs then slowly reluctant-
ly the ugly beast started down toward his
fellows

  ki-gor lowered his bow a faint frown
coming over his taut features
the golden claws of raa

  he studied with new interest the ape-
leader who had called back the bull the
gorilla was fully six feet tall but his chest
and shoulders were of such tremendous
breadth that he had an almost squat look

  but the gorillas most awesome feature
was his face in some past battle the
whole left side of it had been torn open
a hideous many-tongued scar ran from
temple to jaw lifting the beasts huge lips
in a perpetual snarl

  to ki-gors added astonishment as
soon as the tree-climber reached the
ground the six apes wheeled about set
off in single file through the brush with-
out wasting another glance on the jungle
man

  with all his knowledge of animals the
white lord could find no possible ex-
planation of the behavior of the ingagi
apes simply didnt act that way he pro-
ceeded more warily than before and
though he avoided further trouble he
passed six more groups before the harsh
gorilla scent disappeared telling him he
was ahead of the strange migration

  an hour later he caught up with the
slave caravan and all thought of the apes
was thrust from his mind

  though he kept well away from the
cruel procession he could still hear the
steady crack of whips the sudden agonized
screams of tortured men andwomen and
a few times through breaks in the wall of
foliage he kept between himself and the
slavers he caught glimpses of the long
shuffling lines of shackled prisoners

  from the slow pace of the caravan and
the large number of captives who fell and
had to be whipped to their feet ki-gor
saw that even the most brutal taskmasters
wouldnt be able to keep the slaves mov-
ing much longer

  the blacks were exhausted having been
driven mercilessly the past two days while
the slavers sought to get away from the
scene of the attack ki-gor was acquaint-
ed with the habits of slave-traders knew
from grim experience that the unfortu-
nate natives in their hands had had little
food or water since their capture

  ki-gor made a circle putting him
ahead of the caravan he dropped down
into the lower branches and keeping di-
rectly over the trail began to travel fast
within thirty minutes he found what he

was searching for a sizeable river crossing
the path

ii

the sun was low in the west the
slavers would have to make camp
before darkness even terrorized men
have a point beyond which they cant be
driven the site by the river was the
logical place for the caravan to halt

  ki-gor studied the area carefully map-
ping the terrain in his mind he dropped
to the ground tested the depth of the
stream and trotted up the bank a hundred
yards then he took to the trees again
coursed about slowly observing the many
small game trails in the neighborhood of
the stream crossing once he stopped to
pick several handfuls of brown strongly
scented berries from a vine with pale
whitish leaves he wrapped these berries
in a huge leaf and returning to the river
hid them beneath a rock

  by the time the caravans advance guard
arrived the white lord was posted high
in a tree in a vantage point which he had
carefully camouflaged with vines

  four armed bantus came down the trail
at a weary dogged trot sweat cut glis-
tening rivulets down their dusty bodies
	jungle

 they went straight to the stream drank
 thirstily for a few minutes then after a
 brief low-voiced conference one of their
 number turned back toward the caravan
 while the others splashed across the
 stream to investigate the other bank

   the black who had gone back with news
 about the campsite returned with a tall
 broad-shouldered arab and ten bantu
 warriors ki-gors eyes glittered from
 slitted lids as he followed every movement
 made by the burnoose-clad man

   the mans arrogant stance his swift
 hawk-like movements faintly stirred ki-
 gors memory but try as he might ki-
 gor could not go beyond that slight feel-
 ing that he had seen the slaver before ex-
 cept for a narrow strip for his eyes the
 arabs face was veiled and the loose robe
 hanging to the ground was undistinguish-
 able from the soiled garments worn by un-
 counted true believers

   the slaver stared about it will do
 he snapped in bantu managing to sound
 displeased that the blacks could find him
 no better place to camp then he growled
 well dont stand about clear out the
 brush

    he leaned against a tree stared into the
 water while his men worked he appar-
 ently was oblivious of the blacks but his
 hands lingered always near the brace of
 ornate long-barreled pistols shoved into
 his girdle

    that single detail was highly significant
 to ki-gor the arab didnt trust his own
 servants if he was as harsh a master as
 that the bantus would desert like jackals
 any time the tide of battle went against
 him

    the slaver didnt rouse until the strag-
 gling lines of chained men and women
 began dragging into the clearing he
 shoved away from the tree stood poised
 like some evil bird of prey as though
 impelled to cruelty by the very sight of
 their master the guards strung out along
 the weary files began to wield their whips
 cursing and threatening the prisoners ki-
 gor noted there were two more arabs in
 the caravan both armed with rifles the
 furtive manner in which they kept glanc-
 ing at the burnoose-clad figure by the
 stream indicated they feared their leader
 as much as the bantus

   the captives were chained in groups of

stories

twenty studying them ki-gor knew the
slavers had moved swiftly over a wide
area making quick strikes against every
unguarded kraal they encountered rather
than risking an all-out attack against any
single people

  in addition to about eighty pygmy pris-
oners they had snared some fifty obanti
ninety wasuli and sixty watussi the
fact that nearly two-thirds of the captives
were young women told ki-gor another
msavory truth about the slavers

  angered and sickened by the spectacle
ki-gor was watching the final group
driven into the clearing with senseless
whippings when a totally unexpected sight
made him start

  ten paces behind the last of the black
captives came a single woman closely
guarded by four bantus she was a white
woman young and strikingly beautiful
she was blonde and her long abundant
hair streamed free to her waist so well
proportioned was her lithe curved body
that it took a second glance for one to
realize how much larger and stronger she
was than most women

strangely she was clad in a crude-
ly fashioned halter and a wrap-around
breechclout of monkey-skin the firm set
of her red mouth the quick way her grey
eyes lashed her guards told of a seething
anger and there was no doubt that the
slavers had failed to break her will she
walked firmly even arrogantly and her
straight-held shoulders betrayed no weari-
ness

  her hands were tied behind her and in
addition to the steel circlet around her
neck another band of steel had been
locked about her naked waist two guards
held rawhide thongs attached to the neck-
band while the other two bantus held
thongs tied to the waistband by keeping
these ropes taut they forced the girl to
walk between them and were easily able
to control her

  although there were whxp-welts on
practically every one of the black slaves
the blonde girls honey-colored skin was
unmarked she was the arab leaders
prize he took no chances of marring
that fair smooth body if he managed
things properly she could bring him her
weight in gold
the golden claws of raa



  the captives were taken to the stream
one group at a time and briefly allowed
to drink the tall leader stood urnnov-
ing until the blacks were finished and the
blonde girl was brought up he stepped
close as she knelt to drink tensely watched
her

  when she stood up the arabs hand
went out to touch her bare shoulder his
hand was on her for no more than a sec-
ond but there was a lingering ugliness in
the gesture as the blacks led the girl
away the man followed her with his
glance

  i could rid the jungle of him with a
single arrow thought ki-gor

  but he gritted his teeth and lay quiet
on the limb until dusk fell he watched
the bantus build a high thorn wall against
animal prowlers on the forest side of the
camp smiled grimly when he saw that they
left the river side open then he slipped
quietly down the tree wormed away from
the camp through the underbrush and
made his way back to the trail he trotted
about a mile along the path then climbed
into the fork of a tree and made himself
comfortable

  the late moon was rising when he sat
up tested the breeze and listened after
a time he gave an odd warbling whistle
among the myriad night noises that bird-
like call would pass unnoticed by any but
the masai

  tembu georges answering whistle was
not long in coming ki-gor dropped to the
trail and hurried to meet helene and his
friends in the faint mist of moonlight
sifting through the trees the masai were
drifting shadows clustered protectingly
about helene

  we come at last o ki-gor hoarsely
whispered tembu george youve found
where the dogs are bedded

  aye answered ki-gor quickly ex-
plaining what he had learned

  lead us swiftly o white lord de-
manded a masai warrior yes clam-
ored another my blood boils

  youve travelled far the white lord
reminded them perhaps you should rest
and eat

  we need no rest indignantly put in
one of the warriors

  our blades alone are hungry de-
clared another hotly

   ki-gor smiled thinly in the darkness
the masais eagerness was no pose
battle was the principal end of life the
ultimate fulfillment for these savage war-
riors a masai counted himself as worth
ten warriors of any other tribe and on
many occasions ki-gor had seen it proved
that he was not far wrong in his esti-
mate before ki-gor had channeled their
warlike energies into policing the jungle
the fierce masai had been the congos
greatest troublemakers

   so be it ki-gor said and in con-
trast to the warriors tones his voice was
slow tinged with regret

   though he knew it must be he hated
leading these men into battle he had no
love of war only an abiding hatred for it
and for those who were its cause and yet
even the dread masai themselves hailed
ki-gor as the greatest of warriors

   the darkness was no hindrance to the
white lord in leading the masai into po-
sition he had photographed the area and
its paths in his mind before sunset and
now like a night-prowling animal he led
them quietly along tiny game trails circ-
ling the camp and coming out on the bank
of the river a hundred yards above the
sleeping caravan

   except for a few quivering pools of
quicksilver where the moon fought through
breaks in the overhanging branches the
stream ran in eerie blackness

   theres plenty of driftwood along the
bank here ki-gor said well float
down the river and then rush in upon
them

   the slavers naturally would expect any
trouble to come from the forest side of
their camp the river was broad enough
to bar any animal prowlers from coming
in behind them
	jungle

  but the darkness out there may be
swarming with crocodiles pointed out an
alarmed helene you could all be torn
to pieces

  that same thought was in every war-
riors mind but not one of them had pro-
tested ki-gors orders crocodiles abound-
ed in these sluggish muddy rivers

  they wont bother us thanks to a pyg-
my trick ngeeso taught me ki-gor as-
sured her

  he leaned down lifted the rock at his
feet retrieved the berries he had cached
earlier he began distributing a few to
each warrior

  smash these in your hands and smear
the pulp over you he ordered they
are mtika berries the long-noses wont
come near a man with that smell on him

the masai dragged dead limbs
remnants of the last flood into the
water they waded out hip-deep three or
four men to each piece of driftwood lining
up parallel to the shore ki-gor took
helene with him out to the first group

  after we leave you he told her stay
with the log in this slow current you can
keep within sight of the camp with very
little paddling youll be safer in the
water than anywhere else

  she stood close against him trying to
see his face his strong blunt fingers
were very gentle on her arm

  if anything goes wrong he said quiet-
ly you are to drift on downstream you
musnt do anything foolish because i
would rather die a thousand times than
think of your being captured by these
men

  oh my dear she murmured unhap-
pily pressing her cheek against him
please be careful please dont take
chances

  he patted her head with awkward gen-
tleness the masai will take care of me
they always do he turned her away
from him put her arm on the log

  then he was calling softly to the war-
riors behind him group by group they
pushed off into deep water began drift-
ing down toward the slave caravan from
the forest on their right came a hyenas
crazed laughter twice repeated there
was no sound from the men in the water
except their tense quick breathing

the smell of woodsmoke reached
them first then like yellow blooms
among the black trees they saw the slav-
ers fires with nerve-rending slowness
they drifted abreast of the camp

  the exhausted prisoners still chained
together- lay in three long rows along the
river bank wary guards paced slowly
down the aisles between the lines of sleep-
ing natives watchful of every suspicious
movement the whole area was illumi-
nated by fires

  the masai needed only to see the high
thorn boma extending in a solid u-shaped
wall about the camp to appreciate ki-
gors wisdom in choosing to attack from
the river side just within that wall
armed bantus stood vigil kept alert
against any danger from the jungle by the
presence of one of the arabs

  ki-gor estimated that about twenty-five
bantus a third of the slavers whole force
were on guard while the others slept
when a quick glance failed to locate either
the head slaver or his other arab lieu-
tenant ki-gor knew they were both slum-
bering in the single tent which had been
raised

  the blonde girl was chained to a tree
outside the tent she sat with her back
against the trunk her head dropped for-
ward in sleep she looked as though the
least sound would bring her leaping to her
feet

  to offset superior odds ki-gor and his
men had only the slender weapon of sur-
prise they had to hit so hard and fast
that they would shatter the men on guard
in their first rush if the guards held
them for any time at all the sleeping ban-
tus would have a chance to arm and or-
ganize

  ki-gor felt the muddy bottom come
under his feet he set his strength against
the log drifted it in closer to the bank he
counted the moments waiting for the ma-
sai to come into position on shore one
of the bantus patrolling between the rows
of slaves glanced idly at the river ki-
gors heart skipped a beat but the black
went on with his pacing his bored eyes
seeing nothing unusual in a few drifting
logs if the dim hulks registered on his
consciousness at all
the golden claws of raa



  ki-gor knew lie could wait no longer
his men were coming within reach of the
firelight he didnt worry about signalling
the masai they would be straining their
eyes watching for his white body when
he started for shore

  he said nothing to helene but she
seemed to sense his decision he knew
she turned her face toward him as he
took his hand from the log he touched
her chin her throat then he lifted his
spear from the water where like the ma-
sai he had trailed it a few inches beneath
the surface so no gleam of its shovel-
bladed point wouldnt betray them

  the water was only to his chest now
he stepped around the log and started
toward the camp from the corner of his
eye he saw the long uneven line of shad-
ows surge outward from the driftwood

  there was the faint wash of disturbed
water the glimmer f wet spear points
but so quietly did that desperate band of
warriors advance they were in ankle-deep
water before the first bantu sensed their
presence he was the same guard who
had glanced out at the river before

  the man was almost directly in front
of ki-gor when he suddenly ceased his
pacing spun toward the river he stood
close enough to a fire for the white lord
to see the astonished look which exploded
over his face

  the blacks eyes bulged his mouth
dropped open then he leaped backwards
his features wildly working as he fought
to throw off the effects of shock and cry
out to his fellows

  but even as the bantu lunged back-
wards the white lords right arm whirled
high then drove forward with explosive
power the heavy war spear leaped to-
ward the beach like a ray of dark light

  full in the face the huge shovel-bladed
weapon caught the native his ebony fea-
tures shattered apart his head cleft com-
pletely through he leaped high like a
great frog somersaulted backwards and
fell kicking into the wash of his own
blood

  and as the bantu died the huge glis-
tening figures of the masai gained the
bank they were like great black cats
drifting out of the darkness in long reach-
ing bounds it seemed impossible that
men could move with such terrible speed

in such chilling silence

  over the first row of sleeping prisoners
they swept engulfing three startled
guards the bantus saw them now shrill
frightened cries broke out over the camp
the masai swept over the rousing pris-
oners in a swift wave and the still-warm
bodies of eleven bantu dead marked the
way they passed

  like a cornered mongrel the arab lieu-
tenant made little senseless runs back and
forth yapping confused orders in a thin
hysterical voice but the hurtling spears
of the masai cut black furrows in the
firelight even as he cried his first com-
mand under the hammer blows of these
deadly shafts the bulk of his force melted
away within seconds

  in desperation the arab flung up his
rifle yellow fire streaked from its tremb-
ling barrel the blasting echoes caroomed
out through the jungle and a masai run-
ning beside tembu george twisted side-
ways and fell his throat torn away

tembu georges fury burst out
of his throat in roaring madness he
seemed to spurt ahead of his men his
long broad-bladed knife was a burst of
gleaming light as he swung it high in
four incredible lashing bounds he was on
the arab

  all the brute power in his giant shoul-
ders was in that flickering knife-blow

  the arab literally exploded into death
his body rent apart with the stunning
swiftness of a tree split by lightning
tembu george whirled away from the
	jungle

thing that had been a man tearing his
knife free as he turned

  he stabbed the red-dripping blade to-
ward the sky and from his lips roared the
dread masai war-cry until that moment
the attackers had fought in silence now
in concert the huge chieftains war-dogs
chorused their chilling battle challenge
and wheeling behind their leader raced
toward the arab tent and the bantus who
had been sleeping about it

  tembu george knew the demoralizing
effect that welling battle-cry would have
on the groggy bantus it warned the
scrambling blacks that the jungles deadli-
est warriors were loose in their midst

  the sleep-dazed bantus in those first
minutes could not guess how small was
the force opposed to them they awoke
to noise and confusion the screams of
frightened slaves the clash of steel the
pound of running feet and their first
reaction was naturally that a vast force
was flooding out of the jungle to destroy
them

  cat-swift across the camp came the
charging masai but yards ahead of them
the bantus saw a figure more dread than
even the giant tembu george seconds
before the masai turned toward the tent
ki-gor had cut away from his fellows and
sprinted for the haven of the two sleeping
arabs

  aaaiiieee the white lord shrieked
a dozen blacks their master had assured
them ki-gor was too far from the scene
of their raids to interfere

  fight for your lives shouted a ban-
tu braver than the rest and darting for-
ward he cast his spear at the white lord

  ki-gor veered dodging like a broken-
field runner and the hasty throw skimmed
past him but the grey-faced bantu lashed
by desperation flung at the white man
sword in hand a masai spear took him
in the belly flung him sprawling in agony

  the white lord flashed past the
screaming bucking black intent as he was
on his objective he yet noticed that the
blonde girl stood wide-legged against the
tree her body taut with excitement no
sign of fear etching her face her grey
eyes glowed with an electric brilliance as
they whirled over the battle scene her
reaction was certainly not what one would
expect of a civilized woman bound help-

stories

lessly in the midst of a death-struggle be-
tween savages

  ki-gor meant to call to her a word of
hope of reassurance but before he could
speak the tent flap was ripped open and
the arab leader burst out he apparently
had been sleeping fully dressed for he
wore his white robes and had even taken
time to hood his face in his hand was
a gun not one of the ornate long-barrelled
pistols he had worn earlier in his belt but
a squat ugly german luger

  coming so suddenly out of the dark in-
terior of the tent the arab blinked rapid-
ly narrowing his eyes against the hurt of
the light that brief moment of blindness
saved ki-gors life

  going at full tilt the white lord dove
for the mans legs

  he hit him like a football tackier and
at the impact the luger went off in a
series of rapid shots the slugs sprayed
harmlessly upward as the arab careened
against his tent carried by the jungle
mans driving weight as the two of them
went down ki-gor caught the gun with
one hand the mans throat with the other

with a mighty wrench the white
lord tore the luger from the
arabs grasp hurled it away the whole
side of the tent collapsed billowing down
over the struggling men the arab fought
like a maniac writhing and twisting
gouging and kicking as he sought to free
himself from both ki-gor and the smoth-
ering folds of the tent

  he was a powerful man and as ki-gor
quickly learned an accomplished rough
and tumble fighter he managed to rip
the white lords merciless fingers from
his throat and hammered his knees into
the pit of the jungle mans stomach

  momentarily numbed by the blow ki-
gor lost his grip the arab plunged up-
ward throwing off the folds of tent he
didnt try to run instead he turned bal-
ancing himself to deliver a kick which
would knock his opponent senseless

  ki-gor whirled in against the arab like
a rolling barrel knocking his legs from
under him before he could get set and
when he fell this time there was no hope
of again escaping the jungle man ki-gor
was a pouncing leopard mauling and
rocking the man with lightning blows
the golden claws of raa



  the white lord hit in the manner of
the great apes never knotting his fists but
using the rock-hard lower edge of each
hand like a club tough and hard as the
arab was no human could long survive
such a beating with his own blows seem-
ing to have no more effect against ki-
gors muscle-padded bulk than rocks
against armor plate the arabs nerve
broke and he squawled for help

  and to the white lords surprise the
man in his fright cried out in english in-
stead of arabic

  carl-carl help me shoot he

yelped

  but the lieutenant was in no position
to offer him immediate help slower to
act than his master he had been caught
in the collapse of the tent he was plung-
ing about like a netted bird trying to free
himself he heard the tremendous uproar
as the masai ripped into the bantus heard
his leaders terrified screams and his re-
sulting panic made him even clumsier than
before

  despite the chief slavers certainty that
ki-gor meant to beat him to death the
white lord had intended from the first
to take him alive otherwise he would
have buried his knife in him in the open-
ing seconds of the struggle

  the arabs stiff resistance took ki-gor
off-guard ordinarily his race though
bitter fighters with sword or gun had
little skill in an out and out slugging
match but finally ki-gor twisted the
mans head back slammed him twice
across the temple finished him with a
pile-driving blow full on the chin

  as the man went rubbery beneath him
ki-gor sprang up intent on reaching the
lieutenant before he could bring his gun
into play he would have gotten to him
too had not a bantu broken out of the
melee of fighting men and come sprinting
around the tent chased by a masai

  in his frantic attempt to escape his pur-
suer the bantu headed straight into ki-
gor too late the bantu realized he was
getting into the reach of another enemy
he tried to veer slashing with his sword
in an effort to keep the white lord away
but his foot caught on one of the tent
pegs and he dove face-first into the

ground

  ki-gor was on the black before he

stopped skidding twisting the sword from
his hand then as easily as he would lift
a rag doll he heaved the native to his
feet and standing behind him snaked his
right arm about the mans face forced
his head back

  the bantu with the bones of his neck
ready to snap under the pressure was
abruptly motionless all thought of fight
gone the masai braked to a stop dis-
appointment in his fierce features as he
realized ki-gor didnt mean to kill the
native

  but instead of wasting time trying to
argue the white lord out of taking a pris-
oner with a snort of disapproval the
masai whirled and started back for the
main battle at the moment the warrior
turned the arab lieutenant managed to
get free of the tent

  the two men stood face to face no
more than five paces apart the masai
reacted first with a wild yell he leaped
for the arab swinging his heavy knife
like a cleaver

  the arab threw himself to the side
triggering two pistol shots at point blank
range the warrior was flung half about
by the slugs his whole body shuddering
under the impact his legs started to give
at the knees and his knife fell from his
fingers

  but gathering the last broken frag-
ments of life in him the masai somehow
righted himself and took another full step
toward the arab with his last conscious
thought the warrior tried to fling himself
on the robed killer hamper him long
enough to give ki-gor a chance to reach
them but the masais fantastic courage
went for naught a third shot deliberately
aimed this time tore away the blacks
forehead
	jungle

k-gor knew he was trapped he was
farther away from the arab than the
masai had been the gun would cut him
down before he took two steps the
bantu he held before him was no protec-
tion for the slaver would gladly sacrifice
the black knowing the same slugs which
killed him would also tear out ki-gors
life

  as the masai collapsed the arab
jerked his attention to the white lord
but even as he did ki-gor tried a last
desperate measure of defense he caught
the bantu by the throat and the thigh
lifted him bodily overhead and hurled him
at the arab

  all his phenomenal strength was in that
throw a less wary enemy would have
been knocked kicking but in the arabs
case ki-gor only bought himself a few
extra moments of life with a startled
lizards speed the gunman darted aside
firing as he dodged

  the slug burned past ki-gors arm ki-
gors racing hand caught his knife from
its sheath swung it up with straining speed
for a throw but the white lord knew
as he lifted the knife that it was a futile
action that he could never beat that next
shot

  then suddenly as though an invisible
hand had reached out of the dark heavens
to strike him the gunman gave a queer
backward jump his gun blasting far wide
of the jungle man

  the arab staggered drunkenly cursing
in a voice edged with pain the hand
holding the pistol sank to his side and
unexpectedly as ki-gor raced toward
him the man sat down heavily his voice
trailed off vaguely and when ki-gor got
to him he had dropped over on his side
and lay quiet

  the white lord reached down took
the gun from the arabs dead fingers
rolled him on his back then he saw what
had saved his life an arrow was driven
through the center of the mans chest a
small light arrow tipped with yellow
feathers

  ki-gor grunted in surprise glanced
narrowly at the dark trees about him
then as the battle-clamor bore in on him
he dropped his eye abruptly to the head
slaver and the bantu neither man
showed any signs of life so the white

stories

lord snatched up the broad-bladed knife
which the masai warrior had dropped and
ran toward the main fighting

  he found the bantus had never re-
covered from the masais initial onslaught
when they reeled back from that charge
they left a score of dead and wounded
behind now with machine-like effici-
ency the masai were hemming them
against one corner of the thorn wall at-
tacking with a concerted savagery which
kept the bantus from ever getting off the
defense

  the white lords sudden appearance
beside the giant tembu george was the
final straw needed to break the bantus
crumbling morale he had slain their
masters and now he came to direct per-
sonally their own destruction

iv

under any other circumstances na-
tives in their position would have
thrown down their arms and surrendered
but having been caught red-handed traf-
ficking in slaves the bantus were afraid
to surrender if the massai didnt kill
them immediately they would be marched
to the white mans gallows on the coast

  therefore when they realized all was
lost a wild panic burst over them the
one urge in every bantus mind was to
save his own skin it happened with amaz-
ing swiftness a black suddenly wheeled
from the line of battle darted for the
thorn wall tore frantically at it with his
bare hands

  that started the rout instead of clos-
ing up the gap behind the deserter his
fellows needed only his example to set
them off immediately they were claw-
ing at the thorn all about him screeching
and hitting in an insane effort to be the
first to get away

  the masai swayed in clubbing the in-
sane bantus determined none of them
would get away in that scene the order-
ly precision with which tembu george
usually handled his men was impossible
he was helpless therefore when fifty
yards away he saw four bantus tear
through the mass of struggling men and
flee for the river

  he pulled ki-gor out of the fray point-
ed to the running blacks come we
the golden claws of raa



must stop them he exclaimed in alarm
theyll run head-on into helene in cross-
ing the river theyll kill her out of
spite

  before ki-gor could speak the upset
chieftain was sprinting after the bantus
at top speed ki-gor leaped after him
straining every nerve to overtake the big
man he caught up with tembu george
just as they came abreast of the crumpled
tent

  he shouted to make himself heard above
the din wait he cried putting his
hand on the chieftains shoulder they
wont find her there

  tembu george turned on him excited-
ly but they might theyll kill her i
tell you

  shes perfectly safe tembu george
ki-gor assured him

  you cant be sure

  no the jungle man snapped look
at the arrow in that arab beside the tent

  the tension left the masai leaders face
as he saw the arrow there was no mis-
taking it it was one of a set he made
especially for helene

  ki-gors glance combed the dark
branches of the trees about them it was
well for once that she disobeyed me he
said with a grim smile she saved my
life

  tembu george laughed hugely and
now she is afraid to show herself

  he started back at a run with ki-gor
to help his men but saw there was no need
for haste the fight was over a sudden
stillness came to the camp the last fear-
crazed bantu had been subdued not
more than seven of the entire number had
managed to reach the safety of the dark
jungle

  several of his men came toward him
what about those who got away they
asked

  youve done enough for one day
tembu george declared morning will
be soon enough to worry about them

  pride shone in his usually stern un-
readable face

  ki-gors eyes touched each man in turn
halting last on tembu george i know
now what it is to run with lions he said
and pleasure at the compliment rose strong
and quick in the masai

-jungle-fall

  the files of men and women who a few
minutes before had been doomed to slav-
ery were on their feet still too dazed to
fully comprehend what had occurred
free them ki-gor ordered

  but lest their chains grow rusty add-
ed tembu george lock the bantus in
their place

  ki-gor frowned but offered no objec-
tion he walked to the head slaver took
a ring of keys from his belt the slaver
was beginning to stir and moan

  lets look at this arab dango he said
angrily and reaching down ripped away
the folds of cloth covering the mans face

  wah exclaimed tembu george in
astonishment

  by all the gods said the white lord
and with eyes suddenly grown bleak and
cold he stared at the mans long narrow
face

  it was not a face one would easily for-
get beneath the high white forehead
close-set eyes hugged a thin long nose
except for a few coarse reddish hairs the
man had no pretense of eyebrows his
mouth was a crooked gash like a narrow
ridge of scar tissue set in a receding chin

  sam slaker ki-gor gritted no
wonder he hid his rotten face and body
behind arab robes

  tembu george chopped the air vicious-
ly with his great knife

  stand aside he growled one blow
and well be rid of this evil dog

  ki-gor raised a protecting arm

  no he said he must be returned
to prison this time theyll put a noose
about his neck

  we thought that last time argued the
masai leader instead he was sentenced
	jungle

to work his life out in a rock pit i knew
hed escape hes too clever for them

still ki-gor stood between tembu
george and the slaver he hated sam
slaker as much as his friend but he real-
ized that the formal execution of the
blackbirder by the government would
carry much more weight with others of
his kind than his slaying by a native war
party and it might help convince certain
lethargic officials that as ki-gor warned
slavers were again becoming a serious
problem in the congo

  i want him alive ki-gor declared
firmly without explanation chain him
with the bantus

 for a tense moment tembu george
didnt move

  then he shrugged his massive shoulders
and stepped back

  it shall be as you say he granted
you do nothing without good reason-
he hesitated-but i ask you to remember
that this dango lives only for the day he
can kill you so long as he breathes you
are in peril he has the devils own cun-
ning

  ki-gors grey eyes softened as he real-
ized it was his own safety tembu george
was concerned about then abruptly he
remembered the white girl

  ho he exclaimed the girl will
think us mad chattering like monkeys and
not raising a hand to free her we are
fine rescuers

  he walked with his lithe easy stride
toward her apologizing for his thick-
headedness he felt even more badly
when he saw how tensely she stood her
long legs wide-spaced her back pressed
hard against the tree the way she was
turned her face was too much in shadow
for him to read her expression

  youre safe now he said soothingly
everythings going to be allfright well
get you back to your people in quick or-
der

  he raised his right hand to show her
he held the key to her iron neckband the
moment he moved his arm her foot lashed
out at him it was a lightning kick aimed
at his groin

  purely by luck he started to turn as she
kicked meaning to go behind her and un-
tie her hands before he unlocked the neck-

stores

band so the blow landed on his thigh as
it was it staggered him

  with a surprised grunt he caught his
balance and jumped out of her reach the
girl immediately pressed against the tree
poised to deliver a kick with either leg if
he started at her she had moved enough
so that the firelight touched her features

  her jaw was gritted her eyes as watch-
ful and apprehensive as a cornered ani-
mals he could see the quick nervous
flare of her nostrils as she breathed

  ki-gor frowned unconsciously rubbing
the red mark on his leg as he studied her
it hadnt occurred to him before that a
brawny half-naked white man leading a
band of tall black warriors might look far
from reassuring to the girl instead of
realizing she was saved she thought she
had exchanged a bad master for a worse
one

  look he said pointing to where the
masai were releasing the jubilant prison-
ers from their chains ive come to free
you im ki-gor surely you dont think
im a slaver

  she gave no sign she heard him if
anything she grew more wary as though
she believed his pointing was only a trick
to distract her attention long enough for
him to reach her

  whats wrong with you asked the
puzzled jungle man cant you under-
stand me no one is going to harm you

  tembu george had remained by the
tent while his warriors went to free the
prisoners not wishing to divert any of the
praise from the fighting men he used
part of slakers robe to tie the slavers
hands and feet before he went to ki-gors
sicfe

  perhaps mistreatment has shaken her
mind he offered sympathetically

  it is something strange agreed the
white lord

  there was a movement in the lower
branches of a tree near them a white
figure showed vaguely against the dark
foliage then helene dropped lithely to
the ground

  oh you men she said disgustedly
her very tone betraying that she had been
eavesdropping on them just look at
yourselves and youll see why no stranger
would trust you bloody knives in your
hands blood stains all over you frowning
the golden claws of raa	

like you were going to eat the poor thing
up

  she came toward the two speechless
men waving her hand for them to stand
back with slow deliberate actions she
divested herself of her own weapons
dropped them on the ground she took
the key from her husband

  then talking softly reassuringly she
approached the girl the blonde stirred
nervously her nostrils flaring her eyes
bright in the dim light but gradually
as helene advanced she began to relax

  making no sudden movements helen
untied the girls wrists unlocked the cruel
iron band about her neck from the way
the blonde handled her hands helene
knew they were without feeling from the
tight bonds so she massaged them gently

the blonde gingerly submitted to
her ministrations but for all
helenes talking the girl never uttered a
word most of the time she kept her
glance fixed on ki-gor studying minutely
the man she sensed was in control of the
war party

  when circulation had been restored to
her hands she abruptly pulled them away
from helene she flexed her fingers
moved her arms trying them she seemed
to change confidence coming into her

  she pushed past helene and no longer
showing any apprehensiveness walked up
to ki-gor her movements had a cats
smooth flowing grace and there was a
cat-like intensity to the unblinking gaze
with which she scrutinized the white lord
at close range she appeared unaware of
tembu georges existence so utterly did
she ignore him

  despite the air of strangeness about her

word nor expression did she give any evi-
ki-gor could not help but be struck with
her unusual beauty she would have
brought a fortune to slaker among the
dusky-skinned races a blonde woman was
particularly esteemed and one as fair and
young as this would have set any slave
mart into an uproar

  he smiled at her im sorry we
startled you he said well get you
back to your people as soon as we can
tell me what is your name and where
are you from 

  she watched his lips tilting her head a
little to listen as he spoke but by neither
word nor expression did she give any evi-
dence she understood him

  instead she stepped close to him
touched his hair- with her hand dropped
her fingers to his shoulder and traced them
slowly down his arm then she ran the
flat of her palm across the rock-like pads
of muscle which ridged out across ki-
gors broad chest

  there was neither boldness nor affec-
tion in the gesture she seemed to act
purely from curiosity like a child inspect-
ing some strange object

  ki-gors eyes momentarily widened in
surprise she acted as though she had
never seen a man before anyway a white
man and at her touch there rose un-
bidden to his mind an almost forgotten
incident of his youth he had carelessly
fallen asleep on a grassy plot beside a
stream only to be awakened by a velvety
touch exploring his bare skin he found
a lioness curiously snuffling his body he
had kept perfectly still expecting death at
any moment but for some inexplicable
reason the cat had padded off into the
	jungle

jungle once its curiosity was satisfied

  helene i dont believe this girl under-
stands a word we say he declared

  helenes answer was drowned out by
the blondes shrill alarmed cry looking
past the white lord the girl had seen
sam slaker inching on belly toward a
knife dropped by some warrior during the
battle the slaver had regained con-
sciousness and was trying to take advan-
tage of ki-gors preoccupation with the
girl to free himself

  before ki-gor could turn the blonde
was racing for slaker hearing her
scream the slaver writhed about into a
sitting position just in time to see her
literally dive at him his distorted face
growing swollen and bruised from the
beating ki-gor had given him jerked to-
ward the white lord

  no no he shrieked keep her
away no

  and then the hurtling weight of hr
body chopped off his voice and you could
hear her snarl with the berserk rage of an
animal in her attack there was none of
the aimless clawing and flailing with
which most women fight

  she rained blows on slaker much as
ki-gor had hitting with deadly strength
and accuracy but where the white lords
object had been merely to knock the slaver
out it was clear she meant to beat the
man to death bound as he was he was
absolutely helpless

  he managed once to cry ki-gors name
appealing for help but the sound of his
voice so enraged the girl that she clamped
her fingers about his throat he bucked
wildly making a hideous rattling noise as
his breath choked off

v

neither ki-gor nor tembu george
had moved so spellbound were they
by the girls savagery but the spectacle
shocked helene into speech

  stop her ki-gor she shouted shes
killing him

  ki-gor roused then reached the blonde
in four quick steps he caught her hands
pried them from slakers throat and it
took his full strength to do so she fought
to get back at the slaver and failing in
that she switched her attack on the white

stories

lord it finally required the combined
efforts of tembu george and ki-gor both
to drag her away

  with the same swiftness with which
she had attacked slaker she suddenly
quieted with smouldering eyes she
glared at the men holding her and at the
crowd of blacks which had gathered

  wah exclaimed tembu george
this is no woman from the settlements
by all the gods shes the spawn of jungle
devils

  shes a strange one all right ki-gor
said but i dont blame her for wanting
to settle scores with slaker

  tembu george shook his head wonder-
ingly

  what do we do with her he asked

  let her go directed the white lord
i want her to understand she must leava
slaker alone but i dont want her to think
were taking his part or are angry with
her right now she looks like she thinks
were allies of his and that we might pun-
ish her

  he released his grip on the girl patted
her reassuringly on the shoulder then he
pointed at slaker waggled a forbidding
finger and repeated the word no several
times he was certain she understood his
meaning but there was no sign she agreed
to obey

  patch slaker up as well as you can
ki-gor told tembu george i wanted
to question him but from his looks he
wont have his senses about him before
morning meanwhile ill see what i can
learn about the girl from the bantus

  but ki-gor found that the prisoners
knew practically nothing about how slaker
had gotten hold of the girl four days
before the raid on the pygmy kraal the
slaver had left them in camp and gone
ahead with two warriors to scout the area

  when he returned he had the girl with
him and was in a high rage because of the
trouble he had had in making her walk to
the camp the two warriors werent with
him and when the bantus asked about
them he merely snarled that they had been
slain capturing the girl and gave no de-
tails

  the day had been a strenuous one for
ki-gor so he decided to get what sleep
he could and leave the solution of the
blondes identity for morning before he
the golden claws of raa



lay down however he stood at a distance
and watched her twice he saw her leave
helene stride nervously to the edge of the
camp and stare off into the darkness after
a time she would return her face thought-
ful sit down beside helene and resume
staring at slaker she took no notice of
anyone but the slaver coolly repulsing all
friendly overtures

  perhaps she is worried that the bantus
who escaped will return and try to kill or
capture her thought ki-gor he posted
a larger detail of guards than he would
have otherwise thinking the sight of them
would relieve her mind

  but because of the way she watched
slaker he also instructed the guards to
keep an eye on her in her condition he
wouldnt put it by her to get up once
everyone was asleep and try to finish off
the slaver

  ki-gor made a last inspection of slaker
found that tembu george was taking no
chances on his escaping the battered
man was not only tied hand and foot but
also was chained by the neck to a line of
bantu prisoners ki-gor didnt approve
of such severe measures but knowing how
the natives hated and feared the slaver he
thought it best riot to interfere

  ki-gor appropriated for himself and
helene one of the comfortable sleeping
mats in slakers tent gave another to the
blonde the night passed without incident
except that several times along toward
dawn ki-gor was stirred from sleep by
the wierd roaring challenge of a bull ape
there are few more blood-chilling sounds
than an angry gorillas cry but ki-gor
wasnt alarmed because he knew from ex-
perience the great tree-people seldom
caused trouble unless they were molested

  with the first grey light the camp be-
gan to awaken slakers erstwhile captives
were too overjoyed at their miraculous
rescue to lie sleeping freedom brought
renewed vigor to their exhausted bodies
made their hurts seem unimportant

  but as ki-gor had noticed about the
first person other than himself to awaken
was the blonde when the gorillas rever-
berating roar disturbed him he saw her
sit up suddenly and listen daylight found
her still sitting there an air of tenseness
about her despite the apparent composure
of her face the utter quietness of her

hands without appearing to watch her
he noted the too-quick rise and fall of her
full firm breasts beneath the narrow hal-
ter the constant movement of her eyes
along the ramparts of the thorn boma

  could it be she is afraid he wondered
perhaps her apparent bold self-reliance
was only a pose that would be woman-
like to face up without flinching to a dan-
ger she could see and yet worry herself
sick about an imagined threat

  ki-gor awakened helene sit with
the girl he said and ill see what i can
find for us in the way of food

k-gor took helenes light bow and
quiver of arrows and left the camp
he moved quietly along the stream
searching out fruit and berry bushes
where birds clustered to feed with his
unerring aim it was only the work of a
few minutes before he had enough plump
birds for breakfast

  then he cut the top from a dried gourd
jammed it with blue vastoy pears a va-
riety of nuts and berries and kava an-
other gourd he filled with cool clear
water which bubbled out of the river
bank when he returned to camp helene
helped him clean the birds slice the kava
and cook them over hot coals

  the meal unexpectedly was made more
sumptuous when tembu george sent one
of his warriors with a roasted piece of
antelope and a grinning pygmy contrib-
uted a large white-fleshed fish which he
had speared in the river and broiled to
savory tenderness

  ki-gor got small gourds for drinking
cups and large dew-wet leaves for plates
	jungle

the blonde watched the preparations with
a blend of curiosity and suspicion she
held herself aloof as the jungle couple sat
down served her and helped themselves
to portions

  this looks more like a feast than
breakfast laughed helene 

  ki-gor smacked his lips appreciatively
a warriors meal as our little friend
ngeeso would say he had eaten spar-
ingly the day before so with an enthusi-
asm befitting his size he plunged into the
food

  but he had taken no more than a few
mouthfuls when helene sitting cross-
legged beside him nudged his foot mean-
ingfully with her toe

  the blonde had bolted the berries and
fruit but hadnt touched anything else ki-
gor knew she must be hungry and he
couldnt understand her reluctance to eat
by gestures he tried to assure her the
meal was perfectly all right

  whats wrong with her he asked
helene does she think we might poison
her

  no answered helene she acts more
like she isnt familiar with cooked food i
begin to think there really is a deep mys-
tery bout this girl

  do what they would they couldnt get
the blonde to taste either the meat or fish
she did sample grudgingly a bit of the
crisp savory kava but almost immediate-
ly she screwed her face up in distaste and
would take no more but when they gave
her their portions of fruit she set to eat-
ing with a will

  ki-gor waited until she was finished
then set out to learn whether the girl
spoke any of the many dialects he knew
over and over using a different tongue
each time he asked what her name was
in her odd unblinking way she watched
his mouth with only her eyes betraying
the fact that she had any interest in his
actions her face remained wooden re-
vealing nothing

  when he had exhausted his fund of dia-
lects ki-gor sighed hopelessly i just
dont know he said i was beginning
to feel that perhaps she was a white girl
captured and brought up by some african
tribe there is the feel of the jungle about
her but not a single tongue registered
with her

stories

  i had the same feeling about her
helene agreed we must be wrong
though i guess shes a european of some
kind if shed only talk i might guess at
her nationality

  they attempted to elicit talk of any kind
from her even going so far as to pick up
various objects pointing to them and call-
ing their names in an attempt to get her
to say something except for an occa-
sional quick glance about the camp she
gave them her undivided attention but not
once did she utter a sound

  could she be deaf and dumb mut-
tered helene exaspei-ated

  no said ki-gor definitely maybe
she wants us to think so but you watch
the next time she glances away

  near his right hand lay a large flat
rock the instant the blondes attention
was diverted from him his fingers closed
over the rock with a flick of his power-
ful wrist muscles he tossed the stone into
the air behind the girl sending it high
enough to hit among the tree branches

  he acted so quickly and silently that
she suspected nothing as she turned her
glance back to him the rock smacked
against a limb with a loud report splin-
tered downward through leaves and twigs

  at the first noise the blonde shot to
her feet with incredible speed her stolid
mask replaced by a strange wild expres-
sion her eyes seemed to flame with light
and a queer low cry broke from her lips

  the white stone dropped from the lower
branches hit the ground and rolled with
slowly decreasing speed toward her taut-
drawn as a war-bow the girl stared for
the space of three heart beats at the rock

  then with narrowed eyes she turned to
face ki-gors amused smile there was no
doubt but that she understood the pur-
pose of his trick for a bit it looked as
if she might leap at him but gradually her
rigid muscles relaxed and the anger melted
from her face

  haaiiieee chuckled ki-gor i
would say both ears and tongue work very
well now we will begin again

the white lord pointed to him-
self ki-gor ki-gor he said
he gestured at his mate repeated her
name three times then he pointed at the
girl his face asking a question
the golden claws of raa	

  the blonde watched him sullenly slow-
ly her grey eyes smouldering she touched
her breast with her hand

  raa she said raa

  at last exclaimed helene she
does understand but what an unusual
name

  before ki-gor could go any further
tembu george called him the masai
chieftain had assembled representatives
from each of the various tribal groups for
a council meeting the white lord had re-
quested ki-gor wanted to learn the de-
tails of sam slakers raids the number of
men and women slain on the march and
then he wanted to plan for the return of
his charges to their own kraals organi-
zation was necessary to transport the sick
and wounded and there were many de-
tails to be handled such as sending run-
ners ahead assigning certain men as
guards others to hunt or gather healing
herbs

  i must go ki-gor said rising but
keep working with her until i get back
now that she has melted a little maybe
we can learn something about her

  the council was gathered on the river
bank to reach the circle of blacks he
had to pass slaker and the bantu prison-
ers they were chained together in a
single line guarded by four masai war-
riors

  the white man was fastened at the end
of the line chained by the neck to a hulk-
ing native next to him slaker was too
weak to stand so he slumped in a sitting
position his face swollen and discolored
one eye completely closed he was a far
cry from the arrogant master of the slave
caravan ki-gor had observed striding into
the clearing the evening before he was
completely cowed

  slaker dropped his head when he saw
the white lord but ki-gor went past
him without a word let him squirm
wondering what im going to do to him
ki-gor thought when hes wrought up
enough hell babble his head off for fear
im going to give him sofne of his own
medicine

  ki-gor sat down with the natives be-
gan to deal calmly and efficiently with
the problems before them he gave his
full attention to the council paying little
heed to the camp noises with so many

men about him his usual wariness was re-
laxed

  thus when the shattering roar sounded
from the middle of the camp his shock
was as complete as was that of the others

  it was a tremendous eruption of sound
which literally engulfed a man hammer-
ing instinctive terror into every nerve and
fiber deep it was like a booming roar
erupting from some deep cavern tearing
the eardrums with its reverberations
swelling with unbelievable intensity

  ki-gor heard it and for a moment the
mindless terror inspired by that fearful
blasting challenge held even him motion-
less then his mind conquered sheer ani-
mal impulse and he drove to his feet

  ringagi ingagi rose the shrill
frightened cry from a score of trembling
throats

  ki-gors startled eyes knifed over the
camp giant hairy forms were plummet-
ing from the trees into the very center of
the enclosure seemingly insane with
rage the gorillas drummed their mon-
strous chests and roared defiance as soon
as they rtruck the ground

  and the two persons nearest to them
were helene and the blonde girl

  never knowing he spoke he cried
helenes name then he was racing to-
ward her straining with all his magnifi-
cent strength to reach her side before one
of the ravening bulls should charge down
on her there was real fear in ki-gor
then fear for helene a score of times
he had reen mens bodies hammered to
pulp or literally ripped apart by a gorillas
awful attack he sprinted past a stack of
captured bantu spears and leaned in full
stride to snatch one up

  on ah ksides blacks were running for
safety a great ring of fleeing natives
sweeping outward from the dark cluster
	jungle

of apes but the two women stood as
though paralyzed

  run  screamed the white lord but
his voice was a tiny splinter of sound
against the roaring madness of the gorillas

  he saw how helene suddenly seemed
to awaken and though he couldnt hear
her he knew by the way her lips worked
that she was shrieking helene reached
for the blonde girls arm and leaped away
from the apes she was trying to save the
blonde

  but even as his mate acted a tremend-
ous beast plowed out of the growing horde
of gorillas the bull shoved fully erect
lashed the vast length of his arm overhead
and plunged snarling at the two girls

  ki-gor saw the animals hideous face
the whole left side of it permanently dis-
torted by a many-tongued scar which ran
from temple to jaw he saw also that in
height in breadth of shoulders in sheer
bulk the beast was larger by far than any
of his fellows

  this was the gorilla he had seen in the
forest the day before the leader of the
first migrating band he had stumbled on

  at the moment he recognized the giant
ki-gor saw the blonde girl tear loose
from helenes grip an agonized curse
broke from his lips in her panic the girl
had lost her head and in jerking away
from helenes guiding hand she spun
squarely in the path of the charging ape

  the huge beast caught her up like a doll
and flung her over his shoulder his tri-
umphant roar blasted up through the din
his head swung about jerkily surveying
the camp the line of bantus caught his
attention being chained the blacks
couldnt flee

  clutching the girl with one arm the
bull started for the bantus apparently
choosing to charge a group rather than
pursue helene alone he scuttled over
the ground at great speed knuckling the
earth with his free arm to give himself
added balance following his lead all the
other apes except ne rushed in a solid
mass toward the prisoners that one
burst after helene his immense fangs
bared in hate

  ki-gor saw the beast gain on his mate
and his legs drove faster helenes eyes
were wide with fear as she fled she
realized that she ran a losing race giving

stories

more attention to the monster behind her
than to the course she followed she failed
to see the dead limb lying half-hidden in
the short grass dead ahead of her

  her right foot struck the limb with
no chance to catch herself she went
sprawling head first into the grass the
gorilla when he saw his quarry fall raised
himself in a great leap to clear the branch
and reach helene he was intent on the
girl and paid no heed to the bronzed
jungle man who flashed in on him from
the left

  arrow-straight ki-gor catapulted at
the hairy giant the war-spear gripped
level before him with both hands if the
beast thought to destroy the girl and still
have time to turn and dispose of the man
he misjudged ki-gors lightning speed
the white lord struck just as the ape
leaped the fallen branch and was still in
the air

  he hammered the spear into the bulls
side used his driving weight to plunge the
shaft half its length through the creature
the shock of the blow and the plunging
upward shove ki-gor gave the shaft just
before he released it served to pitch the
gorilla off-course and make him miss
helene in his spring

vi

the ape bellowed in pain whirled
to confront the puny man-thing who
had dared attack him the beast grimaced
horribly and in a spasm of pain reached
down and clawed the wooden shaft pro-
truding from his side a bloody froth
gushed from his mouth dripped over the
hairy black skin of his chest

  the ape suddenly flung himself at ki-
gor but swift as he was the jungle man
was swifter the white lord danced
away knife in hand forcing the beast to
whirl and charge again continuing these
dangerous tactics ki-gor enticed the ani-
mal away from helene

  blood was flooding from the apes
mouth and wound when the white lord
decided to risk an aggressive move him-
self as the animal charged him he sud-
denly leaped straight in on the beast in-
stead of dancing out of reach

  he slashed his knife across the apes
right forearm as the creature struck at


the golden claws of raa



him and then he leaped away the gorilla
was weakening growing unsteady as blood
gushed from the great tear in its chest
ki-gor circled rapidly keeping always on
the side of the injured arm

  then a second time he leaped in his
knife churned twice into the beasts throat
when he spun away this time the ape
didnt follow instead the monster swayed
crazily his good hand clawing at his sev-
ered jugular vein

  like a toppling tree the gorilla abrupt-
ly collapsed without another glance at
the beast ki-gor ran to where helene
was dazedly trying to rise he helped her
up heard her assurance she was only
jarred and bruised

  in the interval while the white lord
struggled with the ape tembu george
managed to gather his masai and a scat-
tering of other blacks he rushed these
men forward thinking a shower of spears
and arrows would turn the ingagi away
from the bantus

  as he hoped many of the ingagi swung
to face the advancing men others more
knowing about spears and arrows shied
away and went rampaging through the
camp

  but the scarred ingagi leader and two
followers charged into the bantus with
fists and fangs they laid about them tear-
ing four blacks apart in the space of sec-
onds then they swung toward the end of
the terror-stricken line where sam slaker
was insanely lunging and throwing him-
self about in an effort to break his chains
and run

  one of the three killers staggered and
went down under a whistling flight of ar-
rows from tembu georges men but the
masai were afraid to shoot at the leader
for fear of killing the blonde girl as the
two berserk apes reached slaker the un-
encumbered one reached out and grasped
the chain about the neck of the black next
to the slaver

  seemingly with no more effort than if
	jungle

he were tearing a leaf the beast jerked
the chain and ripped the bantus head
from his body disregarding the blood
fountaining over him the animal fastened
his hands more firmly on the blood-wet
chain and with a second tug snapped its
iron links apart

  slaker suddenly freed by the breaking
of the chain fell backwards he tried so
desperately to get on his feet and run be-
fore the apes should kill him that he liter-
ally flailed the ground with his arms and
legs finally he shot up legs pumping
his face wrenched with horror

  but before he had gone six steps the
gorilla leader smashed a club-like arm
down on his head and shoulders knocked
him rolling the other ape bounded to
the senseless slaver on all-fours snarled
over the still body for a moment it
seemed the animal would bury his fangs
in slakers back

  but just then the scarred leader reared
to his full height gave a thundering road
and started running toward the jungle
the animal crouching over slaker imme-
diately scooped up the slaver in his arms
and charged after his fellow

  ki-gor who had left helene and rushed
to help tembu george barely had had
time to cast his spear when the head bull
gave his roar and trampled for cover the
mass of ingagi facing the masai wheeled
when they heard their leaders cry and
went racing after him

  the hairy horde tore through the thorn
wall as though it were paper plunged into
the shadowy forest behind them in the
camp they left six of their kind sprawled
dead of arrow and spear wounds

  thii crazed screeching of the excited
men smd women in the enclosure persisted
for a few seconds then realizing the ter-
ror was over the blacks fell silent the
crash oi snapped limbs the crackle of
smashed brush faded as the ingagis
trampling rush carried them out of hear-
ing

  may a hundred devils rend my soul
swore tembu george fervently if ever i
saw a more fearful sight what could
have happened to drive them so mad with
rage that they would attack this many
armed men

  ki-gor frowned i dont know it
was very strange but thanks to your

stories

quick thinking our losses were small
ki-gor shifted nervously his lips set
hard tembu george studied him know-
ingly

  you think of slaker and the girl the
chieftain quickly said you wish to go
after them but you hesitate to ask men
to follow you

  with their almost man-like cunning
their insane courage and prodigous
strength no beasts are more dangerous to
hunt than gorillas

  tembu george tapped the knuckles of
his left hand against the jungle mans
chest gimshai the stealer of souls has
in his mind the exact time and place and
way every man will die he will not be
hurried by any decisions we make we
masai understand that so lead on
ki-gor looked sharply at his friend
gimshai has never failed to wfccome any-
one who wanted to hurry matters

  tembu george appeared not to hear
him in a voice which rang through the
camp he told his warriors that any who
wished to do so could accompany him and
ki-gor in trying to trail the white girl
he didnt even mention the despised
slaker

  the chieftain had hardly spoken when
pygmies armed with captured bantu weap-
ons began hurrying to ki-gor

  let us be your eyes o white lord
said one of them

  and ki-gor gratefully accepted the ser-
vices of the small men as trackers better
than all others the pygmies knew the
ways of the ingagi

  helene anxiously asked ki-gor is
there really a chance you might save
them 

  practically none he unhappily con-
fessed but since they were both alive
when taken i feel i must make a search
at least i can find and bury their bodies
but ki-gor wasnt to have the satis-
faction of giving decent burial to the two
whites once in the jungle he found that
the ingagi had scattered and except by
following each spoor which he didnt have
men enough to do there was no way of
knowing where the tom bodies lay

  by noon of the next day after having
flushed three wounded apes intensely
working back and forth over the jungle
following fading spoors ki-gor finally
the golden claws of raa	

resigned himself to the fact that his search
was hopeless

an older soldier would have been
cursing the day he had asked for
foreign service but lt philip arnsdale
assigned only three weeks before straight
from military school to his majestys
third fusiliers only mopped hopelessly
at the sweat streaming from his face and
tried to hide his nervousness he felt very
alone in the pygmy kraal despite the eight
somali regulars under his command

  this ki-gor he was to meet the lieu-
tenant understood was quite an extraor-
dinary fellow went about unclothed
fighting animals living like a savage
arnsdale closed his eyes against the sun
tried to picture ki-gor

  he was anxious to get on well with the
fellow beqause since this was his first solo
assignment a kind of test run given him
by his commanding officers he wanted
nothing to mar it made him uneasy
though the man was surely a bit on the
balmy side and the way arnsdale pictured
him he would be a hulking hairy-chested
type one of those low-forehead boys with
a battered face and an ugly disposition

  the commanding officer in sending him
to get the bantus which ki-gor had cap-
tured said that the blacks had been taken
three weeks previously but because of the
knocking about they had gotten only now
were able to travel

  with a start arnsdale realized that the
pygmy chieftain ngeeso somehow had
materialized without a sound beside him

that meant ki-gor would appear out of
the jungle soon curious how these fierce
little beggars seemed to know the exact
moment anything was to happen yet they
had no more idea of time than the man in
the moon he had come up to the kraal
quiet as a mouse yesterday with his men
yet there ngeeso had been at the gate
with a welcome party waiting for him

  arnsdale turned to the somali cor-
poral who acted as his interpreter with
the pygmies ask ngeeso he told the
interpreter if it would be wise for me
to give ki-gor anything-you know-a
present as i would an important native
chieftain

  except for a faint play of muscles in
his cheek ngeeso didnt change expres-
sion as the interpreter dutifully relayed
the message to him

  one feels too insignificant declared
ngeeso solemnly to the somali to ad-
vise the lord of many guns

  the lieutenant brightened at the phrase
lord of many guns he must remem-
ber that phrase in his letters home

  but if i may humbly suggest relayed
ngeeso this ki-gor is most fond of
these objects his index finger touched
two of the buttons on arnsdales shirt
he used them to make bracelets and
necklaces no doubt he would receive a
handful of them with great joy

  by ngeesos careful estimate a hand-
ful would strip the lieutenant and his eight
men of every gleaming button on their
blouses

  before arnsdale could settle down he
received another shock several pygmies
jabbered pointed toward some trees star-
ing apprehensively through the gate into
the jungle he saw a running figure ap-
pear on a high branch he caught his
breath it was a man going at full tilt on
that narrow swaying perch
	jungle

  he forgot his dignity great scot
he cried hell fall

  the man swerved from the branch dove
out into thin air hurtled at a sharp angle
toward the ground then just whenarns-
dales face screwed up in horror the plum-
meting figure caught a vine swung twen-
ty yards and dropped free again only to
grasp another vine and skim to earth in a
long safe arc

  this wasnt at all the physical type the
lieutenant expected despite his massive
build ki-gor was a clean-cut intelligent
even an impressive looking man but
there was no getting around the fact that
no normal person would be flinging
around trees and living like a savage

  remembering his position arnsdale
managed an order to his eight men in a
strained voice the somali obediently
drew themselves up in their idea of atten-
tion they were splendid fighting men
but hardly the european conception of
military spit and polish

  the lieutenant had expected this flour-
ish to please ki-gor appeal to his childish
nature but the white lord seemed not
even to notice the salute instead he came
straight up to arnsdale his ice-grey eyes
made a quick appraisal

  ki-gor halted his face devoid of ex-
pression and after a long hesitation si-
lently extended his hand the lieutenant
could not know that ki-gors sudden
woodenness of manner was shyness and
reserve the white mans custom of shak-
ing hands was always awkward to the
jungle lord

 er-how do you do gasped arns-
dale

  welcome the white lord said

  great honor and all that to meet you
declared arnsdale unsteadily with a

glance at ngeeso i- would like to

offer you a sort of present

  oh said ki-gor his brows arching

  ah yes gulped arnsdale only take
a moment he turned and muttered to
the somali corporal

  the black looked troubled but he obedi-
ently drew his knife and starting down
the line of soldiers began cutting the metal
buttons from their tunics

  when the corporal was finished hav-
ing cut his own and the lieutenants but-
tons also he tumbled them all into arns-

stores

dales cupped hands with a strained
smile the lieutenant held the buttons out
to ki-gor

  here he said im sorry there
arent more they arent much of a gift
but perhaps they will be of use to you

  ki-gor fell back a step his mouth
dropped open the lieutenant followed
him his smile grown more strained as he
jerkily encouraged ki-gor to take the but-
tons

  had the lieutenant had too much sun
wondered ki-gor or had he been foolish
enough to drink some of the pygmy beer
which ngeeso pressed on guests this
was the strangest thing hed ever had hap-
pen to him

  not knowing what else to do he finally
allowed arnsdale to press the buttons into
his hands he was still holding them fool-
ishly trying to think of anything in the
world to say when ngeeso hoarsely in-
vited the two white men to his hut

the moment he heard ngeesos
voice ki-gors head shot up sus-
picion flaring in his eyes the little chief-
tain had swiftly turned and started for his
hut entirely too swiftly ki-gor saw how
the pygmy leaders shoulders were quak-
ing and heaving

  ngeeso he snapped accusingly i
see your handprint in this speak up now
you little devil and tell the truth

  with that ngeeso could contain him-
self no longer he burst into gales of
laughter and bending double reeled weak-
ly about finally falling to the ground in
utter collapse

  ki-gor gave a violent roar assailed the
pygmy with a storm of native invective
then chopping off in mid-sentence he
suddenly began to laugh himself his scowl
swept away by delight he was as con-
vulsed as ngeeso by the ridiculous prank

  the mass of pygmies quickly took in
the situation and also began to laugh and
for a moment the somali joined them
only arnsdale who had understood noth-
ing of ki-gors remarks in the pygmy
tongue failed to understand what was go-
ing on he looked about him wildly
thinking over and over to himself that if
he ever got home he would never set foot
out of england again no matter if it
meant facing a firing squad
the golden claws of raa



  ki-gor eventually got hold of himself
and with tears streaming down his face
went over and put both hands on arns-
dales shoulders in the friendliest fashion

  that little imp ngeeso made fools
of us both he chuckled

  arnsdale began to sputter angrily
dont be angry with him said ki-
gor apparently the opportunity to joke
me was just too good for him to pass up
hed sell his soul to make a fool of either
me or tembu george

  you-you mean he deliberately led

me to make an ass of myself exclaimed
the embarrassed officer

  im afraid so chuckled the white
lord just what was i supposed to do
with your buttons

  why make bracelets and necklaces out
of them indignantly exploded arnsdale
he said you loved them he made you
out a roaring wild man who would be an-
gered beyond words if you didnt get your
beloved ornaments

  ki-gors great shoulders shook uncon-
trollably at the advantage ngeeso had
taken of the green young soldier

  arnsdale turned to confront his eight
somali they stiffened to attention sud-
denly fearful because they had dared laugh
at a white officer but instead of an an-
gry denunciation the lieutenant smiled at
them

  it was a wonderful prank on me cor-
poral he said ive got lots to learn do
what you can about getting those buttons
back on and corporal when pygmies
start giving me advice again dont be
afraid to speak your own mind

  the corporal saluted his dark eyes
beaming approval of his officer he took
the buttons from ki-gor and swinging
about began redistributing them

vii

while a feast was being prepared
ki-gor explained how his friends
the masai had captured the slavers arns-
dale tried to write the facts down so he
could make a full report but having never
heard a gun fired in anger he grew so
engrossed he kept forgetting to make
notes

  but you make no mention of yourself
he stated when ki-gor finished describ-

ing the night attack you took part
didnt you	

  you can mention me in connection
with what happened the next morning
directed the white lord and he told of
the gorilla raid slaker and the blonde
girl were lost the responsibility for their
deaths rests on me not on the masai i
was in charge of the camp then and i was
unable to save them

  arnsdale winced horrible way to
die he muttered

  i dont mind so much about slaker
ki-gor said hed earned an evil death
but i cant forget that girl shes on my
conscience it was my duty to protect her
and i failed

  arnsdale was quick to try to console
him pointing out how fortunate he was to
have suffered as few casualties as he did
now that he knew why the bantus had
been so long in getting well enough to
trek he was too ashamed to tell ki-gor
how he had thought the white lord guilty
of mistreating them

  after the noonday feast arnsdale made
his farewells the more time he spent
with ki-gor the less he was able to re-
concile the white lords quiet almost
gentle manner with his warlike reputa-
tion

  im sorry i cant go part of the way
with you apologized the jungle man
youll travel fairly close to where the
masai are waiting for me but i cant go
	jungle

until the pygmies finish brewing some poi-
son for us

  poison said the officer raising his
eyebrows

  for tipping spears and arrows ex-
plained ki-gor were going into gorilla
country

  arnsdale shook his head slowly

  after what you told me he fervently
declared i dont think id want any part
of such a hunt

  ki-gor smiled

  were not hunting apes he said my
pet elephant marmo wandered off while
i was away and a pygmy hunter saw his
tracks near the ingagi territory the other
day the bush is pretty thick in there so
we may be a long time running him down
i want m men to be ready in case the
apes cause trouble

  arnsdale glanced skeptically at the bow
strung across ki-gors back

  what you need is a rifle he advised
and a high powered one at that

  ill choose the poison the white lord
told him no matter where you hit a
gorilla with a poison-tipped arrow hes
finished but if you miss a vital spot with
a rifle youre finished

  it works that fast asked the lieu-
tenant in surprise

  it does the way ngeeso makes it
answered the jungle man

  he saw the question come into the offi-
cers eyes dont ask me what he mixes
up he went on i dont know thats
one secret the pygmies wont let out its
been their protection against big fellows
like us for hundreds of years

  arnsdale glanced at the small figures
about him with new respect

  jove he said no wonder the little
beggars are so cocky he stared at the
masai with wonder

  ngeeso came up then had the bantus
marched up and turned over to the so-
mali troops the chieftain spoke rapidly
to ki-gor his glance flicking repeatedly
to the officer

  what is it asked arnsdale when the
jungle man was slow to translate

  ngeeso says there has been at least
one ape near his kraal every day for a
whole moon explained ki-gor he
warns you to be careful he thinks the
tree-people have a grudge against the ban-

stories

tus and are waiting for them to be moved
from the kraal

  the lieutenant appeared bewildered
eh he mumbled

  hes giving you advice in good faith
ki-gor said warning him to guard his
expression the natives look on the in-
gagi as being considerable more than dumb
beasts i might say it is rather puzzling
for them to stay around the kraal
wouldnt hurt to be a little careful

  uh yes yes said arnsdale hastily
thank him for me

  but his tone betrayed the fact he
thought ngeesos warning ridiculous
why any schoolboy knew a maneuver of
that kind was beyond the capabilities of
any species of animal

  as he marched away down the trail at
the head of his men he smiled to him-
self it was somehow reassuring to find
that for all their supposed knowledge of
the jungle the pygmies were really a naive
and simple people imagine apes main-
taining a months vigil over a kraal watch-
ing for an opportunity to attack a few
bantu prisoners

  but had he possessed ki-gors animal
keen senses he would have known that
even as he smiled a great hairy figure
was crouched in the underbrush not a
knife-throw from him peering with
beady eyes at the line of marching men

  hardly were the men out of sight when
the gorilla rose silently its black wet
nostrils working a sliver of sunlight
reaching down through the branches il-
luminated its brutish features the whole
left side of the brutes face was distorted
into a permanent snarl by a hideous
many-tongued scar the beast turned
with a low angry growl and hurried
away through the forest

viii

helene strolled idly down the
winding game trail until ki-gor
returned from the pygmy kraal she had
little to occupy her the masai in typi-
cal native fashion were content to eat
and sleep away the hours but time hung
heavily on helenes hands it was always
so when her bronzed mate was absent

  she came to a mtondo tree occupied
herself like a bored child by prodding its
the golden claws of raa

rubbery bulbs with her spear-point to let
the white sap drain out when that task
was diligently attended to she moved on
to a bed of maheena blossoms in a sun-
splashed glen

  helene pored over the clusters of blue
crimson and yellow flowers trying to
make up her mind which blooms she
should select for a garland finally she
rejected them all deciding she would wait
and find a single orchid for her hair
without leaving the path she rejected a
score of blooms before selecting a pure
white one

  she paused to munch a few berries de-
bating whether she should turn back to
the camp a vanka lizard darted out of
the wassa grass not four feet from her
snared a green fly with a single dart of
its forked tongue the lizard froze for a
few seconds watching her with its cold
gem-like eyes

  helene had half-turned to retrace her
steps when a blue and orange kingfisher
swooped down in its brusque quick way
to perch on a rapphia palm the red-
haired girl looked at the bird and smiled
with sudden inspiration	-

  she set off along the trail at a trot the
kingfisher had reminded her of a deep
clear pool of water about a mile away



tembu george would be furious if he
knew she had strayed so far from camp
but what better way was there to pass
the time than with a cool refreshing
swim 

  the fern-splashed banks of the pool lay
in shade but the sun drove its white bril-
liance into the center of the water flood-
lighting the clean gravel of the bottom
and the darting shapes of gaudy-colored
fish

  helene gave a contented sigh leaned
her spear against a tree quickly dropped
her bow and quiver of arrows beside it
she had been foolish not to think of the
place before with impatient fingers she
untied her scanty halter dropped it to
the ground then with considerable wrig-
gling she slid out of the tight leopard-
skin shorts

  she took a deep happy breath as
though she had just rid herself of many
cloying layers of clothing as she specu-
lated on where she would plunge into the
water her hands in the immemorial way
of women explored the curve of her hips
the smooth flatness of her stomach the
swell of her bosom

  then taking two quick steps forward
she sprang lightly out over the water
knifed down in a long slanting dive for
	jungle

more than an hour she entertained herself
by splashing about in the pool swimming
and floating diving deep to chase blue and
red nuhana fish or retrieve some odd-
shaped pebble

  when a pleasant weariness began to
permeate her healthy young body she re-
luctantly left the water her hair had
come unbound while she swam and stand-
ing nude on the bank she ran her fingers
through it fluffing it loosely over her
bare shoulders and back she brushed
half-heartedly at the drops of water which
clung like jewels to the soft gold of her
skin as she looked about for a place to
rest and sunbathe

  she chose a low-hanging limb she
picked up her halter and shorts and hold-
ing them in her teeth climbed easily the
slanting trunk of the tree she walked
out along the broad limb to the point
where it was dappled with sunlight fil-
tered through a protective screeen of
leaves in the higher branches

  helene stretched out on her stomach
on - the warm bark resting her head on
her arms she relaxed lulled by the
warmth and the faint sway of the limb
she lay so still two purple and gold virini
birds came to rest on a branch a few
yards away while helene listened to
the liquid music of their song she drifted
into sleep

  she awakened with a start every mus-
cle suddenly tense her heart racing there
was no mistaking the sound which had
lashed her awake that angry rumbling
burst of noise could come only from a
gorillas throat and the beast sounded
as though he were directly below her

  helene stifled the instinctive impulse
to leap up and flee she tried desperate-
ly to remember ki-gors teachings keep-
ing her body motionless she raised her
head with agonizing slowness until she
could take in the whole scene about the
pool

the gorilla hadnt seen her she
was certain of that for the brute
stood at the edge of the water looking
away from her he kept shifting and
turning angling his head as though lis-
tening intently he apparently had come
swiftly out of the forest passed directly
beneath her

stories

  the ape was clearly wrought up about
something but with a certain measure of
relief helene realized she wasnt the
cause he hadnt discovered her presence
it was difficult to know what she should
do next

  both courses of action open to her were
fraught with danger the least sound or
movement was certain to attract the gor-
illas attention so despite her almost over-
whelming urge to flee helene would take
a long chance if she got up and tried to
run back along the limb and lose herself
in the forest

  her only other course was to lie still
and gamble that agitated as he was the
ape would storm off before a vagrant
breeze carried her scent to him the
safest plan she finally decided was to do
as the average defenseless jungle creature
would and play dead

  her blue eyes never left the bull taut-
limbed she endured the creeping seconds
and it seemed she had chosen rightly for
the beast showed no intimation that he
suspected a human was within a hundred
miles

  but to her disappointment he made no
move to leave instead he prowled ner-
vously about the bank stopping ever so
often to listen then at last he reared up
on his squat enormously muscled legs
and pounding his chest sent a shattering
roar reverberating out over the trees

  as he finished he gave a few deep
guttural growls like a man talking to him-
self and for the first time wheeled about
so helene could see his face her breath
caught in her throat the whole left side
of the beasts face was rent by a jagged
scar

  the gorilla was the same one who had
borne off the blonde girl

  a sick weakness gathered in helenes
stomach was she to be the second
woman murdered by the vicious beast
it was apparent by the gorillas looks that
he had travelled long and fast his
breath came in quick hard heaves his
hairy body was matted with burrs and
mud

  hes turned killer helene thought

  then abruptly the bull threw himself
down on the bank began to noisily gulp
water lying as he was there was no
chance for him to see helene
the golden claws of raa

  id be a fool to stay here longer
helene told herself i musnt let this
opportunity pass

  quickly yet with infinite caution she
raised on hands and knees the gorilla
hesitated in his drinking helene froze
the gleam of the sun on her naked body
would be certain to attract his eye if he
turned

  but after a few explosive snuffles to
clear his nostrils of water the ape re-
turned to sating his thirst helene picked
up her halter and shorts in her right hand
she was on her feet then the pulse throb-
bing in her throat as she turned her back
to the beast started for the tree trunk

  she judged it would take her fifteen
steps to reach the trunk then she must
swing around the bole of the tree run out
along another low branch about ten steps
before she could leap to the limb of the
nearest tree once in that second tree
the dense jungle growth would begin to
close around her hide her from view

  in that moment helene was deaf to
every sound except the apes sucking of
the water for so long as that sound con-
tinued she was safe in the same man-
ner she was momentarily blind to every-
thing except the branch along which she
ran it might mean her life to stumble or
to strike against a dry twig

  and being oblivious for that fleeting
interval to what went on around her she
didnt discover the line of gorillas thread-
ing out of the forest until she had reached
the trunk and was starting to swing
around it her eyes couldnt fail then
to see the dark rapidly moving line of
beasts

-jungle-fall

the path they followed led direct-
ly under her tree and the leading
animal was almost beneath her helens
face went white her fingers dug into
the bark and her breathing stopped she
squeezed against the trunk drawing back
so for a brief instant at least she wouldnt
be exposed to the view of the whole
group

  the lead ape gave a harsh short bark
the scar-faced gorilla by the pool imme-
diately leaped up and answered with a
barrage of guttural sounds stunned as
she was the swift hope drove up in
helene that the newcomers would charge
the surly beast by the pool if they
fought there was yet a small chance she
might get away while the whole packs
attention was focused on the battle

  as the ingagi poured past beneath her
the great brute by the pool gave a sudden
roar helene turned her head her glance
darting to see how many of the newcom-
ers were closing in on him and as she
looked all hope died within her

  the scarred male was pointing one
huge arm directly at her as he had
turned to confront the line of apes the
naked girl had come directly in his line
of vision and to helenes horror she
saw that instead of attacking him every
one of the newcomers was whirling to
search for her

  its now or never thought helene
and grasping her clothes in her teeth she
started scrambling up the tree trunk
reaching for the higher branches before
she made her break for the forest

  but even as she moved the scarred
brute was roaring again a vast clamor
broke from the throats of the apes as he
	jungle

spoke and they began to rush about in
apparent confusion helene had barely
reached the middle branches though
when she learned there was a deadly
method in their wild scrambling

  the ingagi fanned out in all directions
some leaping into the trees some run-
ning through the brush while others
gathered around the trunk beneath her
she knew then that her hope of their
fighting the scarred ape had been vain
from the first they actually were fol-
lowing his orders to surround her block-
ing off every avenue of escape

  the great brute had summoned them
to the pool that had been the purpose
of his thunderous calls that had been
the reason for his rapt listening

  helene suddenly had no place to go ex-
cept to climb higher apes stood guard
in the branches of every tree around her
another loose circle of the creatures
ringed her perch on the ground she
cursed the moment when she had selected
practically the only tree around the pool
which stood so nearly by itself that it
could be easily blockaded

  conquering her first feeling of panic
she realized the apes were making no at-
tempt to move in on her none were
even climbing the tree she was in they
merely held the positions they had taken
in the first scramble warily watching her

  like a treed animal she stopped climb-
ing her head constantly moving as she
tried to keep all her tormentors in view
the barking and growling of the ingagi
died away and in the silence she could
hear her own quick labored breathing it
gave her a strange awful feeling to have
those black glittering eyes staring at her-
from every side

  she backed against the trunk raised a
hand to take from her mouth the clothing
which she had been gripping with her
teeth she held the halter and shorts for
a time and then suddenly looking at them
seemed surprised to find them in her
hand it was as though for the first time
she was conscious she was unclothed me-
chanically helene donned the two brief
garments keeping her attention fixed on
the silent brutes

  she bit her lower lip looked at the
ground far below that was the better
way down there their fangs and brutal

stories

tearing paws would never close on her
alive she resolved she only needed to
step off the branch and it would be all
over

  oh ki-gor ki-gor she murmured
and her voice broke

  abruptly her jaw hardened and she
blinked back the tears which threatened
to start in her wide eyes she waited
then almost calmly poised for the death-
fall she planned

  a full minute and then another passed
before she heard the expected flurry of
movement the burst of snarls from the
beasts that was the signal she awaited
she took a quick shallow breath and
looked down

ix

not until the next afternoon fol-
lowing lt arnsdales departure did
ki-gor get back to the masai camp two
things delayed him the first was the long
period required to brew the strong poison
he needed the second ngeesos insist-
ence on returning with the white lord

  tembu george is no more than a help-
less child ngeeso had scoffed it is
well to have a man such as myself along
in case of trouble

  ki-gor had smothered a smile behind
his hand a rather large child though
he said

  wah ngeeso sniffed and from his
expression no one could have guessed of
his great affection for tembu george
and what good is size the more blub-
ber and belly for the mind to push around
the less chance it has to work on import-
ant things

  so ngeeso came along blithely dis-
regarding the fact that his company made
ki-gors trip many hours longer when
alone the white lord could travel the
tree paths but with the small black he
had to keep to the winding difficult
ground routes

  as they trotted into the camp tembu
george rose mock dismay clouding his
face i see you o ki-gor he boomed
in the standard native welcome but
what is that strange creature trailing at
your heels it is too small and ugly to
be a monkey

ngeeso drew to a stop before the mas-
the golden claws of raa	

sive masai chieftain his glance running
disdainfully over the big warrior he
spat in the dust at tembu georges feet

  always the same he observed to ki-
gor find a smell-ridden place piled
high with gnawed bones and you can be
sure it is either a jackals den or a masai
camp

  he appeared for the first time to no-
tice tembu george

  the white lord begged me to leave
my duties he carelessly confided be-
cause he needed at least one warrior along
on the trek he squinted at tembu
georges grinning warriors after see-
ing these great-bellied beasts i can un-
derstand his concern ho the masai
women are indeed long-suffering to put
up with such sluggish cattle for hus-
bands

  tembu george grimaced in pain threw
out his hands appealingly to ki-gor

  o ki-gor my people bear not even
the sun a greater love than they hold for
you the big man said knowing this
why must you inflict such cruel punish-
ment on us test our friendship by tying
us naked across anthills chain us and let
hawks tear at our bellies but please dont
make us endure this demented rooster

  ki-gor who was occupied in looking
about the camp for helene chuckled and
shook his head helplessly at the masai
warriors he had witnessed a thousand
variations of this act except in battle
when they fought side by side like twin
demons ngeeso and tembu george
spent most of their time fanning the
flames of their mock feud

  watch your tongue great elephant
the pygmy snapped his hand darting to
the gleaming blade dangling from a thong
at his waist seek not protection in my
rule of not slaying inferiors for a grain
of sand id spill your insides out on the
earth before you

  with your clumsy handling of a
blade taunted tembu george its more
likely youd impale yourself and cry for
me to save you he waved a hand com-
mandingly at his men put all food and
belongings under constant guard until our
unwelcome visitor is gone

  with a wild sputtering ngeeso
whirled his long knife free poised it for
instant use

  no pleading will save you now he
screeched arm yourself by all the
gods now i teach you your last lesson

  tembu george calmly thoughtfully re-
garded the prancing leaping little man
he raised his eyebrows at one of his war-
riors

  moka he said bring me a stick-
only a small stick it would be unfair to
use anything else against his unskilled
blade

  ki-gor cut ngeesos tirade short by
stepping between the two men

  since tembu george is to die he
laughed let me first ask what has be-
come of my mate

  tembu george was abruptly serious
he pointed to the sky

  the sun was there when she left for
a walk he said indicating an interval of
about two hours she has been restless
ever since you left but this is the longest
she has been away she promised not to
go far

  his frown revealed all too clearly
though that he had begun to worry about
her

  ill take a few men and hunt for her
tembu george said casually actually
he had been organizing such a search
when the white lord arrived

  ki-gor stroked his chin considering
helene was like a child when she went
out alone wandering from one bright new
object to another losing all idea of time
she often roamed much further afield
	jungle

than she planned but she knew the
jungles dangers and was never really
careless

  shes probably all right he told tem-
bu george instead of everybody go-
ing out and embarrassing her ill just
hunt her up by myself you know how
she is about being fussed over

  tembu george reluctantly agreed that
ki-gors idea was best he pointed out
the path helene had taken her spoor
was as simple for one man to follow as a
dozen and since she was merely strolling
the fleet-footed jungle lord could easily
overtake her

  ki-gor took a drink of water picked
his spear out of the pile of masai weapons
and started down the path before he
had gone a hundred yards he heard the
pad of bare feet behind him when he
looked back ngeeso grinned pleasantly
at him

  he grunted as though he disapproved
actually he was pleased by the pygmys
unsolicited company  ki-gor set a fast
pace but despite ngeesos short legs he
hung effortlessly at the white mans heels
like all pygmies he was a swift-moving
ghost in the thick bush the two men
had trekked together so much that they
seldow had need for words working a
trail with the smooth efficiency of two
hunting dogs

  they had trekked for an hour when
they passed the sun-swept glen where
helene paused to admire the thick patch
of maheena blossoms a short way fur-
ther on they startled a vanka lizard stalk-
ing flies which buzzed over some crushed
berries she had dropped then the path
widened began to follow the bank of a
rambling water-lily choked stream

  to give ki-gors eyes a rest from
straining after helenes spoor ngeeso
wordlessly took the lead the white
lord fell back without objection the
pygmy was an expert tracker and by tak-
ing turns neither would grow weary

the trail made an abrupt bend
following a turn of the stream with
his attention centered on the ground
ngeeso didnt see the leopard crouched
in the fork of a tree not ten yards ahead
when he came around the curve

  but ki-gor running just behind the

stories

pygmy caught the strong warm leopard
scent the moment he turned it was in
such situations that his close kinship with
the wild became strikingly apparent his
nostrils were keen as any animals and
where ngeeso for all his- jungle cun-
ning suspected nothing that odor was
like a jangling alarm to the white lord

  his eyes sudden slits of light flashed
over the trail even as the word leopard
formed in his mind he saw the tawny
blur of movement against the brown bark
of the tree

  the yellow-eyed killer had crouched
above the trail for more than an hour
while the hunger cramps in its belly grew
more severe

  now as ngeeso reached five strides
past the bend the deadly jungle assassin
gave a single slithering movement to
gather its strength then like molten
metal flung from a catapult it shot in a
rippling mass at the pygmy

  ki-gor caught the cats swift nervous
gathering of muscles devil-cat he
screamed in warning and he was bound-
ing forward his righ arm whipping in a
blur of motion as he cast his spear

  ngeeso was without means to fend off
the- unexpected attack he hadnt brought
his spear choosing to rely on blowgun
and darts for protection and there was
no time for him to free his blowgun
fumble a dart from the pouch at his waist
fit it to his lips and puff

  at ki-gors cry the pygmy looked up
his face blank with surprise as he saw
the leopard lunging down upon him
shock held him immobile for a moment
and then too late he tried to leap back

  that leap was never begun more than
two hundred pounds of solid bone and
muscle slammed into him from the side
the white lord had cast his spear and
then dropping his left shoulder crashed
against ngeeso with every bit of driving
power he could summon

  not realizing what had happened the
pygmy chieftain was hammered off his
feet flung whirling through the air to
land ten feet out into the stream ki-gor
kept his balance as he hit utilized the re-
coil from the collision to hurl himself to
the furtherest inner edge of the path

  his spear rammed into the leopards
chest just as ki-gor struck ngeeso the
the golden claws of raa



cat screamed with pain lashing wildly
with its claws it was jolted off-balance
but such was the angle of its leap that
the weight of its body alone would have
carried the animal to the spot at which
it had aimed

  but thanks to ki-gors lightning quick
action the lashing cat struck bare ground
neither man was within its reach
ngeeso landing in the water and the
white lord bringing up at the edge of
the path

  the leopard reared screaming and
coughing blood spinning away from the
man in the stream it came at the white
lord luring the beast away from his
small friend ki-gor leaped into the bush
bulled his way for a few steps into the
mass of vines and bush then made an
abrupt right turn and shoved straight
ahead another six steps

  a violent threshing broke out behind
him the leopard trying to charge after
him with four feet of spear protruding
from its body had become enmeshed the
shaft had tangled in the undergrowth as
ki-gor hoped and every movement the
cat made helped tear out its life

  ki-gor watched the cat grow weaker
suddenly seeing his chance he dove at it
knife in hand the swift churn of his
blade ended the killers struggles with-
out pausing to wipe the knife clean the
jungle man leaped over the beast and ran
back to the trail

  ngeeso stood waist deep in the ex-
panse of water lilies dazedly shaking his
head and wiping wet hands over his face
the unexpected impact of ki-gors driv-
ing body had saved the pygmys life but
it had nearly knocked him senseless

  are you hurt asked ki-gor in con-
cern

  ngeeso groaned tried to focus his
eyes on the white lord

  what happened muttered the black

  i hit you explained ki-gor there
wasnt anything else to do you didnt
have a chance to escape the leopard

  ngeeso stiffened mention of the cat
cleared the fog from his brain

  it-its gone he asked

  dead answered the jungle man

  ngeeso relaxed rubbed his bruised
side he squinted at ki-gor grumbled
wah i believe the cat got the best of

it at least he died quickly ill prob-
ably linger on for many suns

  stop fooling smilingly ordered ki-
gor are any bones broken

  the pygmy grunted miserably after
all he said whats a crushed chest
and no man needs more than one arm
only next time just leave me to the
leopard

  ki-gor knew then ngeeso wasnt hurt
if he had suffered anything more than
bruises he wouldnt be taking on so

  you little fake laughed the white
lord youll get no sympathy from me-
youre not harmed yet but keep standing
in those water lilies and snakes or croco-
diles will change that

  bah ngeeso scoffed impossible
have not three wizards foretold that
ngeeso need fear only beer and
women 

  but all the same he began trying to
pull his feet from the mud he wriggled
and strained and slowly a queer look came
over his face he looked down at him-
self the water had advanced half-way
up his chest

  ki-gor he cried in alarm the
mud swallows me

  with surprise the white lord realized
that in the brief time they had talked that
the pygmy had sunk deeper he wasnt
upset for there was plenty of time to pull
ngeeso free he glanced around for
something to hold out to the little man
the only thing he saw was the blowgun
which had been knocked from ngeesos
belt in the collision the gun proved too
short though when he tried it

 by all the gods exploded the pygmy
dont just stand there do something
dont get excited ki-gor said ill
get my spear and have you out of there
in no time

  he crossed the path and started into
	jungle

the underbrush a low chilling snarl
froze him in his tracks two leopards
one of them coal black the other spotted
stared at him over the body of the ani-
mal he had killed

the spotted beasts hind-
quarters were bunched the muscles
of its long body drawn tight as steel
cables one forepaw lifted for the spring
the other cat stood behind it utterly mo-
tionless its yellow eyes burning into ki-
gor

  the white lords mind raced like the
flickering leap of lightning he had a
fighting chance to cope with one leopard
but against the fearful speed and
strength of two of the killers he had no
hope there was no time for him to
reach the bow slung on his back the
faintest movement would bring them
catapulting at him

  had they not been standing almost on
top of him he could have used his old
trick of escaping into the trees but with
the cat a mere six yards away they could
rip him apart before he hardly swung his
feet off the ground he was as much
cornered as if he had been backed against
the wall

  the knife in his hand still wet with
the blood of the other leopard seemed
puny and useless

  terror would have exploded in the
minds of most men made them try to
turn and run and death would have
brought them down from behind but
ki-gor was the jungles own and like
any beast at bay he kepthis face to the
enemy meaning to fight to his last breath
since there was no hope of escape

  even as the rumbling growls lashed
from the leopards throats his own lips
sheared apart in a snarl of hate then
swift as a darting gleam of sunlight the
spotted cat flashed at him as though
triggered by the movement of its fellow
the black leopard sprang a fraction later

  instead of going to pieces in what he
accepted as the last black moment of his
life ki-gors whole being galvanized in
a final supreme effort never before had
he achieved such sure and terrible speed

  exactly as the spotted cat left the
ground the white lord flung back
crouching the sun sparked red from his

stories

lifted blade he moved back just far
enough to ruin the cats leap

  already off the earth the leopard
couldnt lengthen its spring yet the man
was so close the hurtling cat instinctive-
ly strained out with- its forepaws in the
hope of reaching him but ki-gor had
planned the dangerous maneuver well
the leopard had to touch the ground be-
fore reaching him

  the raking claws missed him by inches
and then there was the merest fraction
of time in which the jungle killer had to
jerk its forelegs to the earth before rear-
ing for the death-blow that fleeting in-
terval was ki-gors one and only oppor-
tunity to strike before he could ever find
another opening the black leopard would
also be on him

  too fast for the eye to follow he was
against the spotted beast his knife out-
raced the reaching fangs hammered into
the animals neck his legs flashed over
the leopards back locked tight about its
belly he was gripping the creatures
neck then with his left hand hammering
and slashing the blade with his right

  he fought in the wildest frenzy riding
the leaping twisting leopard expecting
any instant to feel the fangs and claws of
the black leopard tear out his back the
berserk screams of the cat were deafen-
ing he could see nothing except a whirl-
ing blur

  once he thought he heard shouts per-
haps some frantic warning from ngeeso
but in that moment of supreme effort
nothing but the leopard actually registered
on his consciousness

  the strength went out of his insane
mount with startling abruptness the
leopard staggered bowing its back its
snarls died as it gave a great bloody
cough then its legs collapsed

  the white lord leaped away as the
killer fell his slitted eyes searching for
the black devil the lunging cat had car-
ried him twenty yards down the path by
the stream he was a fearful figure
crouched there on the trail his arms
thrown wide wrath surging over him like
the play of flame the great blood-
streaked drum of his chest swollen with
writhing muscles

  for the space of seconds ki-gor stood
utterly motionless staring a queer un-
the golden claws of raa



believing look crept over his features his
arms dropped slowly to his sides then
the tense muscles of his body loosening

  it cannot be he said and again he
repeated it

  stunned he tore his eyes away looked
at ngeeso in the stream for confirma-
tion

  it is true ngeeso said i saw it
happen and the pygmy was so com-
pletely confounded himself that momen-
tarily he had forgotten his own danger

  the black leopard lay dead on the path
its skull crushed to a bloody pulp and
standing wide-legged over the cat was a
strikingly beautiful white woman clad in a
crudely-fashioned halter and breechclout
made of money-skin she had long blonde
hair reaching to her waist and in her
hand she held a long knobbed club from
which fresh blood dripped

  it was raa

x

it was the woman taken by the in-
gagi the strange woman ki-gor had
believed dead these many weeks and
no wound or scar marred her honey-col-
ored skin

  she stood there utterly poised her grey
eyes brilliant with excitement as she sur-
veyed the jungle mans bronzed figure
ah she declared in an odd ow voice

ki-gor-not-hurt one could

feel her searching for each word framing
her mouth to pronounce it

  the white lord blinked not only
had the girl come back from the dead but
now she could speak before he could
gather his wits she had turned and dis-
appeared into the underbrush

  ki-gor darted forward thinking she
meant to disappear as mysteriously as she
had come raa wait he cried but
when he got to where he could see her
he found she was only drawing his spear
from the leopard he had killed in the bush

  she walked out on the path with the
spear handed it to him with the merest
hint of a smile she pointed to ngeeso

  by all the gods exclaimed ki-gor
i had forgotten ngeeso in my sur-
prise

  he reached the spear shaft out to the
pygmy and then bracing himself tugged

the little man free of the quicksand drew
him up on the bank ngeeso was beside
himself with excitement but not because
of his rescue

  she killed that devil-cat like a tame
goat he babbled i was watching you
as the spotted one struck

  ngeeso stabbed a finger at the blonde
girl

  the next thing i knew a black leopard
burst out of the bush with her astride it
she killed it with two blows

  the woman watched ngeeso curious-
ly what-talk-that she asked

not ing-less

  thats pygmy said ki-gor hurried-
ly but tell me whered you come from
how is it youre alive and unhurt  then
he caught himself but first let me thank
you for saving my life you took a ter-
rible risk to do it for a woman--

well- never heard of such courage

  she leaned down pulled a handful of
grass wiped her knobbed club clean

 raa-pay-back she said de-
liberately she concentrated a moment

 y ou-save-raa--once

  what a queer thing to say thought ki-
gor

  why you owed me nothing he ob-
jected im the one to be grateful

she smiled waved away his thanks
but please ki-gor pleaded tell me
how in the world you escaped the apes
how youve managed to keep alive since
then i just cant believe it

  then slowly with many hesitations as
she groped for words she explained
	jungle

apes not try kill raa make go long
walk to where live all time watch and
hit raa if not like no can go away
bad all time bad

  you mean they kept you prisoner
ki-gor exclaimed in amazement

  there were legends of such things
among the blacks of course but ki-gor
had been around the great apes all of his
life and had never found the least sub-
stance to such stories

  she nodded gravely long time raa
watch and wait be very good then get
time to run away raa come here
ki-gor puzzled over her words then
suddenly another thought struck him

  how does it come you can talk now
he questioned when you didnt seem to
understand a word in camp

  her red lips curved in a pleased smile
other man teach raa she said
what other man demanded ki-gor
quickly

  su-laa-kur she answered with dif-
ficulty

  ki-gors face hardened sam slaker
he cried then they kept that dango
alive too his mind raced where is
he did he escape with you

  she told him no that she had fled
alone slaker was still in the hands of the
apes the jungle man relaxed

  i should leave him there muttered
ki-gor half to himself then he frowned
but tell me about you who are you
what are you and the long stored up
questions about the strange girl poured
from ki-gors lips

  she regarded him hesitantly

  not time talk now she said you
come your woman need

 what he cried who do you
mean

  haa-lane she pronounced with dif-
ficulty apes have her

  ki-gors face went pale his barrage
of questions fell with such violence that
the blonde blinked dumbly confused by
the rain of words

  realizing finally what was happening
he got hold of himself

raa explained that helene had strayed
into the apes feeding area and that
they had surprised and captured her she
didnt think helene had been badly hurt

stories

but she wasnt sure because raa had
taken advantage of the excitement while
the apes were cornering helene to make
her escape raa said she had followed
the same path along which helene had
come knowing that ki-gor must be near

  raa came you she said so can save
woman her expression was deeply
serious raa know way raa show you
in night can save

  a small measure of relief came to ki-
gor

  with raas help he could at least free
helene within a few hours

  ngeeso who had understood enough
of their talk not to need an explanation
in his language immediately offered i
go swiftly to get the masai

  raa looked from the pygmy to ki-gor
what small one say

  when ki-gor explained she shook her
head pointed toward the late afternoon
sun she declared there would be no need
for additional men if they started im-
mediately at dark the prisoners were
put in a cave and one gorilla left to guard
them while the other apes wandered off
to their favorite sleeping spots to nap
until moonrise

  she said she could lead ki-gor and
ngeeso directly to the cave they could
surprise the ape easily finish him with
their weapons

  but if they waited to get the masai
she explained they wouldnt reach the
cave until after the moon rose she
pointed out that when the moon was full
as it would be tonight the whole tribe
would be out in force she added that
they could wait until the next night if
ki-gor wished though it was always pos-
sible for the tribe to suddenly shift to an-
other area

  but neither ki-gor nor ngeeso could
bear the thought of leaving helene in the
beasts hands throughout the night let
alone through the following day they im-
mediately decided to forget the masai
and handle the rescue together

  good approved raa no dan-ger
she assured

  she patted ki-gors spear and smiled
faintly kill easy

  then she turned and set off at a trot
along the path in single file the two
grim-faced men followed her
the golden

helene had expected the end to
come suddenly the unnatural im-
mobility the eerie silence of the great
apes couldnt continue long she was cer-
tain therefore that the outburst of noise
from the apes on the ground signaled the
beginning of their rush to kill her

  like a taut-drawn bow her lithe
curved body poised for the dive that
would smash her life out on the hard
earth far below better to meet death
that way than at the hands of the beasts
her glance stabbed down picked the path
she would follow then swept to judge the
progress of the climbing apes

  to helenes amazement not a single
bull was moving up the trunk the rush
of the beasts had been past the tree to-
ward the edge of the jungle

  and there surrounded by the leaping
bellowing creatures stood raa and sam
slaker they were flanked by a guard of
six burly apes who kept their milling fel-
lows at a distance from their expres-
sions they were almost as surprised to see
helene as she was them

  then over slakers thin ugly face slid
a cruel smile he half-turned to the blonde
girl his lips seeming to move quickly
but in the uproar no sound of his words
reached helene

  helene was utterly bewildered she
long since had accepted the two as dead
and yet here they were somehow yet
alive prisoners of the ingagi the iron
slavers neckband was still locked about
slakers neck a length of broken chain
dangling from it helene remembered
how to kidnap him a gorilla had broken
that chain with his bare hands tearing
away in the process the head of the bantu
to whom slaker had been fastened

  at a roar from their scarred leader
the ingagi again fell silent

  slakers taunting voice broke the quiet
well my dear so we meet again how
very very delightful

  the blonde girl gave slaker an angry
glare then she looked up at helene
beckoned with her hand come she
said not hurt she pointed at the
apes repeated not hurt

  the girl was telling her to climb down
that the ingagi wouldnt kill her

  what will they do with me helene
asked uneasily

claws of raa	

  nothing gruffly answered slaker if
you dont give them any trouble they
just herd us ground like a couple of pet
goats and thats all there is to it

  but-but i dont understand helene
declared bewildered

  slaker spat disinterestedly

  who does  he growled if you
want to live come on down and join the
happy family otherwise dive on off and
break your fool neck im sure i dont
care one way or the other

  the blonde beckoned again frowning as
though she couldnt understand helenes
hesitation

  it would be foolish thought helene
not to give herself up when she could
see that both slaker and raa were un-
harmed the idea of being completely at
the beasts mercy frightened her but she
consoled herself that she wouldnt be a
captive long ki-gor would find and free
her she might escape within a few hours

  she started slowly down the tree low-
ering herself from branch to branch as
though struck with abrupt misgivings she
halted once looked searchingly at raa
the blonde smiled and nodded encourage-
ment and after a moment helene con-
tinued to the ground

  she waited uncertainly at the base of
the tree apprehensively watching the
hairy giants they had formed a ragged
circle about the trunk while she de-
scended the scarred leader knuckled for-
ward glowering seeing his fearful face
at such close range her heart almost
stopped
	jungle

  he snuffled her scent pawed curiously
at her halter first and then at her red
hair then his huge fingers clamped over
her shoulder held her so tightly she
winced

  as he caught her he turned his head
barked gutturally at raa to helenes
shock the blonde girl responded with a
swift flow of the same harsh guttural
sounds raa was talking to the brute in
his own sub-human language of snarls and
grunts for a full three minutes they
talked oblivious of either helene or slak-
er

  but slaker registered impatience rather
than surprise at raas actions whats
he saying he finally demanded of raa

  bantus coming she answered mog
say these white men she held up one
finger and these black men she held
up eight fingers guns she added
meaningfully

  oh dont worry about a few soldiers
said slaker scoffingly do what ive told
you and theyll never have a chance to use
those guns

  she considered his words her eyes mov-
ing thoughtfully over the mass of apes

  we go she agreed she pointed to
helene tie she ordered

  thats right slaker said give her
half a chance and shed go skipping
through the trees ill tie her hands with
a long vine and you tell one of these
monkeys to hold onto to it all the time

  helene looked from one to the other
in consternation

  what-what is this she asked halt-
ingly

slaker laughed uglily walked away
to get a vine without answering
helene noticed that a gorilla trailed be-
hind slaker every step he took raa stared
at her impassively gone was the appar-
ent friendliness the blonde had displayed
to lure helene down from the tree

  not until after the slaver had tied her
wrists did he speak its quite simple
my dear he said yesterday your hus-
band turned over his bantu prisoners to
a white officer and eight troops in a short
while though he doesnt know it yet this
white officer will turn the bantus over to
me-uh-or rather to my friends here
we mean to waylay him on the trail you

stories

see we plan to gather quite a few slaves
and of course my bantus will come in
very handy in such work

  helene heard what he said but the
whole matter was too fantastic for her
mind to accept surely this must be some
nightmare that she would laugh about
when she awakened

  slaker savored her expression why
i believe youre almost as stupid as your
husband my dear cant you understand
that our blonde friend rules these apes
shes one of them they reared her
but that cant be true protested
helene youre both their prisoners i
saw them capture you with her chin
she gestured at the chain slaker wore
you wouldnt be wearing that if you
were free

  slakers eyes grew mean but he at-
tempted to mask his anger with a false
unpleasant smile he seemed acutely con-
scious that raa was watching him

  i am merely raas faithful servant
her teacher and advisor he declared i
am her friend

  raa grunted disdainfully he slave
like you she said the least smile curled
the corner of her lips he slave like try
make raa

  and then the whole incredible picture
came clear to helene raa was the ruler
of the ape tribe that explained the
ingagi attack on the camp they came
to rescue her and she had turned the
tables on slaker by making him her pris-
oner

  helenes face lighted triumphantly
shes making you serve her she cried
to slaker so the great sam slaker has
become the mousy servant of a bunch of
apes helene actually laughed aloud

  the slaver shook with anger knotting
his fists as though to strike helene but
at a word from raa the ape guarding
him reached out and grasped the chain
dangling from his neck tugged it just
firmly enough to remind him not to cause
trouble

  youll laugh a different tune before
im through with you snarled slaker
maybe i did make a mistake in captur-
ing raa i didnt know who she was but
shes learning who her good friend is i
taught her to talk now im going to
teach her to let slaves make life easy for
the golden claws of raa	

her yeah im going to teach her a lot
of things and then well see who does tthe
laughing

  he was breathing hard i promise it
wont be ki-gor

  helene disregarded the slaver turned
her attention to the blonde

  this man is bad raa she said you
know that you mustnt do what he says
raa wasnt impressed he bring back
man-talk to raa that good she spoke
gutturally to an ape standing away from
the mass the brute came forward and
helene saw he was carrying a knobbed
club raa took it he make raa club
she said that good

  he did those things just so he could
use you helene told her hes trying
now to get you to kill men and you know
thats bad

  slater cursed helene and began to talk
rapidly in his defense

  raa waved him to silence men kill
my people she said gesturing to the
apes now we able kill men men catch
my people now we catch men

  helene was shocked

  men are your people not these apes
she said you must have memories of
your parents because you just said that
slaker had brought back to your mind the
man-talk youd forgotten you cant kill
your own kind

  raa stared impassively at helene
these my people she said belligerantly
they fight for raa now raa fight for
them make weak coward men serve
them

  the strained tense look vanished from
slakers face he could be sure of the
blonde girl helenes words hadnt touched
her raa was as much a wild animal as
any of her apes as dangerous and devoid
of feeling-and as simple if one knew
how to handle her

  you mustnt listen to slaker pleaded
helene you know you cant trust him
look at what he tried to do to you hell
bring ruin and death to you and the apes
raa strong said the blonde balanc-
ing the club significantly he slave raa
do bad he die in her naive self-con-
fidence she was contemptuous of slakers
ability to harm her

  helene bit her lip distressed because
-she couldnt break through the girls child-

  ish ego how could she make her see the
truth 

  i dont mean hell beat your head in
with a club or choke you to death she
tried to explain hell talk you into de-
stroying yourself like killing these sol-
diers if you do that men will hate you
as they do slaker and theyll hunt you
down and kill your whole tribe you
cant win against their numbers and their
weapons

  raas smile was amused superior tak-
ing his cue from the blonde slaker
laughed not meaning to overlook this op-
portunity to flatter raa and torture
helene

  you underestimate us my dear he
said tauntingly weve worked it out
very carefully and by dropping so nice-
ly into our hands youve saved us the
trouble of kidnapping you

  he dry-washed his hands his close-set
eyes gloating

  before anyone suspects a thing he
continued ki-gor tembu george
ngeeso and a few other trouble-makers
will walk oh-so-innocently into a trap for
which you are the bait and raa who
your stupid husband and his friends will
never suspect of being an enemy will be
the one to tell them the pitiful story of
how you are held prisoner by savage apes
she will lead them into our hands

  he triumphantly threw up his hands
highly pleased with his own cunning in
devising such an excellent plan

  and once we hold the jungles key
leaders he gloated we hold a whip-
hand on the blacks well move swift and
fast after that ah its amazing what a
really clever person can do if he sets his
mind to a thing and my dear friend
	jungle

ki-gor what a pleasant surprise this
will be to him

fear touched a cold finger to helenes
heart raa she cried surely you
wouldnt harm the man who saved you
from this mad dango ki-gor helped
you yet here you are plotting against
him

  raas people save her snapped the
blonde not need or want ki-gors help
one man all same another all weak cow-
ard bad she grunted in disgust spun
on her heel and walked off we go she
said

  the ingagi hurriedly cleared a path for
her then fell into file behind except for
the scarred ape he shoved up to the head
of the line pushed ahead of her she
patted his hurly shoulder affectionately as
he took the lead

  two hours later a horror-stricken
helene after being gagged by slaker was
forced to watch helplessly while the goril-
las swarmed out of ambush to overwhelm
lt arnsdale and his eight native troops
it happened with such suddenness that
the troops had no chance to defend them-
selves

  great hairy forms swinging on vine
ropes smashed down from trees on the
blacks other apes charged out of thick
brush on either side of the trail five
somali literally were torn apart in the
first rush the other three were wounded
and knocked senseless after firing a few
wild shots

  lt arnsdale the young officer who had
never fired a shot in anger proved in
those few tumultous moments of battle
that as ngeeso had predicted he had the
makings of a real fighting man

  he was the novice yet his gun was the
first to speak he triggered three shots
into the brute swinging down on him the
animal roared with pain turned loose of
the vine to soon and missed its leap an
ape sprang on a somali within a yard of
the lieutenant fastened his fangs in the
mans throat arnsdale shoved his pistol
against the back of the apes skull fired
twice

  the white officer spun his face paper-
white but his gun steady the thought of
flight seemed not to occur to him though
he must have believed death was certain

stories

he blasted his last shot into one of three
beasts charging in on him

  helene shuddered and turned away as
she saw him go down but to her sur-
prise a minute later the scarred ape still
surley with battle brought the white man
up and threw him on the ground before
raa arnsdale was unconscious but be-
fore the attack raa had given orders not
to slay him white hostages she was
learning were far more valuable than
natives

  the bantus hysterical with fear tried
to stampede when the attack started the
charging apes bowled them over almost as
they did the somali roughly collaring
them by the time slaker appeared to
quiet the bantus two of them were dead
and several unconscious

  as soon as the battle was over slaker
began picking up the soldiers guns at a
word from raa mog went down knocked
them out of his arms then the giant
brute began methodically breaking and
twisting the rifles

  slaker appealed to raa to stop mog
we need them he pleaded guns
mean power we can handle the blacks
with them

  raa wordlessly waited until the scarred
ape had destroyed the final rifle then
she calmly turned her back on slaker
only the slaver and his men knew how
to handle those deadly firesticks and naive
though raa was she wasnt fool enough
to entrust such power to them

  the blonde assessed her losses arns-
dale had killed one gorilla badly wounded
another two others were hurt but not
seriously

  you won fairly easy this time helene
said angrily as her gag was removed
but enjoy yourself while you can be-
cause from now on the days of you and
your apes are numbered next time you
may be one of those to die

  a faint derisive smile curled raas lips
any unspoken doubts the blonde had about
slakers evil plans were swept away by
this first swift triumph

  raa go now get ki-gor she said
you see who die

  and leaving mog to direct the ingagi
trek back to their home area the strange
jungle girl sped away to backtrack helenes
trail slaker had impressed her with the
the golden claws of raa	

 importance of capturing the white lord

 raa set a swift pace too swift to per-
 mit such conversation but though ki-
 gor and ngesso were puzzled about the
 girl they didnt mistrust her after all
 she had slain a leopard to save ki-gor
 and now risking her life to help them free
 helene

   dusk was blotting out the jungle when
 raa halted beside a tiny spring ki-gor
 could sense a growing nervousness in the
 girl

   we are nearly there he asked

   she replied soon

   youre very brave he said to do
 this

   raa not forget you save her from bad
 ones she panted

   she dropped to one knee by the spring
 drank slowly and sparingly when she was
 finished she stood back as though to give
 the two men room

   drink she urged cool good

   the hot thirsty men needed no urging
 ki-gor let ngeeso drink first then as
 the small black scrambled up the white
 lord dropped his spear on the ground
 dropped on all-fours and lowered his face
 to the water

   as ki-gor took his initial swallow he
 heard a thud behind him followed by a
 gasp and the sudden thump of something
 heavy hitting the ground he whirled
 straining to get to his feet sensing some
 sudden danger

   raas club caught him just back of the
  ear as he spun up he lay crumpled on
 his face

   weak stupid fools she gritted how
 easy it had been and these were two the
 whole jungle was supposed to fear

   raa stepped back raised her face to the
 dark sky a weird bestial cry burst from
 her lips twice more in the next ten mi-
 nutes she repeated the cry then out of
 the night her brutish followers came to
 crowd curiously around the unconscious
 men ki-gor and ngesso didnt stir
 when the apes lifted them

   when ki-gor regained his senses he
 was lying on a broad heavy wooden table
 in a dark room moonlight streamed in
 a narrow column through a barred window
 beside him sifted through a score of breaks
 in the roof above

  he blinked dully at the two shadowy
figures standing by him they were
helene and lt arnsdale but for a mo-
ment he couldnt understand why they
should be there together or for that mat-
ter why he was there himself he stirred
weakly tried to raise himself

  helenes hand pressed him back dont
try to get up yet darling she said and
it came to him vaguely that she had been
crying

  then abruptly he remembered he had
had a single fleeting glimpse of the knob-
bed club hurtling at him with raas con-
torted face behind it

  raa he snarled and despite his swirl-
ing senses despite helenes restraining
hand he plunged up she did it but
why she was helping he broke off
ngesso he demanded what about
ngeeso

  from a corner of the room a shaky
voice answered i am alive think you
a woman could succeed where a hundred
men have failed 

  ki-gor gave a relieved grunt raised a
cautious hand to his throbbing head
what trickery is this helene he de-
manded my mind reels so i can make
no sense of it

  but when helene with arnsdales help
had finished the incredible story ki-gors
brain had been shocked into chill clarity

  but the idea of using apes for slave
raids isnt all arnsdale told him we
learned something else

  it was still daylight when they put us
in here explained the lieutenant though
most everything is in ruin we found a lot
of letters and papers in some cabinets and
trunks we wondered why we were put
here why the house looked like the owner
had just gotten up one day and walked
out

  arnsdales voice was trembling with ex-
citement

  we found this was a dr august mont-
gomerys place a kind of experimental
station seems he was carrying on some
complicated study of gorillas his wife
and five year old daughter were with him
the way we figure it raa is that daugh-
ter

  yes broke in helene her name
was roberta some sudden tragedy must
have happened a native raid or an out-
	jungle

break of the gorillas he kept for study-
theres a big row of steel cages outside
anyway everyone except the child must
have been wiped out suddenly

  though a bit unsteady on his legs
ngesso had come up to listen ki-gor
pursed his lips and in the moonlight you
could see his eyes narrow in thought

  it could happen i suppose he said
slowly some of the very young apes
were probably treated like pets left a-
lone the child would turn to them for com-
panionship and there would have been
food enough stored here to keep her alive
until the older apes took her in or she lear-
ned to forage herself

  his musing was interrupted by the prac-
tical-minded ngesso

  one would rather speak of escape
sourly advised instead of how that she-
devil was spawned my knife blowgun
darts all are gone

  helene moved closer to ki-gor

  slaker had your weapons taken she
said angrily and he was the one who
wanted us put in here the door is bolted
the windows barred and there are apes on
guard all around the walls

  though he felt terrible ki-gor prow-
led and probed over the room for an hour
trying to find or think of some way out of
their predicament but his efforts were
useless

  we may as well sleep he said finally

  sleep declared the astounded arns-
dale who could sleep at a time like
this

  were safe until morning at least
said the white lord matter-of-factly
raa was careful to capture not kill us
she may change her mind tomorrow and
if so well need our strength and wits

he stretched out on the table
without a word helene climbed up
beside him nestled her head in the crook
of his arm it seemed to arnsdale that
the white lord fell asleep almost imme-
diately and like a nervous child calmed
by the presence of a parent helene drop-
ped off a short while later

  the lieutenant turned to look for
ngeeso the pygmy was sprawled on
the floor his arms thrown wide snoring
softly arnsdale was both distressed and
disappointed he had expected swift

stories

deeds some miracle of high adventure
from ki-gor yet here the supposed jungle
hero slept away the hours like a dullard
unable to realize they might be his last
ones

  jove he thought ive overesti-
mated them all theyve just given up
like whipped dogs

  ki-gor lounged by the window looking
idly out the window his complete im-
mobility exasperated the lieutenant nei-
ther his face not his manner showed any
sign of worry and from arnsdales view-
point there was certainly little sense or
for that matter coherence in the few re-
marks the white lord did make

  that scarred ape is pretty much the
boss after raa isnt he ki-gor asked
helene

  yes answered helene they all
jump when he growls shes the queen
but hes definitely the prime minister
why

  the jungle man shrugged nothing
i was just thinking how odd it was for
them to follow a female the strongest
bull usually leads the tribe

  helene watched him frowning thought-
fully he kept staring out the window
and after a time she returned to her con-
versation with ngesso it was a full five
minutes later before ki-gor spoke again

  that poison pellet you have hidden on
you ngesso he said idly is it from the
new supply you mixed yesterday

  poison hidden on me indignantly
exclaimed the pygmy you know they
searched me took everything why the
idea

  ki-gor smiled faintly i know a few
things little lion you and everyone
of your cutthroats carry a hidden pellet
for yourselves if the wrong persons cap-
ture you and sometimes for an unsus-
pecting enemys food after youve lulled
him by putting aside your weapons

  ngeeso grunted glared swiftly at hel-
ene and arnsdale

  its new he muttered

  more minutes passed while ki-gor ga-
zed at the green world outside the barred
window then he turned around and
walked over to arnsdale

  could i see that ring you wear he
asked arnsdale

  the lieutenant sighed disgustedly thrust
the golden claws of raa	

his hand out what a time to be looking
at a ring he thought to his surprise in-
stead of bending to see it ki-gor reached
and slipped it from his finger

  its merely a good luck ring my girl
gave me he said testily has little
value other than for sentiment that rat-
faced feighter would have taken it other-
wise

  ki-gor inspected it closely even testing
with his fingernail the tightness of the
four metal prongs which held the stone
setting in the ring

  i can use it ki-gor said after try-
ing it on his little finger

  the lieutenant choked back a caustic
question as to what possible use a worth-
less ring would be after all he con-
sidered what difference did it make the
jungle man was too childish to argue with
if he thought he could bribe one of the
bantus with the ring arnsdale wearily
nodded he could have it

  to his dismay he saw that ki-gor im-
mediately pried the prongs open and took
out the stone before he could protest
the white lord called ngeeso to produce
the poison pellet the poison was thick
like resin and using a splinter of wood
ki-gor carefully covered each of the
prongs with it smeared the remainder on
the mounting when he was finished he
dropped the ring into his empty knife
scabbard

  a disturbance outside interrupted them
the door flung open and a group of apes
led by mog pressed into the room sla-
ker appeared in the doorway behind the
beasts his little rat-like eyes darted to
ki-gor ignoring the others

  im about ready to begin on you
smart boy he grated venomously im
gonna make you wish youd never been
born sam slakers gonna have his inn-
ing now and what an inning itll be
the pale scar of his mouth broke apart
in a wolfish grin

xi

kt-gor gave no sign he knew the
laver was in the room the white
lords whole attention was centered on
mog he walked slowly three paces past
the ape looking him up and down a
thorough-going change had altered the

jungle man transforming his very features

  arnsdale studied him queerly an odd
sensation pricking his skin there was
something suddenly menacing about ki-
gor he seemed to have grown larger and
beneath his bronzed skin the great mus-
cles had come alive swelling into writhing
prominence

  in his slow stiff-legged walk in the
taut set of his body was an animal bel-
ligerance thats it realized arnsdale
ive seen dogs bristle that way when they
were about to fight and he was certain
of his interpretation when ki-gors lips
sheared abruptly back over his white teeth
and a deep rumbling snarl ripped from
his throat

  mog had stood rrfotionless only his
red-rimmed glittering eyes alive as he
watched the white lord parade before
him but though not a muscle on his
giant frame moved so abnormally quiet
was he the stiff short hairs along his
neck rose stiffly one could feel rather
than see an electric tension build up in the
bull

  brutish though he was mog recognized
and did not like the insulting challenge of-
fered by this hairless man-thing he was
mog the feared one never in his life
had he given ground before any animal

  he had mauled every bull in the tribe
into submission he had fought kra
the leopard and won he had broken
tar the lion in his great hands like a
rotten stick when he roared his anger
all jungle creatures fled from his path for
they knew and feared him

  raa had said not to slay this hairless
one but raa did not know of this insult
mog heard how quiet the other bulls had
become they sensed too that this
strange man-thing was challenging mog
alone challenging him as another bull-ape
would do and they waited for their
leader to crush the hairless one as he did
all who dared oppose him

  mogs anger grew building up until
when ki-gor snarled the giant brutes
control snapped he gave a thunderous
roar and shoving fully erect pounded the
vast expanse of his chest with knotted
fists

  no ki-gor screamed helene hes
going to charge

  slaker realizing too late what ki-gor
	jungle

had precipitated cried shrilly you fool
hell tear you to bits and then as the
thought struck him that ki-gor was de-
liberately committing suicide to escape
torture slaker cursed vilely

  neither arnsdale nor ngeeso spoke
the officer because he was too bewildered
ngeeso because guessing ki-gors pur-
pose he was too awed by the jungle mans
nerve to think of his own safety

  but before mog could charge raa burst
through the door and leaped in front of
him she spoke rapidly to the ape patting
and smoothing him and gradually she
edged him out of the door he went with
her but his angry growls told that his
anger was far from being quenched

  as soon as she got mog away raa re-
turned you-do-that she rasp-
ed at slaker apparently believing he had
tried to goad mog into killing the prison-
ers then her lips curled with contempt
she smashed him in the face with her
hand he staggered back cowering before
her

  she gave a guttural command to the
apes and immediately the beasts seized
the prisoners began roughly dragging
them from the house raa stalked ahead
of them leading the way past rotted col-
lapsing buildings to what had been a broad
open field

  in the center of this field were gathered
nearly a hundred ingagi both bulls and
shes raa sat down on a raised mound
of dirt and the prisoners were brought
before her mog came out of the crowd
walking stiff-legged and stood by the
mound his red little eyes glittered at
ki-gor

  suu-laa-kur summoned raa the
slaver who had been sulking in the
background because he feared the girls
wrath hesitantly came forward talk
them she commanded say what raa
do

  the hangdog air dropped from the slav-
er he saw she wasnt angry at him she
meant to go ahead with the plan he so
cunningly had sold her on he wet his
pale lips with his tongue

  raa and i are going to call on the
pygmies he began silkily and do you
know why well were going to make
a nice fair bargain with them were go-
ing to tell them that if they capture two

stories

hundred strong young slaves for us well
give them back their precious ngeeso
ki-gor and tembu george

  his lips slid back over yellowed teeth
in a cruel grin no comment he said
in mock surprise

  ngeeso spat in the dust looked away
disinterestedly

  so youve decided your hairy brothers
arent such wonderful slave-gatherers af-
ter all taunted helene

  it isnt that my dear said slater hate-
fully pygmies are no good as slaves
themselves but they can catch slaves well
save the apes for other jobs things like
going in and finishing off the little devils
when theyve weakened themselves enough
warring on other tribes

  the loud trumpeting of an elephant
sounded from the jungle off to ki-gors
left as the sound ended the sharp clear
crack of breaking branches could be clear-
ly heard an elephant herd was on the
move foraging for tender leaves and
shoots as it moved unhurriedly through
the forest

  the apes stirred restively muttering
among themselves they didnt like the
elephants being so close

slaker turned to raa tell them
its the same herd he said impatient-
ly thats been tramping back and forth
around here for days the elephants mean
them no harm great scot they throw a
fit every time they hear an elephant

  following his instructions raa quieted
the ingagi what slaker said was true
the tuskers never sought trouble it had
to be forced on them

  youre the smart boy ki-gor the
slaver resumed what do you think of
our plan a great man like you should
be worth two hundred slaves by himself

  ki-gor looked at him with distaste

  youre a fool as well as a coward he
he said evenly if you think the pygmies
would believe your promise to free us
and as to tembu george-well-i think
hell have his own ideas on this prisoners
business

  the elephant herd had come consider-
ably nearer as he talked one part of ki-
gors mind followed the beasts gauging
their distance and their number

  tembu george is no brighter than
the golden claws of raa



you sneered slaker were going to
take him with the same trick he ex-
plained that raa had left two apes the
night before at the spring whenever
he gets that far the apes will hurry here
and tell raa shell go into her act and
lead the lambs into a foolproof ambush
of certain death

 that was why so many ingagi were
assembled raa was going to throw the
whole tribe against the masai though ki-
gor gave no outward sign worry gather-
ed in him

  and as to the pygmies theyll do our
bidding all right continued slaker his
face had grown more evil and hate was
a hot madness in his eyes you see were
going to show them two realistic examples
of what will happen to ngeeso tembu
george and you if they dont get the
slaves and quick

  he turned and pointed across the open
field toward three fresh mounds of dirt

  there are three holes dug he ex-
plained were going to put helen and
this baby-faced soldier in two of them
bury them up to the neck and then on
a zebra i taught her to ride raa is going
to give a demonstration of her skill with
a club he glanced around you follow
me 

  he chuckled gleefully that had made
them all sit up and take notice even that
damnable ki-gor their faces were shock-
ed unbelieving

  to make it sporting he gibed shell
ride at a gallop that may make her miss
quite a few times going fast like that
it isnt easy to crush a skull

  he babbled on complimenting himself
on thinking up the fiendish idea ngeeso
would be put in the third hole he explain-
ed to get an idea of what was in store
for him if his people failed to become
slaves

 but when we dump helene and the
soldiers bodies before them declared sla-
ker they wont fail you i think though
you may want to send them a little order
just as a guarantee after youve seen this
work

  does he mean that arnsdale asked
wildly

  yes he meant it helene answered
white-faced but in complete control of

-jungle-kali

herself hes an insane killer and raa
is no more than an animal

  in that moment ki-gor knew the great-
est agony of his life gripped by three
massive brutes he was held helpless as a
child helene was to be brutally slain be-
fore his eyes and he could do nothing to
prevent it he felt his own sanity reeling
as raa barked the order for the three
prisoners to be buried

  the ape-guards lifted the victims start-
ed at a run toward the freshly-dug holes

  get zee-bra the blonde told slaker
and he hurried away toward one of the
tumble-down buildings she strolled over
to supervise the placing of the prisoners

  there was a rend of breaking wood and
a small dead tree at the edge of the field
toppled over a grey bulk appeared in
the opening where the tree had been laz-
ily the elephant ambled onto the field and
with no more than a glance at the apes
turned westward

other huge beasts appeared behind
the first elephant until the whole
herd of twelve three of them young ones
was grazing a leisurely path to the west
along the edge of the field mog snarled
at this intrusion and the apes holding ki-
gor bristled angrily though the uncon-
cerned elephants were fully two hundred
yards distant and moving further away
with every step

  but ki-gor had grown more rigid than
his captors he recognized the vast beast
leading the herd as his own half-wild pet
marmo though the great bull ordinarily
remained near ki-gors camp he had
grown restive in the long absence of his
master and had sought companionship
with his own kind

  a desperate idea exploded in the white
lords mind if only he could attract
marmo he might have a fighting chance
to help helene he shouted with all his
might marmo to me startling the
apes holding him

  the giant bulls trunk hesitated on its
way to pluck a mouthful of grass the tre-
mendous ears shifted ki-gor cried his
name again and the bull slowed turning
his head the apes had no inkling of what
their prisoner was attempting but they
shoved him roughly not liking his actions

  raa spun and stared hard at the jungle
	jungle

man but she didnt suspect his motives
any more than the brutes despite the
treatment given him ki-gor kept crying
to marmo and gradually the elephant
swung about the giant would come for-
ward a few yards then stop as though
puzzled peer about nervously until ki-
gor called again

  the strong ingagi smell smothered ki-
gors scent and the tusker couldnt under-
stand why his masters familiar tones sum-
moned him when he could neither smell
nor see the white lord but by fits and
starts the giant came on until he was
within an easy spear throw of the apes

  the ingagi grew terribly disturbed fe-
males knuckled about locating their young
while the bulls thinking they were threat-
ened by the elephant grew belligerent
one ape released his hold on ki-gor lum-
bered about bellowing

  slaker arrived at a gallop on raas
zebra from a distance he had heard ki-
gors cries seen the huge elephant draw
closer he understood instantly what the
jungle man was about

  cant you see hes calling that blasted
monster he burst out at raa

  her brow creased in surprise to her
an elephant was a creature to be given
wide berth it hadnt occurred to her that
ki-gor could call a beast out of a wild
herd with a swift wrathful command
she told one of ki-gors guards to clap a
paw over the jungle mans mouth

  deeply concerned she appealed to sla-
ker for some way to drive off the tusker
she explained that the apes were growing
so angry they might try to attack the ele-
phant and many would be slain

  slaker pointed to where club-wielding
gorillas guarded his bantus the suspi-
cious raa took no more chances with the
blacks than she did with slaker

  free my men and let them use those
clubs he demanded that devil is just
tame enough not to hurt men yet hes
wild enough not to trust strangers well
get rid of him

  as soon as raa complied with his wish-
es slaker leaped off the zebra rushed his
men between the apes and marmo no
longer hearing ki-gors voice the tusker
had halted and was eyeing the angry mass
of apes in puzzlement

  marmo was confused the men sound-

stores

ed angry and shook weapons at him was
this some kind of trap  had he only
thought he heard ki-gor marmo trump-
eted again but he was only bluffing mar-
mo was too wise to risk wounds from a
white mans fire stick for no better reason
than to display his power

  if ki-gor came to him and commanded
that he scatter the men then he would
trample them into the earth show them
what marmos awful fury would accom-
plish

  with anguish the helpless white lord
guessed what went on in marmos brain
he saw the great beast shift uncertainly
then turn and retreat fifty yards across
the field but as soon as marmo got a
safe distance from the men he stopped
and looked back waiting to see if ki-gor
would call once more

  the ape-guard on his right clasped one
paw about ki-gors upper arm held the
other over his mouth as the ape shifted
his weight so he could better follow what
was going on in the field the white lords
fingers brushed his empty knife-scabbard

  but it isnt empty he remembered

  slowly so the fumbling of his fingers
wouldnt attract attention he drew the
sheath up tilted it until arnsdales good
luck ring slid into his palm

  he maneuvered the ring until he could
grasp it between the thumb and forefinger
then cautiously he pressed the pin-like
prongs of the ring against the ape-guards
hip he held his breath pushed the ring
hard enough to pierce the brutes thick
skin

  the ape flinched instinctively jerked his
paw away from ki-gors mouth to slap at
what he thought was some stinging insect
the instant his mouth was uncovered ki-
gor was shouting to marmo knowing
his voice would halt the elephants retreat

the ape roared with fury
swung its club-like hand up for a
blow that would batter his tricky prisoner
senseless but that blow never landed
the brutes arm faltered in mid-air his
huge lips jerking and twitching he stag-
gered his roar abruptly changed into a
queer agonized croaking

  his chest leaped and heaved like huge
bellows trying to force air through a clog-
ged pipe then his finger slid from ki-
the golden claws of raa	

gors upper right arm and the beast
toppled backwards

  ki-gors other guard stared thunder-
struck at his fellow he barked excitedly
at the sprawled figure he shoved the
jungle man out of his path bent over the
dead animal as his slow mind tried to
probe this mystery

  though the bull retained his grip on the
prisoners left shoulder ki-gors right
hand was free the white lord stabbed
the pronged ring into the guards arm
with a swift movement the ape started
turned his head so quickly that he caught
ki-gors movement

  he glared suspiciously straightened with
slow menace he reached out and pushed
ki-gor angrily in the face he snarled
slapped hard again suddenly an agonized
look contorted his face and seconds later
he was dead

  mar mo had swung about at the white
lords call and there was a more danger-
ous note in his trumpeting this time when
he faced the line of bantus if only ki-
gor could get to him he might yet scatter
the ingagi long enough to save his wife
and friends but what chance did the
jungle man have to reach the elephant

  apes were all about him blocking every
avenue of escape the nearest beast was
the huge mog who had turned in time to
see the second ape-guard fall raa too
momentarily speechless with surprise was
staring at the jungle man in another in-
stant the blonde girls lashing voice would
send the whole tribe leaping in on ki-gor

  for any other man it would have been
the end but with his knowledge of the
wild ki-gor had one last thin thread of
hope a thread so slender that only extreme
desperation could have driven even him to
grasp it it was a strategem for which he
had laid the groundwork when slaker and
mog first came to take him from the room

  ki-gor had deliberately goaded mog
to battle fury in the room he had chal-
lenged the ape leader as another bull would
do he had done it because he realized
that it was mogs brawn that actually
ruled the tribe perhaps mog was one of
the pets raa had grown up with in any
case he was the weapon she used to keep
the ingagi in line

  and if ki-gor could trick mog into
accepting individual battle and could de-

feat him then by ape standards the jungle
man would have won for himself the scar-
red apes place and standing in the tribe
after all it was not a far step from accept-
ing raa as one of their own kind to
accepting the white lord but the main
trick was to make mog and the tribe look
on him as a challenger seeking to supplant
the scarred ape in the tribe rather than a
man fighting for his life

  that plan had been in ki-gors mind
when he left the room that was why he
had prepared the poisoned ring because
without the deadly pygmy poison he could-
nt hope to defeat mog but the way
slaker had guided matters ki-gor never
had an opportunity to put his plan in
action

  now when he had to fight mog or die
under the rush of the whole tribe the ring
already had been used twice and the fur-
ther effectiveness of its poison was doubt-
ful ki-gor knew- how terrible was the
gamble he took but his only other alter-
native was worse

  ki-gor slid the ring on the little finger
of his right hand he swelled his chest
to its fullest expansion battered it with
his open palms and with perfect mimicry
roared the challenge of an angry ape

  he took three quick steps toward mog
stopped to repeat the roaring and chest
beating mog bristled a cavernous rumble
rolling from his throat ki-gor turned
and strode arrogantly back to the two dead
apes he put his foot on one of them
giving the wierd chilling gorilla cry

  mog could not mistake his purpose
the hairless one was boasting that he
had slain the two guards and that he
would slay mog as easily like searing
volcanic flame rage burst up in the scar-
red ape he watched ki-gor make
another short rush toward him snarling
and scowling

  raa was shouting then for the tribe to
swarm at the white lord but she was
too late with a single shattering scream
mog rooted them where they stood twice
had this puny man-thing dared affront
him twice had this two-legged white
grub faced him with an arrogance no other
jungle denizen would have the courage
to assume

  now no power on earth would keep
mog from taking the hairless one in his
	jungle

great arms and crush him to a pulp for-
gotten in the red swirl of his anger were
raa and her vaguely understood scheme
of holding men in bondage forgotten
were the elephant and slaker and the
mysterious ease with which the man-thing
had killed the two guards mog bellowed
his wrath to the tribe signalling his in-
tention of personally destroying this chal-
lenger and then snarling steadily he
edged forward wanting to get close enough
to take ki-gor with a single rush

  but as the hideous giant knuckled for-
ward the white lord suddenly streaked
in smashing his right fist against the scar-
red cheek and spun away mog shook the
ground with his roars he was outraged
that the man should be the first to attack
but he wasnt hurt a score of such
blows landing simultaneously wouldnt
have shaken his muscled bulk

  he raised to his full height his tremen-
dous arms outstretched his beady red-
streaked eyes watched his quary for a mo-
ment then abruptly he charged

  but ki-gor had known how mog would
react and he was ready as the bull thun-
dered down on him he waited until the
last possible second then ducked low
avoided the giant paw that hammered at
him as he slid under the upraised arm
he raked the ring across the brutes belly
and side

  but before the jungle man could get set
again mog had spun and was rushing at
him ki-gor summoned every bit of his
speed tried once more to avoid the club-
bing arms and dive past the beast the
raging gorilla wasnt to be caught by the
same trick twice

  mog whirled with him handling his
immense weight with cat-like quickness
and balance and as he whirled the bull
connected a round house blow with ki-
gors shoulder it was his forearm not
the granite like mass of his paw that
connected

  the white lord was torn from his feet
sent twisting ten feet through the air his
whole leftside paralyzed by the blast of
pain he fell hard rolling to a stop on
his stomach mog thundered toward him
gone utterly berserk

  ki-gor fought to get up knowing death
rushed upon him but for once in his
life his magnificent body couldnt respond

stories

to his commands his nerves and mus-
cles needed time to recover from the
awful power of that blow yet there was
no time

  more by sheer will than strength ki-
gor scrambled his way to his knees he
knew he could never make it there was
no chance to escape the beast and mogs
scream of triumph showed he realized too
his victim couldnt get away

xii

but ki-gor dazed as he was meant
to die trying he gathered his numb
quivering muscles and then abruptly like
a startled frog he threw himself sideways
at the charging apes ankles he barely
flung beneath the reaching paw but he
hit his target squarely

  the gorillas feet shot from under him
his vast bulk going at full tilt suddenly
reversed its whole position with his heels
going high and his head whipping toward
the ground he drove face first into the
earth striking with the force of a falling
tree

  despite the terrible fall mog was on
his feet almost as soon as the white lord
though he was slightly shaken the brutes
greatest annoyance came from the dirt he
had plowed into his eyes and mouth
spitting and roaring he pawed at his eyes
his squat stump-thick legs already braced
for another rush

  the watching apes were silent it was
obvious to them the end was near
though by their standards the battle had
hardly begun they saw the white lord
was plainly unsteady on his legs his lungs
laboring to pump oxygen into a body
shaken by the two collisions mog would
get him on his next lunge

  to their amazement however it was
ki-gor who drove forward first any
expectation they had of seeing him actual-
ly make a fight quickly faded the jungle
man swung a disappointingly ineffectual
over hand-blow at mogs face missing by
fully two feet and then jumped back

  what the ingagi didnt know was that
ki-gor had slid his ring from his finger
darted forward just as mog bellowed
not enough poison was left on the pointed
prongs to harm the bull when ki-gor
hit or scratched him but a glance had
the golden claws of raa

s

told the jungle man that there was still
some of the death-dealing resin caked on
the actual mounting he had taken ad-
vantage of mogs momentary blindness
to cast the entire ring into the beasts
mouth throwing it hard enough to lodge it
in his throat for an instant

  mog choked struggling to dislodge the
ring with a tremendous cough he raked
it from his throat caught it with his tongue
and furiously spat it out then he raged
forward at the jungle man running erect
his long arms extended to net his prey

  ki-gor tried to dodge him weaving and
back-pedaling desperately but like a steel
clamp one great paw slammed closed over
his shoulder with that single hand mog
lifted the white lord and jerked him
against his chest the ape lashed his
other arm about ki-gors back and apply-
ing bone-breaking pressure he bared his
fangs and bent to tear out the jungle mans
throat

  ki-gor squirmed and fought but a-
gainst such brute power he was utterly
helpless he saw the cruel mouth open
wide for the death bite and then as the
hideous head bent for his throat a violent
spasm wrenched mogs face

  ki-gor felt the arms about him jerk
wildly and suddenly the crushing pressure
about him was gone the ape was sagging
against him making odd croaking noises
in his throat the poison had taken effect

  ki-gor braced himself against the beast
began battering with his hands and utter-
ing blood-curdling snarls when the full
weight of the gorilla came against him he
couldnt support it so he caught the hairy
body and made it seem he was throwing
mog

  he went down with the dead ape con-
tinuing his play-acting by mauling and
choking until it should seem that he had
slain mog with his bare hands

  then he sprang away from the still
form hammered his chest and roared a
victory cry he swung slowly about
glancing at the astounded ingagi raa
was staring at him dumb-founded by his
swift and utterly unexpected victory

  ki-gor stalked beligerantly a few paces
back and forth past the body and then
growling he walked directly toward the
massed apes to his well-hidden relief
the wall of hairy bodies split apart before

him he sidled at a snails pace growling
and turning his head as though searching
for some bull who thought like mog to
challenge his might

  then he was past the apes his heart
racing with the strain of the bluff he had
successfully carried out he put his hands
to his mouth and called marmo a mut-
tering broke out among the ingagi behind
him ki-gor paid it no heed he leaped
forward sprinted toward the elephant

  slaker and his bantus lay between the
white lord and marmo but the tusker
recognized his master and trumpeting ex-
citedly he started to meet him the sla-
ver and his men tried furiously to turn
the grey giant but marmo was certain
now of his masters wishes and he plunged
directly at the blacks

armed with no more than clubs the
bantus scattered out of his path
despite slakers profane efforts to hold
them once the elephant got past the
slaver turned his attention to raa shout-
ing for her to send the ingagi at ki-gor
from the front while he and the bantus
attacked from the rear

  judging by what he would have done in
his place slaker thought the white lord
was merely trying to save his own skin
not until marmo swung the jungle man
onto his head and then raced directly to-
ward where the prisoners were buried
did the slaver realize what ki-gor in-
tended

  kill them shrieked the running sla-
ver to raa dont let him reach them
you kill them while the apes get ki-gor

  but raa needed no instructions when
the first shock of seeing a man slay mog
had passed she went insane with rage and
grief she was more intelligent than her
followers and one look at the body had
told her that ki-gor had won by some
evil mans trickery

  she pointed to the white lord on the
elephant told the apes that he would use
the huge beast to slay them all unless they
dragged him from his perch

  and roused by the lash of her fury the
tribe surged out across- the grass to inter-
cept ki-gor raa waited only long enough
to get them started then she grabbed up
her club and leaped astride the zebra

  ki-gor saw her mount the animal knew
	jungle

she meant to gallop down on helene and
the two helpless men batter in their skulls
before he could intercept her but the
zebra was half-wild and frightened by
the noise it bucked throwing raa

  the blonde twisted cat-like and landed
on her feet still holding the halter she
fought the zebra savagely j and finally
mounted it again the fall though had
given ki-gor the time he needed to smash
through the ingagi beat off the beasts
that tried to clamber up the elephant

  raa used her heels to spur the zebra
into a gallop straining to outrun the
white lord she would have beat him
to the prisoners by seconds had she been
a better rider but in her anxiety she
failed to control the zebra properly

  ki-gor rode marmo in at an angle
meaning to block off from helene an
experienced horsewoman would have swer-
ved abruptly cutting behind the running
elephant and reached her objective the
blonde girl turned the other way trying
to outrun and cross in front of marmo

  the white lord simply veered the
huge tusker suddenly smashed into raa
the zebra crashed down with its rider
they both fell directly in marmos path
and the elephants great feet pounded
over them as ki-gor glanced back at
the bloody pulp pounded into the ground
his face tightened but he could feel no
real remorse

  in maneuvering to stop raa ki-gor
had given the pursuing ingagi time to draw
near he had to drive them off long
enough for him to dig out helene and the
two men he headed marmo toward the
apes then slid from the elephants back
marmo was aroused now and ready to do
battle with or without ki-gors direction
so he could rely on the mammoth beast
to scatter the gorillas

  the earth was soft about the taut-faced
prisoners and by clearing their shoulders
ki-gor was able to pull thdlm out of the
holes as he freed arnsdale the last one
ki-gor heard slaker exhorting his bantus
to close in

  the white lord looked for marmo
saw there was no chance to use the ele-
phant either to battle or outrun the bantus
the tusker had the ingagi in headlong
flight across the field and was taking a
bloody toll of the slower bulls in his

stories

battle frenzy marmo was definitely be-
yond recall

  ki-gor had known slaker would come
in from the field to try to stop their escape
but he had counted on having marmos
help even had he ngeeso and arns-
dale been armed they would have been
unable to fight the slavers force the
odds were too great

  there was no choice but to make a run
for the forest they sprinted toward the
path along which raa had brought them
as prisoners the previous day but the
four were worn by their cruel experience
and the bantus steadily moved up behind
them

  if slakers men had had spears they
would have cut them down a hundred
yards from the trees as it was the
blacks and their savage leader were no
more than twenty paces back when ki-
gors little group entered the jungle like
a pack closing in the bantus gave cry

  my-strengths-gone gasped hel-
ene cant-run-more

 you must commanded ki-gor
though in his heart he knew it was useless

ngeeso didnt speak but his face
was grey with effort arnsdale was
beginning to lurch drunkenly every breath
a quick pained sob twice ki-gors
steadying hand had kept the young officer
from falling

  the white lord knew but one way to
buy helene and his friends a little more
time he lagged back careful not to let
them guess his intention he was the
game slaker wanted most by suddenly
turning and charging into the club-wield-
ing blacks he could delay them for a
time-for as long as he lived

  ki-gor gritted his teeth steeled him-
self to turn then a fierce wild clamor
erupted all about him massive ebony
figures yelling like devils burst out of the
underbrush and engulfed the startled ban-
tus with spear and sword tembu
george and his masai charged into the
men they mistakenly had shown mercy to
once before and it was clear the same mis-
take was not to be repeated again

  when he heard the masai war-cry sla-
ker leaped off the path hoping to hide in
the underbrush the sight of the masai
chieftain tembu george racing down on
the golden claws of raa



him was enough to turn slaker send him
fleeing back onto the path

  in his fright the slaver got turned
around so that he burst out of the bush
almost on top of ki-gor instead of return-
ing to his men he screamed in fear when
he saw the white lord lashed out awk-
wardly with his club ki-gor ducked the
clumsy blow plowed his right hand into the
slavers belly

  slaker doubled over and as he did the
white lord locked his fingers around the
hated mans neck just above the iron slave
collar his fingers bit deep choking off
the shriek which rose in the slavers throat
in another minute the crazed cowardly
killer was dead and ki-gor still holding
him- by the neck lifted his body as he
would a dangos carcass and threw him
off the trail

  when ki-gor looked around the masai
had finished their work and tembu
george was hurrying to him sorrowfully
apologizing for not having reached them
before

  you came in time ki-gor said
putting his hand on the masai chieftains
shoulder had you come earlier youd
have walked into an ambush he ex-
plained about raa and the apes two
bulls were supposed to notify raa of your
approach but you must have slipped past
them because they never did show up

  tembu george smiled thinly

  those two ingagi lie dead by the spr-
ing he declared we saw them watch-
ing us and thanks to ngeesos poison on
our arrows we killed them we meant

to slay every one we saw because after
reading the spoor around the spring we
thought the tree-people had slain both you
and ngeeso

  arnsdale slightly awed by the tall gran-
ite-faced masai edged his way up to the
white lord he waited his face troub-
led until tembu george finished talking

  about that ring ki-gor he began
hesitantly

  ki-gor frowned oh yes he said
that was your good luck ring all i
know for us to do is go back and get it
no no exclaimed arnsdale missing
the twinkle in the jungle mans eyes you
misunderstand me i want to tell you im
sorry for acting rude when you asked to
use it ill probably lose my commission
for failing so miserably to carry out my
orders but because of you ive lived
through a whole exciting lifetime today
i believe it will be worth the disgrace
kindliness was in ki-gors smile as he
looked down at arnsdales serious face

  you wont lose any commission i
promise you he said youve acquitted
yourself with honor and i mean to go to
the coast with you to tell your commanding
officer that very fact actually youll
have an impressive report to make
jove said arnsdale as he watched
ki-gor walk away what an amazing
fellow

  there was a low merry laugh beside
him helene had heard the words he had
unconsciously spoken aloud

  youre right she said he really is an
amazing fellow im quite proud of him

 witchs moon

by wilton hazzard

   in the green mists of miasmic kaokoveld two haughty warriors fought
   for the glittering treasure in lotumbes tomb nkoi the leopard and
   losako the whip-which would yield to the power of the witchs moon

gordon quinton rode into dom
luis in the late afternoon native
laborers ovambos for the most
part were streaming through the town
on their way to the mines in damaraland
and namqualand on the way out the poor
devils usually lost their pay for a year all
of five pounds much of the money
jingled across the counters of the sharp-
eyed orientals whose shops lined the red
dusty road and some of it never got that
far

  quinton was thinking of this as he rode
toward ikes place his job was to organ-
ize and manage gangs of native labor and
he was good at it he was loved by the
ovambos as much as he was hated and


feared by the cutthroat gang that made
ikes place a veritable den of thieves

  the hum of voices and snatches of a
bawdy song came to quintons ears as he
drew rein before the latticed door of the
saloon his lips tightened it sounded as if
the gang were already drinking his boys
money pie rode around to the bar at the
back of the hotel

  jambo membe he greeted the black
stable boy rub her down good and look
after these he swung out of the saddle
from his saddle horn he took a coiled
whip of giraffe hide with a carved ivory
handle and a wrist loop

  ah-h-h breathed membe with his
wide eyes fixed on the whip he remem-



jungle stories

bered the last time losako the whip
had come to dom luis

  when quinton walked into the saloon
a tense silence came over the room then
there was a rustle of movement as the
men lining the bar turned to face him
their eyes drawn to the whip coiled in his
hand

  at one of the tables close to a window
sat a stranger he was well built an
elderly man with grey hair that con-
trasted nicely with the brown of his skin
his topee resting on the table and white
suit stood out among the battered felt
hats and dirty shirts like a mink coat in
an east side pawn shop

  go on with your drinking boys said
quinton the man im looking for isnt
here yet on an impulse he walked over
to the strangers table and sat down shift-
ing his chair so that he faced the doorway

  are you the law or some kind of a
disease asked the other

  quinton smiled weve got all the dis-
eases known to science but damn little
law mister

  im john raymer an american
well im glad to meet a countryman
said quinton at least i was born there
folks brought me here when i was an in-
fant always wanted to go back but some-
how    he finished with an expressive
shrug

  i know how it is raymer chuckled
a man sweats for years in the jungle
building up a stake he makes it and de-
cides to go home gets as far as cape
town maybe and finds a lot of attractive
fluffy things the kind he dreamed of in
the bush-amazin how the money goes
youre no stranger quinton laughed
he liked the others deep voice-the faint
southern drawl in it and the twinkle in
his steady blue eyes

  im a stranger to these parts ex-
plained raymer but ive worked in the
camaroons-construction engineer and
i had a missionary brother-

  excuse me quinton interrupted
here comes my man he arose trans-
ferring the coiled lash of his whip to his
left hand

a huge man with a face like a baboon
came stomping in his open shirt
showed a mass of ginger hair and a thick

bulls neck growing out of bunched shoul-
der muscles he brought his ponderous
bulk to an abrupt stop as he caught sight
of quinton

  maddon you stuck up six of my boys
and took thirty pounds from them they
worked hard for their money maddon i
want it quinton accused sharply

  the big fellow stood hesitant and fing-
ered his thick protuding lips then some-
thing in his eyes hardened

  ive eard about you an yer bloody
whip his voice boomed if ytry usin
it on me ycocky blaggard ill  

  the lash of the whip uncoiled as if it
were alive there was a crack as loud as
a pistol shot maddon screamed and blood
oozed from between the fingers of the
hand he held to his left cheek his eyes
bulged he let loose a string of vile oaths
while his right hand clawed at the holster
under his coat

  crack the gun was wrenched from his
hand as soon as it was clear of its holster
and like a resilent spring the lash seemed
to coil itself back into quintons hand
freeing his hand of the loop quinton
tucked the whip into his belt

  i want the money thats all he said
calmly hand it over maddon

  maddon was sweating and breathing
hard working up his nerve suddenly he
aimed a vicious kick at quintons groin

  take that you-ah-h-a he finished
with a yelp of agony

  quinton had side-stepped in a flash
and had caught the others hob-nailed
boot in his hand a quick twist and mad-
don was sprawling on his face when he
got up he went limping around the circle
his face twisted with pain

  aw come horf hit bull cock biles
voice suddenly piped up bash im he
pleaded ycan do hit e aint arf yer
size

  as maddon walked around quinton
circled with him his grey eyes wary then
he half-stumbled over an out-thrust foot
maddon rushed him quinton went down
with his knees doubled up and he drove
both his feet into maddons stomach mad-
don rolled over gasping for breath as
quinton got to his feet the report of a
gun thundered in his ears followed by the
tinkle of shattered glass

  cock biles was staring foolishly at
witchs moon



raymer the neck of a broken bottle still
clutched in his up-raised hand raymer
sat at the table without rising but there
was a smoking gun in his hand

  nice shooting  thanks quinton
grinned at him and went to stand over
maddon who was seated on the floor
holding his stomach with both hands quin-
ton uncoiled his whip

  i dont like to use this maddon he
said but i want that money and-
before he could finish portuguese po-
licemen were swarming into the saloon
flourishing their long bayonetes

  who bang ze gun demanded their
sergeant looking around the room nerv-
ously it is not permitted to bang ze
gun who

  raymer stood up i did

  ha arrest him ordered the ser-
geant

  sargento quinto caught his arm
one moment please

  the sergeant tore himself loose with a
squeal of fright seize him he yelled
at his troop

  quinton and raymer were soon hemmed
in by a ring of steel the two men ex-
changed glances

  it was the gun quinton explained
theyll stand for anything but shooting

the squad of policemen marched
them out and down the dusty road
toward the barracoon as the portuguese
called the barbed-wire compound and col-
lection of lousy huts on the outskirts of
the town

  how long will they keep us raymer
said after the police had escorted them
into a stinking mud-walled cell which
boasted only one bench and a pile of
mouldy straw on the floor

  quinton fished in his pocket pulled out
a few pound notes and thumbed them with
a wry smile

 how much money have you got
quinton asked it might cost us twenty-
five pounds to get out before morning it
depends on the state of his excellencys
pocket book

  raymer chuckled well do all right
said he were stayin at the mendos
bungalow ill bet my daughter is work-
ing on em right now it wont be the first
time shes bailed the old man out

  quintons feet hit the floor your
what he exclaimed

  my daughter weve been stayin with
mendos for about a week now

  well im damned you shouldnt have
brought a girl here

    didnt want to

  shes the boss eh

  well-wait till you meet her
quinton rubbed the back of his neck
thoughtfully usually we dont ask ques-
tions in this town but im wondering what
brought you here

  ever hear of lotumbes tomb

  oh good lord dont tell me youre
after lotumbes treasure why there isnt
a man in this country who hasnt wasted
a couple of years of his life on account
of that yarn

  its not a fairy tale said raymer
gravely lets check your version with
mine as i have it lotumbe was chief of
the ovambos in paul krugers day he
collected a sort of tax from all the ovam-
bos who went to work in the mines be-
fore a young ovambo could return to his
kraal and settle down he had to give
lotumbe something-a diamond maybe
gold dust or a kruger sovereign in the
course of years the old boy collected a
sizeable fortune and when he died it
was buried with him where only a
eouple of witch doctors knew

  check said quinton with a broad
grin i dont question the yarn its
known that lotumbe did collect that tax
but listen his tomb is somewhere in the
kaokovelds that means youd have to
comb a mountain range and about ten
thousand square miles of jungle for it
and another thing the chief in that coun-
try is a particular friend of mine bo-
gembwe is his name went to the coast and
got himself an education well he wants
lotumbes gold to finance an irrigation
project but he hasnt found it yet dyou
really think youve got a better chance
than he has

  i know i have son as i was goin
to say before you started the fight back
there ive got a missionary brother he
worked in the kaokovelds for ten years
he converted a witch doctor now that
witch doctor knew where latombe was
buried

  sure but its one witch doctor youll


jungle stories

have to worry about thats nkoi the
leopard hes a ju-ju scares the hell out
of the other natives

   sure i know replied raymer calmly
nkoi is the witch doctor brother joe
converted

  converted quintons face flushed
with anger what are you trying to sell
me raymer

  well son i understand youve just
finished a job i like your style an you
know the country nw my proposition is
a half share for bogembwe the remainder
well split between us providin the chief
is willin-i dont aim to start trouble
if we dont find the gold ill pay wages
how about it

  before quinton could answer the chain
on the outside of their door was rattling
the door swung open

   umble apology senhoreta the
turnkeys voice came to them dis plaze
make great steenk

  a girl with a mass of red-gold hair
stood framed in the doorway she was
tall and the jodhpurs she wore empha-
sized the slenderness of her build she had
her fathers eyes but at the moment there
were sparks of anger in them and her
compressed lips spoiled the softness of her
mouth her gaze passed over quinton and
flashed at raymer

  father how could you after what
you promised

   mdear said raymer i didnt have
more than an eyeful quinton will vouch
for me

  she looked at quinton in a way that
made him feel like something crawling on
the floor doubtless i imagine mr
quinton is not particular-

  cut that jean raymer interposed
sharply

uinton was amused to see the
change that came over the girls face
her eyes moistened and her lips pouted a
tricky wench he judged who would have
her way by fair means or foul

   i have been so worried she said with
a faint smile senhor mendos has been
kind enough to arrange for your release
and yours she added turning to quin-
ton and since you started the fight i
think that it is only right you pay for the
damage done

  how much did you give him asked

quinton with dismay in his voice

   one hundred pounds

  good lord quinton gasped a
hundred quid for a broken bottle

a broken bottle she echoed staring
thats right jean drawled raymer
fellow was going to hit quinton on the
head with it i shot it out of his hand i
guess were stuck for the hundred my

 igirl

  oh why did you she cried why
didnt you-

   let the fellow smash it on my head
miss raymer suggested quinton with a
grin

   well it would have been cheaper and
i dont think it could have hurt you much
mr quinton

   the two men walked out into the bril-
liant star-light a guard gave them a
sleepy boa noite senhores as they
passed through the gates of the com-
pound thirst urged them down the de-
serted road in the direction of ikes place
the road zig-zagged along the bank of a
vlei and followed down into a cluster of
mopani trees among which the dying ban-
ana fronds showed splashes of red

   as they entered the inky blackness of
the grove an owl hooted the drumming
of the bromvoels drowned the sound of
their footsteps after they had covered a
short distance an owl hooted again so
close and so suddenly that quinton leaped
backward dragging raymer with him
suddenly black figures dropped from the
trees rustling as they passed through the
leafy branches in a moment the grove
seemed alive with shadowy figures

  quintons whip cracked as a naked
form leaped toward them a yelp of pain
rang through the grove again and again
the lash whistled and cracked beating back
their half-seen assailants

   run for it i quinton yelled at ray-
mer keep to the trail

   he led the way opening a path through
an amorphous blur that clawed at him he
left his coat behind him and plunged on
through raymer came next whooping
and lashing out with his hands and feet
to right and left in a moment they were
clear and racing for the open road they
gained it and when they looked back along
the trail there was no sign of pursuit
witchs moon



raymer sat down on tke road bank pant-
ing

  not as good as i used to be he
gasped

  hope im as good at fifty quinton
grinned then he said with a frown you
must have told somebody else what youre
after

  not me son even jean doesnt
know but somebody sure meant to take
us apart and ill bet that ape maddon
knows who

  quinton shook his head if he wants
me that bad he can take a shot at me from
behind a rock any time no sir somebody
wants you and believe me if any of the
gang at ikes place have got wind of what
you told me youll have trouble plenty
of trouble

  ikes place-well im still thirsty
drawled raymer getting to his feet lets
go

  the saloon was crowded and murky with
tobacco smoke and the stench of paraffine
oil that came from the blackened lamp
fat slovenly ike found them a table
in a corner

  maddon and cock biles treked out
he announced when he came back with
four bottles of cool beer

  after the first bottle raymer said
what about biles and maddon

  quinton shrugged dont know much
about maddon hes a new man here but
cock biles is an old-timer i dont know
what he does for a living he comes and
goes and hes always got money a lot
of people would like to know where he
gets it including senhor mendos but no-
body has caught up with him yet now
about that hundred pounds mr raymer
ive only got a months pay coming to
me-

  glad to hear it youll have to work
for me

  well im bound to say that i think
youre wasting good money but if youre
set on it ill take you into the kaokovelds
iand you can talk it over with chief
bogembwe

  good when can we start

  tomorrow at sunset if you want to

  i want to

  good ill ride over to the ovambo
village right now should be back with the
boys about noon

  they went outside quinton led his
horse around to the front

  by the way he said as he mounted
youre not thinking of taking jean with
s

  raymer shook his head she doesnt
know it yet but were going to leave her
at indaba on the british side ive writ-
ten to the district commissioner about it
she can argue with him

  hm-m said quinton for a stranger
you know your way around

  brothers friend joe built up quite
a reputation for himself

uinton was back before noon but
he had no boys with him the first
time the ovambos had refused to work
for him if his best friend had robbed him
of his last dollar he would not have felt
it more keenly

  raymer came out to meet him as he
dismounted before the mendos bungalow

  are you sure you didnt mention the
kaokoveld to anyone quinton asked

  dammit no raymer swore im old
enough to know when to keep my mouth
shut

  well im damned if i can understand
why my ovambos turned me down
maybe maddon and biles have got
something to do with it

  quinton shook his head they couldnt
turn the ovambos against me no i know
the symptoms my boys are scared theres
something wrong and i dont like it ray-
mer

  youre under no obligation to me you
dont owe me a plugged dime

  thats a matter of opinion quinton
grinned i want you to make it known
that were headed for indaba youre
working for a cape town mining syn-
dicate understand 

  sure i got the idea

  good well detour south of indaba
slip into the kaokoveld by the back door
ill get porters ill have to use any of
the riff-raff i can pick up in the native
quarters but get some sleep well trek at
sundown

  two days later quinton was riding be-
side jean raymer their road was the
dry bed of a river with high banks cov-
ered with tall burned grass on either
hand behind them the safari straggled


jungle stories

out in a broken line the porters picking
their way over the boulders and loose
gravel away to the north-east the kaoko-
velds brooded over a stretch of green
jungle their peaks wrapped in a mysteri
ous veil of mist indaba was about a days
march south-east

  the girl had quintons whip in her
hand examining the finely carved handle
losako the whip said she what a
name how did you get it

  the ovambos gave it to me quin-
ton replied with a slight frown

  i suppose its because you punished
them with this she returned the whip to
quinton

  quinton flushed why did she have to
think the worst of him no quite the
contrary in fact i took it from a boer who
was whaling an ovambo with it and i
gave him some of his own medicine sud-
denly one of the ovambos who were
watching jumped up and pointing at me
shouted losako there you have it and
once they give you a name it sticks

  suddenly quintons horse reared a
shot rang out and before it had echoed
the crackle of small arms sounded all
along the left bank of the river bed quin-
ton sprang clear of his mount as the
stricken beast sank under him he caught
the bridle of the girls plunging horse
and dragging her from the saddle forced
her down behind the quivering belly of his
dying mount

  in a moment the deep channel was a
chaos of screaming blacks and bursts of
musketry the porters had dropped their
loads and were trying to scramble up the
steep right bank they rushed at the bank
clawed their way a few feet upwards and
then slid down again mad with fear
they surged towards a spot where one of
their fellows had found a good foothold
and in a moment a melee swirled around
the spot quinton knew that nothing could
stem the panic

  a pall of smoke drifted along the right
bank grim-faced gun in hand quin-
ton crouched and waited for a head to
show above the tall grass

  raymer came galloping up from the
rear riding low in his saddle quinton
watched his progress with a puzzled
frown slugs were buzzing overhead like
bees but no one had been hit

 get jean on my horse raymer
shouted as he vaulted from the saddle

  a high-pitched twang like that of a
plucked steel string sounded above the
loud reports of the muskets raymers
horse whinnied and rolled over

  that observed quinton was a
mauser and the guy behind it can shoot

  shootin at our horses but not at us
eh  said raymer with quick compre-
hension guess were kind of fenced in
son

  the firing stopped studdenly quinton
pointed to where the grass bent and
swayed as if disturbed by an under cur-
rent

  then he said theyre creeping up
on us

a horn blared on their left the un-
warriors answered it in a thunder-
ous shout as their battle-cry rolled across
the veldt painted shields flared above the
yellow grass and the sun flashed on steel
like a black wave the massed warriors
swept down on them their white plumes
tossing like spindrift whipped up by the
wind

  jean screamed and covered her face
with her hands raymer raised his rifle
but quinton caught his arm

  that wouldnt do us any good right
now he explained coolly

  in silence they watched their porters
herded together a line of warriors ad-
vanced upon them then fanned out into
a circle crouching behind their shields
with out-thrust spears and closed in
slowly

  theyre ovambos muttered quinton
ovambos he repeated incredulously

  youve been keepin bad company
drawled raymer i dont like the look
of your friends

  quinton was pointing to a spot above
the heads of the warriors a white man
was scrambling down the bank

  maddon quinton said

  raymer gave him a quick understand-
ing look youre in real trouble son

  the circle opened and maddon stood
before them his rifle ready

  drop your guns his voice boomed

  quinton obeyed with a shrug raymer
also flung down his rifle

  four ovambos jumped forward they
witchs moon



bound the wrists of both men behind
their backs

  whats on your mind maddon 
quinton asked

  ill show yer maddon took a pace
forward and kicked quintons feet from
under him then he walked over to
quintons horse and came back with the
whip in his hand

  quinton gritted his teeth as the lash
fell across his shouders when the blood
spurted maddons hatred became a frenzy
bestial grunts came from between his
thick slobbering lips soon quintons
shirt was in ribbons his back a mass of
raw flesh

  you beast you coward the girls
voice came to quintons ears you wouldnt
dare face him- she screamed as the
lash struck her

  quinton struggled to his knees mad-
don ill kill you for that he gasped

  aint ad enough yet heh maddon
gloated ill lift your bleedin ide i
will

  he pushed quinton over with his foot
and raised the whip to strike again but
the lash was caught in a strong black
hand and jerked with a force that toppled
maddon over

  another lash and you die said a deep
voice in english

  maddon faced about with an oath but
backed away as the new-comer advanced
upon him

  through eyes glazed with agony quin-
ton saw a tall muscular ovambo come to
a stand in the centre of the ring he wore
the head dress of a chief

  bogembwe-you muttered quinton
why- the circle of faces whirled
around hinx he shook his head and gasped
with the pain that came with movement

  with a cry the girl ran to him and
dropped to her knees beside him she pil-
lowed his head on her lap

  want to say quinton whispered
clinging desperately to consciousness you
have the prettiest legs-ah he fainted

  quinton spent the next few days in a
kind of coma the fever had come to add
to his misery but it was the normal kind
recurrent shakes and temperatures he
lay on his stomach in a litter when they
were on the march and the chant of the
porters and swaying of the hammock be-

came a rhythm of agony vaguely he knew
that his life was in the hands of jean
raymer she was always beside him to
shield his lacerated back from the sun and
to brush off the flies when they made
camp she was there to dress his wounds
and quench his thirst

  years of clean hard living made him
an easy patient once the danger of in-
fection was past the fever left him and
he healed rapidly on fhe fourth day of
their march he declared himself able to go
on foot

  they were half a days march behind the
main column twenty young ovambos
formed their guard from jean quinton
learned that her father and maddon were
with the main column just before start-
ing on the following morning the head
man of the guard came to quinton
losako said he it is bogembwes will
that you go unbound  but it is death for
me if you escape

  i will not disgrace you warrior said
quinton when bogembwe was my
friend he would not have killed a man for
so small a thing

  perhaps he would not do so now lo-
sako nkoi wills it

  nkoi so it is the leopards claws you
fear warrior  how is that is nkoi chief
in the kaokoveld 

  the head mans face froze i have
spoken said he

an hour later they were winding
across the veldt toward a brooding
tangled mass of jungle they followed
the line of least resistance a river bed
which would become a torrent when light-
ning rent the black clouds gathering over
the kaokovelds they passed marshy
pools from which the egrets disturbed by
their approach rose like feathers shaken
from a pillow in the wind the ground
was strewn with hippo dung and the grey
ghostly forms of baboons glided among
the rocks

  quinton and the girl were trudging
along side by side when she suddenly
asked where are they taking us
bogembwes kraal would be a good
guess he replied its in the kaokoveld
foot-hills we should make it by sun-
down tomorrow

  but why what have we done
jungle stories

  quinton answered her with a question
do you know what your father came here
for

  oh its about something uncle joe told
him hes always going off somewhere to
build dams and bridges and leaving me
behind he didnt want to bring me along
this time but i changed his mind
uncle joe-a missionary

  yes she laughed knowing father
that hardly seems possible does it the
funny part is they look so much alike
theres only a year between them and if
uncle joe were to shave his beard you
couldnt tell them apart

  ah exclaimed quinton and stopped
short as understanding came to him some
ovambo had recognized raymer mis-
taken him for his missionary brother per-
haps and the leopard a back-sliding
convert remembering the secret he had
once divulged had pounced upon them
now he could understand why his ovam-
bos had refused to go on safari with him
and why bogembwe had come so far from
his own territory to ambush them but
what connection could there be between
maddon cock biles and nkoi and then
the realization that the knowledge raymer
possessed was likely to cost their lives
struck him with the force of a blow the
leopard would use his claws silence the
tongue

  he glanced up as the head man strode
up to him

  why do you stand here losako
the man asked with a suspicious frown
the woman wished to rest warrior
so soon the head man looked dis-
gusted do not take her to wife losako
he advised she is lazy and could raise
but a sorry crop march losako

  what did he say asked the girl
well he said that id be a lucky man
if i got you for a wife

  oh really she flashed a happy smile
at the dour-faced head man

  iquinton lapsed into gloomy silence and
trudged on

  before noon they entered the shade of
the forest a hot-house shade damp and
sultry streamlets linked the pools in the
river-bed and as they forced their way
deeper into the jungle the linked pools
became a sluggish river fed by the mists
that shrouded the mountains

  then the trail they followed began an
abrupt ascent the noise of the river in-
creased in volume by sunset they were
up on a plateau with miles of parkland
stretching out before them and rolling
up to the foothills like a green tide

  instead of making camp they rested
for only an hour just before night came
they marched into bogembwes kraal called
 otumbe after bogembwes grandfather
the fabled croesus of ovamboland

  the village was more than the usual hap-
hazard collection of bee-hive huts sur-
rounded by a mud wall it was a small
well-built town with cultivated ground on
all sides on one side it was bounded by
the river and on the other by a rocky
krantz and steep cliffs the deep shadows
of their abrupt descent contrasting with
the burned grass of the plateau above
everywhere there were signs of planning
quinton who knew the town well saw in it
the symbol of one mans bitter struggle to
lift himself and his people above the dark
bloody rule of witchcraft

  as they marched down the broad well-
kept road that ran through the centre of
the town their guards broke up into two
squads and separated quinton from the
girl they were led away to separate huts

  food was brought to quinton by a firm-
breasted ovambo girl she giggled and
talked flirted with him scandalously but
would answer no questions anxious as
quinton was to learn what had become of
raymer and madden he did not press for
answers patience was the highest wisdom
in ovamboland and apparent unconcern
the surest way to knowledge

eary after the long trek and still 
sore where the lash had bruised his
ribs quinton lay down on the hide couch
as soon as the girl left him but worry
stayed with him it pursued him through
his dreams in the form of a gigantic
leopard with flaming eyes-through mud
that clung to his feet and through a jungle
of lianas that reached out to check his
flight like so many vibrating tentacles

  quinton awoke with the roll - of the
drums in his ears a shaft of sunlight
stabbed into the blackness of the hut
through its low doorway everywhere
there was the rustle of movement splay
feet padded along the road past his door-
witchs moon



way the drums kept up their incessant
clamor calling the ovambos to the large
open space before their chiefs house
where the ceremonial dances were held
and judgments given

  presently quinton was called out into
the sunlight he walked briskly towards
bogembwes house with two armed ovam-
bos following closely at his heels

  all the villagers men women and chil-
dren were packed into the square a path
opened for quinton as he approached and
he came to stand in a pool of sunlight
hemmed in by black sweating bodies ray-
mer and his daughter stood facing the
chiefs house

  bogembwe sat on a stool under the
sloping eaves of his house backed up by
the elders of the clan his body guard of
young warriors made an imposing array
their white plumes contrasting nicely with
the black sheen of their muscular bodies
their long bladed spears butted to the
ground painted shields resting against
them

  the witch doctors stood apart-a weird
group grotesque a composite of all the
evil that could befall an ovambo their
hideous masks smelled of fresh pigment
attesting to the importance of the occa-
sion their necklets of human bones
rattled when they moved quintons eyes
passed over them and came to rest on the
young chief

  are we no longer friends- bogembwe
quinton asked in english

  you have brought enemies into my
country losako the chief answered in
his own tongue

  quinton pointed to raymer and the
girl what harm can these two do to the
ovambos one man and a woman what
of the other i do not see him here is he
your friend did he not steal from the
ovambos who punished him you saw
with your own eyes how he-

  i see with the eyes of the leopard
the other cut him short

  ha-a-ah the witch doctors chorused
their approval

  quintons eyes widened bogembwe
bending his proud spirit to the will of a
wizard  he couldnt believe it

  does nkoi say that i am your enemy
he asked

-jungle-fall

  he said so losaka but i and the
elders would not believe it we said that
if you brought enemies into our country
you did so without knowing it and we
sent nkois messenger back to the moun-
tain yonder you will do well to leave
lotumbe before he returns losako

  and what will be done with my
friends demanded quinton

  they must die

  quinton looked at raymer and jean
and felt a tumult of sudden fear

  have you gone crazy chief he cried
in anger youre under british rule you
know what will happen if you allow these
two to be killed

  bogembwe rose scowling at him he
pointed to raymer why did he come
here losako i will tell you he came
to steal did we ask him to do this no
but because of it nkoi says kill the
witchmen say kill kill and my young
men sharpen their spears if the english
come there will be fighting i cannot help
it

  quinton turned to face the witch doc-
tors his face twisted into a grimace of
disgust

  ah-a-ah a sharp gasp ran through
the ranks of the warriors and ended in an
angry growl

  but quintons anger had carried him
beyond fear who is this nkoi he de-
manded his voice ringing clearly how is
it that no man has seen his face it is
because he is a cheat and a fool and he
will destroy the ovambos

  bogembwe strode up to him his eyes
flashing with anger

  be quiet you fool then his deep
voice addressed the elders losako is
angry with us because he cannot help his
friends could he be otherwise and be the
losako the ovambos know as a true
friend 

  the elders jabbered among themselves
for a few moments then a white-haired
fellow their spokesman stepped forward

  it could not be otherwise o chief
he announced their decision but let the
truth be shown to losako so that his anger
will be turned from us

  let it be so wise ones bogembwe
affirmed i will talk with him later he
turned to quinton go in peace losako
i give you my hand


jungle stories

as they clasped hands quinton felt
a piece of paper pressed against his
palm he closed his hand upon it ray-
mer and the girl were staring at him
jean gave him a faint smile raymers ex-
pression was enigmatical they couldnt
know he thought that he held their
chances of life in the palm of his hand
perhaps jean thought he was leaving them
to their fate he wanted to talk to them
but bogembwes eyes warned him away

  as soon as quinton reached the se-
clusion of his hut he opened the note
bogembwe had given him all it said was
walk east through the village at moon-
rise

  quinton put a match to the paper and
frowned as he watched it burn at least
it was clear that witchcraft had under-
mined bogembwes authority and he dared
not openly oppose the verdict of his witch
doctor what could he do in secret quin-
ton jumped to his feet and ground the
charred paper under his heel in sudden
impotent anger it was incredible that
seven words could spell out the only hope
he had of saving jean raymer-the girl
he would marry if she would have him
but it was so there was nothing he could
do without bogembwes help-without it
raymer and his daughter would die be-
fore sun-rise nor was it likely that he a
witness would be allowed to live to tell
the tale poison in his food or a bullet
from maddons mauser perhaps

  for a long time quinton sat on the hide
couch revolving plans the mumble of the
drums broke in on his thoughts he went
out the ovambos were leaving the
square from behind the trunk of a tree
he watched raymer and jean led away
hemmed in by young warriors whose
spears flashed above the heads of a pack
of women and children who cursed and
spat upon the condemned pair

  quinton made no attempt to follow
them the less concern he showed the bet-
ter for bogembwes plan-if he had a
plan

  slowly the sun inclined from its zenith
climbing down through an eternity to the
crest of the krantz that brooded over the
town and where in some rocky cavern
nkoi the leopard watched and flexed
his claws

  at moon-rise the ritual drums began to

throb soon the deep bass voices of the
warriors were chanting tonelessly while
the women kept time by clapping their
hands the leaping figures of dancers-
circled the fire that blazed in the centre
of the square coming from his hut quin-
ton glanced up and down the straight road
it was deserted bogembwe had chosen a
good time for their tryst

  quinton sauntered down the road and
reached the eastern outskirts of the town
he was about to retrace his steps when
he heard his name called softly bo-
gembwe was standing in the shadow of a
tree he whispered

  we have two hours perhaps three fol-
low me without a word of explanation
he started to run down a trail that twisted
between the boles of great trees

  about a quarter o-f a mile beyond the
outskirts of the village they came to a
clearing surrounded by a stockade of
sharpened stakes as thick as a mans
thigh and interwoven with thorn lianas

  the man and woman are here an-
nounced bogembwe as they came to a
stand before a narrow gate of thorn bush

  guards asked quinton tensely

  the chief smiled grimly who en-
ters here needs no guard losako the
fence guards him against the lion and the
leopard

  the stakes enclosed a circle of ground
a flat arena a row of saplings stripped
of their lower branches stood in the
centre like slender flag poles two of
them were bent over bow-like with their
tips lashed to stakes driven into the
ground on their knees bound to these
same stakes were the drooping figures of
raymer and his daughter quinton knew
that when the hour of execution came the
sapplings would be lashed to the hair of
the victims and when their necks were
stretched taut a fellow with a machete
would take a swing at it-the spring of the
sapling would finish the job

  with a cry he ran toward them his
knife flashing in his hand while he
slashed the girls bonds bogembwe freed
raymer raymer swayed to his feet but
jean lay very still in quintons arms her
face white in the moonlight her breathing
scarcely audible

  how long have they been here  quin-
ton asked anxiously
witchs moon



  since an hur before noon

  without water

  give her a little bogembwe thrust a
skin bag into his hand

  quinton forced a few drops between
the girls bloodless lips she moaned but
did not open her eyes raymer knelt be-
side quinton forcing back the girls eye-
lids as he said shell be out for an hour
at least

  quinton noticed that raymers hand
shook you all right he asked

  never mind me son just get her out
you can have anything ive got ive been
through hell watching her suffer these
black devils-

  theres one standing beside you ray-
mer quinton interrupted him coldly
were a long way from out yet if we
do get out youll have him to thank for
it

  raymer got to his feet chief he
began offering his hand

  but bogembwe stood with folded arms
and his eyes flashed in the moonlight i
do nothing for you he said bitterly
what i do i do for my own people if
they killed you soldiers would come my
people would not understand it they
would think that the soldiers had come as
you have come to steal and spit upon the
things they honor they would throw
themselves against the soldiers guns and
they would die your brother was a bet-
ter man than you gold-seeker he knew
where the gold of my fathers was hidden
but he would not touch it nor would he
betray the trust black devils had in him he
kept their secret but you-

  anger is before your eyes bogembwe
interposed quinton quietly you cannot
see my friend as he is he would have
taken nothing without your consent it was
agreed between us-

  raymer checked him with a touch on
his arm i had that cornin to me said
he and turned away

  we must go urged bogembwe if
the woman cannot walk carry her he
turned and strode off toward the gate

raymer and quinton lifted the girl be-
tween them and followed in his wake
they skirted the village and came out on
a trail that ran along the bank of the river
after they had gon some distance jean

declared herself able to walk with the help
of her father quinton moved ahead and
fell into step beside bogembwe what
became of the other white man maddon 
bogembwe pointed to the krantz that
loomed out above them he is nkois
friend he went to the lair of the leopard
and that is where we are going losako
because my young men dare not follow us
there

  true quinton agreed they would
catch us before sunrise how many are
up yonder

  bogembwe shrugged who knows as
you know nkoi dwells there with his
servants he shows himself to no man and
he speaks with the mouth of his mes-
sengers he is a shadow the tricks of the
witch doctors i understand and i know
how to deal with them but this nkoi i
do not understand him and i fear him
losako how can a man fight a shadow 
he is more cunning than the others
that is all bogembwe he knows that the
greatest fear is of the thing unseen

  it may be so losako well because of
what i have done this night i am a doomed
man but i am not eager to die if we
are to live we must root out this wizard
true bogembwe quinton approved
with a grim smile we get the wizard or
the wizard gets us

  an hour later they were toiling upward
among the red rocks and dwarf aloes as-
cending the hill by a series of terraces like
a gigantic stairway there were stretches
of narrow-leafed grass and scattered
patches of bush lurking among the huge
sand-stone boulders the spoor of a lion-
ess and two cubs crossed their trail and a
mountain reibok stood out in silhouette on
a pedestal of eroded red rock vast cloud
masses hovered over the crags of the
kaokovelds the bright moon was behind
them and drew an outline of dazzling light
along their black edges a flash of light-
ning illuminated their interior with a fit-
ful transparency the crash of distant
thunder shook the solid hill

  quinton and bogembwe reached the
plateau before raymer and the girl they
stood looking about dwarfed by the huge
boulders and slabs of sand stone which
were fretted into weird shapes by wind
and rain a few hundred yards ahead of
them the sheer face of a cliff loomed and


jungle stories

seemed to present an lftipassable barrier

quinton was thinking of maddon and
his rifle  but bogembwe troubled by less
tangible fears touched his arm and said
it is an evil place to come to at night
a man with a rifle among the rocks
would be more dangerous in daylight bog-
embwe is there a path beyond the cliff 
only the witch doctors know who but
wizards and men doomed as we are would
come to this place

  a white man in search of gold bog-
embwe

  ah but he is nkois friend

  quinton smiled grimly if nkoi can
keep his friendship when once he has seen
the gold even i will believe that nkoi is
a wizard

  raymers voice called to them as he
came up over the rim of the escarpment
jean clambered up beside him white
skin showed through revealing rents in
her shirt and jodhpurs and blood where
the thorns had torn her flesh she was
too exhausted by the climb to talk and
stretched herself out with a groan under
a thorn bush

  this is it said raymer its just as
joe described it

  quinton was chewing on the biltong
bogembwe had produced from his bag
and did not speak but at length he said
bogembwe and i will go on youll have
to stay here with jean

  raymer started to protest but quin-
ton cut him short she cant go on be-
sides your white shirts would show like
a light among the rocks and maddon can
shoot too damn straight 

a few yards beyond their starting
point they left the trail and worked
their way toward the face of the cliff in
swift rushes from rock to rock quinton
cursed as the moon came out from behind
clouds it was a witchs moon-a moon to
make the jackals howl

  soon the black shadow of the cliff
spread over them bogembwe pointed
silently as quinton came to stand beside
him the face of the rock reflected the
flickering light of a fire without ex-
changing a word they crouched and
crawled toward it

they had covered another twenty
yards when the orange flames showed

between gaps in the rocks the outlines of
two figures were seated before the fire
the skin of one showed white and quin-
ton recognized maddons burly torso the
other was a small weazened person wear-
ing a leopard skin the head and claws
hanging loosely from his shoulders

  nkoi breathed bogembwe

  as they watched another figure emerged
from the mouth of the cave and crept to-
ward them his black skin almost invisible
in the shadow of the cliff quinton
watched his approach with a puzzled
frown evidently the fellow was trying
to pass the fire without being seen

  as the black approached the circle of
fire-light he sprang upright and made a
dash for the cover of the rock quinton
saw maddon spring to his feet the black
was within ten yards of them when a spurt
of flame flashed before quintons eyes
the runner coughed turned a somersault
and lay still the jackals stopped their
howling the report of the rifle re-
echoed along the face of the cliff and
was swallowed in the breathless silence of
the night

  maddon was advancing upon them his
rifle held at the ready evidently coming
to see the effect of his shot the wizard
nkoi remained by the fire peering out
into the shadows

  a grim smile came to quintons face as
he watched maddons cautious approach
nkoi and maddons rifle were the things
that worried him most and he saw that
luck was offering him a chance to rid him-
self of both

  they do not know we are here bog-
embwe he whispered tensely the
white man is mine the wizard is yours

  ah-h bogembwe sighed and faded
into the shadows

  quinton crawled forward on his belly
and crouched behind a rock a few feet
from the spot where the black had fallen
the crunching of maddons boots on the
loose gravel stopped quinton heard him
grunt as he bent over his victim then the
crunching started again as he turned away
quinton slid around the rock and sprang
at his back

  the force of his rush knocked mad-
don off his feet he dropped his rifle as
he pitched forward and uttered a hoarse
croak of fear unable to check his mo-
witchs moon



mentum quinton tripped over the others
legs and sprawled on top of him maddon
yelped and writhed in a frenzy of terror
evidently believing himself attacked by
some beast with a roar he struggled to
his feet lifting quinton with him quin-
ton jumped clear

  maddon gasped in relief as he stared
fet quinton i thought you was a
leopard

  it might add up to the same thing
maddon

  you aint got your bleedin whip
mister maddons teeth showed in an
ugly confident grin his hand slid down
to his holster but he was built like an
ox and as slow as one the gun was
kicked from his hand as soon as he got
it clear of the leather and quinton had
hit him twice while he mouthed an oath
swift and sure-footed quinton circled
the others huge bulk avoiding the power-
ful arms that clutched at him and strik-
ing hard blows whenever the other passed
from shadow into moonlight inside of a
few minutes he had the hairy baboon
face mashed into bloody pulp but it was
man versus gorilla maddon was still on
his feet and quinton realized with a thrill
of dismay that maddon was taking all he
could give deliberately wearing him
down waiting for a chance to close and
crush him in a bear-like hug

  suddenly maddon sprang at him quin-
ton struck desperately he felt the others
huge hand clutch his shoulder and twisted
away leaving his coat behind him mad-
don lurched after him the steel of a hunt-
ing knife flashed in his hand instinctively
quinton drew his own knife from its
sheath

for a moment the two men looked at
each other and the light in their eyes
was as cold as the glint of moonlight on
the steel in their hands it was an instinc-
tive pause such as comes when the warm
pulsing heart feel the approach of death

   maddons snarl broke the spell he flung
himself at quinton his knife sweeping up-
ward in a murderous arc aimed at his
stomach quinto felt the blade burn his
flesh as in one swift movement he par-
ried the stroke with his left arm and side-
stepped he drove his knife at the others
body but maddon caught his wrist in his

hand twisting the knife from his grasp
in a last despairing effort quinton crashed
his free fist into maddons face he felt
the shock of the blow up to his shoulder
and it stopped maddon he staggered back
a pace and quinton rushed in striking
with right and left suddenly maddon
doubled up sat down and then rolled over
on his stomach

  dazed and gasping for breath quinton
turned away vaguely wondering what had
happened to bogembwe as he stumbled
in the direction of the fire something
whizzed past his ear he faced about with
a startled cry he heard maddon gasp
and saw him fall back with the shaft of
a spear sticking out of his chest

  bogembwe stepped out of the shadow
losako said he with a reproachful
shake of his head did he knock the wits
out of you in another moment his knife
would have been in your back

  it was stupid but thanks bogembwe
quinton leaned back against a rock breath-
ing deeply what of nkoi he asked

  deep laughter mumbled up from bo-
gembwes stomach  oh-ah the leopard 
come lasako he said still chuckling
come and look upon nkoi

  quinton followed him out into the circle
of fire-light the crumpled painted body
of nkoi lay before the fire his hands were
bound bogembwe ran forward and picked
up the scrawny body by the neck and but-
tocks showing the face to quinton
behold the leopard said he

  cock biles quinton stared with his
mouth open then he asked is he dead
no but i think he all but died of
fright when he saw me losako he
shook the little cockney as a terrier shakes
a rat as he bellowed ho wizard
awake

  blimey gasped biles from between
chattering teeth

  truly observed bogembwe fear is
an evil thing i chief of the ovambos
have feared this thing aie all the
ovambos have feared him and we dared
not disobey the commands his messenger
gave us ho what will the elders say 
what will the witch doctors say when i
show them this

  quinton chuckled you are wise bo-
gembwe show the leopard to them just
as he is and witchcraft will die in the


jungle stories

kaokovelds shame and laughter will kill
it but put him down there may be others
there were others losako

  maddon done it whined biles they
was in the cave-six of em shot em
down like dawgs e did as they tried to
sneak hout wot did i ave against em
they was me palsi tried to stop im i
takes houth on hit guvnor

  disgust twisted the corners of quintons
mouth as he looked down on the snivelling
cockney he was thinking of the mysteri-
ous trips biles had made out of dom
luis always returning with money

small lots for years he said to bogem-
bwe then for some reason he decided
to bring it all out and he brought maddon

quinton finished

  no squealed biles hit wus mad-
don hit wus is hidea so elp me
bogembwe and quinton both faced about
quickly as the crunch of a boot sounded
on the gravel raymers white shirt showed
in the darkness he had maddons rifle
in his hand the girl came into sight a
few paces behind him

  ha said bogembwe here is another
with a nose for gold

  raymer smiled and handed the rifle
to quinton as he said heard a shot and
came over been listenin for the last five
minutes

  quinton waited until the girl came up
to them then stooped and took a burning
brand from the fire well take a look
inside the cave

  up wizard bogembwe heaved biles
to his feet show us the way

  they followed biles and bogembwe
each each with a burning brand in his
hand quinton saw the dead forms of two
of the witch doctors who had fallen to
maddons rifle and steered the girl past
them the stench of tom-cats stung his
nostrils as they filed into the damp black-
ness of the cave quinton thought of lions
and moved up abreast of bogembwe

  the flickering light of the torches re-
vealed soot-blackened walls there were
patches of color which on closer inspec-
tion proved to be crude drawings of ani-
mal life the work of ancient cave-dwel-
lers

   ere hit is biles voice brought them
to a stop he pointed down to a number
of hide bags stacked against the rock
wall

  as they gathered around the hoard
quinton slashed one of the bags with his
knife gold poured out of the slit kruger
sovereigns portuguese milreis and among
them a few rhombic stones that burned
with an inward fire

quinton gave raymer a quizzical look
well this is the end of the trail mr
raymer i waive my share and my wages
white man bogembwes deep voice
addressed raymer if you had not come

i	would have lost it all also because of
witchs moon



your coming my people will be free from
the evil of witchcraft take what you can
carry white man i give it to you
well said raymer i sure came a
long way to get it and i dont figure to go
back empty-handed maybe we can talk
business chief our friend losako told
me that you wanted to do some irrigatin
youll need a dam and a reservoir well
thats my job ill stay and build it
quinton was examining a golden sov-

ereign with an absent smile it reminded
him of jeans hair and he was thinking
that it would take raymer a long time to
build a dam-long enough for the witchery
of african moonlight to work its magic
during the nights that would follow when
he would walk with her down the forest
trails and across the sweet-smelling veldt
he looked up at the girl her lips parted
and she smiled somehow he knew that
she had been thinking of the same thing
the clean sweeper

by edgar wallace

the dark voodoo world of ksalugu-mpobo screamed with
the exultant fiendish tittering of ghouls when sanders of the
river dared challenge the great ochori king

the soldiefs of the old king who
lives beyond the mountains came
down into the ochori country and
took back with them ten women and forty
goats-and this was the year of the sick-
ness when goats were very valuable and
a week later they came again and in yet
another week they repeated the raid

 mr commissioner sanders sent an
urgent message into the old kings country
and journeyed to the ochori to meet the
old mans envoy   

  on a certain day over the northern
hills came buliki chief minister of the
great king ksalugu-mpobo and he came
with great hauteur with four and sixty
spearmen for his escort and each spear-
man wore the leopard skin of the royal
service-that is to say a leopard skin with
three monkey tails signifying the swift-
ness the ferocity and the agility of these
men he boasted that he was the fortieth
of his house who had sat in the royal kraal
and had given the law

  sanders with a more modest escort
waited in the city of the ochori for the
coming of this mission which was two
days late and was even now arriving not
at dawn as had been faithfully promised
but in the heat of the day sanders sat
cross-legged on his canvas chair chewing
an unsmoked cigar and drawing little pat-
terns with his ebony stick on the sand

  behind him tall and straight his bare
brown back rippling with muscles with
every movement was bosambo chief and
king of the ochori folk north and south

  behind the shelter which had been erected
to serve as a palaver house was a section
of houssas brown-faced men in blue
tunics handling their rifles with an easy
familiarity which was very awe-inspiring
to the dense mob of the ochori people who
had come to witness this memorable
meeting



  sanders said no word realizing that this
was not the moment for confidences and
that in all probability bosambo was quite
as wise as he himself on the matter of
the great kings delinquencies for north
of the hills was territory which was as
yet independent and acknowledged no
government and no king beside its own

  whether this was to remain so did not
depend entirely upon the result of the
interview for no man knew better than
sanders that nothing short of four bat-
talions could force the passes of the great
mountains and war was very unpopular
with the british government just about
then

  the royal guard which the king had
sent as escort to his minister wheeled onto
the big square and formed a line facing
sanders and the houssas regarded them
with the peculiar interest which soldiers
have for possible casualties buliki was a
big man broad tall and stout he swag-
gered up to the palaver house without any
evidence that he was impressed by the im-
portance of the man he was to meet

  i see you white man he said in the
bomongo tongue which runs for six hun-
dred miles to the north and the west of
the territories	

  i see you black man replied sanders
what message do you bring from your
master 

  lord said the man insolently my
master has no message for you only this
that whilst he rules his land he knows no
other king than his own beautiful impulse
and has no other law but the law he gives
oh ko said sanders sardonically
he must have a very powerful ju-ju to
talk so boldly and you buliki have surely
the stomach of a lion- for hereabouts i
am the law and men who speak to me in
the tone of a master i hang out of hand
his tone was bleak and cold and his

 copyright   by edgar wallace
blue eyes strayed unconsciously to the high
tree before the palaver place

  buliki who knew nothing of the sacred
character of an embassy went gray under
his tawny skin and shuffled his feet

  lord he pleaded in a different voice
i am a tired man having come this day
across the mountain of the cold white
powder that melts therefore be gentle
to me a poor chief who does not know
the ways of white men

  go back to your master buliki and
speak this way sandi who sits for his
king on the great river desires that no
soldiers may come again from the kings
territory to raid the women and goats of
the ochori for i am a man quick to
kill and no respecter of kings or chiefs

i	have ploughed little kings into the ground
and the crops of my people have flourished
on the bones of princes where is mbala-
gini who brought his spears against me


	jungle

he is dead and his house has rotted with
the rains where is kobolo the ngombi
warrior who took his young men into battle
against me you will search the forest
for his city and his spirit weeps on the
great -mountain little kings are my meat
how mighty are they in the house of their
wives how small are they when i bring
them in irons to my great ship go back
to the old king and say this the chief
or soldier of his who comes this side of
the ghost mountains shall be slaves for
my people and be glad they are alive the
palaver is finished

  after the embassy had departed   

  dam nigger said bosambo who was
blacker than a spade suit but had the ad-
vantage of a christian education silly
ass  

  then in his own language for sanders
did not favor coast english

  lord this old king is very cunning
and there sits in the shadow of his hut a
white man who knows the ways of white
lords

  the devil there is said sanders in
surprise for this was news to him that
joe the trader had gone that way

  up in the old kings country buliki
prostrate and on his face before the wiz-
ened old man told the story of his embassy
and the king listened stroking his thin
frizzly beard

  joe the trader he had no other name
listened too and had parts of the message
translated to him

  tell the old man he said to his in-
terpreter that all that stuff is bunk say
sanders aint got no soldiers moren fifty
tell him that if he sends down to head-
quarters an complains bout these threats
sandersll get it in the neck-not allowed
to do that sort of thing

  joe in his semi-sober moments was an
authority on what may be described as the
unwritten laws of the wild he had
tramped up and down africa from the
zambesi to the lado and he had learned
a lot there wasnt a lock-up from char-
ter to dakka that had not housed him he
had traded arms and gin for ivory in the
days of bula matadi and had drifted now
to the one sanctuary where the right arm
of any law could not reach him

  of all the men in the world he hated
best mr sanders and had good reason for

stories

his antipathy for sanders flogged the
sellers of gin and hanged even white gen-
tlemen who purveyed belgian firearms to
the unsophisticated and bloodthirsty abo-
rigines

  here   joe was excited at the
idea tell him to send for sanders to
a great palaver-somewhere up the ghosts
-youd get him coming up that road  

  this plan was duly translated the old
kings dull eyes lit up and he rubbed his
hands for he had sworn to stretch upon
his new war-drum the skin of the man
who harassed him-and the drums case
had grown warped and cracked in the
years of waiting

  that is good talk said a counsellor
unfavorable to the kings white guest
but it is well known that sandi goes un-
harmed through terrible dangers because
of mshimba-mshamba the fearful spirit
they say that great regiments of devils
march with him shrieking so that where
he has passed the leopards lie dead with
fright

  the old king was impressed and licked
the four fingers of his right hand so that
no evil could touch him

  stuff said joe loudly ghosts-
stuff youll get him good an then these
birds wont come stickin their noses over
the mountains no more  

  the king listened straining his neck
toward the interpreter

   man this shall be he said and buliki
was bidden to rise

new brooms may not always sweep
clean but generally speaking they
raise enough dust to choke some men and
bring tears to the eyes of others macalis-
ter campbell-cairns was the newest broom
that was ever landed from a surf-boat to
agitate the fever-bitten back-blocks and
bring to the surface the murder urge which
lies so close to the skin of the most law-
abiding

  this man was an excellency had on
the lapel of his coat miniature noughts and
crosses that glittered at the end of vari-
gated ribbons wore as his right on such
occasions a radiant paste star over his
pancreas and could put a string of letters
after his name as long as the name itself
he fell from the surf-boat into the arms
of a sergeant of kings houssas fell from
the clean sweeper	

the tawdry little horse carriage which
brought him to government house into
the presence of a second and third secretary
a chief staff officer and the master of
his household and eventually fell into
the thickly padded chair which was his
by right of his high office and almost
immediately the new broom began to move
around the dusty places and there was
issued from administrative headquarters
an order of the day which was to all
intents and purposes an address of wel-
come to sir macalister campbell-cairns
written by sir macalister campbell-cairns
and signed in his indecipherable hand he
had come he said to bring light into
dark places to do justice to white and
black alike to offer an inspiration and a
hope to the most debased to establish
centralization and curb the undesirable
tendencies of officials to usurp the functions
of the law he did not exactly say this
but he meant this and last but not
least he intended making himself ac-
quainted with every frontier post of
civilization for which he was responsible
and if anybody had grievances would they
kindly keep them until he came along

  o my lord gasped thirty-three com-
missioners inspectors officers commanding
troops and the like when this reached them

  attached to the address of welcome was
a very secret and highly confidential
note for the more important of his sub-
ordinates

  it has been brought to the administrators
attention that judgment of death is frequently-
given and executed by subordinate officials
particularly in reserved territories this
practice must cease all inquiries into cases
of murder treason and incitement to rebellion
must be remitted to a h q accompanied by
a report of th evidence in triplicate deposi-
tions in duplicate and a report of the find-
ings of the court

  a month after this order was issued
lieutenant tibbetts whose other name was
bones chased a man who had murdered
hkema the woodman and stolen his wife
caught him on the borders of the old kings
country and hanged him within an hour of
his arrest

  thereupon was hell let loose at ad-
ministrative headquarters and the musi-
cal career of lieutenant tibbets was threat-
ened with extinguishment

a visit to any administrator is a
solemn and unnerving business to
a new administrator such a call is to be
obeyed with trembling knees but when
bones otherwise known as lt tibbetts
received the imperial summons to the head-
quarters of sir macalister campbell he
did not cringe he did not flinch a bit from
what was obviously a severe duty he took
it all with an amazing lightness of heart

  sir campbell had not been in office more
than five minutes before he gave to the
world his system of responsible control
which was roughly as follows every ad-
ministrative unit was to be divided into
as many districts as there were european
officers each officer was to control a
district and be responsible for its well-
being and good conduct the fact that
he did not have his dwelling within three
hundred miles of the country made little
or no difference he might be a subaltern
officer acting as tutor to wild houssa men
who were being moulded into military
shape and learning for the first time that
a rifle was not an instrument designed to
frighten people to death but an arm of
precision which performed certain func-
tions with mathematical exactness that in
fact the bullet and not the bang was
the real cause of all fatalities which fol-
lowed its discharge

  macalister believed in machine-guns
correspondence in triplicate and confidence
in the man on the spot this latter be-
lief originated when he found that he was
the man he hated all foreign wines and
foreign dishes had a passion for scottish
mutton and whiskey and possessed no
faith whatever in the rising generation
when he was a boy things were different
the people who went into the diplomatic
service were gentlemen women were
modest and knew their place children
never spoke until they were spoken to

  he was a tallish broadish man with
shoulders like an ox and a very red face
that had seen a lot of hard wear it ap-
peared to have been originally modelled in
red wax and to have been carelessly left
in the sun

ttis excellency will see you

  a a at once said the third secretary
and looked at his watch you are ten min-
utes late he shook his head
	jungle

  the boat was a day late sir said
bones

  the third secretary shook his head again
took off his white helmet and peered into
its depths with half-closed eyes his lips
moving he seemed to be praying then

  this way mr tibbetts he said and
walked rapidly down a corridor

  bones who had all a military gentle-
mans loathing and contempt for the civil
service followed at a slower pace to ex-
press his independence

  sir macalister was pacing up and down
his large room his hands clasped behind
him all the weight and burden of empire
on his clouded brow he shot a glance at
the newcomer but did not pause in his
exercise

  mr tibbetts your excellency said
the third secretary in the tone of one who
had caught the visitor after a hard chase

  huh said his excellency

  the secretary withdrew reluctantly he
would have liked to hear all that the ad-
ministrator had to say

  so-you-are-mr-tibbetts

   yes sir

  your excellency snapped sir mac-
alister no relation to the late-er-sir
john tibbetts

  yes sir-my father

  oh

  the administrator was at a disadvan-
tage sir john was the greatest official
that had ever come to the coast

  indeed now sir will you tell me
why-will you please tell me why when
you were policing the chimbiri district
you r-ecuted without judge or jury one
talaki you will say that you were in
a perilous position you will say that you
were five hundred miles from the nearest
magistrate you will say that you have
precedents you will say that the other
miscreant escaped because you were under-
staffed he stopped and glared at bones

  no sir said bones politely none
of these cute little ideas occurred to me

  no sir oh indeed sir now sir-
understand sir from this moment sir-
and you may take this back to your com-
missioner sir-no man is to die in the
territories until his death warrant is
signed and sealed sir by me sir-the ad-
ministrator sir  or my authorized deputy
sir tell mr sanders that sir

stories

  bones was not in any degree ruffled

  yes sir he said and when mr
sanders resigns perhaps your excellency
will tell his successor 

  resigns sir macalister grew purple
sanders was a tradition at the foreign
office the last time he resigned a most
important administrator was recalled he
was told when he -reached home that it
was so much easier to find a new adminis-
trator than a substitute for the commis-
sioner of the river territories

  do you think he will resign mr tib-
betts

  certain sir most unprofessional to
send that kind of message by a jolly old
subaltern bones shook his head re-
proachfully and added i might have to
resign too

  the effect of this threat was not appar-
ent bones afterwards said that ruddy
reeled at any rate he resumed his walk-
ing

  ill go down and see him myself he
said it is shockingly unhealthy but i
must go why did you hang this fellow
sir

  because sir said bones he killed
another fellow sir an took his jolly old
lady wife  

  he explained how sir macalister who
was not accustomed to the raw of life
shuddered and stopped him halfway
through his narrative

  dreadful    youd better come to din-
ner and talk it over tibbetts-seven-
thirty sharp dont keep me waiting or
ill have you cashiered and by the way
before i forget it there is i understand
some trouble in the old kings country
ticklish business    wants tact tell
sanders ill come down by the next boat
and ask him to arrange a palaver with the
old man eh no no i shant want
sanders there ill fix the boundary ques-
tion-seven-thirty sharp and if youre a
minute late by    ill-ill have you
hoofed out of the army i will by gad

sanders really did not mind-the
presence of an administrator in his
area worried rather than awed him he
went down to the little concrete quay to
say farewell to his excellency and since
he had thoughtfully added certain com-
forts to the furnishings of the zaire and
the clean sweeper



reinforced the poverty-stricken cellar of
the big white boat sir macalister was al-
most friendly

 sorry to have given you so much
trouble mr sanders he said affably
but im going to make this an annual
visit    previous administrators have been
a bit too slack

  i should be very careful of the old
king sir if i were you said sanders
personally i should not have held the
palaver-the mere fact that he asked for
it so soon after the last little talk i had
with his chief looks very suspicious to
me you quite understand that this palaver
was called by the king and not by me
he anticipated your message by twenty-
four hours

  so much the better mr sanders
beamed his excellency i shall find him
in a conciliatory mood

  the wheel of the zaire began threshing
astern bones in spotless white stood on
the forward deck and saluted stiffly and
magnificently and the zaire backing slowly
to midstream turned her nose to the black
waters and her stern wheel whirling ex-
citedly she passed the bend of the river
out of sight

  sir macalister his sun helmet on the
back of his head paced up and down the
awning-covered forebridge

at the ochori city bosambo awaited
his guests and when he discovered
that sanders had not come his face fell

  lord this is a bad palaver he said
and for bosambo he was serious for
my spies have brought word that two of the
old kings regiments are sitting on the
far side of the mountain and because
of this i have gathered all my spears and
have sent throughout the land for my young
fighting men

  bones pulled at his long nose

  oh ko you tell me bad news he
said dismally for this man is a kings
man and a very high one

  bosambo surveyed the unconscious mac-
alister busy at that moment through his
interpreter in speaking to the head men
gathered to meet him

  to me he looks like a fat cow he
said without offense and this is a won-
der to me that all your high ones are fat
and old

  all that evening bones spent in a vain
endeavor to dissuade the great man from
making the journey they had with them
an escort of twenty houssas and the road
to the mountains led through dense thicket
in which riflemen would be practically
useless

  mr tibbetts said his excellency tre-
mendously a british official never shirks
his duty that sacred word should be
written in gold and placed above his head
so that sleeping or waking he can see it
personally dear old sir murmured
bones i never sleep with my jolly old
eyes open the point is dear old ex-
cellency-

  mr tibbetts you are growing familiar
said macalister haughtily

t daybreak they started ten
houssas and a hundred and fifty
picked spears and came to the foot of the
mountain as the last rays of the sun fell
athwart the low bush-trees

  well rest here a bit and finish the
march tonight-in the cool of evening
said macalister who had been carried the
last twelve miles

  bones wiped his hot and grimy forehead
better wait till the morning sir he
suggested the men are all in

  sir macalister smiled

  keep you fit my boy he said jovially
i know the music to bring em along i
shall have a little practice on my bagpipes
in that great cleft of the ghost moun-
tains which mshimba-mshamba had bitten
in a night of terrible storm a score of
spears awaited in the dark the old king
wrapped in his rug of fur crouched in
the cover of the high cliffs a hot bowl of
glowing wood beneath his robe to give him
warmth squatting at his feet joe the
trader sucked at a short foul pipe

       tell him that when this sanders
goes out he can go down into the ochori
when he dam pleases  

  one of the attendant counsellors had
been lying flat and motionless on the rocky
road his ear pressed to the ground now
he rose

  they come he said and hissed

  the score of spears became a hundred
form after form flitted past the waning
moon reflected from their broad spear-
blades    flitted past and disappeared
	jungle

hereabouts the ground is littered with
boulders and there was cover for three men
behind each

  let no man strike until they are a spear-
length from me coughed the king scindi
you shall bring me alive also the young
man with the silvery eye  

  the counsellor by his side turned un-
easily

  if the terrible spirits come- he be-
gan and joe recognized the words

  stuff he muttered say tell him he
can have my skin if that happens 
spirits come on sanders you beauty

  they heard the tramp of feet caught
fugitive glimpses of a swaying lantern
behind the boulders men grew tense and
gripped their killing spears hotly

  out of the bush that encumbered the
lower slopes of the big hill the lantern
came into uninterrupted view

  kill whispered the king

  but even as he spoke there came from
the advancing column a strange and hor-
rible sound it was the shriek of a wounded
soul-the scream of a man tortured beyond
endurance-a savage and exultant howl
amidst the fiendish titterings of ghouls

   sir campbells pipes

  for a second the king stood erect para-
lyzed his face working and then with

stories

screams of fear the hidden spearsmen be-
gan to run blinded by terror throwing
spear and shield as they fled

  trader joe shouted tell him    only
the bagp 

  joes words ended in a sob and he fell
to his knees striving vainly to draw out
the spear that transfixed him for the
counsellor of the old king had struck as
he ran

yes dear old sir said bones as
they tramped back to ochori city
in the light of day terribly discourte-
ous and all that sort of thing if a johnny
makes an appointment a johnny ought to
keep it

  it was ambush by gad quivered his
excellency bumping up and down as the
palanquin-bearers negotiated a rough bit of
track

  it is no use my dear man telling me
that it wasnt ambush    that horrible
white man with the spear sticking in him
good heavens    awful

  it may have been an ambush dear
old excellency admitted bones but if
it was why did the jolly old sinners run
away 

  bones smiled contentedly at the triumph
of his logic

make plaster of paris face masks of the
ngowa warriors

burack stared youre crazy matt
what the hell do they wanta make
face masks for

  because of the ngowas importance
to history or something interesting mi-
grant background thats the girl shes
the one whos after the masks

  girl buracks eyes opened then nar-
rowed again he sighed the devil with
it shes probably a refuge from a ladies
aid tea-party

  conklins faded eyes twinked son she
is like an untrammeled flower bloomin in
the heather the mans name is jonathan
mcwilliams but hes got a different
racket he hunts snakes

  burack lighted up an abdulla import
and swore its crazy matt wed be
damn fools to go into the bush with crazy
people like that

  these young chillun dont know a
baboon from a baobob but they have many
francs to spend and they want guides
and theyll pay our way right into those
ngowans treasure tombs mcwilliams
wants to catch snakes and that countrys
crawling with ever kind of surpent god
cursed the earth with in fact the kiny-
amwesi are snake worshipers their gods
are all snakes

  burack gulped anything else matt
and by the way how do you know all
this stuff about the mcwilliams

  om habit boasted conklin read the
afrique beige like my grandma read the
bible well son will you take the job
with me and wara

  burack said he would and then won-
dered what he had said

  bravo shouted conklin now-we
gotta move fast i got the inside infor-
mation that that big bushmaster over
there at the end of the bar is going to try
and land that job as guide himself
burack had noticed the big german
pie was as big as a water buffalo and ap-
parantly just as dangerous

  in case you aint never met up with
jobi kersten before your lucks at an
end conklin really sounded worried
hes poison son hes a bloated black
mamba that walks like a man

-jungle-fall

  kersten was staring straight at burack
from a florid bullet headed face sat down
deep in a wide expanse of slabbed shoulder
space he was a giant and he was bad
in sweat-stained ducks and rubber-soled
shoes he started toward buracks table

  watch yourself whispered conklin
that krauts up to no good he a mur-
derin bushwacker

  jawohl mine friends roared kersten
burack gazed in awed fascination at the
rattan chair wondering how it held up so
much flesh i could not help hearing you
talk about der ngowa very unhealthy
talk

  listen jobi conklin said softly get
the hell away from our table whenever

i	want to keep company with a water
buffalo ill send out a formal invite
kerstens face darkened donnerwet-
ter i haf enough of your drunken insults
conklin you vill not safari the mcwill-
iams to the ngowa country der flies vill
be eatink you

  no flies will ever eat you jobi and
live conklin said

  kersten roared something obscene he
heaved conklin into the air burack stif-
fened in the rattan chair every sound in
the ivory hut was chopped dead even
the mombasan band

  so you vould take job away from me
eh conklin i laugh you wont be fit to
guide anybody tomorrow

  conklin squirmed his feet a yard from
the tamped earth floor if you guide em
in there conklin yelled wildly none of
emll come out alive you murderin son
before burack could act kersten slam-
med a wall of fist into conklins face
conklin flew back against the wall drop-
ped groaning burack put his two hund-
red pounds behind a long blow that came
clear up from the floor

  flame spurted up his arm into his eyes
kersten only roared stepped back shak-
ing his shaven head kersten had a heavy
german luger from canvas holster bur-
ack grabbed struck a sweating wrist just
as the black hole bellowed out of a blast of
fire

  burack kicked upward felt the gun fly
out of kerstens hand burack ran to
conklin picked him up and dived for the
door glancing back burack saw a big
black wall between himself and kersten
	jungle

it was wara the masai he was holding
a big curved blade in his hand as broad
as a canoe paddle

  the blade flashed kersten roared fell
back stumbled and his body sprawled out
on the floor he leaped back to his feet
with amazing agility for a big man stood
shaking a bloody head like the maddened
buffalo from which he had gotten his name

  a roar filled the ivory hut every white
in the place was after the black man af-
ter his head a white stream flowed over
booths and tables a belgian policeman
was blocking the door so burack dived
for the open windows leading onto a ver-
andah two native policemen were club-
bing rifles a brilliantly uniformed nco
was firing a luger

  burack yelled run for it wara
the big masai grinned and made for the
opposite side of the room swinging the
big masai sword like a scythe he went
headfirst through a side window like a
stream of obsidian a barrage of shots
followed him

  the doorway was clear and burack
crashed through it into the sticky rain
with conklin still unconscious in his arms
he plunged into a mass of monololo bush-
es and lay there in a puddle of mud

  his pursuers spilled out after him and
the masai yelling and shooting he heard
a policemans wild whistle then the horde
disappeared like yammering savages down
ponthierville avenue toward the black
section

  burack dragged conklin down side-
streets to his hotel room a stinking sump-
hole with a vermin-infested bed he pour-
ed water into a clay pitcher washed conk-
lin off and put him to bed then he got
a service colt out of his one-piece of can-
vas luggage and checked it

  he had the gun gripped in his hand as
he lay down across the insect-proof door
and waited for conklin to come back out
of the dark the rain hissed steadily on
the thatch roof

ii

the old man woke up early
swearing a blue streak before bur-
ack could shake his sleep-starved brain
into action conklin had dragged him into
the early morning steam of stanleyvilles

stories

sweltering heat and was heading at a half
run toward the ponthierville hotel

  conklin was swinging a long elaborate
swizzle stick like a hurrying commission-
er as they went inside the delapidated
building he still swore darkly nursing
his swollen jaw ill make that kraut pay
the dirty son conklin repeated that
mud-crawlers after blood hes up to
dirty business

  the hotel was pushed up beside the
english consulate two hamitic negroes
with brilliant red and blue turbans and
flowing robes served as bored doormen
the mcwilliams had a two-roomed suite
on the first floor conklin paused in the
dim hall long enough to swill deeply from
a bottle of gin before they knocked and
were admitted

  burack did two double-takes then star-
ed at the girl mcwilliams introduced her
as jean in white linen with an open
midriff and brief shorts she was so beau-
tiful that buracks stomach began to ache
she was deeply tanned with a golden color
that softened sinuous curves her hair
was the kind of blonde that so strikingly
goes with bronzed skin but of which most
blondes are only jealous there was some-
thing very businesslike capable and effi-
cient about her in contrast to mcwilliams
who burack finally managed to look at

  mcwilliams was pale attenuated he
wore thick-lensed glasses his face was
thin with an upturned prudish nose and
pale wet hands that motioned lamely as
he talked neither of them belonged with-
in a thousand miles of the congo

  burack breathed a long sigh when she
was introduced as jonathons sister

  im so sorry mr conklin said mc-
williams with precise tones but a cer-
tain jobi kersten has already been engag-
ed to guide us into the jungle ah-it
will be a most interesting trip the
ngowa represent a dying type of classical
facial sculpture descendant of the ha-
mitic solomon migrants but jean will
tell you now my interest of course is

snakes-

  conklins leathery face was twisting
with rage damn the snakes he howled
in mcwilliams shocked face that buf-
faloll lead you to hell afore hes through
buffalo really mcwilliams stutter-
ed were very grateful to this mr jobi
mask of the snake



we expected to get immediate permission
to go into the ngowa area from the pro-
vencial vice-governor or even by the
comite regional but do you know they
flatly refused beastly of them but thank
heaven this jobi chap offered us his ser-
vices last night he has ways of overcom-
ing any-ah-legal difficulties he assures
us

  he has ways all right yelled conk-
lin hes a black murderin renegade
whos wanted for every crime in the
book

  i simply cant believe it said mcwil-
liams frowning can you jean he
added looking at her

  her blue eyes sparkled who knows
he certainly didnt look like a gentleman
burack grinned

  he liked her he winked at her and
she flushed a lovely pink

  youd better believe it conklin was
almost dancing with rage drop that buf-
falo like you would a black mamba hes
workin for one of the colonial powers
thats tryin to edge out the belgians i
know that and hell do anything to get
paid off by the right party he aint tak-
ing you up there just to be polite

  frankly said the girl eyeing burack
carefully i dont trust this jobi very
much

  thats hardly fair jean whined mc-
williams

  burack sneered openly at mcwil-
liams clothing his brand-new heavily-
starched khaki shorts probably bought
within the week at drysdales which boast-
ed being the special outfitter of his royal
highnesses safaris it stuck out like a
babys rompers

  jean these jungle men must of neces-
sity be of a hardy calibre

  yeah howled conklin but hes up
to dirty work and it aint the treasure
either its somebody head im bein
honest with you mr mcwilliams ker-
stens one of the worst characters in the
bush he was a leg man for the deutsche
ost-afrika-linie he was also with the
union miniere du haut katanga mining
gang when they was running in slave la-
bor from the bantu tribe up tanganyiki
way he was in the cage for sabotage
and a thousand other crimes besides hes
no safari man he dont know anything

about the bush now mike here and my-
self we can help you

  im afraid one guide is sufficient said
mcwilliams mr kersten is over at the
huileries du congo beige right now ne-
gotiating for a boat

  burack winked at conklin it took
plenty of francs to rent a boat from that
outfit he looked hopefully at jean wil-
liams

  why not take them along too she
peered sidewise at burack we may need
them if this ngowa territory is as dan-
gerous as a few hints imply that it might
be anyway the foundation can spare
the extra expense

  mcwilliams sighed but he didnt ar-
gue and burack didnt blame him for
that oh all right we plan to leave in
the morning for the upper lualaba mr
kersten is arranging everything he has
a crew chosen equipment being loaded
this afternoon good day

 ah-er- began conklin without

changing color how about a little ad-
vance on our salaries had a little recent
difficulty with a black mahogany project
and-

 mcwilliams shrugged and he made
out a check on the banque beige dafrique
while chatting enthusiastically about
snakes burack shivered he didnt like
snakes jean flashed him a frank smile
and he returned it after that thinking
about her burack was in a trance as
conklin practically ran to the bank they
came out of the bank with the equivalent
of a hundred american dollars in belgian
paper

  they bought some equipment at a sub-
sidiary of the famous konrad schauers
and then his toothless mouth drooling
conklin headed at a run for david marton

	son ltd his purchase three quart
cases of gordons gin straight from
london the whitest purest and best
everything was to be delivered at the
last minute to the boat landing then
they started for the ivory hall for a few
highballs

  not bad is she matt said burack
dreamily

  conklin groaned a femalell jinx a
safari every time

  but without jean burack said we
wouldnt have any safari
	jungle stories

conklin didnt answer for just
then a black arm reached out of a
bush beside the fungus-eaten boardwalk
burack reared back but conklin laughed
at the black beggar crawling in the mud
his dirty rags spotted with flies and ticks
and then a familiar voice whispered from
beneath a dirty burnoose-covered head

  bwana conklin burack tis thy ser-
vant wara of the masai conklin whis-
pered to burack stand like hes a beg-
gar laugh at em theyll string em up
if they catch him

  wara whispered i find out much from
black section where i hide during night
two despised muri have hired out to serve
big buffalo kersten they say no whites
come back from safari say kersten start
big blood wind blowing from tanganyiki
conklin said good job wara now
listen get canoe and start tonight travel
day and night meet our boat at the
mouth of the tega that damn stream call-
ed the blood river that leads from the
lualaba to the kraal of the ngowa fol-
low our boat upstream to ngowas village
remain hidden be ready

  they went to the winehouse

a broken galla groveling with a
tired soul served them gin how
the devil can wara get to the tega river
before we do him just in a canoe asked
burack

  hell be there son conklin grinned
what did wara mean about that blood
wind blowing from tanganyiki

  dunno son if kersten wants to start
a big uprising up there what does he want
to do it for  a native uprising would
end the most peaceful stretch weve had
around here for a long time kerstens
got some reason for wanting blood to run
in the lualaba

  at sunrise they were approaching the
landing where the side-wheeler sagged in
the silt-heavy water of the river scrawny
chickens ran out from under their feet
with drooping wings the sound of a
distant riverboat whistle floated through
the sultry morning steam hanging over
the river

  a bunch of black laborers from the
helot tribes of the dorobo wasanye and
yibars were lazily beginning to load the
last equipment aboard including conklins

three quart cases of imported gin

  conklin took a long swill from the pint
in his pocket and began fiercely exhorting
the natives in blistering swahili the
blacks leaped to life and burack stared
in admiration at conklins power these
blacks knew an old-league bushman when
they saw one conklins heavy swizzle
stick waved wildly in the air

  but the first big yibar who staggered
up the gangplank with a case of conklins
gin balanced on his enkata-padded head
was stopped at the rail by a grotesque
ape-like spidery-legged hamite with slant-
ed green eyes and a hair-lip that made
his face grin constantly like a monstrous
toad

  his twisted body wore only a breech-
cloth with a string of tiger-fangs around
the thick neck he held an old webbley
rifile crossed before the frightened yibar
whose white eyeballs rolled

  thats the toad said conklin grimly
one of kerstens men part east in-
dain drifted in from british east africa
come on burack if i go aboard that
gins goin with me

  they edged up the gangplank past the
cowering yibar conklin was dwarfed by
the grinning toad go tell bwana mc-
williams that were cornin aboard he
said

  the toad kept on grinning burack
felt a cold shiver go up and down his neck
the toad raised the webbley not to fire
but as a bludgeon conklin raised the
swizzle stick burack heard the sliding
click saw the shining blade leap out of
the end of the stick stop flush against the
toads neck the yellow skin turned a
wet corpse-grey his slanted eyes glazed

  drop that cannon yelled conklin
and tell mcwilliams were cornin aboard
unless you want your neck slit like a
rotten pomegranite

  the toad turned and burack conklin
and yibar came aboard-

  jean her brother and kersten were
sitting beneath a dirty awning at the
stern jeans face was calm and cool look-
ing as she smiled at burack jeans bare
legs were crossed and her knee was dimp-
led nicely thought burack who wasnt
noticing kersten

  we must all cooperate whined mc-
williams rather desperately
mask of the snake



  gewiss roared kersten ve must
get along as long as i am der leader
of dis expedition i vill see there iss no
troubles

  you mean as long as my brother is
leader and youre working for him cor-
rected jean mcwilliams

  kersten stared dat iss vat i mean
he mumbled burack watched him turn
waddle over to a bunch of the toughest
characters he had ever seen two evil
looking muri warriors with raised scar-
patterns all over faces and chests the
toad and a small dope-ridden renegade
called hans

  things settled down as the boat moved
up river burack haunted the presence of
jean mcwilliams much to conklins dis-
gust conklin sipped gordons gin and
mcwilliams began working over a pile of
cages made of bamboo with screen tops

  kersten and his bunch whispered among
themselves

ill

a week slid down stream without
trouble river craft had thinned out
to almost nothing half way to kongolo a
little while after that conklin directed
the pilot to stop the side-wheeler at the
narrow miasmic south of a sluggish trib-
utary that emptied in

  thats it said conklin we have
to go up that pest hole you may notice
he added to mcwilliams that our boat
wont go through that jungle-choked
mouth i told kersten that but he
wouldnt listen

  donnerwetter roared kersten you
insult me i know tega river mouth too
small for our boat

  mcwilliams looked accusingly at the
big german why didnt you tell us if
you knew

  jean lighted a cigarette her long fin-
gers trembled slightly burack admired
her waited for a big blow-up in the strain-
ed relations of the party they stood on
the bow facing the wall of fetid jungle
a vast expanse of almost impenetrable
rain-forest a small cloud of sunbirds
flashed like colored arrows after noisy me-
talic flies chimpanzees hooted derision
at the idiot white apes a civet cats icy
scream came from far up river absurdly

short-legged hippos charged snorting in-
to the water from mud banks and croc-
odiles slid after them

  and the sun was beginning to set above
the jungle heights in a riotous steam of
color

  burack moved over and stood beside
the girl her high strong brows and solid
little jaw looked a little fearfully at the
jungle and burack couldnt blame her for
that

  just take it easy now jean he said
softly well get out all right conklins
the finest guide in the congo

  she smiled but it was a thin smile now
im beginning to realize now what a hell
this place really is and we havent even
gotten into it yet

  conklin was yelling at mcwilliams i
told you that damn kraut didnt know
beans about the jungle didnt i dont
trust him any further than you could
throw him i happen to know that he
intends for us all to die back there in
that bush

  ridiculous gasped mcwilliams wav-
ing his hands weakly

  but kersten had held himself back too
long he dived for conklin roaring like
a wounded bison one hand slid his heavy
luger its canvas sheath hed forgotten
burack jean cried out as burack brought
the barrel of his own  down across ker-
stens forearm kersten howled as the
gun spun across the deck swinging on
around with the momentum of his dive
kerstens clubbing fist caught burack
above the right ear

  fireworks put on a beautiful and pain-
ful display for him as he went stagger-
ing blindly across the deck and bounced
off a rusted metal post

  kersten dully burack was aware
that it was jeans voice that had sliced the
air like a shrill knife he fought against
nauseous blackness and gradually his vis-
ion cleared enough to see kersten drop
conklins battered body to the deck

  der next time i kill he growled
dat iss promise

  burack got to his feet stood swaying
he thought of jeans amazing courage as
he watched her coolness with warmth
underneath slender body strung togeth-
er with steel strands with a woman like
that-burack swore at himself softly
	jungle

what the hell burack he said maybe
if you got hold of some of that ngowa
treasurer youd have a chance maybe

  a deadly brooding kind of strained
waiting existed between all of them after
that kersten and his crew went ashore
to hire native canoes and paddlers from a
local village downstream

  early the next morning in -paddle
canoes they went up the oily tributary of
the tega blood river in five days they
had reached the crude canoe landing of
the ngowa

  burack was behind conklin conklin
stretched out a claw-like hand pointed
burack felt a cold chill on the nape of his
neck he stared he ran his tongue back
and forth along his dry lips sweat trick-
led down his ribs

  back from the canoe landing was a
huge kraal around it was a high wall a
white shining wall gleaming like deaths
final song in the sunlight

  it was a wall built entirely of human
skulls

the ngowa with conklins ex-
pert help received them with a kind
of silent mysterious acceptance it was a
deadly thing and no one expected it to
last kersten and his crew got one part
of the village for huts conklin and bu-
rack mcwilliams and jean another sec-
tion

  jean went about the crazy business of
making plaster of paris face masks of the
few whom she could persuade to submit
to this indignity and mcwilliams like
a boy-scout on an over-night hike went
bounding about in the jungle catching
snakes

  it was all very jolly thought burack
grimly except that its only a damn pre-
lude to bloody murder and it was

  trying to siesta in the afternoon after
failing to figure out a way to rob the me-
morial huts and tombs of their treasure
without endangering jean and her broth-
er conklin and burack were awakened
by a long terrible scream it was gibber-
ing terror and pain

  this is it son rattled conklin grab-
bing up his gun and running for the kraal
gate burack trailed him keeping an eye
on the sides of the jungle trail

  they stopped quickly burack mopped

stories

his eyes and tried to keep his hand steady
on the butt of his 

  a ring of motionless giant ngowa war-
riors with assegais and battle axes ready
stood around a dead body

 a very dead ngowa warrior was
sprawled out in the oozing trail half a
mile from the foraal wall of human skulls
the leopard skin had been torn from his
body he lay on his back huge blue flies
crawling over him it wouldnt have been
so bad except that burack saw that the
dead man-had no face

  the face had been ripped away leav-
ing a weltering bloody mask that bubbled
and frothed as the flies settled

  burack held back violent sickness he
backed away conklin twisted a corpse-
white face and muttered this-my lord
- this is really it burack conklin
choked its that damn kerstens work
and now were getting the blame i told
you he was getting in too good with that
two-faced witch-doctor listen to what lit-
tle shamans howling now listen to that
damn little neri-neri

  burack listened and as he listened he
slowly slid the  out of its holster it
was hot and sweating in his palm

  kersten was clever clever as hell
clever like a devil

  seeing those huge fierce warriors re-
duced to children by jeans persuasion
letting themselves be lain out on their
backs while plaster of paris hardened on
their faces that had been a little funny for
a while conklin had said at the time that
the blacks had acted scared as though
they had been victimized by some kind
of ju-ju

  mcwilliams had been oblivious to ev-
erything but his snakes he had a num-
ber of them captured and in their boxes
lined up in back of his hut there were
a number of black mambas one of the
worlds deadliest snakes including other
deadly cobras and vipers

  now none of it seemed funny because
now burack understood what had hap-
pened he tensed as the ugly little mwi-
tangala or medicine man made counter
magic signs over the terribly defaced
corpse he was a wizened black shell in
blood-saked feathers a sly evil little man
with sharp darting eyes

  borfina he turned spat at conklin
mask of the snake



and burack suddenly the face is gone
see thou art black magicians even as
thy big white companion hath warned us

  burack snarled in his throat kersten
had fixed it all right

  all of thee white magicians are here
to steal away the souls of the ngowa
with the second faces thou hast made of
this dead warrior thou hast slain him
those rock faces were black juju

  the witch doctor made magic motions
with his clawing hands go ye he
shrieked to the warriors ringing the corpse
make thy death drums speak make
thyselves ready the drums of the liv-
ing hearts will beat again the white
man who hath stolen souls of our war-
riors shall become living hearts for the
drums

  burack fell back in a crouch with
conklin beside him but miraculously the
two of them were suddenly alone except
for the black corpse without a face

  the others had melted into the vaporous
green wall

  a tribe of colobus monkeys rustled the
overhead euphorbia tree tiny clouds of
insects rose and fell like mist parrakeets
chattered in rage at the disturbance

  the dead black who had lost both his
face and his soul heard nothing

bonklin let out a long sick
sigh and then drained half a pint of
gin at one long-drawn gesture burack
finished it

  listen son gasped conklin its up
to us now kerstens got in the first and
big punch he found out enough about
these ngowas superstitions to know his
plan would work

  burack tried to take his eyes off the
bloody horror of the corpses faceless
head

  conklin said this dead black is the
first one jean made a plaster of paris
face mask of aint he now his face is
gone get the connection

  burack did

  the witch-doctor had the bug planted
in his bonnet by kersten he thinks were
all black magicians that we made the
masks so we could kill off the warriors
at a distance with juju-like devil dolls
they stick pins in ill bet my last case of
gin that that mask made from this poor

  devils face is smashed up right now
broken smashing the mask kills the war-
rior it was made from and we get the
blame for smashing it kersten or one of
his monkeys probably did it if the n-
gowa dont slaughter us for this then
therell be another face mask broken and
another warrior killed and his face ripped
off

  anyway we dont have much chance
of getting out of here with our hearts

  well be the sacrifice victims son
well be put alive in those drums and al-
lowed to die in there come on lets sneak
back to the kraal we gotta warn the
mcwilliams that its high time to trek out
of here

  a faint queer whistle sounded burack
wouldnt have noticed it except that it
didnt sound quite natural then conk-
lin repeated the whistle

  now what the devil goes on growled
burack his skin tingling

  that grinned conklin was wara
the masai

  as they rounded a turn in the trail the
wall of skulls blazed in whiny white re-
lief beyond it in a clearing were the
tombs of the ancient ngowa a special
stoned roadway led directly from a tow-
ering baobob tree in the center of the
kraal into the weird place of tombs there
must have been hundreds of tombs there
each with a small memorial hut built over
it all kinds of fetiches sacred signs ou-
angas and packets hung on the huts to
ward off evil spirits

  treasure symbolic of centuries of an-
cestor worship

  and inside those huts were fortunes in
crude gold ornaments jewels diamonds
uncut emeralds blood rubies or so the
story went burack hadnt been inside one
of them giant ngowa guards were
spotted at strategic points ancient peo-
ple jean had said come from the nile
delta centuries ago

  he had talked of the treasure to jean
but she had only smiled as though such
things were childish and maybe they
were but getting your hands on a mil-
lion dollars wasnt childish or was it
burack thought

he blinked at the wall of skulls his
eyes burned and his throat was dry row
on row of bleached skulls composed the
	jungle

high walls skulls of enemies killed in cen-
turies of warfare the chiefs hut was
made of skulls as were his footstools and
his throne was made of skulls

  they edged through the entrance and
along the wall ngowa guards didnt
seem to notice them or rather ignored
them conklin swore they know theyve
got us he said he entered his own and
buracks bee-hive hut first turned and ran
back out yelling wildly waving his swiz-
zle stick his mouth contorted

  the gin burack my last case of gin
they stole it either the blacks or that
damn kraut

  take it easy shouted burack we
gotta find jean and-

  conklin stood trembling with rage he
was still standing that way when a dozen
huge silent ngowa warriors popped up
out of nowhere that burack could see and
surrounded them dont fight clear dont
even try it conklin said we wouldnt
have a chance theyve probably already
got the girl theres still a chance that i
can talk to the chief if hes got a brain
in his skull hell know better than to
throw in with kersten-

  burack watched the blacks take away
all of their weapons and ammunition they
left conklin his swizzle stick though what
he could do with one sword cane against
the giant ngowa burack couldnt figure

  they dragged the two men to a big
hut by the towering baobob in the center
of the kraal

  sacrificial hut groaned conklin as
they were thrown inside

  jean and her brother were inside sit-
ting dejectedly in the gloom the girls
face was white and drawn mcwilliams
was standing against the wall lips twitch-
ing like a lost child

  kersten was there too with a luger
in his hand and the toad standing be-
side him

  the toads mouth was parted in a betel-
stained grin

  veil said kersten der game is
about played out none of you vill get
out alive maybe jean here vill go out
alive with me maybe

  burack lunged but conklin held him
kersten said listen mine friends was

                                               t

the insidious throbbing of the
drums ate quickly into buracks
nerves mcwilliams sighed i simply do
not understand what is happening

  kersten said you must know dat it
dos not matter you vill die here but i
shall tell you der idea chust listen this
ngowa country is one of the biggest un-
exploited mineral regions ach so dhere
iss much copper tin gold but der fool-
ish congo association and der belgian
government let the blacks keep it and dat
is no goot white men have come in and
made trouble ngowas will go on war
trail big uprising start now and blacks

fraulien chust disappear war much blood
and this place vill be taken away from
the blacks der territory made free for
mining and i haf got der job as man-
ager for der compnay what vill take over
der mining projects

  conklin swore in five dialects and
plenty of slave labor again too eh ker-
sten this other companys national back-
er will ship helpless bantus in here by
the thousands to work the mines and
theyll die off like flies

  kersten laughed he turned pointed to
the row of plaster of paris face masks
lined up along the wall kersten motioned
to the toad break up three more of the
masks

  the toad hopped across the dim in-
terior of the hut a single blow for each
did the trick now said kersten like
you did with the first one the toad
grinned his hand gripping a long curved
knife then he darted outside the hut

  conklin looked at mcwilliams three
more ngowa warriors who let your sis
make masks of their faces are going to
be butchered by the toad mac their
faces mutilated

 what do you mean mcwilliams
stared owlishly

  they think you and jean and all of
us except kerstens cutthroats are black
magicians using the face masks for juju
so now were going to be put alive in the
drums of the living hearts unless we
can either escape or talk our way out
burack took quick advantage of ker-
mask of the snake



stens attention being on conklin he made
a flying tackle into kerstens groin to-
gether they hurtled back into the flimsy
woven thatch of the hut wall there was
a splintering crash a choking cloud of
dust rose around them startled vermin
scuttled for cover

  kersten hit flat on his back with an
outrush of air burack had an elbow in
his neck as they hit then he was pound-
ing desperately with his fists into that
bullet-headed face he felt bone crunch
blood ripped from nostrils he saw conk-
lin dive through the hole of the hut and
disappear and then from somewhere a
hand appeared clutching a heavy revolver
burack tried to dodge but the barrel de-
scended hard and repeatedly

  he was hearing a long scream from
jean as he rolled over feeling the in-
rushing darkness shattered with brilliant
lights

fully layer by agonized layer con-
sciousness returned to burack

  he raised his head he opened his eyes
and was looking at a black writhing sea
of contorted bodies he blinked his eyes
they burned cold sweat streamed down
his naked chest he was tied to the big
baobob tree

  the ritual fires reached up hungry yel-
low tongues in the night toward the moon-
filled sky monstrous shadows swayed
and twitched as the crazed ngowans
danced and stomped to the rhythm of
blood sacrifice

  he turned his head weakly blood
dripped down his sides his hands were
tied tightly behind him to the tree in the
center of the kraal

  and jean was bound too beside him
her clothing was ripped to shreds her
soft bronzed flesh gleamed in the fire-
light

  jean he whispered the hell with
them say that theyre going to torture
us so weve got to determine that were
not going to feel it you understand
that

  her voice was stiff and dry the hell
with them she said

  burack straightened on the other side
of him mcwilliams also bound sagged
limply - his glasses were gone his pale
eyes watered as he stared wildly his

breath came in sharp painful gasps only
when he turned and looked directly at
burack did burack see what kind of
a man mcwilliams really was he was
delicate sensitive but he was not the
coward he had seemed to be he had
guts there was a grim dark determina-
tion under that soft face

  barely audible beneath the roaring of
the drums and the blacks burack heard
mcwilliams say

  the hell with them

  conklin had mentioned it to burack
this was called the tree of pain three
drums were placed in a row before the
victims three drums three victims a
living body entombed in each drum to die
a slow death of torture but that wasnt
enough for the blacks on the tree of
pain you suffered unspeakable prelimi-
nary torture

  the witch-doctor masked now and
leering made cabalistic signs over the
three drums then the leaping dancers
began the last stage of the ritual dance

  they leaped around and around the
tree leopard skins glinting rare animal
tails hanging from skins encircling waists
swinging and jerking crowns of brilliant
feathered plumes bobbing swaying

  screaming pain it went on and on
through blurred sweating mist torture
he let his fevered eyes drop saw the
many tiny wounds dotting his naked
sweating body again and again assegais
licked out points breaking the skins of
the three

  he didnt want to look at jeans body
now he couldnt have even if he had
wanted to his head lolled on his chest

  only living hearts placed within the
drums could give them the true rhythm
of battle faster the dance swung asse-
gais glinted in the flames where
thought burack through foggy wet pain
is conklin

  beyond the dancers the chief the
mwanangwa sat on his throne of skulls
the gigantic black joss outline watched
the torture with eager eyes three hun-
dred fat pounds of flesh he sat chewing
a kilakilola root which caused his body
to exude a body-odor like cedar-wood a
cord around his neck dangled five crim-
son wing-feathers of the kuri-kuri bird
badges of distinction
	jungle

  kersten stood on the chiefs left on
his right crouched the toad behind stood
the white renegade hans his mousy
eyes were wet with fascination as they
watched the torture

  the witch-doctor was leaping now in a
fantastic stiff-legged dance burack dim-
ly knew that this was the end of the ritual

  and then something like hell exploded
the witch-doctor let out a long broken
scream of sheer terror

  something-something ghastly and in-
human-was coming toward them from
the tombs

  or rather it was raising up out of the
tomb nearest the big baobob tree it was
near the rock road that led from the
tombs to the tree the blacks froze from
the apparition rising out of the tomb
came a moan of hollow-sounding horror
a weird sonorous chanting the sound
died and rose again ululating in tomb-
thrown echoes

  the tomb had been that of a former
village chief and out of that tomb stalk-
ing toward them was a gleaming white
skeleton

the pale outline writhed toward
them closer emmiting its ghastly
moans

  the witch-doctor was the first to run
he yelled orders as he ran for the blacks
to bring the sacred drums with them or
the ghostly skeleton would contaminate
them in a matter of seconds the kraal
was empty the drums gone even the
ponderous outline of the mwanangwa the
chief had managed to roll down from
his throne and waddle out of the kraal
into the dark jungle night

  only kersten the toad and hans
remained and even they were crouched
in fear as the weirdly glowing apparition
approached only when the ghostly out-
line had come within a few feet of bu-
rack did he recognize it

  it was conklin and he was drunk he
was naked except for his shorts and he
had painted a skeleton outline on his body
with phosphorescent paint though where
he had gotten it burack couldnt figure
out

  but kersten had also recognized conk-
lin he roared with dark rage pulled up
his luger and began firing conklin

stories

ducked behind the tree the swizzle stick
lengthened into silver steel licked across
the bonds of the bound three tonga bark
cord fell away and burack dropped into
the dust he managed to crawl behind the
trunk of the baobob to join jean mc-
williams and conklin bullets whined
around them

  mcwilliams was babbling wildly sud-
denly before they could stop him he
leaped up yelling jean screamed as her
brother ran into the open and kept on
running dust spurted around him as bul-
lets followed jean started after him but
burack held her

  mcwilliams was a mad figure leaping
and bounding across the kraal torn
clothes flapping like a frightened scare-
crow his lanky length galloped out of the
kraal and disappeared into the wall of
dark jungle

  we gotta get out of here said conk-
lin those blacksll be back kersten
dont know whether to rush us here or
not he may think i pack a gun you
guys sneak through those bushes around
the edge of the skull wall ill stay here
and bluff them for a while

  you were in the tomb said burack
howd you get that skeleton disguise
conklin grinned drunkedly i couldnt
find my gun so i had to have some liquor
son i knew i could get it in the chiefs
tomb

  what gin

  no you idiot beer those tombs are
provided with sacred beer a number of
big gourds are kept above the tombs filled
with strong native millet beer son its
made by three appointed virgins that know
their business they have long reeds run-
ning from the gourds down into the bur-
ied blacks bones to feed his lingering
spirit with spirit it was a simple matter
to transfer that reed to my own mouth
that millet beers strong

  burack wanted to laugh but his slashed
face was too sore but the phosphores-
cent paint

  hell cant you figure that out that
tomb was full of bones wetted down by
centuries of rain the tomb was full of
phosphorescence so i just painted a skele-
ton on myself now you two vamoose out
of here

  he started to argue with conklin about
mask of the snake



that but be didnt get the chance jean
screamed as the big savage muri warriors
of kerstens charged around the tree ker-
sten came in fast behind them

  a kind of blind suicidal rage filled bu--
rack with a strength he could never oth-
erwise have had under the circumstances

  he saw conklin slash out with the
swizzle stick saw a big muri pick up
jean and run with her then he grabbed
kerstens running foot and brought him
down on his face burack was swearing
insanely as he got to his feet kicked ker-
sten in the face

  kersten still gripped the luger he
swung it upward

  i only got my bare hands kersten
burack screamed

 he wasnt surprised when kersten
obliged burack couldnt see anything
else jean conklin the muris anything
all he could see was kerstens bulk ris-
ing to his feet

  burack charged fists flailing kersten
roared met the charge head-on they
were standing close together exchanging
blows and then the toad and hans
dragged burack away hans let him have
it across the head with a revolver barrel
burack weaved his legs wide apart to
hold him up blood running into his eyes

  donnerwetter roared kersten

  dont do it whined hans mousy
eyes glittered dont fight him now jobi
let the blacks slaughter him who cares
now about what we came up here to do
originally  conklin told us about them
tombs bein loaded with treasure didnt
he i dont know why he told us but that
sample-

  burack wondered vaguely why conk-
lin might have told them then he knew
or thought he knew part of it if kersten
got interested in getting some of the
treasure for himself then hed forget any
other plans he might have had not that
his main plan wasnt busted up already
not that anything could matter much
now the big muri black was still hold-
ing jeans limp body in his arms

  all right agreed kersten tie them
up leave them on the tree again let der
natifs have dem while the natifs are put-
ting them inside der drums ve vill get the
stuff from der tombs and head down
river

  so burack and jean were tied again to
the tree burack watched kersten and his
men edge out of the kraal in the direction
of the tombs sometime later the blacks
returned their fright had partly cooled
and it got cold when they saw their vic-
tims tied and helpless they started sac-
rificial rites but burack knew that this
time it would be short jean was still un-
conscious and he was glad of that conk-
lins skeleton painted body sagged life-
lessly

v

now burack was beyond pain
jean sagged in her bonds through
a wet mist he saw the three drums again
brought back by the sweating blacks
again the ngowa danced stiff-legged
around the drums

  now the witch-doctor and his appren-
tices were removing the thongs holding
the bull-hide drum heads with silent
awe the three apprentices threw aside
the stiff drum heads into the dust they
made gestures then they reached inside
the drums they were going to take out
the old bones of former sacrificial victims
burack mused foggily then replace them
with us jean and matt and me me
burack the young man who wanted ad-
venture he managed a dusty chuckle

  the apprentices fell back shivering
with horror three quaverous cries burst
from them those werent bones rising
up from the drums

  they were snakes spitting venemous
heads darted out each drum was a pit of
angry deadly cobras mambas and vipers

  erectile heads on both sides of the ma-
lignant eyes were outstretched loose
plastic skin elevated by movable ribs
stretched in poisonous hunger sharp
groove fangs struck struck with invis-
ible speed struck and struck again
deadly contents of venom-glands shot in-
to the three howling apprentices enough
neuro-toxin in each stab to kill a man in
half a minute

  buracks eyes bulged in incredulous
horror there were spitting cobras too
squirting venom from fangs that swung
forward when they spread yawning white
mouths menacing hoods opening their
bodies foreparts rose up like flexible foils
	jungle

from coiled spring-steel muscles beneath

  the three apprentices died quickly
conklin conscious again let out a long
joyous yell otherwise a terrible silence
had descended over the kraal every na-
tive was frozen stiff with terror and hor-
ror

  conklin said that mcwilliams must
have pulled this trick burack he dumped
those snakes into the drums when they
took them away just now and went on
into the jungle he took off the war-
heads and put in the snakes then put the
heads back on if he didnt then who the
hell did  hes the only one who can
handle them serpents

  hearing the sudden silence kersten
and his boys could be seen edging through
the shadows from the tombs staring in
bugged eyed fright at the snakes plopping
out of the drums into -the dust and into
the flickering firelight

  they didnt know which tombs to
rifle said conklin you got to know
which ones have the treasure only a
chosen few-

  conklin was struggling against his
bonds if i can only get free i got an
idea thatll make them blacks crawl for
sure we got em scared right now if
those snakes dont get us first the
blacks can run but we cant

  most of the snakes were out of the
drums their flat evil heads were wear-
ing to and fro eyes gleaming spotted
hides shown iridescent

  a terrible frozen silence still clutched
the blacks their white eyes stared they
breathed hoarsely through dialating nos-
trils the witchdoctor had fallen on his
knees was beating his head in the dust
several snakes slithered toward the chief
frozen on his throne of skulls the witch-
doctor was crawling back like a scuttling
crab hands writhing as he frantically tried
to create big counter juju

  kersten yelled it iss anudder trick
his answer was a tasseled assegai that
streaked the air above the blazing sacri-
ficial fire missing the big german by
inches

  kersten jerked out his luger crouched
with his eyes glaring like a cornered apes
hans and the toad flanked him back in
the shadows behind the chiefs throne of
skulls

stories

  a huge black man bounded past the
fire following up the assegai he had
thrown

  wara conklin cried out hoarsely
where you been hidin

  waras teeth gleamed white the broad
iron masai sword in his hand slashed
conklins bonds free then he quickly
freed burack and jean the girl was
coming around now and burack supported
her somehow as he kept his eye on the
nearer snakes and wondered what conk-
lin was going to do

the snakes weaved toward him
flattened heads pulsing conklin
somehow managed to outwardly ignore
them seeming almost contemptuous ker-
sten had that luger raised but he was
hesitating about using it he knew that
the ngowa were against him now too
and he didnt want to try to escape with-
out a crack at the treasure in the tombs
he evidently saw that conklin was going
to pull something and he was intending
to hang around long enough to see what
it was

  when conklin spoke standing there
waving his arms his body glowing like a
part-skeleton part-fleshly fiend his voice
sounded like wind rattling through dried
reeds

  in his selfish greed and jealousy
said conklin in kinyamwesi tongue this
white juju man has made great insult and
blasphemy to yakamfwa the snake of
death he pointed an accusing skeleton
arm at kersten

  the sea of blacks sank to their knees
they gave out a cry of tortuous fear
women wailed men shrieked

  conklin elaborated i am the fleshly
form of limsasi the avenger messenger
of yakamfwa we were sent to find the
truth about ye ngowa and we have
found it ye were given this land to call
your own free from white mans med-
dling but ye have betrayed that trust
ye have insulted the snake god he has
changed your living hearts within the
drums to living serpents

  burack watched kersten raise the lu-
ger his face working with suppressed
rage the snakes wriggled nearer conk-
lin jean was staring now with horrified
eyes
mask of the snake



  as soon as we can start walking back
away from the snakes burack whispered
to her she nodded

  the blacks were babbling woe and ter-
ror dark fear of retribution

  you have tortured with your assegais
none other than the human forms of swila
the spitting cobra and of ninabo the
snake mother the gods of the snake
are enraged at this sacrilege

  burack watched the snakes fearfully
conklin might be convincing the blacks
that he was swila the spitting cobra
god but those cobras there in the dust
didnt seem convinced he remembered
that conklin had told him earlier that the
kinyamwesi were snake worshippers
and now conklin was having a field day

  the ngowa chief managed to roll into
the dust a ten foot cobra swayed its
head a scant yard from the chiefs face

 conklin was saying mutemi em-
peror of the snake people and ruler of
all wakaioka empire of the snakes is
enraged at your devotion to the black juju
charms of the big buffalo there shall
be no more sacrifice of humans to give the
drums the beat of life from this night
you must put live snakes in the drums for
your sacrifice this is the command of
the great msamba

  kersten saw that conklin had convinced
the blacks he bellowed in a high harsh
voice that sounded mad to burack then
he ran forward blasting wildly with his
luger little geysers of dust were kicked
up by the heavy slugs striking among the
snakes he was going to get conklin
burack could see that no matter what
else happened to kersten he was going
to get conklin and burack was the only
one in a position to save the old man

  relax he said to jean mcwilliams
then he started dodging through the pool
of snakes to head kersten off his breath
came harshly in his throat his lungs
burned straining he saw that he would

be too late to save conklin unless-

  he turned crashed straight through a
barrier of cobra heads he hardly felt
the slapping sting as the black mamba
struck into his thigh his only thought

was that he would have to hurry if he
saved conklin hurry and get kersten

  as he intercepted kerstens charge
kersten swore and hurled the empty lu-
ger at burack he dodged kersten came
 in with a long lunging dive

  burack sidestepped he tripped kersten
who went headlong into the dust burack
lifted high on his toes clenched both
hands tightly together he brought his
body weight down the heels of his hands
crashed down into the back of kerstens
thick neck the neck cracked and ker-
sten stiffened twitching and died

  burack sank down slowly into the dust
beside him to also die

the snakes had been confused
pushed from the firelight by the
gunfire but burack didnt really much
care anymore as he lay beside the dead
kersten the poison was a crawling mist
in his head through a shifting blur he
watched the toad and hans running fran-
tically across the kraal toward the boma
entrance

  it was hard to believe it but then bur-
ack recognized the red-dripping scratched
and utterly savage looking figure running

after them as-mcwilliams there was

little resemblance to the mcwilliams who
had come over from london a few weeks
ago a bounding bloody apparition chas-
ing the renegades he was carrying a
small bore winchester

  he knelt down he aimed carefully and
fired twice hans went down with a long
cry the toad ran faster long thin legs
crawling like a spiders he fled into the
jungle as mcwilliams sent a chamber o
shots after him

  then mcwilliams disappeared into his
hut reappeared quickly and then was
crouching beside burack he had a leather
pouch from which he was hastily extract-
ing a hypo anti-snakebite toxin mc-
williams chattered always be prepared
for everything in these beastly jungles
eh

  burack went to sleep with jean kissing
him which was about as good a way as
any
kraal of the
   walking dead

by dan cushman

    why would mengbattu the pale girot never dance at the fetish fire even
    the well-known scientist dr sprague dared not try to answer that question
    for the ghastly death-secrets of ancient tovodoun might contain truths too

evil to know

avanette rattled loose fenders and
disappeared in flamelike mirage
where the road curved among thatch
huts on its way to the cacao plantations
along the bosun prah for a long time af-
ter it was gone dust hung apparently mo-
tionless in the morning air caught like
fine-ground kaffir flour where sun slatted
through the palm fronds



  for a time it seemed that the vanette
had taken with it the last living things in
that town of borkovo the gold coast
british west africa

  then unexpectedly as things sometimes
happen in the tropics a white man ap-
peared apparently born of heat-wave and
mirage

  he walked slowly past the a  g vege-
table oils warehouse and struck across
borkovos wide street toward the two-
three steps to the lower verandah avoided
a bit of broken flooring and jerked the
bell-pull

  a tinkle came from the deep interior
he waited taking off his sun helmet for
comfort

  he had perspired and a wisp of burlap-
brown hair stuck flat against his forehead
he was neither tall nor short slim nor
heavy but he had a lean resilience that
was uncommon among men who spent their
years along the quinine and whiskey belt
of the african tropics he was about
thirty-five his face was not handsome
-it was too long his cheekbones too high
so they seemed to press and narrow his
blue-gray eyes

  he waited with utter resignation and
at long last there came a slap-slap of bare

feet on woven palm mattings and a tall
aquapem boy with dusty coal skin came in
sight buttoning the front of his trousers

  the district commissioner is expect-
ing me the white man said

  the boy led him up a flight of cob-
webby stairs to a copper-screened door
the shadow outline of a man could be seen
moving inside

  white man come see you said the
boy

  he may come in a nasal-metallic
voice responded

  the man was seated in a rattan chair
forearms resting on a cluttered ebony-
topped deck he was a negro small wiry
dressed in ill-kept whites his hair po-
maded with an attempt at taking the kink
out the pomade was perfumed and the
perfume with sweat gave the sort of
sickly-sweet odor one would expect at the


	fungle

front door of a brothel behind him a
white canvas hammock swung limply mak-
ing it evident that he had been taking early
siesta

  the spidery negro moved his rattan
chair with just the right degree of court-
esy and said

   mr thebes i say this is a pleasure
 he tried to accent his speech like a
 britisher and did a rather good job of it
 the white man craig thebes looked
 down on him for a moment of thoughtful
 amusement then he shrugged

   well maybe it will be a pleasure

thebes was not english he was
american with an americans side-
of-the-mouth carelessness of speech he
sat down sliding to rest on shoulderblades
and tail bone stretching his legs out he
drew a long cigarette from the pocket of his
linen coat and lighted it without offering
one to the commissioner

   you call yourself latham dont you
   my name is roger latham

   there was reproof in the mans answer
but not too much reproof thebes blew
cigarette smoke it was tangier tobacco
smelling like a cigar he took time to
study latham through the smoke the
fellow was mulatto probably maybe three-
fourths black accra tribe no ordinary
natives the accras even the armenians
from dakar had a time matching them for
cleverness it was a common joke that
this latham was once the district com-
missioners barber and that he had merely
taken over the affairs of state without any-
ones consent when that gentleman resigned
without warning to work for the cocoa
combine for the better part of a year
thereafter the governor let the fellow who
signed his reports roger latham carry
on unaware that he was a native then
when the fact was brought before him the
august gentleman had saved face as best
he could uttering a resounding phrase on
african citizenship and rushing a tem-
porary appointment through the legisla-
tive assembly

   latham seemed not in the least embar-
rassed by the quality of thebes gaze he
tapped black fingers on the black desk
whistling softly the air was something
from pinafore everything he did was
i mimicry of his former master then as

stories

though to complete the caricature he af-
fixed a monacle in one eye

  thebes laughed-a dry jerk of his shoul-
ders cigarette scissored in one corner of
his mouth the man was like some ghastly
aspersion on britain a kick at the collaps-
ing bones of her empire thebes spoke
talking to himself more than latham

  praise god that benjamin disraeli is
not around to see this

  eh the negro was no fool and
though he recognized the contempt in
thebes words he saw no reason to get
angry you have some business to trans-
act or were you paying your respect
i could pay my respect from across the
street i have business to transact as you
damned well know thebes leaned back
inhaled and talked smoke from his lungs
as i told you on the phone i am rep-
resentative of dexter mahogany and dye-
woods limited our concern is at present
expanding into the primary fields either
here or in the malay archipelago with
a careless movement thebes drew a bill-
fold opened to the identification win-
dows tossed it across

  american

  yes

  while latham read thebes eyes wan-
dered the room a dusty british flag
stood in a brass holder behind the desk
there was a row of screened windows
with bamboo jalousies that swung making
whispered rattles in the almost impercep-
tible breeze

  i say old fellow cawnt say that i
ever heard of this dexter mahogany out-
fit latham remarked sliding the billfold
back

  next time ill come representing
burma shave thebes growled around his
cigarette or do you still use the old-
fashioned shaving brush

  i use a brush french oil soap and a
german razor but my prices have gone
up considerably furthermore i warn my
customers not to talk to much while they
are being shaved or else they might get
their throats cut

  thebes laughed it wasnt often one
found a native who could toss it like that
in the white mans vernacular he stop-
ped twisted his lips as though his tangier
cigarette left an unpleasant taste i told
you what i wanted over the phone and
kraal of the walking dead



i	came here expecting to be clipped
how much do you want

   im a british official honor of the

empire old man bribery is a-

   all right well be subtle about it
though it takes more time he felt in-
side his pocket and drew out a heavy man-
ila envelope if youve never heard of
dexter ltd you can tune in on the tak-
oradi wireless tonight at seven and get the
london quotation theres a big world
outside the g-c and it isnt all run by the
royal cocoa combine and the bank of
b w a my outfits pretty big too as
youll find out some day

   he tossed the envelope over and la-
tham opened it it contained a stock cer-
tificate

  thebes said thats made out for
twelve shares of capital stock were not
giving it to you remember no bribery
not an official of the new africa thebes
spat his cigarette across the palm-matted
floor no were giving you the oppor-
 tunity to buy it at par value one pound
sterling a share the present market value
is two-pounds-six but what the hell its
our policy to invite leading citizens of new
districts to become part owners of our
concern

  you want me to pay--

   pay me anytime next christmas will
do

   i believe i would rather have you ad-
vance me the money

   thebes opened his billfold tossed over
a five-pound note ill advance you this
much and no more take it or leave it
latham laid the banknote inside the
certificate placed both in the top drawer
of the desk turned a key in the lock he
said

  and now to this thing you wanted

the american explorers-

   i want their permit temporarily sus-
pended

   but signed by the governor himself-
the governors in england and that
permit was signed by his secretary any-
how theyre headed for aggamba ag-
gamba is dangerous too dangerous or-
have you forgotten about that representa-
tive for gambon mahogany stantina
he never came back theres no reason
why any white man would want to stay on

 -jungle-fall

in a voodoo hell like aggamba hes
dead

  but i say    there are so many
things a man dies of in the jungle the
watersnake the striped mosquito that lays
the eggs in the blood 

  thats what i was saying its too dan-
gerous for three american scientists with
no guide a white guide thats what they
need get it latham

  ah he exhaled through flattened
nostrils lifted his bony hands let them
fall you have convinced me

  sure said thebes standing up

  you were not clipped so close as to
hurt what-ho grinned latham lifting
his monacle

  close enough

  latham came around the desk reaching
to lay a friendly arm around thebes
shoulder

  keep your hands off me barked
thebes he turned toward the door paus-
ed half way through by the way if ev-
erything goes right ill advance you the
rest of that loan just before i leave for
aggamba   with the american scientists

ii

a converted u s reconaissance
car stood in front of the two-story le-
vique hotel the numbers and army insig-
nia had been obliterated by daubs of gray
paint and across the side in neat letters
was the inscription columbia ethnologi-
cal expedition a young man with wavy
yellow hair tossed a heavy bag through
the rear opening and turned to grin as
thebes walked up

  hot he said

  thebes stopped giving more regard to
the remark than it seemed to deserve by
the way leskawitz where were you rais-
ed he asked

  minnesota

  minnesota good god doesnt co-
lumbia have an arctic expedition  did
you know that the hottest spot on the face
of the globe is keyes just five degrees
north of here i was there one day when
it was  in the shade at night it cool-
ed off one hundred two youd better
knock off for the day kid or one of these
noons youll turn belly-up permanently at
the ripe age of twenty-five
	jungle

  no rest today the good doctors in a
hurry to beat the rains

  youre going to aggamba arent you
leskawitz nodded and thebes spent a
second or two looking at the inscription
on the side of the truck

  what the hell are you digging for up
at aggamba

  were not diggers were from the
columbia department of ethnology i
guess theres an endowment fund that
was invested a little too well so they sent
us here to get rid of the accumulated in-
terest

  what do ethnologists study

  races customs institutions

  i should think you could have studied
that in the bronx

  i know it sounds crazy but this thing
all started with a study of voodoo down
in haiti most of those africans ances-
tors were originally from the gold coast
so we came here to dig out the roots the
voodoo capital seems to be aggamba so

-its aggamba for us in this recon

car-if we can beat the rains

  a second white man about thirty-five
big and muscular with a deep red face
walked down the hotel steps with a bundle
he nodded briefly to thebes the man
was dr otwen mason he had more the
appearance of a stevedore than a scientist

better light-to leskawitz theres an
evil weather report on the wirelessi and
the chiefs getting his bowels overheated
right-o sang leskawitz still smiling
thebes followed them inside the

chief-dr hilary sprague- was

at the desk talking to fat madame levique
the proprietress he was fifty or fifty-five
good looking with china-white hair mak-
ing a striking contrast with his reddish-
tanned skin

  oh thebes he said its a hell of
a thing to turn down a fellow countryman
the way i did you but you can see for
yourself how that car is loaded

  sure sure doc things work out
that way sometimes

  no hard feelings

  why should there be ill take care
of my end

  he climbed the stairs circled the vine-
shaded verandah his black boy boleh-
kah was curled up just outside the door
of his room asleep he stepped over the

stories

mans big body and went inside the jar
of his step awakened boleh-kah who sat
up heavy shouldered ugly made to seem
uglier by the tribal welts which puckered
his skin and made ridges from forehead
to navel he made no sound boleh-kahs
tongue had been removed by an arab sur-
geon many years before on orders of the
sultan of wadeai for carrying tales against
the government so he merely lifted his
two hands in greeting

  thebes pulled off his linen jacket un-
buckled the  mm walther automatic
leaving the wet print of its shoulder-strap
on his shirt and lay down on the stretched
canvas cot he closed his eyes while bol-
eh-kah made slow movements stirring air
with a hand-punkha

  when he woke up clouds made a thick
cover over the sun thebes stepped over
boleh-kah who had fallen asleep and walk-
ed to the verandah making a hole to see
through the kumasi vine the recon car
was still there

  downstairs he found mason and leska-
witz seated disconsolately inside a screen-
ed compartment of the lower verandah
with empty sundowner glasses on the table
between them

  still here thebes sat down and
with the big wet coming up from the west
this is the end of march my buckos
the greater rains theyve been holding
off two weeks and that always makes it
worse maybe you should have brought
a meterologist along

  a native boy came spotless in new sen-
gah-shifter and half-trousers making him
look like a hindu thebes ordered whiskey
and water

  refill he asked indicating the empty
glasses

  might as well grumbled mason per-
sonally i think we might as well sit here
and get stinking drunk

  now youre talking like a real tt
said thebes

  dr sprague came from outside mop-
ping his face until his handkerchief be-
came a damp ball

  no use asked mason

  sprague shook his head

  commissioner revoke your permit
asked thebes

  sprague peered at him you must be
psychic
kraal of the

walking dead



  no just experienced the trust
doesnt like the idea of strangers who
might carry stories out of the country
folks might get the idea that the g-c
isnt the black mans utopia its been pic-
tured

  mason asked sprague did you try to
buy the commissioner off

  no

  dont thebes leaned back making
room so the houseboy could put down his
stengah dont especially a black offi-
cial theres nothing hed rather do than
throw the lot of you in jail

  but damn it we cant just sit-

  of course not youre going on to
aggamba

  there was a promise in thebes voice
and sprague waited for more

  i might be able to get your permit re-
instated

  say that would be-

  provided youd agree to take me along
as professor thebes your associate
very well sprague said he gave in
that easily

  mason rose to his feet he bumped the
table making glasses jump he looked
down on thebes damn it you pulled

strings and got him to-

  mason sprague spoke sharply wav-
ing him to be quiet

  mason remained standing a few sec-
onds anger thickening his shoulders and
raising veins in his forehead then he
sat down thebes watched him with an
unlighted cigarette dangling between his
lips he struck a match on his thumb-
nail

  go ahead and say it he said smooth-
ly-

  nothing mason muttered

  sprague addressed thebes when can
you get us started

  that depends

  on what

  it just depends

  thebes finished his stengah and left a
few minutes later rain came in an abrupt
deluge the shower was over in ten min-
utes leaving the town steamy-hot dark-
ness came and with it the thum-thumming
voodoo drums of the native village thebes
returned finding the three scientists en-
gaged in a desultory game of pinochle
he tossed a paper on the table

  get it  asked dr sprague

  yes hell let you go in the hands of
a white guide

  mason threw down his cards why do
you want to go up there

  ill tell you that not because its any of
your damned business but because youd
imagine something a hell of a lot more
sinister im with dexter mahogany and
dyewoods one of the richest stands of
mahogany and cabinet odum in the colony
lies up there near an old concession that
a certain george clifton is operating a
couple of men went up there last dry sea-
son to do some timber-mapping they
never came back im not accusing any-
one it might not even be significant that
clifton has already shipped out three times
the amount of mahogany that was inside
the limits of his concession but id like
to look around for my firm with an eye
to cutting in on a good thing and id just
a little rather have clifton think i was
an ethnologist

mason twisted down his heavy lips
in other words youre using us as
a screen so you can spy on a competitor
and maybe steal his concession away from
him

  why yes thats one way of putting it

  there was no warning in thebes eyes
he turned the movement brought him
close to mason thebes fist swung in a
sudden arc connecting with masons meaty
jaw

  masons head snapped to one side his
eyes were off-focus as he hit the floor sit-
ting down with hands flung behind him
after a baffled moment he charged to his
feet thebes sidestepped and tossed a chair
so it tangled his feet and sent him to the
floor again

  stop it dr sprague was between
them with mason getting to his feet both
of you sit down mason he turned to
thebes and you ive agreed to take
you thebes but youre not running the
show any more violence and youll stay
behind if it means all of us go back to
accra

  sure doc thebes kept opening and
closing his right hand looking at skinned
and bleeding knuckles mind spotting
me a smear of sulfa this is a hell of a
country for infection almost as bad as
	jungle

aggamba he looked over at mason
know why i did that of course you do
because you were getting too close to the
truth and nobody likes to be made out a
heel

  especially when he is one

ill

the road was not surfaced beyond
borkovo it was reddish-brown dirt
and as rain fell it became slick and deep
by the second noon the car stood hub-
deep and hopeless

  they left it mired there and walked fol-
lowing a bush-track that tunnelled through
jungle and at last terminated at a planta-
tion where cacao trees were planted in
straight rows beneath protecting silk-cot-
tons

  the plantations negro operator directed
them to a village of soggy thatch huts
standing on a shoulder of ground over-
looking the river

  it was evening and smoke from damp
cookfires pressed low and blue even the
arrival of four white men and boleh-kah
with his strange tribal markings brought
inhabitants only as far as their doorways

  a pound note slipped between the knees
of a nass-how-wee fetisher brought forth
a crew of boys and one of the long canoes
of bombax wood that lay half swamped
from rain at the edge of the river

  they returned to pick up the more val-
uable pieces from the bogged-down recon
car then pointed upstream through alter-
nate deluge and sun

  for hours as the native canoe boys sang
in monotonous rhythm dr sprague ques-
tioned thebes about voodoo and little by
little succeeded in breaking through the
protective reticence of the man until he
talked at length alternately scoffing and
serious telling of fantastic rites of human
sacrifice cannibalism and the strange un-
known depths of the subconscious mind
that was tapped by hypnotism and faith
in the black arts

  you sound like you believed in all
that mason said barely smiling as he
broke a silence maintained toward thebes
for three days

  i believe what i see

  even that about the soul-less dead who
walk around with the warmth of life

stories

breathed through their nostrils by a witch

doctor

  ive never seen that

  but if you did see it youd believe it
wouldnt you

  no i dont suppose i would it de-
stroys your self respect as a white man to
believe such things and in this country
when a white man loses his self respect
its up to another white man to kill him
he gestured around including sprague
and leskawitz and you too you scien-
tists talk about facts about learning the
truth thats a pious lie that you try to

make your own selves believe hell-

you have to look at everything in the light
of your own learning if you went back
with an authenticated zombie theyd laugh
you out of the department

  maybe youre right smiled d r
sprague but i dont think theres much
chance of it do you

  with your attitude theres not a chance
in the world

  after four days along a river running
bank-full the jungle unexpectedly opened
along the northern shore there was gent-
ly rising land planted with yams and cas-
sava and beyond the pointed thatch roofs
of a native village

  aggamba thebes asked of the capito
boy

  aggamba the black answered in an
awed tone

  like mecca to the moslems aggamba
was the capital of that intricate and mys-
terious african religion called variously
voodoo tovodoun and fetisher
but aside from its reputation first glance
revealed nothing unusual about it there
were two rows of palm-thatched huts one
on each side of a footpath so ancient it
had been worn down till it formed a gen-
tlesided depression several feet lower than
the surrounding land from the village
just over the tops of feathery bamboo and
heavy leafed banana could be seen the
boxwood steeple of a mission a bush
track wound down a gentle slope to the
left and ended again at the river where
some white mans houses were built on
stilts to raise them a few feet above the
dark hot miasma of vast rainy season
overflow

  the resthouse must be down there
thebes said
kraal of the walking dead



  natives had gathered around them jab-
bering a half-intelligible variety of fanti
men and women wore rags of calico as
loin cloths pot-bellied children sported
considerable fingers of umbilical cord
showing that the g-cs celebrated native
improvement program had not extended
so far as to furnish skilled midwifery in
aggamba

  thebes pushed his way through the
crowd and walked through mud toward
the two-story veranda-fronted building he
assumed to be the resthouse he was tired
vaguely disturbed

  ach mynheer thebes 

  a fat trader had waddled to the round-
ed front porch of his mud and bamboo
store and stood letting a smile find its
way across the vast folds of his face

  so thebes i have maybe changed
some vanderbosch you remember me
ja

  van i didnt know you were here

the last time-

  in abakaliki before the war nine
-maybe ten years he watched thebes
climb the off-angle steps they shook
hands ja ten years wiser ten years
fatter ten years closer to death so come
in and bring your white friends mit
schnapps good english schnapps i
have vanderbosch the trader of sixpence
machete knives serves good schnappsi
the whiskey was only fair but it seem-
ed good after the long damp to sit be-
neath a roof to stretch the feet and
smoke a dry cigarette

  after a couple drinks around sprague
led his two men away to examine the run-
down resthouse leaving thebes alone with
the dutchman

  men of science asked vanderbosch
watching them descend the porch steps
they perhaps examine soil to see maybe
about planting some new variety of cacao
tree 

  thebes shook his head

  theyre ethnologists they study man
and how the hell he got that way speci-
fically in this case-voodoo

  the tovodoun

  yeh

  perhaps they have heard stories about
our walking dead

  they dont believe in it if thats what
you mean

f ta vanderbosch leaned forward his
j veight creaking the rattan chair his
knees were bent making his legs look
short like the legs of a toad with his fat
belly above by daylight and with good
schnapps then you do not believe but by
night that is different thing eh thebes
when the eye cannot see then the mind
takes over the black caves of the mind
ja i have seen the dead walk by night
so have we all but by daylight how many

have seen this thing you-no but

i thebes i have seen it so much for
that it is not good that white men should
talk of the black gods when seldom they
meet we must laugh at these things for
that is the last thing that saves us from
being natives ourselves you are smart
thebes smart enough to know that these
ethnologists are fools that nothing matters
what is held in glass or jingle in pocket
or take to bed why are you here mit
these diggers

  im a guide

  vanderbosch jerked his head

  but id just as soon youd call me
professor thebes

  so vanderbosch poured two more
drinks i am not man who asks questions
i am only old-time friend happy to pour
schnapps i will not tell george clifton-
anything

    thebes jolted back looking in the
mans eyes he was laughing shaking
his wattles

  how did you know it was clifton i
was thinking of thebes asked

i am not dull mynheer you are not
first white man who come and find out
about clifton no there was portuguese
i forget his name thin mit hawk nose
stantina

  ja stantina

  clifton killed him didnt he
  vanderbosch lifted his hands and let

them fall he was a fool he came--

so he tell me everyone i am stantina
i am mit big mahogany firm i perhaps

cut mahogany here and so he is-

gone tell me are you perhaps acquaint-
ed mit george clifton

  i have known him for a long time
long long time

  before aggamba

  long before aggamba in nigeria i
know him there and dahomey i tell
	jungle

you if ever was man mit body of gentle-
man and soul of swine that man is george
clifton so you must be careful the
knife in the back the poison in the food
the cobra in bed these things you must
think of vanderbosch leaned across the
table and pressed a thick forefinger against
the walther automatic concealed in the
shoulder-grab beneath thebes coat ja
always the gun you are old thebes yet
i have heaid the motto of your country

how you say it-shoot first and talk

afterward perhaps you should shoot this
clifton and look afterward at mahogany
riches

  well see thebes said dryly the
schnapps didnt seem to have had the
least effect on him his face was as ex-
pressionless as ever he let the long cig-
arette dangle in his lips blue smoke string-
ing up past his eyes van what were
you saying about the walking dead

  so you are interested in tovodoun af-
ter all

  i just wanted to give the boys a lead
the husky fellow is a little unpleasant but
doc and the yellow-haired kid are all
right

  ja so will i tell you if you say noth-
ing about hearing it from mine lips
thebes gestured him to go on

  clifton he is great man hewill in-
vite you to his house-

  i was talking about the tovodoun
wait so am i talking of it clifton
i say-he has big fine house mit furni-
ture from england you will see it while
tasting first the food to make sure there
is no poison you will look around and see
his house mynheer and there too will
you see a man or what was once a man
thebes waited rain had started again
making a hissing sound as it fell on the
thatch roof it found its way through the
thatch in several places and thudded to
the floor mats forming puddles that lazily
oozed away

  from nearby came the sound of ham-
mering as sprague and the others repaired
something in the resthouse

  ja there will you see mengbattu the
girot mengbattu who never dances at the
voodoo fire mengbattu who no native will
touch cliftons slave a slave who will
never leave him until clifton does and then
will stop breathing with him i tell you

stories

this because mengbattu has been dead
these twenty years

  thebes barely smiled and seeing him
vanderbosch hurried to defend his state-
ment

  hear me twenty years ago this girot
named mengbattu was hanged for killing
an english officer at yakuba nigeria by

the neck and he was dead dead-they

hauled him through the native village and
dead they buried him dead and six feet
underground mynheer only that night
the ground was disturbed and there were
stories through the native village that the
priest of the black fetish had dug the
body up during the night and carried it to
a hut there to breathe through his nostrils
and conjure life mitout soul into him un-
derstand i was not there in yakuba but
it was told me by kare everwijn a man
of god a holy missionary so for two
nights days all the time boomed voodoo
drums until mynheer commander say we
will open the grave and show them his
body so everybody go home and this
they did but behold me as i sit here
across the table from you drinking

schnapps-the grave was empty ja

and five years later i saw this mengbattu
walking breathing and i thought he
was alive oh-no i say to myself van-
derbosch you should not be the fool this
man lives and then i looked in his eyes
his eyes mynheer gott his eyes flat
dead looking at me through dust of his
grave

  the effort had spent the trader sweat
streaked down his cheeks so they glisten-
ed in the light which struck obliquely from
outside he lifted the schnapps bottle it
had been half full to start with and now
it was empty he hurled it it struck a
hardwood pillar shattering spinning jag-
ged pieces of glass across the dirt-clotted
mattings

  you think i am crazy mit quinine

  no van youre not crazy

  vanderbosch exhaled everything seem-
ed burned out of him now he reached
and slapped palm on table a moment
later there was a jingle of ankle links and
an old houseboy with white woolly hair
entered drawing the cork from a fresh
bottle

  it was like yesterday mynheer i see
it his eyes you stay a while jaf you
kraal of the

sit mit me an talk these native even
my own black boys sometimes there is
something far back in their eyes and i
fear them sometimes i wake up late
dark i sit up and then i look back at
bed for fear i am dead mynheer i am
not afraid to die but i fear to be like
mengbattu the girot you know what i
am talking about

  thebes nodded

  hear me if you are near when i die
i would want my body burned he pour-
ed schnapps resting the elbow to keep
his hand from shaking he lifted the glass
and something like a smile touched his
heavy lips i would perhaps burn good
mynheer

the rest house was a dilapidat-
ed two story building slithering with
house-ghekkos and thatch snakes it had
been built twenty-odd years before when
aggamba had seemed like the logical term-
inus for the huni valley railroad but the
powers of cocoa and mining had decided
otherwise and so the big new resthouse
was left to the encroaching jungle

  the two rooms used when the district
commissioner made his twice-yearly visits
were in fair repair and with bronze
screening and other supplies found at van-
derboschs store a couple other rooms
were made fit for habitation

  late in the next afternoon reverend
heggrie waded down through mud from
the methodist mission with a barefoot
akem convert holding an oiled silk para-
sol

  heggrie was an ample man fifty with
the voice of a minister but with the self-
righteousness which is the blight of his
profession softened by his twenty-five years
in savage country where he had to be
thankful for what white company came his
way

  heggrie invited them to dinner and
they returned with him through drizzle to
his sheet-metal-covered dwelling inside the
mission compound mrsheggrie a sallow
woman in a black dress greeted them in
the front room where a petrol lamp was
already burning

  dinner was delayed as darkness settled
heggrie kept glancing at his watch shak-

walking dead	

ing it to make sure the fungus had not
corroded its fine gears finally he explain-
ed

  i was waiting hoping my ward would
come along but she seems to have been
detained

  your ward asked thebes

  willa poor dr quilters daughter
weve cared for her since he died

  she teaches at the mission school i
suppose 

  no he said bitterly so-called bush
schools are no longer encouraged by the
colonial government

  a stormy thick darkness had crept in
from the jungle and with it came the
strong odor of fires burning damp grass
tom-toms commenced muttering muffled
by rain by degrees the tom-toms grew
louder asserting themselves

  week of the rain fetish reverend
heggrie remarked then he smiled with
a tinge of embarrassment you see ive
come to know the native religion almost
as well as my own

  how are the words of israel competing
with the fetishes these days  thebes ask-
ed

  instead of answering directly heggrie
said the fetish religion has held the
souls of these poor people in bondage for
thousands of years you shouldnt expect
too much of a missionary in one lifetime
those drums arent coming from the
village

  no from the fetish town you take
a footpath through the bush two or three
miles drums can be heard easily over
that distance

mrs heggrie spoke in an unexpectedly
loud voice if they would only send us a
bell that was louder than those drums
yes smiled heggrie mother and
her bell

  ever since i came ive tried to get
them to send a bell so loud it would drown
out the drums then i would ring it ev-
ery night as long as their drums beat
she had a habit of staring a few inches
over a persons head when she talked
quinine did things to a man and more
things to a woman after ten or fifteen
years in that rotten climate

  is it safe to go over there sprague
asked

  eh heggrie snapped his watch shut
	jungle

and put it away oh i think so ive
been there several years ago-to see one
of my converts who had fallen into a fit
they accept christ you know but they
keep sneaking back to consult the vo just
the same one of my boys ran here and
said this fellow his name was ikoro had
fallen into a trance at the sagbata fetish
hut

  he paused drawing in his breath

  of course i went over

  did you get to see him

- oh yes i saw him but it did no
good he was in a trance and there was
nothing i could do to awaken him so i
had to come back

  what kind of reception did the priests
give you

  heggrie seemed to be listening for some-
thing eh oh yes-the priests they

acted like i wasnt even there like i was
invisible i asked questions and they
wouldnt answer nor look at me very pe-
culiar i never went back

  they finally sat down to dinner without
willa quilter the meal consisted of
chicken prepared after the arabian man-
ner yellow with saffron a rather hard and
fibrous bread of pounded cassava a pa-
paya and banana salad drenched with avo-
cado oil that had a fermented taste and
as a special treat canned potatoes fried 
in palm oil

  afterward the boy came with cups of
coffee prepared from extract and quite
cold

  a loose board thumped on the porch
and the door opened

  a lean-faced man of thirty-five or forty
paused just inside holding the door open
for the girl who followed him

  heggrie hurried across the room clif-
ton  thank god shes with you

  it was quite all right clifton said in
a well-modulated british voice quite
all right old top she was caught in a bit
of rain that was all and had stopped un-
der the verandah down by the resthouse

i came along there to visit the americans
and found her so we toddled along as
soon as the wet eased off

  his voice had a cold quality

  cliftons back was turned and he hung
up his waterproofs as he talked the girl
had moved into the circle of light from
the petrol lamp

stories

she was in her late teens or maybe
twenty her flushed loveliness was
not at all what one expected in a country
where european women became drab her
eyes were dark with flecks of rust that
gave them color the brownness of her
skin came only partially from sun she
was shorter than average slim waisted
with womanly breasts like a young gypsys
that her plain clothes tended to accentuate
rather than conceal she was really a
beautiful girl

  thebes smiled a tiny bit and without
taking his eyes off her lifted his cup of
bitter coffee

  she was looking at him lips parted
showing the tips of her teeth then mov-
ing with what amounted to a toss of her
head she turned to look at heggrie who
was talking to her

  my dear you know very well how we
worry about you why do you go away
like this with the dark coming on you
know its not safe   

  she had stopped listening so heggrie
let his sentence trail away clifton walk-
ed across looking from one mans face to
the next

  he was not bad looking though his
face was too long his age showed around
his mouth and at the outer corners of his
eyes otherwise one might have supposed
him to be thirty rather than forty he was
thin about five feet eleven his skin turned
deep reddish brown by many years of the
tropics vanderbosch had described him
as one possessing the body of a gentleman
and the soul of a swine but such a thing
was hard to believe after once meeting his
eyes

  i dare say youre the american chaps
he said

  reverend heggrie introduced them and
clifton shook hands around he mention-
ed the fact that he was a mahogany con-
cessioner with a place up the river he
spoke with good accent but one that was
cultivated rather than natural for now
and then some brassy twist of a word
would creep in indicating his yorkshire
origin

  he then accepted mrs heggries invi-
tation and sat down at table across from
the girl

  so youre yankee scientists agrono-
mists i suppose
kraal of the walking dead



  ethnologists sprague answered the
voodoo

  oh i say clifton laid dowq the bit
of hard cassava bread he had been spread-
ing with honey oh i say

you sound alarmed sprague smiled
he jerked his head indicating the drums
you think the fetishers are dangerous
inherently my dear fellow not de-
liberately do you get my meaning

  i think i do you believe theres some
chance of our getting ourselves included
among the human sacrifices

  mason laughed in his stevedore voice
but clifton did not even smile

  exactly he said returning to the
honey

  if we only had a bell mrs heggrie
said clang clang a bell that would
drown out those heathen drums

  clifton said i told you last week that
on my next trip to takoradai i would or-
der a bell the biggest most brazen bell
in all london

  everyone smiled except mrs heggrie
her eyes were closed her face a sallow
mask and her thin body weaved back and
forth imagining the sound of her bell
clanging christian defiance at the voodoo

  willa kept moving her eager eyes
around the room looking atthe newcom-
ers and always her eyes came back to
rest on thebes the most unhandsome of
the lot as though the craggy cruelty of his
face fascinated her

  after an hour while talk jumped from
one subject to another clifton stood up
to go

  youll be here through the rains and
probably longer he said to sprague i
dare say a project such as yours will take
considerable time the point is we might
as well take time to get acquainted id
like to have you visit me tomorrow ill
send a launch down just after siesta din-
ner and a few whiskies reverend i want
you and your family of course right-o 
clifton looked at the girl good night
willa he only smiled when she did not
seem to hear him

  willa cried reverend heggrie wil-
la your guest

  oh im sorry she stood swinging
her dark hair in coils around her shoul-
ders i wasnt listening

  good night clifton said

after he was gone handsome young
leskawitz struck up a conversation
with the girl he turned on the wireless
bringing a dakar jazz-band over oceans
of tropical static the two danced leska-
witz taking time to show her one of the
current steps

  she was a pliant dancer swinging eas-
ily with the movements of his body fol-
lowing with feline ease although it was
probable she had never danced before in
all her life she moved apparently with-
out thinking watching over his shoulder
her dark eyes on thebes who sat rocked
back in a hardwood chair the inevitable
tangier cigarette between his lips

  you must have it said mason in his
sour manner

cassanova was no pretty boy either
unexpectedly willa spun away from
leskawitz leaving him in empty-armed
surprise and walked softly in rope-soled
slippers to thebes

  im willa quilter i dont think
youve spoken to me

  thebes let his chair bang forward he
didnt bother to get up but he did remove
the cigarette from his lips

  how do you do miss quilter

ive never smelled cigarettes like those
thebes drew the pack from his shirt
pocket it was a red package with yellow
lettering in arabic done in the thin-runny
ink common to african lithography

  she took one of the cigarettes and bent
over to let thebes light it

  willa reverend heggrie strode
across the room

  she turned and faced him the cigarette
looking out of place in her full young
lips

  whats on your mind girl

  when she made no move to discard the
cigarette he seized it from her lips started
to hurl it down then thought better of it
and crushed the coal in an ash tray

  you shouldnt have given it to her
he said to thebes

   thebes laughed with a single jerk of his
shoulders theres a saying they have

over in f m s-beware the tamed

tigress who first beholds her face in a
mirror

  and you think that applies 

   if i didnt i wouldnt have repeated
it
	jungle

  im asking no advice in bringing up
my ward

  all right

  willas lips were twisted down half
pouting half defiant she started to say
something and heggrie turned on her i
believe its time for you to go to your
room

  the girl had a way of languid brooding
thoughtfulness not affected it was na-
tural to her she was not all european-
-there was a strain of arabian or anoth-
er of the asiatic bloods in her she climb-
ed a set of mahogany steps to the second
story

  im sorry heggrie spoke to thebes
really i know it was nothing you did

its just that willa- and that remark

of yours about the tamed tigress it was

somehow-so deft accidental of

course it unnerved me you dont under-
stand about willa professor thebes

  there was silence filled with machine-
gun blasts of static from the wireless and
above it the inevitable thum thwm ta-ta-
thum of tom-toms still by the table mrs
heggrie lifted her eyes and spoke

  he said he would buy me a bell a
brass bell i could drown them out if i
had a bell

v

a towering forest of bombax
and mahogany arched the river be-
yond aggamba shutting the village from
sight before the launch was a quarter-mile
upstream it was only a short trip to clif-
tons concession but the light of afternoon
was fading in dull rainy-season clouds by
the time they got there the akim boat-
boy laid the launch against the dock of
heavy african teak and hopped over the
side to make fast a tall black who looked
to be senegalese prowled into sight with
a semi-automatic rifle over his arm and
watched with professional suspicion as the
passengers came ashore there were rev-
erend and mrs heggrie willa the three
scientists and thebes

  a path of fresh-painted cobbles led be-
tween straight rows of fan palms to a
white plantation house a capito houseboy
in white jacket shorts and topi saluted
them and opened the front door showing
them inside the house was big and ap-

st okies

parently unplanned an assortment of large
and small rooms furnished with a hodge-
podge of things european and african

  clifton in crisp blue-white linen came
down the stairs to meet them darkness
was then coming rapidly so he called a
boy to light the petrol lamps

  clifton was saying i have an a-c plant
at the mill but ive never brought power
up here i havent a wireless either i
suppose if such things appealed to me id
never have chosen to live here in the first
place

  table was set in the diningroom glass-
es scotch and bottled water stood on a
chinese laquer sideboard clifton poured
whiskey to all except heggrie and the wo-
men whom he served first with plain soda
after a couple of drinks they sat down
to table while boys carried platters around
serving after the manner of dutch reistafel

  dinner had reached the port wine stage
when a jingle of copper bracelets sound-
ed and a heavy shouldered native entered

  he was a slow-moving man with a
blunt dull face dressed in khaki shirt and
shorts he must have carried ten pounds
of copper distributed on wrists neck and
ankles

  he paused at cliftons right arm wait-
ing for the master to finish his wine clif-
ton did this slowly touched his lips with
a napkin and signaled without turning

  willa quilter was seated at cliftons
right colorhad sunk from her face as
she looked up and saw the native there
he leaned to say something close to clif-
tons ear and the movement accidentally
brought the soot-black skin of one elbow
against her bare arm

  touch of him snapped her momentary
paralysis she sprang to her feet recoil-
ing a scream tearing at her throat

  the black man moved away not start-
led hardly looking at her in the momen-
tary interval of startled silence following
her scream one could hear the clank of his
bracelets

  willa had moved around her chair
with an obvious effort she pulled her
eyes away from him she rubbed the
place on her arm where his elbow had
touched

  clifton got hold of her

  girl whats the matter 

  she recovered herself quickly and spoke
kraal of the

walking dead



i dont know he touched me i didnt

expect-

  certainly you were just startled i
shouldnt let a black come in dressed like
a zulu after heads he turned to the
black mengbattu

  thebes moved forward with an involun-
tary jolt at sound of the natives name
he looked intently trying to glimpse his
eyes the petrol lamps were old-fashioned
wick burners and their reddish light fell
uncertainly on his face

  clifton asked the native what he want-
ed and was answered in a mumbling da-
homey dialect as he backed away he
found a doorway without feeling disap-
peared leaving the strung bamboo drapes
swinging behind him

sorry he frightened you my dear

  it wasnt anything i just didnt ex-
pect   

  thebes drew a cigarette from his pock-
et he did it with deliberation placing it
between his lips lighting it he took the
match away and it trembled slightly he
blew it out and looked up to see cliftons
eyes on him

  reverend heggrie got hold of willas
shoulder and said sternly youll have to
get hold of yourself my dear

  leave me alone she pulled herself
away from him you act as though it
were somethings-awful just for a per-
son to be startled

  heggrie watched her walk to the side-
board she twisted the metal cap from
the whiskey bottle and poured out a ter-
rific slug she stared at heggrie defiantly
and downed it in four big gulps after
several desperate gasps she managed to
get her breath

  vvilla heggrie thundered

  oh i say old man clifton pulled
him around let her go i know your
feelings about liquor but theres a time
when it comes in handy you know
willa was watching heggrie the whis-
key had steadied her apparently meng-
battu was forgotten she said

  im tired of you shouting at me all
the time trying to tell me every move to
make

now willa said clifton gently
im tired of it he wants to keep
me locked up inside that dreary mission
compound he didnt even want to bring

me here tonight and do you know why
because i might meet somebody he doesnt
approve of he wants me to wait until
the right man comes along some good
steady english man he thinks i should
sit inside and take quinine but never
even listen to the dance bands on the
wireless

  she stopped she poured a second
drink gulped it heggrie started to re-
monstrate but clifton shook his head

  nothing like a bit of excitement to
settle the digestion i was going to serve
brandy but willa seems to have over-
ruled me better toddle over with that
bottle you wouldnt want to drink it all
away from us

fter a whisky clifton paused
beside thebes and said youve
been giving too much credence to the sto-
ries that dutch swine at the trading post
must have told you believe me theres
nothing unusual about myself and my ser-
vants mengbattu is most certainly alive

  how do you know that mynheer van-
derbosch told me

  he tells everyone about mengbattu
jealousy he used to be sort of a partner
of mine maybe id have been the same
way if hed grown wealthy while i was
rotting my life away in a jungle trade-
store

  somewhere in the big plantation house
a woman was singing pronouncing words
in the berber tongue accompanying her-
self on a two-string lute her voice was
husky but melodious and it moved easily
touching the unexpected minors that seem
like discords to an ear unused to listening
to music of oriental origin vanderbosch
had said something about cliftons con-
cubine a berber woman purchased from
one of the slave caravans that still after
fifty years of french rule run from tom-
bouctou to ghazal a woman named
t uema

  willa was unnaturally flushed from the
whiskey she kept watching thebes try-
ing to catch his eyes finally she strol-
led to the adjoining sitting room she
could be seen in the halflight beyond an
arch turning the crank of an old grama-
phone she put the needle down and
opened the gramaphone doors to let out
a shallow treble sound some jazz band

kraal of the

of another era playing dardanella

  my god said sprague that takes
me back to my youth

  everyone laughed except heggrie
willa why do you have to do these
things 

  she went past him dancing tip-toe one
of the steps leskawitz had taught her the
night before and continued across the
room until she was near thebes

  dont you know how to dance she
asked him

  its not one of my accomplishments

  ill teach you

  he stood with one elbow resting shoul-
der-high on an okume sideboard cigarette
between his fingers eyes meeting hers

  youd better take a couple more les-
sons yourself

  all right i will

  she turned away giving her head a
toss her hair had gloss and life and the
movement gave it a swing as though it
were weighted by spun metal

  teach me she said to leskawitz

  he hesitated looking helplessly over at
sprague he knew everyone was watch-
ing him and it was embarrassing to be
second choice to thebes

  he put out his cigarette turned he
seemed surprised how quickly the girl
was in his arms how firmly she moved
against him

  heggrie spoke her name again and
started across clifton seized his arm
swinging him around

  oh i say old fellow a girl has to have
her day to kick over the traces maybe
a whiskey would do you a bit of good
what

  no thank you

  the phonograph was spinning too fast
making the piece hard to keep up with
it came to an end and the two left the
room together in a little while the
strains of taxi came with an engaging
forgotten lilt

  sprague said do you realize i was a
student in stanford when that was po-
pular 

  the phonograph spun its way to the
end and struck the discard groove with
a sandpaper effect and went on until clif-
ton walked through the arch to turn it off
he looked around for willa and leska-
witz with muscles showing hard at the

walking dead	

sides of his lean jaw when he saw they
had disappeared

  gone asked heggrie edgily

  clifton nodded a smile barely break-
ing the hard lines of his face now that
the phonograph had stopped they could
once again hear the berber woman and
her lute she made the jazz sound thin
and futile unexpectedly heggrie took
the glass of whiskey clifton was offering
him and drank it down with the dramatic
flare of a ham actor making dr faustus
compact with the devil

  he banged down the empty glass faced
clifton man how can you stand there
and let her show herself you know

very well-ive done my best she

shouldnt be out around-

  its quite all right inside the com-
pound youre worrying too much
after the manner of polite men neither
sprague nor mason acted as though they
heard this obviously private exchange
but thebes made no pretense at polite-
ness he looked at heggrie with a
thoughtful half-smile as he rubbed a
cigarette between the palms of his hands
loosening the hard-packed tobacco

  bangh asked clifton shoving over
a flat tin box

  it was not bangh but a derivative
brownish hastish paste thebes made a
tiny ball removed a half-inch of shredded
tobacco from the end of the cigarette
mixed in the paste reinserted it

  try a pinch he asked sprague

  in the name of science sprague
answered cheerfully no rule against
mixing it in a pipe

  its your pipe clfton smiled

  the same as marijuana isnt it mas-
son asked and thebes nodded

the resinous extract of hemp
mixed with alcohol and  just a little
crude opium laid a pungent odor across
the room it was the opium one smelled
more than anything

  heggrie walked away-stood listen-
ing he turned suddenly noticing the
odor

that stuff will kill a white man
sprague answered on the contrary
no one has ever proved that these de-
pressants dont help a man live longer
i cant think of a better prescription for
	jungle

thrice-weekly visits to a good old-fash-
ioned opium den

  no one spoke for a while rain had
stopped and the damp air cool with even-
ing rustled the bamboo jalousies even
the berber woman had stopped singing
from the far distance came a thud-thud
of drums

  professor thebes heggrie said un-
expectedly she seems to have taken
a fancy to you oh i know its none of
your fault but she has id rather she
wasnt outside shell listen to you
would you mind that is just see she
doesnt wander far

  not at all thebes said grinding
out his cigarette

  cliftons jaw muscles had tightened up
again but there was no other visible anger
on his long british face

  thebes walked through the sitting room
to the picinnin room where the cloaks
were hung he looked for his oil silk
rain hood it was gone he stepped on
to the darkness of the lower verandah
now and then a big drop of oozing wet
gathering and growing fat on a bamboo
rafter pole thudded to the floor huts
of native workers made pointed outlines
against the night sky aside from those
there was only the jungle darkness pres-
sing in across the little clearing

  he walked around the verandah a
sort of patio had been built on that side
-flagstones with frangapani and dwarf
ylang-ylang growing in wooden tubs on-
set of the rains had brought racimes of
bloom to the ylang-ylang and the frag-
rance hung sharp and unsatisfying re-
minding a man of other nights across the
great bulge of the world in fms of
brown women under the kanari trees and
things a man would like to live over a
little differently

  he caught movement willa and les-
kawitz they were just standing talking
quietly the girl turned catching sight
of thebes

  instantly she was in against leskawitz
arms around his neck

  kiss me she whispered

  thebes laughed and walked away

  you didnt see them heggrie
asked when thebes re-entered the room

  theyre out on the patio

  dr mason and clifton had left the

stories

room dr sprague the hashish gone
from his pipe stood with eyes half closed
analyzing the effect of the drug as it laid
hold of his nervous system

  another smoke asked thebes

  no thank you i only hope it hasnt
ruined my pipe

  i was on a pearler once off the malay
archipelago working some reserve shell
when a limey gunboat sighted us and we
had to lie low in a jungle lagoon every
time the wind and tide were right that
gunboat would come sniffing around so
we had to stay there the better part of a
month we had a saigonese diver abroad
who was a three-pipe chandu smoker and
he made out for a week by pounding up
three old bamboo pipes and smoking the
pulp that shows how the volatile stuff
impregnates a piece of wood-

  how did you get out asked spra-
gue putting the pipe away past the
gunboat 

  thebes shrugged im here

  rain was falling again with a soft
patter

  thebes asked wheres clifton and the
doctor 

  up in cliftons room he had a bit
of gold-quartz mason used to work-
sprague stopped he listened

  what was it thebes asked
nothing i guess i was saying that
mason used to work with the geological

survey- 

  the mosquito door slapped shut and
footsteps approached running it was
willa she stopped in the archway she
was ivory-pale her lips were open and
she was trying to say something sud-
denly the words came

  he just fell he didnt say anything
  who cried sprague

  she didnt answer she was staring
up the stairs at clifton who had appeared
with dr mason standing back of him

  was it leskawitz shouted sprague
he seized her shoulders shook her
answer me

  yes she whispered

clifton walked outside around the
verandah the patio with flag-
stones glistening from rain was partially
lighted from a side window he could see
a mans feet and legs
kraal of the

  the toes were crippled

  thebes stood quite still walther auto-
matic in his hand he went across the
wet stones dropped to one knee leska-
witz lay quite still face down only the
curly blonde top of his head visible among
the folds of the rain cape he had bor-
rowed

  a heavy machete had been driven just
beneath his left shoulderblade he must
have died instantly

  feet made irregular sounds on the ver-
andah floor as they hurried from inside
whos that mason cried

  me thebes said standing up

  what are you doing there

  he was inside with me when it hap-
pened sprague muttered in a tight voice
pushing past mason down the steps 
dead thebes told him

 good god there was nothing
sprague could do he tried to pull the
machete free it took all his strength
the machete was a big-bladed weapon
native- fabricated from a spring leaf its
horn handle riveted on with cooper it
had been driven with considerable force
for its blade had entered at an off-angle
with the ribs and must have shattered a
couple of them

  my god sprague kept breathing
my god   

  they carried leskawitz inside

  tell just what happened clifton said
gently to willa

  we were just standing there and-
thebes broke in he was kissing you
and youd been at it for quite a while
yes

  let her tell it clifton said

then i heard something the sound
of-that she looked at the machete
i didnt see anyone i ran inside 
clifton said the machete was thrown
thebes which way was he facing 
that way she indicated the front
of the house

  clifton he must have been standing
among the frangapanis

  mason had been on one knee beside
poor leskawitz he stood there was
a bit of thickening blood on one forefinger
he pointed at the oil-silk hood

  thats your hood isnt it thebes
  yes

  then its obvious to me why he was

walking dead	

murdered one of your enemies came
and mistook him for you

  the muscles of masons shoulders had
thickened and anger twitched at the cor-
ners of his mouth

  clifton asked what enemies could
professor thebes have

  professor be damned that mans

no professor-

  mason sprague cried this isnt
doing any good

  oh the hell with it id never have
played along with his scheme in the first
place and that kid wouldnt be lying
dead

  thats enough mason

  mason clamped his mouth shut clif-
ton keeping the background barely smiled
as he looked at thebes

  mrs heggrie was speaking she had
been speaking for some time but no one
had been listening her voice now droned
monotonously across the room

      a person should never go
outside after night when the drums are
playing the drums can lay the curse
of antichrist i wish they would send us
a bell they couldnt play their drums
with the bell of god ringing in their
ears

vi

leskawitz was buried next morn-
ing in the little white-fenced mission
cemetery later the sun came on clear
and hot raising steam from earth and
thatched roofs cooling the interior of the
resthouse

  thebes sat on the upper verandah until
vanderbosch showed himself after siesta

  mynheer thebes the dutch tra-
der smiled through the folds of his face
when he saw thebes coming so i have
hear it one of your scientist friends he
is dead already the voodoo darkness
it is not good for bondele

  what do you make of it van
ho what should i make of it you
see jungle growing there bib dark
when i come to aggamba it was millet
field he waved futile fat fingers
life in the jungle it is like fever so
today they bury him next month he is
gone mit even his bones like chalk to
crush in fingers ja death life every-
	jungle

thing spins fast so today you die to-
morrow your blood makes green in grow-
ing tree leaf

  whod want to put a knife through
leskawitz 

  you heard drums last night they

beat black rhythm-like-so in bed i

hear them and i know it was not good
perhaps he was killed by no man
mynheer

  you mean clifton had mengbattu do
it

  ja mengbattu you saw him the-
bes when knife come you perhaps then
could see soulless girot and what but
strong man like mengbattu could drive
knife sidewise through ribs he pee-
red at thebes with little shrewd eyes
you think it strange vanderbosch knows
mitout being there i have ways of learn-
ing ja

  now will we have schnapps

  sprague was waiting when thebes went
back

  what did vanderbosch think he
asked

  thebes shrugged what can you ex-
pect of a man who wants his body cre-
mated so the black fetishers cant make
a zombie of him

  he believes that

  sure and dont fool yourself about
van he used to be level-headed a big
rosy cheeked dutchman strong as a
clydesdale horse and just as stable ment-
ally well all be ordering ourselves brass
bells before this country is through with
us

  they both fell silent watching the ap-
proach of a half-dozen men from the
native village

  the onaheme said thebes head-
man hell probably want to chase you
downstream

  what should i tell him

  tell him to go to hell

  zandi-tschai was a chocolate-brown
native portly and erect walking and he
wore white mans pants as befitted the
oneheme who received a letter once each
year from the governor himself he came
bare foot down the muddy path with two
guards leading the way and a servant
holding an umbrella over his head he
left his men and the umbrella on the
lower verandah and went to spragues

stories

room where he was regaled with cigars
and blue beads

 what did he say thebes asked
when he left

 you were right he wants me to
light out for the downriver the voodoo
he says should not be disturbed else we
will have plague flood fire and the yams
will rot in the ground but i told him
to go to hell diplomatically of course
with cigars

the voodoo village looked
drab and miserable by the light of
gray mid-morning rain stood in gray-
ish puddles across the central grounds
with the huts of mud thatch and laced
bamboo forming a rough circle around
none of the huts were very large none
of them deserved being called a temple
some were dome-shaped affairs one learns
to associate with the fetish beliefs others
were shaped outlandishly one was writh-
ing and tunnel-like made to symbolize
danah the snake fetish others composite
heaps of mud and palm-thatched represen-
ted sabata -the smallpox nesshue

-the river and many more

  three natives naked save for loin cloths
stood beneath a rain-heavy bombax tree
watching the approach of thebes dr
sprague and dr mason they showed
neither alarm nor surprise just passive
curiosity it was evident that whites
violated no taboo by going there

  thebes spoke using the common tshi
dialect and after a momentary hesitation
one of the natives walked forward mud
oozing between bare toes pronouncing
words of the krobo district sprague
broke in speaking fluently asking for the
chief fetisher

  the native pointed with an elongated
lower lip indicating one of the smaller
huts

  the hut had a long roofed-over ent-
rance of ant-mound mud plastered over
straw the mud had hardened to some-
thing resembling concrete during the dry
season but is was now slowly absorbing
water and washing out leaving grayish
palm fronds and grass blades exposed

  the entrance was repulsive with the
stench of purification heavy shadow
lay at the far end thebes groped and
lifted a drape of antelope skin a dome-
kraal of the walking dead



like room was visible in light from a
smokehole in the roof

  a negro dressed only in a bark-cloth
loinpiece sat crosslegged on a heap of palm
mats watching he was well built by
grayish light his skin had the slaty black
look of unfermented cacao beans he
gestured and surprised them by speaking
english

  come i know you come to see houssa
ever since you leave resthouse

  you knew we were coming sprague
showed amazement to flatter him i
heard no message drum

  houssa have drum here he tapped
his breast ever since white men leave
borkovo and before i know they will
visit me every day every night in
canoe i see you approach

  you know all that

  the mind of avodoun is everywhere
and its eyes see through dark and wall of
hut

  mason spoke we had quite a time
that second evening didnt we

  houssa recognized the challenge and
answered sharply green water-snake of
death splash in canoe he pointed to
thebes you shoot

  the boatboys had visited the fetish
town and it would have been easy enough
to have learned the snake episode from
them

  houssa went on borkovo-boys no tell
tovodoun tell

  mason tossed back his head with a
statled look it was like the man reading
his mind houssa grinned the middle
teeth of his upper jaw were filed to points
and turned black from betel nut chewing
round about other things became visible
as a mans eyes grew accustomed to the
dimness overhead on strings of twisted
raffia were clusters of bats wings dried
monkey tails bits of snake and the other
things used as gri-gri charms among the
rest was a black crucifix with a silver
christ on it at houssas knees was a
calibash turned greasy and black from un-
counted years of handling and inside it
was a handful of mottled pebbles at one
side of the calibash pulled to a rough
pyramid was a patchwork robe of monkey
skins bald in spots where the short hair
had fallen out

-jungle-fall

  you answer many questions said
sprague

   the fetisher waited eyes on spragues
face

  i would have you answer me a ques-
tion

  you must make a vo

  sprague handed him a pound note and
houssa smoothed it and slid it inside the
waist of his loin cloth with a little exhal-
ation of satisfaction it was plain to see
that he was used to working for copper
and small silver even from white men

  he slapped his palms and after a min-
utes wait a long-legged native crawled
in through a rear passage carrying a roos-
ter under his arm

  houssa took the bird as it squawked
and flapped its wings lifting dust and
bits of thatch from the floor his fingers
pressed the sides of its head evidently
finding a nerve center for it slowly quiet-
ed and crouched with breast on the ground
houssa taking his time lifted the bird
high feet up and with a quick twist of
his fingers ripped its head off

  blood shot in a sudden stream spatter-
ing the earth between his knees he bent
forward touched his tongue to one of the
final drops and sat back hurling the roos-
ter to a far corner

  houssas eyes were on sprague the
white mans brother was not killed by
avodoun or what white men call voodoo
he was killed by one the white man has
never seen ask the missionary of the
two-stick fetish he knows who it was
killed the white mans young brother

  sprague had not asked the question-
the fetisher had read it in his thoughts
that or he was a phenomenal guesser

  was that your question  thebes ask-
ed

  yes

  who killed him asked mason rising
to one knee like a runner starting a race

houssa did not even answer he
went on speaking to sprague you
travel over the far salt water to learn
about our fa our akovodoun but only
the small spirits walk by daylight at night
-then must you return

  thebes tossed the fetisher a cigarette
and lighted one himself how about bring-
ing mengbattu along
	jungle

  the fetishers fingers closed crushing
the cigarette so its blackish tobacco popped
from the side mengbattu does not dance
at the fire

 why

  ha the wicked witch-doctors of da-
homey  there is a law here ordering
prison for anyone breathing into the nos-
trils of the dead

  then mengbattu is dead

  houssa pretended not to hear he look-
ed at the cigarette and threw away the
broken half he fumbled for a match in
the waist of his loin cloth lighted it in-
haled tell me what is it the old white
woman keep saying about bell

  shell get you when they send her that
bell

  no the drums of tovodoun are long
as the time of man and they beat the
rhythm of the heart they will drive her
bell into the earth

  it was hot with midday when the white
men emerged blinking from the fetish
hut the village looked miserable as be-
fore a native blind from trachoma walk-
ed along the footpath carrying baskets of
cane suspended from the ends of a spring-
pole he kept swinging to and fro feeling
his way by the touch of vine leaves which
hung thick as pythons bodies from the
branches above

  thebes jerked his head to indicate the
fetish house the lads good

  mason snorted nothing there that
cant be explained ive seen better shows
in haiti he went on in a challenging
voice and if you ask me it was prepos-
terous bringing the name of mengbattu
into it you never miss an opportunity to
discredit clifton do you mengbattu is
just as much alive as i am

  that remains to be proved

  not to me

  you said thebes lack a scientific
attitude

  sprague said i think he tripped you
up that time mason if theres a dead
man wandering around this jungle its up
to us to find out about it

  youre joking

  oh am i

  the three men took siesta and went
back to the fetish town as evening settled
through blue throat-biting smoke of thatch
fires to watch a slim black girl of seven-

stories

teen beat into a catalyptic trance by
repetitions of the drums when they left
she was sitting crosslegged on the ground
next to the door of the cobra fetish hut
her eyeballs rolled back inside her skull
her body apparently retaining neither
breath nor pulse she was the ma-deup
of a sprcerers dance

  ive seen the same thing in haiti ma-
son remarked

  sprague ill go you one better i saw
it in louisiana and the ma-deup was a
housemaid in one of the best homes of
new orleans

  the path was utterly black as it wound
through jungle and the men walked slow-
ly half feeling their way sprague paused
when it emerged on the village clearing
a light was still burning at the mission
house

  sprague glanced at his watch one
oclock heggrie must be writing a ser-
mon what do you think about the rev-
erend  suppose he knows more about that
killing than he lets on you remember
what the fetisher said

  hell said mason by the way the-
bes how are you getting on with your
work your spying on clifton

  im not getting on-thanks to you

after you tipping clifton i wasnt a scien-
tist hell be likely to put a bullet between
my shoulders the first move i make

  they had left a candle burning in the
resthouse and it sent strips of reddish
glow through the shutters there was
movement on the verandah boleh-kah
he sat crosslegged letting the white men
walk around him he got up to pad bare-
foot after thebes

  its all right thebes said

vii

boleh-kah stopped in the half dark-
ness watching as they climbed the
stairs thebes paused for a moment be-
fore entering his room he knew by
boleh-kahs mute hand-language that there
was someone inside

 he opened the door the room was
dark peirfume hung in the air there
was movement a whisper of footstep
willa he said

  yes

  he closed the door she was so close
kraal of the

walking dead



 he could feel the warmth of her breath

 he said in a voice that was almost cas-
 ual i noticed a light at the mission

 youre worrying heggrie by running
 around this way

 what do i care he wants to lock me

up to-

 it might be a good idea

 he started to go past her she was clos-
 er than he expected he stopped with the
 feel of her shoulder against his chest

 what the hell do you see in me he
 asked

 take me away please tonight

 youll have to

 the quick insistence of her voice left
 no doubt she was frightened

 he said you can hear through these
 bamboo walls like paper and mason prob-
 ably has his ear glued

 please she held tight to his jacket

 one of the canoes theyll never catch
 us

 where will i take you

 anywhere 

 what is it do you want me or do
 you just want to get away

 both

 he stood still feeling the press of her
 young body smooth beneath her harsh
 white dress

 you will she asked

 all right kid youre not what i came
 here looking for but youll do

 she wanted it so he drew her close and
 kissed her she had an eager strength

 her hair was filled with the odor of rain
 and ginger blossom

 tonight he said all right now

 where are your things

 what

 your clothes you cant go downriver
 like that

 oh she backed from him with the
 air of one awakening ill go back to the
 house

 id better go along

 no i dont want you to she said
 it with a force that surprised him wait
 for me here in front of the resthouse

 she located the door corroded hinges
 whined when it opened she caught her
 breath and started back   

 thebes could see beyond her to the hall

silhouetted against reflected light from the
night-candle downstairs

  he was a native but not negroid
glimpsed by half-light he looked like one
of those magnificent brownfellows from
the islands of polynesia perhaps he was
a fulbe tribesman from the north

  the brownfellow had hold of willas
wrist she drew back and for a few sec-
onds it was tense struggle silent save for
sharp exhalations of breath

  let me go she hissed through her
teeth

  thebes crowded past her to the hall he

could see the man then-young finely

muscled his only clothing consisted of a
green topi flowered silk shorts leather
babooshi

  all right thebes growled let her
go or would you rather have your teeth
for supper

  his words brought the fellow around
he was as tall as thebes beautifully
muscled for a second he seemed to be
backing away instead he was setting him-
self he muttered something in a tongue
thebes did not understand and his right
hand darted fingers flat thumb aimed at
the soft choke-hole of his throat

  thebes weaved a little shifted his feet
and smashed a right to the fellows unpro-
tected jaw

  he backpeddled struck the wall spun
half way around he caught his balance
at the brink of the stairs and started back

  light glimmered from the blade of a
knife it was held edge up waist high

  the knife lashed and thebes could
feel the burn of it along his forearm he
had the brown fellows wrist then ram-
ming the blade down

  the brown fellow was unexpectedly
strong thebes back struck the bamboo
wall and it gave with a sound like a
crushed basket the air was filled with
dust and drifting spiderweb

  the wall gave thebes his balance still
clutching the wrist he bent double went
beneath and came up again whipping the
arm over his back the brown fellow
cried sharply and the knife flipped away

  thebes let go it would have been
simple to just draw the walther and kill
him instead he booted him in the abdo-
men and swung a left-right smashing him
down the stairs

stories

the brown fellow struck on
elbows and the back of his head
turning a complete backward somersault
he came to a crouching position at the
foot of the stairs light from the candle
struck obliquely across his face the cor-
ners of his mouth glistening black from
blood once he had been a handsome devil
but he was not handsome then

  he felt for his knife-a movement of

habit it was gone of course lying on the
mattings at tbebes feet- boleh-kah had
come up in barefoot silence and the brown
fellow didnt see him there was a ma-
chete large as a short-sword in boleh-kahs
hand

  no barked thebes

  the brown fellow spun saw boleh-kah
flung himself aside ran   

  willa thebes said the girl was not
in sight sprague and mason were shout-
ing questions did you see where she
went he asked

  thebes went in his room the screen
was torn out shed escaped that way
thebes stepped from window to verandah
he listened in the vine-shadowed dark-
ness nothing but a flutter of bats in the
corners

  who were you fighting with  sprague
demanded following

  a brown fellow fulbe id say nev-
er saw him before

  mason came up flashing the white beam
of an electric torch

  your arms bleeding he said to the-
bes

  the cut was shallow about six inches
long a razor-clean cut the knife was
still lying on the floor thebes picked it
up it was an old weapon with a da-
mascus blade and a brass handle set with
a mosaic of pearl shell and carnelian a
type one often sees in near-east collec-
tions

  want it thebes asked

  sprague took it and thebes went on

  probably hes the one who killed les-
kawitz

  mason spoke certainly its like i
said hes an enemy of yours and he mis-
took leskawitz for you he died because
of your rotten-

  im not in a mood to take much from
you tonight thebes barked

  thebes stood by the torn screen of his
kraal of the

bedroom window feeling the smart of his
cut arm beneath the bandage dr sprague
had applied he jerked straight listened

  from far away had come the single
abrupt sound of a womans scream

  afterward there was silence as before

-silence filled with a patter of rain that

had started a quarter-hour before

  he felt to make sure of the walther
automatic slipped on his rainhood went
downstairs outside paused while rain
drip-dropped from the thatch ends

  boleh-kah

  the native shuffled down

  come along said thebes

  the girls footprints once slightly marked
in the mudwere now dissolving in new
rain after fifty or sixty yards thebes
let the native go ahead blacks sometimes
have a nose for such things

  boleh-kah went swiftly enough after
five minutes he stopped his bare toe
pointed there was an object on the
ground copper thebes picked it up it
was a rude chain strung with brass and
copper medals large as a childs hand
thebes remembered seeing it before on
mengbattu

  he held it toward boleh-kah who shrank
back eyes rolling so their white showed
a laugh jerked thebes shoulders as he
dropped the heavy necklace in his coat
pocket

  so you believe in the walking dead
too

  boleh-kah was letting his breath with
a hissing sound trying to talk despite the
loss of his tongue it wasnt often he was
upset like that

  thebes struck out at a swift jog for the
river he waited for the native and they
dumped rain from a small dugout they
paddled steadily through black arching
jungle until there was a slight rift at their
left and light reflecting cold gray from
the metal side of cliftons launch

  thebes guided the canoe past and
swung it toward shore through flooded
cane grass and spongy masses of water-
lemon they waded thigh-deep pushing
up the gentle rise of the bank through
vines like giant spiderweb

  the white cobble path looked vitreous
beyond its edging of palm a man was
walking down carrying a rifle over his

arm the senegalese he dropped from
sight across the swell of ground by the
dock

  thebes gestured and boleh-kah follow-
ed him to the open no one accosted them
on their way to the house three steps
led to the verandah shadow the door
was unbarred he glanced back boleh-
kah had stopped refusing to put the roof
over his head superstition inside the
house smelled stuffy filled with odors of
cheap perfume burnt petrol boiled lamb

  he stood for a while in the picinin
room no sound anywhere he opened
the door leading to the sittingroom light
came dimly from deeper in the house he
walked slowly making out furniture the
general features of the room

  he drew up at a voice close to him-
well professor thebes ive been ex-
pecting you

viii

thebes spun hand stopping at the
butt of his walther he saw clifton
then the man was sitting quite still in
a chair not four strides away a luger

pistol in his hand not pointed-just

resting there

  thebes said i didnt think mengbattu
had dropped the necklace by accident
quite i wanted to see you clifton
slapped his thigh and the signal brought
a sound of leg bracelets as mengbattu
came in take his gun its in the shoul-
der holster

  the girot came close and reached inside
thebes coat thebes stood rigid feeling
the walthers two pounds leave his shoul-
der he turned to look in mengbattus
eyes it was too dark 

  clifton laughed so you still believe
the dutchman

  after fifteen years in africa id be-
lieve anything

  then you admit not being an amer-
ican professor

you know damned well why im here
quite clifton stood up he gestur-
ed vith the luger we might as well
go in the diningroom its more comfort-
able there

  a blackboy came without being called
and lighted the petrql lamp drawing it ov-
erhead by a string clifton seated him-

stories

self behind a small table laying the gun in
easy reach and thebes sat down facing
him

  you brought the girl here i suppose
thebes said

  perhaps his cheeks colored slightly
she was in your room tonight wasnt
she

  jealous

  i dare say youre quite proud of your
conquest clifton said bitterly

  that why you get me here

  no i rarely let things like that inter-
fere with my business of mahogany clif-
ton showed the tips of his teeth in a smile
they had turned a little brownish and
were the single feature which detracted
from his appearance as the perfect british
colonial i have a good thing here it
must be that word of it is getting around
the officials merely think its unusual
that you have already cut a footage that
exceeds the original resources of your con-
cession

  indeed and youre checking up may
i ask for your credentials

  ask and be damned

  unpleasant rascal arent you
thebes lighted a cigarette and blew
smoke across it comes natural to me
some men are considerably less un-
pleasant when dead

  go ahead and kill me he jerked his
head at the draped door i know you
have your man over there with a gun on
my back if you want to kill me im in
no position to stop you however just

one word-my disappearance will cause

more notice than poor stantinas did it
happens that the district commissioner is
financially interested in my success

  i have no intention of killing you--if

you cooperate clifton opened a portfolio
tossed out blank paper and a fountain pen
will you write a to whom it may con-
cern saying that after a complete investi-
gation you have found my timber cuttings
to be entirely within the concession bound-
aries

  i can claim duress the minute i get
outside

  of course but ill have the document

  when ive written it-then what

  you may go and take miss quilter
with you

  the man was lying of course a bullet
kraal of the walking dead



would put an end to the matter and
thered be no complications there at ag-
gamba with a hundred miles of steaming
jungle separating them from the colonial
police

  thebes picked up the pen and wrote
to whom it may concern in a series of
abrupt half-legible strokes he looked at
clifton pen poised

  by the way do you know a handsome

young brown fellow-fulbe tribesman

i presume has a fancy for flowered silk
shorts

furrows showed deeply at the sides of
cliftons mouth as his face hardened why
dont you ask who his sweetheart is too
clifton fancy you having a touchy
spot like that

  did you ever have a woman refuse
an offer of marriage and then prove that
she preferred a brownfellow to you get
to writing

  thebes wrote slowly the fine-pointed
pen kept digging the surface of paper turn-
ed thick from rain breeze from outside
carried perfume of ylang-ylang from the
patio where leskawitz had died

  the point dug on an upward strike
spattering ink thebes looked up a blot-
ter lay among the things in the portman-
teau he reached for it clifton saw
thebes hand diverted at the final second
he tried to bring the luger around
thebes hand clamped on his wrist the
guns safety was off and cliftons finger
was on the trigger but the muzzle was
pointed down at the table

  the men struggled silent for two or
three seconds no advantage clifton hiss-
ed through brownish teeth

  in chess we call this a drawn game
and start over

  a slight superiority of weight was
working in thebes favor he slowly twist-
ed the gun down slid it from the table

  thebes said mengbattus behind the
drape why dont you tell him to shoot
clifton felt the balance going against
him and twisted trying to free the gun
rough matting caught his heel thebes
rammed forward utilizing the advantage
bending clifton over the table

  the table tilted on bamboo legs clif-
ton let go the gun and dived sidewise for
the floor

 battu  he shouted

flame and explosion burst from the
ped doorway but thebes was already
moving aside the bullet kicked air by
his cheek he swung his left arm over-
head catching the petrol lamp breaking
it free of its drawstring it sailed through
air crashed in a corner darkness

 at the final instant of light thebes
 glimpsed mengbattu he bent for the
 luger stopped on one knee fired twice
 three times at point-blank range

no answering bullet he rose and
moved forward expecting to find the
mans body it was not there he turned
back cordite fumes filled the air he
located the stairway

 battu is that you battu  clifton
 asked below in the dark

 thebes climbed turned along the dark-
 ened hall bare feet were running that
 way a houseboy thebes shouldered him
 and the surprised boy almost fell

 i have a gun thebes muttered

 kasa me the houseboy whimpered

 take me to the white girl

 yes me take

 he led thebes to the verandah and
 unlocked a door to a plushy sitting room
 the houseboys eyes roved the room

 shes gone

where

 me no know master me no--

 maybe she got away

 no get away

 a cushion from one of the chairs had
 fallen to the floor

 thebes asked was it like that be-
 fore

 me don know

 there was a second door thebes strode
 toward it the houseboy leaped in front
 of him

no no go masters room

 thebes slammed him out of the way
 he entered a small bedroom a door led
 on a dimly lit sitting room he breathed
 air repugnant with civet perfume a door
 at the far side had just closed leaving
 the basket-weave bamboo wall still trem-
 bling

 in half-darkness it was a moment be-
 fore he noticed willa quilter lying face
 up on the couch of arabian cushions

 her hair was tangled her dress torn

stories

one foot kicked feebly around her throat
was a strip of baghdad satin twisted tight
her face was red thickening to purple

  he jerked the silk free pulled her to
her feet shook her until breath sucked
in her tortured lungs then he started
toward the door balancing her over his
left arm the luger still in his right

  clifton appeared in the door a bolt-ac-
tion rifle in the crook of his arm

  drop it thebes said

  dont be a fool do you think id
have come here if-

  drop it

  ah right he let the rifle fall oh
i say the girls face what the deyil 
ask your berber woman here youd
better try your strength ill let you carry
her to the dock and when we get there
you can run us down in the petrol launch

ix

morning appeared by degrees
through a thick cover of clouds
laying a white light across the sleeping
girls face shed been awake for a while
on their way from the concession house
but once inside her room she had fallen
into an exhausted sleep

  sprague said something and snapped
shut the case of his watch after taking hex
pulse his gray eyebrows were drawn
together as he looked around at thebes
reverend heggrie was also in the room
so sprague said nothing until he was
downstairs alone with thebes

  peculiar she shouldnt be sleeping the
way she is

  thats what i thought he looked at
spragues face go ahead doctor say
what you really think

  why i suspect someone has put the
eye on her

  tuema 

  peculiar yes its damned peculiar i
tried to rouse her you know theres no
concussion a little shock perhaps tell
me just what was it that happened last
night what about that fellow clifton
oh i suppose cliftons as sane as any
man of forty who falls in love with a
girl of nineteen he took her out there
knowing id follow he intended to knock
me off the way he did stantina and what
he intended with the girl you can guess
kraal of the

as well as i but tuema that berber
woman of his got the silk garotte in if
theres a bit of sorcery involved i sup-
pose its tuema or that young fulbe i
knocked downstairs but dont ask me
who he is

  did you notice willas hair some-
body lopped off a chunk of it

  the implication was plain enough any
part of a person was equal to the whole
in the laying of a voodoo spell

  the two men left the mission house to-
gether rain had stopped for the moment
a woman hidden beneath the folds of a
white djellaba was hurrying away from
the trade-store

  who is it sprague asked and the-
bes shook his head

  vanderbosch was standing on a stool
hanging a cluster of foot-long papayas to
a rafter he climbed down wheezing from
effort

  thebes i hear you have trouble last
night some man try kill you

  a young fulbe handsome devil in
flowered shorts

  ja kenura

  is that his name

  vanderbosch nodded a no - good
thief someday i kill that kenura he
sat down making the rattan chair creak
sidewise if one thing i cant stand its
native who thinks hes good as white
man

thebes sat down and told about willa
ja clifton he perhaps hire wicked
fetisher to put poor girl to sleep or
mengbattu ja-mengbattu that man
mitout soul

  maybe tuema hired someone

  ha you know her vanderbosch
hooked his thumb at the door she just

ma she came to buy sandalwood incense
but she is moslem moslem do not drink
wine or lay curses only christian or
heathen do these things mynheer

  what should i do hire drums and
a ma-deup 

  pah vanderbosch spat across the
dirt-clotted mattings no if it were
me i would shoot that clifton mynheer
i would kill him and that same shot would
kill slave too for man mitout soul will
die same second as master you hear it

and when you kill sorcerer then will
woman wake up as always

  ill think it over thebes said

  the girl slept through the day and all
night and all the day following she was
already becoming thinner thebes left the
mission and started toward the resthouse
then he changed his mind and walked to
the fetish town

  when he headed back two hours later
the chief fetisher was wealthier by a five-
pound note and the drums were mutter-
ing the age-old rhythm of the sorcerers
dance later that day or the next their
sound would assert itself and a woman
would feel their call and she would be
pulled to them by an attraction stronger
than any will to resist and she would
dance as long as the fa willed her to un-
til she fell in a trance from which she
would awaken with the knowledge of the
sorcerers identity burning in her soul
and she would hunt him out and reveal
him for what he was by digging finger-
nails in his flesh

  he glanced at his watch as he entered
the resthouse it was a few minutes be-
fore twelve boleh-kah was sitting cross-
legged at the foot of the stairs he made
a sign with his hands and thebes knew
there was a visitor for him

  his room was dark he heard voices
coming from spragues room clifton he
lighted the candle and lay down inside the
mosquito drape of his bed wishing for
some hashish with which to spike his
tangier cigarette

  after a while he heard clifton say
good night his feet thumped in the hall
-paused thebes knew he was standing
just outside the door

  may i come in qifton asked

  come along

  he paused in the door the lines of his
face looking unusually deep ive been
listening to the drums

  the hell you have if you feel the
urge maybe theyd let you dance

  he came on in closing the door i
thought you were the one who set them
going

  right

  thebes pronounced it after the british
manner but clifton ignored its mockery

  you think theres some voodoo in-
volved in her sleeping this way

stories

  dont you

  perhaps well out with it-who do
you suspect

  what difference does it make who i
suspect i know theres only one way to
combat voodoo and thats with voodoo
we havent a ma-deup yet so theres no
hurry but when the time comes well have
a gathering of the clans over there ill
expect you to be on hand with that
strangling berber woman of yours
clifton raised his voice how could
she do it she hasnt been near the

girl since-

  you have

  oh the devil thebes you cant be-
lieve such a thing about a white man
thebes shrugged

clifton went on oh i know how
it looks to you and to the scientists
too only they didnt come right out and
say it ill admit tuema tried to strangle
her but that other damn it man id
kill that tuema if i thought she was
playing around with the black fetish
or perhaps it was someone else ken-
ura for instance why dont you tell what
you know about that brownfellow youve
never done that

  i promised heggrie id tell nothing
about kenura and willa

  what are you talking about thebes
sat up suddenly seizing cliftons coat
ramming him to the wall are you hint-
ing there was something between willa
and him

  get your hands off me clifton
moved away grinning from one side of
his mouth whats the matter does it
nick your ego to find out she had a con-
queror before you

  by god thats a lie

  you sound like a poor scene out of
hall caine yes she had a fancy for dark
skin i should know im the one who
found them together have you ever stood
and watched a damned nigger or some-
body not much better pressing his fingers
in a white womans flesh a woman like
her  pure aloof untouchable thats what
she was to me and then i found that
those kind of vines budded like the rest
when the rains were near that she liked
to toss off that starched linen dress for a
sarong and run in the moonlight there
kraal of the

walking dead



they were-she and the brownfellow at
the edge of the mission compound and he
was kissing her finally she got scared
and tried to fight him away but after
youve stirred that dark blood too much
you cant turn it off like the cold water
tap in an accra hotel id have killed him
only he got away

  she isnt in love with him shes afraid
of him

  sometimes you cant quite get a knife
between love and fear

the drums were still thum-thum-
ming inside the smoky fetish hut
when sprague and thebes went over next
afternoon across the floor thirty or forty
blacks were sprawled some with their
bodies weaving in monotonous rhythm
others simply entranced and staring

  after half an hour a priest of nesshue
the river fetish came in barely able to
walk beneath the weight of a mask of
painted and stick-stretched antelope skin
larger than the rest of his body he seat-
ed himself crosslegged on a heap of un-
cured skins the painted mask seeming
to stare inflexibly at the entrance

  without warning a black girl came
isinuously through the entrance and fac-
ing the drums commenced to dance

  ma-deup ma-deup the blacks chant-
ed

  her movements were slow impromptu
she apparently saw nothing-felt nothing
she danced with one hour stretching into
the next through the length of the long
night until dawn sent gray light through
the smokehole imperceptibly there was
a quickening of the tom-tom tempo

  she tossed off the robe of print calico
she was wearing leaving herself clothed
only in a loin piece of dyed raffia and a
necklace of cowrie shells that glistened
white against the oily blackness of her
skin

 she was a handsome wench broad-
hipped and slim-waisted once the tempo
was broken it increased rapidly with the
girl responding using every voluntary
muscle of her body arms and hips writh-
ing abdomen swung out of joint bare
feet slapping earth in rapid intricate
movements at last after she had ex-
ceeded all reasonable human endurance

she cried sharply and fell crosslegged
back to the drums her body stiffened
her lips peeled back showing clenched
teeth tiny dribbles of spittle ran from
the corners of her mouth her eyes were
wide but the eyeballs had rolled back in-
side her skull blank white

  anyway we have a good ma-deup
thebes said turning to the door clifton
had better keep that tuema woman a long
way off if he doesnt want our black girl
wetting fingernails in her blood

  do you think you can get him to bring
her here

  of course hell have to otherwise
it will be an admission of guilt

x

willa was the same as before per-
haps a trifle weaker thinner her
skin had turned white with tiny freckles
showing across her forehead

 sprague walked away putting his
stethoscope in his pocket

  id feed her intravenously if i had the
equipment

  thebes gestured indicating the fetish
town where the drums were still beating
is heggrie getting the old woman to
come 

  shell go along to show her defiance
of the drums if for no other reason fool-
ish though mrs heggrie-

  no its not foolish anybodys sus-
pect in a case like this even the two of
us

  and cliftons coming with tuema
theyll be there he actually seemed
anxious this morning when i talked to
him traded my walther back for his
luger says hell kill the sorcerer him-
self when he finds out who it is

  they waited on the lower verandah it
hadnt rained since morning and the fet-
ish drums had tightened judging by their
sound

  were likely to have a long wait
sprague said i saw a girl in haiti that
was under for eight days died the sor-
cerer they were after had hanged himself
and she had to go to him it almost makes
a man afraid to go out in the dark
heggrie came out in a few minutes
bringing his wife and the four of them
walked to the fetish village clifton and

stories

tuema were already there mason came
along a while later

  the ma-deup girl seemed to be the
same as before still stiffened cords of her
neck distended eyeballs rolled drums
kept the hut vibrating

  tuema was crouched on the floor com-
pletely hidden by her djellaba clifton
stood behind her the luger was strapped
around his waist

 with darkness the rain commenced
again now and then a little spatter of it
struck them as it bounded from some-
thing coming through the smokehole

  heggrie said what heathen foolish-
ness 

  sprague smiled and wiped perspiration

  thebes said this should make good
material for your report

  the men became suddenly silent as a
tremble passed along ma-deups muscles
tom-tom players sensing the end raised
the tempo of their playing ma-deup
sprang to her feet and of a sudden the
drums stopped

  there was something explosive and
terrifying about silence coming after so
many hours of drumbeat

  ma-deups eyes were no longer rolled
in her skull she looked around wildly
tuema cried out in her native arabic and
sprang up both arms flung across the
hood of her djellaba she was trying to
escape but clifton anticipated the move
he held her from behind as she strug-
gled

  clifton got one hand free he ripped
the hood from her face exposing it for
ma-deups fingernails

  at other times the berber woman might
have been beautiful but fear made her
face repulsive

  ma-deup paused in front of her hands
raised nails standing out on her black
fingers like pieces of clam shell in the
light of greaselamps

  then instead of pouncing she turned
her eyes swept the hut she ran brushed
between thebes and sprague disappeared
through the doorway

  thebes started for the door ramming
mason mason got out ahead of him
paused for a second swinging the ray of
an electric torch ma-deups cowrie neck-
lace gleamed white against her dark body
as she ran following the footpath toward
kraal of the walking dead



the village mason was fast with strength
and wind unimpaired by years of quinine
and he kept the lead covering the dis-
tance in long strides

  he stopped and was cursing unable to
find the black girl in the rays of his torch
lost her he cried over his shoulder to
thebes

  clifton was shouting mengbattu
damn you follow her

  they had not seen mengbattu before
that night perhaps he had been hiding in
the jungle edge not daring to enter the
fetish town he ran past with a jingle
of copper ornaments seeming to sense
ma-deups direction

  mason reached far past the running
mengbattu with his torch and again caught
the gleam of her cowrie shells she seemed
headed for the resthouse

  then she turned the movement was
so sudden she lost footing and fell in the
mud she sprang forward again running
up unpainted cobbles

  a candle was burning inside the voice
of vanderbosch came bellowing almost
unrecognizable from terror

  no gott away you she-cat

  they caught sight of him momentarily
running down the verandah the girl was
clinging trying to claw over his shoul-
ders he turned to fling her but she clung
to his arm she struggled close digging
fingernails ripping the skin of his fat
face

  suddenly all strength left her and she
collapsed like wet cloth on the verandah
vanderbosch stumbled over her got up
came down the steps

   for the first time he realized there were
others he ran forward a huge stumbl-
ing beast of a man the electric torch
seemed to blind him he had one massive
arm over his eyes

  stop thebes said stop van or
ill kill you

  vanderbosch did not seem to hear his
eyes were beyond thebes fastened on
clifton

  clifton had planted himself in the mid-
dle of the cobbles luger aimed shoulder
high

  it pounded-a flat sound deadened by
rain it pounded again and again with the
slugs slamming the dutchmans huge body

but still vanderbosch was on his feet
charging on

the luger snapped empty clifton
cried out hurled the gun in van-
derboschs face he tried at that last sec-
ond to move aside no time for that van-
derbosch seized him lifted him high
dashed him head and shoulder first to the
ground

  for a moment vanderbosch stood over
him his sweaty white shirt turning dark
from blood life seemed to leave his big
body by degrees his knees bent and he
fell forward sliding one side of his short-
roached head through mud no one see-
ing him could doubt that he was dead

  sprague started to lift clifton he
paused carefully laid him back good
god he touched cliftons head saw
the loose roll of it  do you realize his
necks broken

 tuema had followed- she heard
spragues words and flung herself over
clifton covering him with the folds of
her djellaba

  thebes pulled at the berber womans
shoulder you hired him didnt you you
hired vanderbosch-brought him a piece
of the girls hair so he could lay a curse
on her and he agreed knowing it would
be most likely laid to clifton or the gi-
rotte

  tuema looked up only half compre-
hending

  heggrie ran down from the mission
shes awake he was saying awake
asking for you thebes

  he laughed for me good god

  he started away paused grabbed heg-
gries shoulder isnt it about time you
told what you know about kenura-that
fulbe boy

  i know nothing about him

  you knew he was in love with willa
and that she led him on thats why you
tried to keep her inside the house and
you had a pretty good idea it was ken-
ura who killed leskawitz when he found
the two of them making love

  i had to think of the girl 

  you might have got me killed ever
think what a tragedy that would be
there are some people who live in
spite of everything

  yes i have been rather durable the-

stores

bes grinned from one side of his mouth
as he hunted a dry match for his tangier
cigarette

  at the mission house he found willa
sitting up looking thin but with a flush
of life once more riding her cheeks she
was hungrily finishing off some hard cas-
sava bread spread with honey paste

  thebes said youve changed your
mind about wanting me to take you down-
river havent you

  no

  she started to get up but his hand
closed on her shoulder keeping her in
bed

  dont be afraid of kenura girl the
colonials will run him down for leska-
witzs murder before the rains are over
i never cared for kenura not after i
saw you that first night you were stand-
ing down by the table    

  mrs heggrie had heated powdered ca-
cao and canned milk she came up put-
ting the cup on a stand beside the bed

  mr thebes she looked at him her
eyes bright with inspiration if youre
going downriver i wonder if you could
do something for me if you had time i
wish you would look around in accra
and see if you could locate a rather large
bell 

lights were burning in the rest-
house and through rain its win-
dows had a blurred circular look some-
one was standing near a clump of palms
at one side of the trade-store an elec-
tric torch flicked on catching thebes in
its ray

  mason

  yes

  thebes walked over by the way i
once promised vanderbosch id burn his
body if we could find enough petrol-
foolish of course

  mason answered in a tight voice i
dont know if its foolish or not

  what do you mean

  instead of answering mason directed
light to the ground revealing a dead na-
tive

  his body looked old as thought hed
been dead a long time his eyelids hung
open revealing strips of eyeball of a sort
one might expect in a mummy only
when thebes saw the neckpiece of copper

him well doctor i dare say you intend
to include a full account of this in your
report to the department of ethnology
i have no desire sprague said
though his teeth to become the laughing
stock of my profession

explained psychosis has its materialistic
aspects and at times they are spectacularly
