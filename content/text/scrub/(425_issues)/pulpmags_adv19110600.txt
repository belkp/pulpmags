adventure
tic appeared to me tc justify more tlian
ordinary care there were other factors
that entered for the first time in goldfield
too
  the initial successes of the big display
udvertising campaigns directed from gold-
neld appeared to have been due to the fact
that the american public had greeted min-
ing-stock speculation as filling a long-felt
yant namely a channel for speculation in
which they could indulge their gambling
spirit with comparatively limited resources
-resources that were insufficient to give
hem a look-in on the big exchanges
-here the high-priced rails and industrials
re traded in
advertising for thinkers
having tried on the dog my meth-
ods of advertising for nearly two
years that is to say having conducted an
advertising agency for mine promoters and
earned the business with their money i
had passed through the experimental stage
and now marshalled a cardinal principle or
two that i decided must guide me in the
operations in which i had become more
directly interested
  i resolved never to allow an advertise-
ment to go out of the office that was un-
convincing to a thinker if my argument
convinces the man of affairs i determined
it will certainly succeed with the man of
no affairs
  dogmatically expressed the idea was
this
  never appeal to the intelligence of fools
no matter how easily they may part with
their money turn your batteries on the
thinking ones and convince them and the
unthinking are bound to follow
  that principle was applied to the argu-
ment of the advertisement
  the headlines were constructed on an
entirely different principle namely to be
positive to an extreme
  the bible was my exemplar it says
it is or it was thou shalt or
thou shalt not and the bible rarely
explains or tells why
  the strength of a headline lies in its
positiveness
  the logic which directed that the flaring
headline of my big display advertising copy
fmbrace a very positive statement and that
uit irgtmrii which followed in small type
be convincing to the thinker was based on
a recognition of the fact that while boldness
of statement invariably attracts attention
analysis is the final resort of the thinker
before becoming convinced
  more circumspection was used also in the
matter of selecting media for the advertis-
ing newspapers that did not publish in
their news columns mining-stock quotations
of issues traded in on the new york curb
the boston stock exchange the boston
curb the salt lake stock exchange or the
san francisco stock exchange were taboo
on the theory that by this time trading in
mining stocks had grown sufficiently popular
to command a regular following and that it
was easier to appeal to those who had some
experience in mining-stock speculation than
to those who had never before ventured
  subsequent advertising campaigns were
always conducted from this viewpoint i
did not set the ocean on fire with my stray
dog promotion the advertising campaign
of which was conducted on these lines but
this was due to circumstances which i ex-
plain further on later when the sullivan
trust company grew and prospered and
afterward when i reached the east and
learned more and more of the inside rnechan
ism of the big wall street promotion game
in rails and industrials as well as mining
stocks i became absolute in my opinion
that my publicity principles were right
  the mighty powers on wall street
recognize the fact that it is not in the
nature of things that fools should have
much money and thinkers not fools are
the quarry of the successful modern-day
promoter high or low honest or dis-
honest
  a little knowledge is a dangerous thing
and the man who thinks he knows it all
because he has accumulated much money
in his own pet business enterprise is the
typical personage on whom the dishonest
modern-day promoter trains his batteries
  the honest promoter aims at both the
thinker who thinks he knows but doesnt
and the thinker who really does know
he is compelled to appeal to both classes
because the membership of the first out-
numbers that of the second in the propor-
tion of about  to i
  in fine to use the parlance of we
gambler all promoters on and off wall
street of necessity deal for suckers
my adventures with your money

      the initial stray dog and indian
camp promotion campaign was
only half successful at the outset
about  shares of stray dog and
  shares of indian camp had been
disposed of when the manhattan boom be-
gan to lose its intensity promotions had
been made a little too rapidly for public
digestion there rere more miners at
work than ever in the manhattan camp
out the demand for securities was not keep-
ing pace with the supply manhattans
initial boom appeared to be flattening out
just as goldfields first boom had
  we met with a setback from another di-
rection henry mccornicks banking con-
nections in salt lake objected to the use
of his name as president of the stray dog
at the very height of our advertising cam-
paign mr mccornick resigned we elected
our engineer jack campbell president
but the damage was done
      yes business is business
the offices of the trust company were
furnished on an elaborate scale resem-
bling the interior of a banking institution of
a large city the offices became the head-
quarters of eastern mining-stock brokers
whenever they arrived in camp
  one morning j c weir a new york
mining-stock broker whose firm held an
option from the trust company on 
shares of stray dog stock was ensconced
in one of the two luxuriously furnished
rooms used as executive offices mr weirs
firm was one of our selling agents in new
york he was the dean of mining-stock
brokers in new york city in those early
days the telephone service of goldfield was
not yet perfected and it was only necessary
for a person in order to overhear any talk
over the telephone to lift the receiver from
the nearest hook and listen it was re-
ported to me that mr weir had been avail-
ing himself of this method of learning things
at first hand
  say rice said mr sujlivan one morn-
ing weir hears your messages every time
you are called on the phone he takes
advantage of you i wish you would let
me fix him
  all right what do you want to do i
answered
  say said mr sullivan campbell
our engineer is in manhattan ill call
him up from the public station and tell
him to phone you some red-hot news about
mine developments on stray dog and ill
see to it that weir is in his office at the time
you get the message if weir dont grab a
big block of stray dog on the strength of
it im a poor guesser
  all of our options to brokers were to ex -
pire on the th of march and this was
the th
  at four oclock in the afternoon i was in
my room mr weir was at the desk in the
room opposite the phone bell rang
  hello i said who is this
  campbell at manhattan was the re-
sponse
  whats the news jack i asked
  weve just struck six feet of  ore
its a whale never saw a mine as big as
this one in my life dont sell any more
stray dog under  a share shouted mr
campbell
  bully jack i said but keep thai
information to yourself dont tell your
mother and dont let any more miners go
down the shaft close it up until i am abl-
to buy back some of the stock i sold so
cheap
  fifteen minutes later mr sullivan am 
met mr weir leaving the room
  weir said i your option on stray
dog expires on the th at noon so far
your new york office has ordered only
	shares of the  that were
allotted to you we have decided to close
subscriptions on the moment and wish you
would ware your new york office not to
sell any more
  you arc wrong said mr weir why
when i left new york we had oversold
our entire allotment if the office has no
notified you of this it has been a slip we
will in fact need at least  share
more than have been ordered
  you cant have them said i
  not in a thousand years put in mr
sullivan
  mr weir sent a bunch of code messages
to new york all the next day mr sulli
van spent with mr weir ke allowed mr
weir to cajole him into letting him have
the entire block of stock finally it wa
agreed between mr weir and mr sullivan
that mr sullivan would give him the addi
tional stock whether i consented or not
surreptitiously according to mr weirs
idea mr sullivan was yielding to him

adventure
without my knowledge and against my
wishes
  next day tlie sullivaa trijstcompany
shipped to mr- weirs firm in new york
	shares of ttray log attached to
draft at  cents a share the draft was
aid mr weir must have burned his
fingers by the operation
a few weeks after this and at
a period when manhattans initial
boom was easing off san francisco
was destroyed by earthquake and fire
not less than half of the capital invested in
manhattan stocks had come out of the city
of san francisco where manhattan was in
much higher favor even than in the east
the earthquake was fatal to manhattan
the san francisco stock exchange which
was the principal market for manhattan
mining shares was compelled to discontinue
business for over two months brokers and
transfer companies lost their records and
the publics property and monfey loss was so
appalling that no more money was forth-
coming from the coast for-mining enter-
prises every bank in nevada closed down
just as every california bank did the gov-
ernors of both states declaring a series of
legal holidays to enable the financial insti-
tutions to gain time nevada banks as a
rule had cleared through san francisco
banks and there was much money tied up
by the catastrophe
  the sullivan trust company faced a crisis
i had decided it was good business to lend
support to jumping jack in the stock mar-
ket when the manhattan boom began to
relax from its first tension and had accu-
mulated several hundred thousand shares
at an average of  cents the trust com-
pany had only  in gold in its vaults on
the day of the quake moneys deposited
in bank were not available of the 
in gold coin  was paid two days after
the earthquake to the wells-fargo express
company for an automobile which was in
transit at the time and for which wells-
fargo demanded the coin it was impossi-
ble to hypothecate securities of any descrip-
tion in nevada or san francisco
  with the sullivan trust company s funds
tied up in closed-up banks and with an un-
stable line of securites in its vaults it was
 up ggainst it for a period it looked as
if we must go to the wall tor two months
we ekecl out c bare subsistence by the direct
saie of manhattan securities at reduced
prices to the eastern brokers this pur-
chasing power came largely from broker
who were short of stocks to the public on
commitments made at a much higher range
of prices and needed the actual certificate-
for deliveries
  it took the nevada banks and the san
francisco stock exchange more than sixty
days to rehabilitate themselves no sooner
did the san francisco stock exchange open
for business than it became possible for the
sullivan trust company to borrow some
much needed cash on manhattan securities
of which it had a plethora through mem-
bers of the san francisco stock exchange il
obtained in this way in the neighborhood of
 goldfield banks supplied an-
other  a little later by the same
process
  -fortunes that were missed
bout this time the mohawk of gold-
field began to give indications of being
the wonderful treasure-house it has since
proved to be hayes and monnette who
owned a lease on a small section of the prop
erty had struck high-grade ore and were
producing at the rate of  per day a
few weeks later it was reported that the
output had increased to  a day
  the mohawk being situated onlya stones
throw from the combination mine the idea
that the mohawk might turn out to be an-
other combination was common in gold-
field hayes and monnette were startled-
almost frightened-at their success yield-
ing for the moment to the warning of friends
who urged upon them the possibility of the
ore soon pinching out hayes and monnette
called at the offices of the trust company
and offered to sell their lease which had six
months to run for  cash and -
	to be taken out of the net proceeds of
the ore
  i will take it i said
  i sent over to the state bank  trus
company and had a check certified for the
coco i was about to close the deal
when mr sullivan and jack campbell
protested
  i ought to have fifteen days to examuu-
the mine urged mr campbell
  it is too big a chance to take declarer
mr sullivan
  when appealed to hayes and monnette
my adventures with yowhccfoney

said that ju allow a fifteen-day examination
would mean practically to shut down the
property for that period and would result in
a positive loss to them because of the lim-
i ted period of their lease the possible loss
if the deal fell through was too large to con-
template and they refused
fday by day as mr campbell and
  mr sullivan dilly-dallied the out-
put of the lease increased and when
a fortnight later all three of us were unan-
imously in favor of the proposition hayes
and monette flatly refused to sell within
half a year that lease on the mohawk pro-
duced in the neighborhood of 
worth of ore gross and netted the leasers
about  the l m sullivan
trust company certainly overlooked a
bet there
 e about this time i spent an evening with
 henry peery and w h daddy clark
 daddy clark like mr peery came from
 salt lake mr clark had successfully pro-
 moted the bullfrog gibraltar seated
 around a table in the palm restaurant the
 conversation turned to new camps
   rice said mr clark i expect to be
 able to put you in on a townste deal in a
 couple of weeks that-wju make you some
 money if you undertake to give the camp
 some publicity
   good said i
   i am having some assays run he said
 of some samples which were brought into
 camp last night by a couple of prospectors
 and if they turn out to be what the prospec-
 tors claim or anything near it well need
 your services to put a new camp on the
 map
   that night mr peery learned from the
 assayer that the lowest assay of  samples
 was  and the highest  per tea
 next morning mr peery informed me that
 he had worked all night on mr clark to
 learn where the ore came from mr peery
 said mr clark had told him in the wee sma
 hours that the rich stuff came from fair-
 i-iew peak fifty miles east of fallon
   rice said mr peery lets beat him
 to it hes going to trek it across the
 desert by mule team with a camp outfit
 to-morrow and it will take him a week to
 get there
   billy taylor who was interested with
 mr peer- in a bullfrog enterprise joined
 he party and we each gave mr peery p
 chcck lor s forming a pool of  to
 send a man to fair view to buy properties
 there mr jpeeiy wired the bank of the
 republic af salf lake tv pay ben luce
  and instructed m-luce by wire
 to take the money go to frrview aiid do
 business
  it was nearly two weeks beore we  tea i d
of either mr clark or mr luce mr
clark returned to camp and said he had
purchased the nevada hills property
scene of the big find for  and that it
was a world-beater
  did you meet any outsiders there
queried mr peery
  yes said mr clark i met a man
named luce who almost got ahead of me
in fact he did buy the property before i
got there but he had no money and they
would not take his check for  which
was the deposit required i had the gold
with me and that settled it
  a few days afterward mr luce came to
goldfield
  i didnt get the big one he said but
i bought the eagles nest near by for
 of which  was demanded to be
paid down and there is ore in it and it
looks good to me i had no money with
me when i arrived in fairview they re-
fused my check for the nevada hills but
the eagles nest boys took it for the first
payment of 
  mr luce was not at home when mr
peerys despatch was delivered in salt lake
when it reached him the bank was closed
in order to catch the first train he was com-
pelled to leave the money behind he ar-
rived in fairview minus the  and
thereby lost the nevada hills for mr peery
mr taylor and the sullivan trust com-
pany
  mr clark and his partners incorporated
the nevada hills for r shares of
the par value of  each and accepted sub-
scriptions at  per share
  within a few months the nevada hills
paid  in dividends out of ore and
soon thereafter at the height of the gold-
field boom it was reported that the owners
of the control refused an offer of 
or the property the mine has turned out
to be a bonanza the stock of the company
sold recently on the new york curb and
san francisco stock exchange at a valua-
tion for the mine of  andit is
believed by well-posted mining men to

adventure
be worth all of that george wingfield
president of the goldfield consolidated
who followed the sullivan trust company
into fairview and bought the fairview
eagle which is sandwiched in between the
nevada hills and the eagles nest is now
president of the nevada hills treasury
stock of the fairview eagle was sold in
goldfield at  cents per share
hgh jack campbell reported
iffpil favorably on tbe eagles nest and
we decided to organize and promote
a company to own and develop the property
  the sullivan trust company bought
mr taylors interest in the eagles nest
for  mr luces for  he had
been awarded a quarter interest for his
work and mr peerys for  it
made the property the basis for the promo-
tion of the eagles nest fairview mining
company capitalized for  shares
of the par value of  each- governor john
sparks accepted our invitation to become
president of the company the entire
capitalization was sold to the public through
kastern and western stock brokers within
thirty days at a subscription price of 
cents per share after paying for the
property our net profits were in the
neighborhood of 
  the eagles nest deal enabled the trust
company to repay most of the money it had
borrowed after the san francisco earth-
quake and this put the company on its
feet again
the fetching tale of bullfrog rush
tollowing the eagles nest promo-
tion the sullivan trust company be-
came sponsor for bullfrog rush i had met
dr j grant lyman owner of the property
on the lawn of one of the cottagcs of the united
states hotel in saratoga a few years before
where he raced a string of horses and mixed
with good people and i was glad to renew
his acquaintance on the desert dr lyman
bought the bullfrog rush property for
 i was present when he paid
 of this money in cash at john s
cook  companys bank in goldfield the
bullfrog rush property was of large acre-
age enjoyed splendid surface showings and
was situated contiguous to the tramps
consolidated which was then selling around
s a sbare it looked like a fine prospect
  dr lyman incorporated the company
for  shares of the par value of 
each the services of the sullivan trus
company were employed to finance the
enterprise for mine development the
trust company obtained an option on the
treasury stock of the company at  cent
per share and proceeded to dispose of it
through eastern brokers and direct to the
public by advertising at  cents per share
to brokers and  cents per share to in-
vestors we sold  shares realizing
 in less than thirty days retained
 for commission and expenses and
turned into the treasury of the bullfrog
rush company  all of which was
placed at the disposal of the company for
mine development
  half a dozen tunnels were run and several
shafts were sunk down to the -foot
level the mine appeared to be of much
promise it was then learned that the
shaft at the oo-foot point had encountered
a bed of lime it appeared that all the
properties on bonanza mountain where the
bullfrog rush was situated including the
tramps consolidated which was then sell-
ing in the market at a valuation of -
	were bound to turn out to be rank
mining failures the entire hill according
to our engineer was a slide and below the
oo-foot point ore could not possibly exist
  we thereupon notified dr lyman thai
we would discontinue the sale of the stock
until such time as the property gave better
indications of making a mine
  a few weeks later dr lyman entered my
private office unannounced at this period
jumping jack stray dog indian camp
and eagles nest were all selling on the san
francisco stock exchange at an average oi
 per cent above promotion prices the
l m sullivan trust company was mak-
ing good to investors bullfrog rush had
not yet been listed and we were afraid to
give it a market quotation
  i have formed here in goldfield the
union securities company dr lyman
said as he sat down close to my desk ant-
i am going into the promotion business my-
self i dont believe a word of the reports
you have that the bullfrog rush is no good
i am going on with the promotion
  you wont i protested we shall
not permit it governor sparks who is the
best friend the sullivan trust company
has accepted- the presidency of the bull-
my adventures with ymaivtoney

hog rush oil our assurance that the prop-
erty was a good one john s cook the
leading banker of this town accepted the
ireasurership on the same representations
mr sullivan president of this trust com-
pany isvice-president of the rush dont
dare go on with the promotion at this time
if you do youll get us into trouble and we
shall take drastic action
   dr lyman left the office without utter-
ing a word
ehs two days later i received a dis-
gjug patch from governor sparks saying
that a full-page advertisement of the
union securities company had appeared in
the nevada state journal at reno offering
bullfrog rush stock for subscription the
governor protested vigorously against the
sale of the stock we had previously in-
jformed him as to the new conditions which
prevailed at the mine
 i sent peter grant one of mr sullivans
partners in the palace to dr lyman to
protest the answer came back that the
nevada state journal advertisement was
about to be reproduced in all the newspapers
of big circulation throughout the east and
that the orders for the advertisements would
not be canceled half an hour later dr
lyman entered the office with mr grant
m grant looked nettled dr lyman
glowered
  i bade dr lyman take a chair
  if you move a finger to stop me he
said as he sat himself down before me ill
expose every act of yours since you were
born and show up who the boss of this trust
company really is 
  dr lyman was tall as a poplar and mus-
cled like a samson ke was fresh from the
east red-cheeked and groomed like a
chesterfield i was cadaverous desert-
worn office-fagged and undersized by com-
parison in a glove fight dr lyman could
probably have finished me in half a round
but the disparity did not occur to me the
sense of injustice made me forget everything
except dr lymans blackmailing threat i
jumped to my feet dr lyman backed up
to the glass door i aimed a blow at him
he backed away to dodge it in a second
he had collided with the big plate-glass pane
which fell with a crash in another instant
he recovered his feet turned on his heel and
ran his face was covered with scratches
the result of his encounter with the broken
plate glass several clerks who followed
him thinking he had committed some vio-
lent act reported that he didnt stop run-
ning until he reached the end of the block
  cleaning house in bullfrog rush
after dr lymans hurried exit i
was quick to decide upon a course of
action
  the position of the trust company was
this with the exception of bullfrog rush
we had a string of stock-market winners to
our credit with the public if we allowed
dr lyman to go ahead with his promotion
of bullfrog rush we should unless we
abandoned our rule to protect our stocks in
the market be compelled some day to buj
back all of the stock he sold the truth
about the mine was bound to come out and
we stood before the public as its sponsors
  i decided that the trust company should
refund the money paid in by stockholders
of bullfrog rush and prevent dr lyman
from selling more stock
  to the brokers through whom we had
sold much of the stock to the public we
telegraphed that we would refund the exact
amount paid us by the brokers on delivery
back to us of the certificates we also
wired to governor sparks and asked his
permission to insert an advertisement in the
newspapers over his signature announcing
that the property had proved to be a mining
failure and advising the public not to buy
any more shares this pleased the gov-
ernor immensely for he promptly wired
back his  k with congratulations over the
stand we took
swffg that night a broadside warning
to the public bearing the signature
of governor john sparks and 
separate advertisement of the sullivan
trust company offering to refund the
money paid for bullfrog rush shares were
telegraphed to all the leading newspaper
of the east next day both of these an-
nouncements appeared side by side with
the half-page and full-page advertisements
of dr lymans union securities company
of goldtield offering bullfrog rush for pub-
lic subscription
   the effect of course was that the public
didnt buy any more bullfrog rush shares
  the bullfrog rush incident cost the sul-
livan trust company a little less than

adventure
 which was refunded to stockhold-
ers and about  additional that had
been expended lor publicity dr lyman
was stripped of his entire investment in
the property the newspapers lost many
thousands of dollars representing dr ly-
mans unpaid advertising bills a number
of mining-stock brokers also forfeited some
money they were compelled to refund
their commissions
  j c weir the new york mining-stock
broker had sold in the neighborhood of
	shares of bullfrog rush to his
clients and he took violent exception to
our decision not to refund an amount in
excess of the net price paid to us he held
that his firm ought not to be compelled to
disgorge its profit we stood pat and
argued that he ought to be proud to share
with us the glory of making good in such
an unusual way to stockholders it was
the first time in the history of western min-
ing promotions that a thing like this had
ever been done and we pointed out to mr
weir that it would gain reputation both for
himself and the trust company for a
period mr weir carried on an epistolary
warfare with the trust company for
nearly two months he refused to yield
finally we received a letter from mr weir
saying that since we refused to come to his
terms he would accept ours and that he had
drawn on us for  with one lot of
	shares of bullfrog rush stock at-
tached on receipt of the letter i gave
instructions to the cashier promptly to
honor the draft
  an hour later the cashier reported that
the draft had been presented and that an
examination of the stock certificates showed
that not a single one of them had been sold
by the trust company through mr weirs
firm and in fact had never been disposed
of by the trust company to anybody a
hurried examination of the stock-certtficate
books of the bullfrog rush company which
were in the hands of the companys secre-
tary in goldfield a clerk of dr lyman re-
vealed the fact that a large number of
blank certificates had been torn out of the
certificate books without any entry appear-
ing on the stubs
  the certificates returned to us by mr
weir bore dates of several months prior
and our immediate assumption was that
dr lyman at the very moment when we
were marketing the treasury stock under a
binding contract which forbade him or any
one else to dispose of any bullfrog rush
stock under any circumstances was clan-
destinely getting rid of these shares mr
weir it appeared had neglected to seg-
regate dr lymans certificates from those
shipped him by the trust company an
other hypothesis was that those certificates
had never been sold at all but had
merely been received from dr lyman 
be reforwarded to us in order to claim a
refund for what we had never been paid
for
  of course we returned the draft unpaid
but that didnt end the incident my part-
ner mr sullivan took it upon himself to
wire his sentiments to the man who had
tried to turn the trick as follows you
are so crooked that if you swallowed a ten-
penny nail and vomited it would come
out a corkscrew that was larrys
homely way of expressing his opinion
goldfields year of wind and
dust had brightened into the glow
of summer the still breath oi
august was diffused through the thin mild
air of the high altitude this thin air
which nearly two years before had prompted
a camp wit to comment on the birth of my
news bureau to the effect that the high
elevation was ideal for the concoction of tht
visionary stuff that dreams are made of
appeared unprophetic there was plenty
of concrete evidence of the yellow metal to
be seen production from the mines was in-
creasing daily and money from speculators
was pouring into the camp from every di-
rection
  a mining-stock boom of gigantic propor-
tions was brewing mohawk of goldfield
which was incorporated for x shares
of the par value of si each and which in
the early days went begging at  cents a
share was now selling around  a share on
the san francisco stock exchange the
goldfield stock exchange and the new
york curb other goldfields had advanced
in proportion combination fraction was
up from  cents to siis silver pick
which was promoted at  cents a share
was selling at  cents jumbo extension
advanced from  to  red top which
was offered in large blocks at  cents per
share two years before was selling at 
jumbo advanced from  cents to 
atlanta moved up from  to  fifty
my adventures with ypur-monev

others representing prospects enjoyed pro-
portionate advances
  the sullivan stocks were light in the
swim jumping jack was in hot demand
on-the san francisco stock exchange and
new york curb at  cents stray dog at
 cents indian camp at  cents and
eagles nest at  cents subscribers to
indian camp couid cash in at a profit of
more than  per cent
  the country gave indications of going
goldfield crazy my goldfield publicity
bureau was working overtime james
hopper the noted fiction writer and tnaga-
zinist ably assisted by harry hedrick and
other competent mining reporters was on
the job  and doing yeoman service the
aews-columns of the daily papers of the
country teemed with stories of the goldfield
excitement
   people began to liock into the camp in
droves the town was a scene of bustle and
life motley groups assembled at every
corner and discussed the great production
being made from the mohawk and the ter-
rific market advances being chronicled by
mining stocks representing all sorts and
descriptions of goldfield properties when-
ever hayes and monnette owners of the
m ohawk lease appeared  the streets they
were followed by a mixed throng of the
riffraff of the camp who hailed them open-
mouthed as wonders
  the madness of speculation in mining
shares in the camp itself was beginning to
exceed in its intensity the exciting play
at the gaming tables there was a con-
tagion of excitement even in the open spaces
of the street
   at each meeting of the goldfieljl stock
exchange the boardroom was crowded
the sessions were tempestuous every step
and every hallway leading to the room was
jammed with men and women over whose
faces all lights and shades of expression
sit ted the bidding for mining issues was
frantic profits mounted high every-
body seemed to be buying and no one
appeared to be willing to sell except at a
big advance over the last quotations cas-
le-building and fumes of fancy usurped
reason
   bank deposits - were increasing by leaps
wnd bounds the camp was rapidly be-
coming druni vith the joy of fortune
making
  manhattan now shone mostly in the re-
flected glory of goldfield but manhattan
stocks were booming this enabled the
sullivan trust company to dispose of
nearly all of its manhattan securities which
had been carried over after -the san fran-
cisco catastrophe and to pile up a great
reserve of cash
  a big demand was developing for shares
in fairview companies nevada hills of
fairview was selling on the stock exchanges
and curbs at  per share or a valuation of
 for the mine only a few months
before it had fallen into goldfield and salt
lake hands for  fairview eagles
nest for which subscriptions had been
accepted at  cents per share by the sulli-
van trust company was selling at  cents
on the san francisco stock exchange
  the sullivan trust company announced
the offering of x shares embracing
the entire capitalization of the fairview
hailstone mining company at  cents
the stock was purchased by us at  cents
we sold out in a week san francisco and
salt lake were the principal buyers and it
was unnecessary even to insert an advertise-
ment offering the stock the brokers fell
over one another to underwrite the offering
by telegraph
  prize fights and mining promotion
ttor a fortnight there was a lull in
-f news of sensational gold discoveries
but the approaching gans-nelson fight
which was arranged to be held in gold-
field on labor day september  fur-
nished sufficient exciting reading matter for
the newspapers throughout the land to keep
the goldfield news pot boiling the sulli-
van trust company had guaranteed the
promoters of the fight against loss to the
extent of  and other camp interests
put up  more gans the fighter
was without funds to put up his forfeit and
make the match and the sullivan trust
company had also advanced the money for
that purpose mr sullivan became gans
manager when gans arrived in town mr
sullivan interviewed him to this effect
  gans if you lose this fight theyll kili
you here in goldfield theyll think you laid
down i and my friends are going to bet a
ton of money on you and you must win
  gans promised he would do his best
  tex rickard and his friends wagered
on nelson the cashier of he sullivan

adventure
trust company was instructed to cover all
the money that any one wanted to bet at
odds of  to  and  to  on gans we
taking the gans end a sign was hung in
the window reading a large sum of
money has been placed with us to  wager
on gans nelson money promptly covered
inside-- mr sullivan was in his glory
prize-fighting suited his tastes better than
high finance and he was as busy as a one-
armed paper-hanger with the itch
  an argument arose about who should
referee the fight tex rickard nomi-
nated george siler of chicago and battling
nelson promptly  kd the selection mr
sullivan objected he sent for the news-
paper men and gave out an interview in
which he declared that mr siler was preju-
diced against gans because he was a negro
and he did not believe mr siler would give
gans a fair shake
  rice whispered sullivan after the
newspaper men left the office i am four-
ftushing about that race-prejudice yam but
it wont do any harm siler needs the job
hes broke and ill make him eat out of my
hand before ill agree to let him referee the
fight theyve already invited siler to
confe here and i wont be able to get another
referee but ill beat them at their own game
when siler gets here ill thrash matters out
with him and agree to his selection but first
i want him to know whos boss
  mr siler arrived an hour later he was
closeted with mr sullivan in one of the back
rooms of the trust company offices the
dialogue which ensued was substantially as
follows
  mr siler youve got me dead wrong
sullivan i want to referee this fight and
 want you to withdraw your objections
  mr sullivan well ive heard from
sources which i cant tell you anything
about that you dont like gans and i cant
stand for you
  mr siler i need this fight and ive
come all the way from chicago in the ex-
pectation of refereeing it i couldnt give
gans the worst of it if i wanted to he is
a clean fighter and i would not have an
excuse
  mr sullivan gans is a clean fighter
but nelson isnt he uses dirty tactics and
he is a fouler for fair
  mr siler li he does any fouling in this
fight ill-make him quit or declare him out
  mr sullivan what guarantee have i
got that you wont give gans the worst
of it
  mr siler well ill tell you sullivan if
you withdraw your objections ill guaran-
tee you that ill be this fair if nelson
uses foul tactics or if he dont ill show my
fairness to gaas by giving him the benefit
of every doubt now will that satisfy you
  mr sullivan yes itll satisfy me but
remember if you dont keep your  word
youll have jut as much chance of getting
out of this town alive as gans will havc-
if he lays down you understand
  mr siler yes
on the afternoon of the fight the
sullivan trust company cast ac-
counts and found that it had wa-
gered  on gans against a total of
 put up on nelson
  mr sullivan after talking it over with
me had accepted the honorary position of
announcer at the ringside though not of
aristocratic mien larry was of fine
physique with a bold bluff countenance
and i felt confident thatr-his cordial manner
would appeal to the assemblage
  just before the prize-fighters entered the
ring larry jumped into the arena
standing above the mass of moving heads
and holding up both hands he hailed the
great crowd thus	-
  gentlemen we are assembled in this
grand arena to witness a square fight this
fight is held under the auspices of tex
rickard a man of great acclumuations-
  larry did not get much farther the
audience laughed and then jeered and
hooted until it became hoarse his words
were drowned in the tempest of derision
i was informed by friends who were close
to the ringside that he went on in the same-
rambling way for a few minutes more but
i cant testify to that fact from my own
knowledge because acclumuations and
areno overcame me and i stopped up
my ears
  the fight progressed for twenty rounds
or more when  began to doubt the ability
of gans to win mr sullivan had a com-
missioner at the ringside who up to this
time had been betting anybody and every-
body all the  to  that was wanted against
nelson i hailed mr sullivan at the ring-
side
  this doesnt look like the cinch for gans
you said it would be i whispered
	-	 i
my adventures with yurmoney
  t

  wait a minute mr sullivan replied
id go to gans comer as soon as this
round is over and find out whats doing
with him
  mr sullivan went over to gans corner
and came back
  gans says he cant win this fight but
he wont lose hes a good ring-general and
hell pull us  out dont bet any more
money im going to stay close to the ring-
side watch close
  it was apparent during the next ten
rounds that gans was availing himself of
every opportunity to impress upon the
audience that nelson was inclined to use
dirty fighting tactics and soon nelson was
being hooted for foul fighting gans on
the other hand appeared to be fighting
zair and like a gentleman soon it was evi-
j dent that gans had won the sympathy and
favor of the audience
  the fight had continued through the
fortieth round when mr sullivan again
repaired to gans corner and held another
animated whispered conversation with him
  in the forty-second round gans of a
sudden went down rolled over and hold-
ing his hand under his belt let out a yell of
anguish that indicated to the excited multi-
tude that nelson had fouled him fright-
fully
  in another instant mr sullivan had
ciambered into the ring confusion reigned
the audience was on its feet pushing hi
fist into the referees face mr sullivan
cried now siler you saw that foul
didnt you its a foul isnt it gans wins
doesnt he
  all of this happened quick as a flash
mr siler pale as a ghost whispered some-
thing inaudibly
  mr sullivan turning to the assemblage
and raising both arms to the skies yelled
gentlemen the referee declares gans
the winner on a foul
  the audience acclaimed his decision with
salvos of applause there did not appear
to be a man in the crowd who doubted a
oul had been committed although nelson
it once protested his innocence
  next day mr sullivan told me that in
or near the twenty-fourth round gans had
broken his wrist and knew he could not win
he fight by a knockout he also said that
gans went down in the forty-second round
in order to save the day
    v  that fight sairi mr sullivan
i told gans while he was- in his corner
after the fortieth round that if he lost he
would be laying down on his friends thal
he had the audience with him- and that il
was time to take advantage of nelson-
foul tactics
  this was my first experience in prize-
fighting and my last my sympathies
were however with the winner gans
tactics throughout up to thelast round wen-
gentlemanly and those of nelson unfair
even the partisans of nelson who had
wagered on him agreed after the fight thal
the battle put up by the negro up to the
forty-second round was a white mans
fight and he was entitled to win
  nelson had been guilty of foul tactics in
almost every round but the probabilities
are that gans was not disabled by a foul
blow in the forty-second round and that he
took advantage of the sentiment in his
favor which had been created by his manly
battle up to that time to go down at a
psychological moment 
  i saw mr siler after the contest and he
appeared pleased that his decision was so
well received but he assured me that if he
was invited to referee another bout in any
mining camp he would decline the job
spl the sullivan trust company 
s course won a big bet on the result
       but it lost a bigger one as an out-
come of the battle on the very next day
the impression created by announcer sulli-
vans attempt to reach lofty flights of elo-
quence in his speech to the fight-audience
was bad for the trust company and il
required the use of over  on the day
following to meet the flood of selling orders
in sullivan stocks which poured into the
san francisco stock exchange
      the year of bio figures
i soon recouped these stock-market losses
at about four oclock one afternoon a
few days afterward a miner who had been al
work during the day on the loftus-sweeney
lease of the combination fraction called at
the office of the trust company and asked
me to buy  shares of combination
fraction stock for him he divulged to me
that just as he was coming off shift he had
learned that a prodigious strike of high-
grade ore had been made at depth com-
bination fraction had closed that afveraoor

adventure
on the san francisco stock exchange with
sales at  i went out on the street and
proceeded to buy all the combination frac-
tion in sight in half an hour i had cor-
ralled about  shares at an average of
 an hour later the owners of the
lease obtained the information on which i
was working and by eight oclock that
night when the goldfield stock exchange
began its evening session the price had
jumped to  within a week there-
after the price skyrocketed to  and at
this figure i took profits of nearly 
had i held on a little longer i could have
doubled that profit for combination frac-
tion a few weeks later sold at higher
than 	-
  the combination fraction strike was fol-
lowed by a number of others and the boom
gathered force by october goldfield sil-
ver pick had advanced to  per share up
 per cent goldfield red top was sell-
ing at  jumbo at  and mohawk at 
showing profits of from  to  per
cent others had gained proportionately
in fact there were over twenty goldfield
securities listed on the exchange that showed
the public a stock-market profit of anywhere
from  per cent to  per cent
  mining machinery of every description
was being shipped into camp and for half
a mile around the combination mine the
landscape of assembled gallows-frames re-
sembled a great producing oil field there
were signs of mining activity everywhere
for four miles east of the combination
mine and six miles south every inch of ground
had been located claims situated miles
away from the productive area were chang-
ing hands hourly at high figures
  the sullivan stocks kept pace in the
markets with the other booming securities
and it was plain that the trust company
was riding on a tidal wave of success our
profits exceeded  at this period
and we were just eight months old
  in quick succession the sullivan trust
company promoted the lou dillon gold-
field mining company at  cents per share
a valuation of  for the property
which cost  and the silver pick ex-
tension which cost  at the same
figure netting several hundred thousand
dollars profit on these two transactions
options to purchase the lou dillon and
silver pick extension which were situated
within  feet of the combination mine
had been in possession of the sullivan trust
company for months and had increased in
value to such an extent that- on the day
the subscriptions were opened in goldfield
for lou dillon at  cents per share a pros-
pector named phoenix who had received
 from the sullivan trflst company
for the entire property subscribed for
	shares or a tenth interest in the
enterprise paying  therefor
  it was the rule of the sullivan trust com-
pany to open subscriptions in goldfield on
the day its advertising copy left the camp by
mail for the east newspapet publishers
were always instructed to publjsh the adver-
tisements which were generally of the full-
page variety on the day following receipt
in the case of lou dillon if became neces-
sary to telegraph all newspapers east of
chicago not to publish the advertisement
because of oversubscription before the copy
reached them and in the cgeof silver pick
extension the orders to publish-the adver-
tisements were canceled by telegraph before
the mail carrying the copy reached kansas
city san francisco los angeles and salt
lake subscribed for  per cent-of the en-
tire offering of lou dillonand silver pick
extension and goldfield for  per cent
as a matter of fact had we desiredw could
have sold the entire offerings in goldfield
tonopah and reno without inserting any
advertisements so great was the excite-
ment in the state itself
 at this period the combined monthly
payrolls of the mining companies promoted
by the sullivan trust company totaled in
excess of  and the properties were
reaching a forward state of development
it was early autumn in goldfield
warm dry and dusty and never a
cloud in the sky i was at my desk
eighteen hours a day and liked my job
things were coming our way
  the sullivan trust company was in poli-
tics mr sullivan was popular with the
miners and governor sparks -was a large
asset of the trust company because he had
been allowing the use of his name as presi
dent of the mining companies promoted by
it nevertheless when the state election
approached the governor had no money for
campaign expenses he telegraphed the
trust company from carson
   will not stand for renomination
 we replied you are certain tc be
my adventures with yaur-money

elected and you will be renominated by
acclamation if you accept
  i woit run unless you guarantee my
election he telegraphed
  we answered we guarantee
  the governor was renominated by the
democrats the republicans placed in
nomination j f mitchell a mining engi-
neer and mine owner who was very popu-
lar among mining men
  there were thousands of miners domi-
ciled in goldfield the western federation
of miners dominated
   -sullivan i said isnt it a cinch these
miners will vote the democratic ticket be-
cause mitchell has been put forward by the
mine owners is it necessary to spend any
money with the western federation
not a dollar replied mr sullivan
theres a fneeting of the executive com-
mittee to-morrow im going to be around
when they meet without spending a dol-
lar ill bring home the bacon watch me 
sullivan reported to me the next day
that he hadsucceeded in his mission
  i didnt attend the meeting he said
but i did see the main squeeze he told
me that a contribution to the miners
hospital would be gratefully accepted but
that eyen that was not necessary and that
sparks would win in a walk
  the only campaign money advanced by
the sullivan trust company was given to
mrv sullivan to go to reno he asked for
 and he used it in conducting open
house on the first floor of the golden hotel
meeting people and greeting them reno
appeared to be a republican stronghold
and mr sullivan by baiting the catholics
against the protestants succeeded in hold-
ing down the republican majority to an
extent that was wofully insufficient to
overcome the democratic majority rolled
up in goldfield with the aid of the miners
governor sparks was reelected by a hand-
some majority had the occasion de-
manded it we would have tapped a bar-
rel but it was not necessary
the stoky ot goldfield consolidated
rumors were rife in goldfield of a mer-
ger of mammoth proportions which
 as said to be on the tapis great -as were
the gold discoveries in camp they did not
ustify the terrific advances being chroni-
cled in the stock-market and it was appar-
ent that something extraordinary must be
hatching to justify the markets action
  george wingfield who had enjoyed a
meteoric career rising withinfiye years
from a faro dealer in tonopa to the-svner
ship of control in the mohawk and many
other mining companies and to part owner-
ship of the leading goldfield bank john s
cook  company which was then credited
with having  on deposit was said
to be engineering the deal the names of
the properties were not given nor the fig-
ures it occurred to me that in any merger
that was made the jumbo and red top
because of their central location must be
included i sought out charles d taylor
who with his brother h l taylor and
capt j b menardi owned the control of
these properties he asked  per share
for his stock and that of his partners-all
or none mr taylor had walked into the
camp as a prospector most of his nights
were spent at the gaming tables and he was
reported to be an easy mark for profes-
sional gamblers i put mr sullivan on his
trail mr sullivan reported to me that
mr wingfield was hobnobbing with mr
taylor
  get an option on these properties from
taylor i told mr sullivan
next morning i met mr sullivan
he held in his hands  shares
of jumbo selling at  per share
on the goldfield stock exchange
  i won it in a poker game last night with
taylor and wingfield he said i have
an oral option on the property good for
three days at  but if you leave it to
me ill win these properties from him play-
ing cards
  i	did not see mr sullivan again for a
week next i heard of him he had fallen
off the water-wagon and was reported to
be celebrating the event in tonopah while
mr sullivan was kidding himself about
his poker-playing ability mr wingfield
had come to terms with mr taylor and
had bought the control of jumbo and red
top at an average price of  per share
that explained mr sullivans lapse how-
ever i blamed myself mr sullivan was
no match for mr wingfield in any game
from stud-poker to fitting a pistol-duel
mr wingfield can outwit outmaneuver
and outgeneral a hundred like larry
both companies had been capitalized

adventure
for i-shares the sale required
that a fortune be paid over mr wing-
field paid a small sum down and mr tay-
lor placed the stock of both of these com-
panies in escrow in the johfi s cook 
company bank the balance to be paid a
month later
the purchase of control of the
jumbo and red top by the firm of
wingfield and nixon signalized the
beginning of a stock-market campaign for
higher prices that stands unprecedented
or intensity in the history of mining-stock
speculation in this country since the great
boom of the comstock lode in -
  the market for all listed goldfield stocks
was made to boil and sizzle day in and day
out until jumbo and red top had been
ballooned from  to  per share laguna
from  cents to  goldfield mining from
 cents to  and mohawk from  to
 within three weeks the advance in
market price of the issued capitalization
of this quintet alone represented the differ-
ence between  and 
  a few days before top prices were reached
it was officially announced that the merger
of mohawk red top jumbo goldfield
mining and laguna into the goldfield con-
solidated mines company had been made
on the basis of  for each outstanding
share of mohawk  for red top  for
jumbo  for goldfield mining and  for
laguna it was also given out that the
promoters wingfield and nixon had al-
ioted themselves  in stock of the
merged companies as a promoters fee
right on top of this came an announcement
that the combination mine had been turned
into the merger for  in cash and
stock and it was learned that go-betweens
had made a profit of  on the deal
-y securing an option on the property for

  in short a merger was put through of
properties and stocks the issued capitaliza-
tion of which was selling in the markets on
the day the merger was conceived for
sxioooooo at a valuation of 
and in addition the promoters received
s	for their services had the
properties been merged on the basis of their
selling prices three weeks prior the equiva-
lent value of the  shares of merger
stock would have been a fraction above
 as it stood under the ballooning proc-
ess the market value was  which was
the par
  at the time of the merger these were the
conditions that ruled at the mines
  the mohawk appraised at 
had produced under lease in the neighbor-
hood of  of which less than
 had found its way into the treasury
of the mohawk mining company the bal-
ance going to the leasers the leasers had
high-graded the property to a fare-you-
well and less than r worth of high-
grade remained in sight although it was
conceded on every side that the leasers had
not attempted nor were they able during
the period of their leasehold to block out
systematically and put into sight all of the
ore in the mine large but indefinite
prospective value therefore attached to mo-
hawk in addition to the tonnage in sight
  the laguna for which  had
been paid in stock did not have a pound of
ore in sight and there were no indications
that it would ever have any
  coldfield mining scene of a sensational
production during the early days of the
camp appraised at  more had
fizzled out as a producer
  jumbo taken in for  for a year
previous had produced little or no ore most
of the time being exhausted by the manage-
ment in sinking a deep shaft and it had less
than  in sight
  red top valued at another 
had in excess of  worth of medium
grade ore blocked out
  wingfield and nixon were also heavily
interested in columbia mountain sand-
storm blue bull crackerjack red hills
oro booth milltown kendall may queen
and other goldfield stocks no sooner did
the five stocks forming the merger begin to
show such startling market advances than
the ballooning tendency manifested itself in
wingfield and nixons miscellaneous list
and all of them showed phenomenal gains
soon the entire list of goldfield tonopah
manhattan bullfrog and other nevada
mining securities listed on the san fran-
cisco stock exchange and traded in on the
exchanges and curbs of the country felt the
force of the terrific rises and sympatheti-
cally they skyrocketed to unheard-of
levels
  to convey an idea as to how far the prices
of these stocks were moved up beyond their
intrinsic worth as a result of the balloon-
my adventures with your money

ing process of the merger i give some
comparisons
  columbia mountain sold during the boom
at above  it is now selling at  cents
blue bull crackerjack oro booth red
hills milltown kendall conqueror hi-
ll	emia ethel kewanas sandstorm and
may- queen sold at an average of  cents
during the boom they are now selling at an
average of less than  cents a hundred
other goldfield securities which were in
eager demand at the zenith of the spectacu-
lar movement at prices ranging from 
cents to  can now be purchased at from
 to s cents per share while many others
that were hopefully bought by an over-
wrought public at all sorts of figures are now
not quoted at all
at the height of the frenzy
the difference between the market price
of listed nevada stocks on november
  and that of to-day is in excess of
 a fair estimate of the pub-
lics real-money loss in the listed division
is 
  nor was this all of the damage that
was done vftien excitement in goldfields
listed stocks reached a frenzy wild-cat-
ters operating from the cities got into
harness and within three months in the
neighborhood of  companies owning
in most instances properties situated miles
from the proved zone in goldfield or
in unproved camps near goldfield were
foisted on the public for 
more
  the fact that mohawk which in the
early days of goldfield could have been pur-
chased at  cents had advanced to  and
had shown purchasers a profit of  per
cent that laguna had advanced in less
thantwo years from  cents to  that
jumbo and red top selling at  could
have been purchased a year or two before
at around  cents that goldfield mining
which had in the early days been peddled
around the camp at  cents had moved up
to  etc gaye the wild-catters an argu-
ment that was convincing to gulls in every
town and hamlet in the union and the
harvest was immense not one of the
	wild-cats has made good and every
dollar invested has been lost
  u will be noted from the reckoning as
given that about as muchmoney was lost
in the listed stocks of the camps as in the
unlisted cats and dogs
  as a matter of fact veteran mining-stock
buyers in camp and out f the camp lost
as much hard cash as didfelje unsophisti-
cated san francisco which owes its
opulence of years gone by to successful
mining endeavor was probably hit as hard
as any other city in the union san fran-
cisco thought it knew the game and it con-
fined its operations to the stocks listed on
the exchange where the comstocks are
traded in but san francisco did not know
the inside of the merger deal as it is now
known to every schoolboy in nevada
  the operation on the inside was this
wingfield and nixon owned the john s
cook  company bank in goldfield and
they owned the control of a number of min-
ing companies which were of little or nc
account as well as having acquired the con-
trol of the biggest mine in camp during
the height of the boom which they engi-
neered to swing the merger they disposed of
millions of shares of an indiscriminate lot of
companies and used the proceeds to take
over jumbo and red top and to take up
their outstanding contracts in mohawk and
other integrals of the merger they like-
wise were able during the ballooning proc-
ess to dispose of much mohawk at from
 to  much jumbo at from  to 
much red top at from  to  that cost
them very considerably less than this and
in this way were enabled to finance their
deal to a finish
  i have just pointed out that in order to
accomplish the merger it was necessary that
the market in all goldfield securities in
which the promoters were interested be
stimulated in order to enable unloading by
the insiders before some of the very large
payments became due this being accom-
plished and the payments having been
made the promoters sought to establish a
market for merger shares at or around par
in order to accomplish this the goldfield
bank in which the promoters were heav-
ily interested stimulated speculation and
managed to spread a feeling of security by
announcing its willingness to loan from 
to  per cent of par on merger shares
  all goldfield fell for this and the camp
went broke as a result
  within eighteen months thereafter gold-
field consolidated sold down to  in the
markets and margin-traders and borrowers

adventure
who had y it up the stock as collateral to
purchase more were butchered the stock
has since paid  in dividends its
recent low in the market was s per
share and its high  a share
  it must be evident that wingfield and
nixon both of whom are multimillionaires
as the result of their mining-stock operations
in goldfield were directly and indirectly
important factors in the loss by the public
of  as set forth above it is
admitted that less than  worth of
ore had been developed as a reserve at the
time  worth of stock in the
merger was issued and a market manufac-
tured to hold the stock at this fictitious
price-level it is not of particular interest
that goldfield consolidated by reason of
sensationally rich mine developments at
depth has since given promise of returning
to stockholders an amount almost equal to
par for their shares and that it now appears
that those who were able to weather the
intervening declines may in the end be out
only the interest on their money
  this is also evident goldfield con-
solidated stockholders had two chances
at the outset they could break even or
lose-break even on their investment if
the mine made good in a sensational way
which was a big gamble at the time or
lose if the mine didnt they could notjwin
  mr nixon is a united states senator
from nevada he is also president of the
nixon national bank of reno nevada
lie held both of these positions at the time
the merger was made and it was largely
because of mr nixons political and finan-
cial position that the daring market opera-
tions of the mergerers which led up to the
merger proved so successful
  in the nevada mining news of may 
 circulation  an interview ap-
peared with united states senator nixon of
nevada vouched for as follows
  the manuscript of the interview was submitted
to and approved by the senator unchanged by
one jot or tittle it is printed just as it came from
his hands even now the senator holds a carbon
of the original manuscript and may brand uswith
it if we have broken the faith we pledged
  i quote from the senators interview as
it appeared in that issue of the nevada min-
ing news
   what do you estimate the ultimate earnings of
goldfield consolidated will be was asked
   consolidated will be a bigger producer i should
say three or four years from now than it will be
one year from now senator nixon replied  and i
believe i am conservative when i say that the
property will be eventually earning  net
monthly
  then as an investment the stock is
easily a  stock
  that is a minimum estimate of its
future value i should say was the
response
  as to that interview
  mr nixon said that within three or foui
years the time limit is up  would be
a minimum price for the shares thej
touched  only once since then or one-
half of his estimate shortly after the inter-
view was given they sold down as low as 
  he said further that the mines would
ultimately earn at the rate of 
a month this statement also has fallen
far short of fulfilment
  since george s nixon as president of the
goldfield consolidated company gave this
interview according to his own statement
he has disposed of all of his holdings and at
an average price it is believed of less than
 a share
  this is only a superficial rendering of the
big event in goldfields history but it is
sufficient to furnish an example of the effect
of get-rich-quick influences that radiate
from high places and separate the public
from millions upon millions without being
called to account
  the dear american public has been
falling for this kind of insidious brand of
get-rich-quick dope for years it is being
gulled into losing millions through its fetish
worship of promoters with millions who are
really the get-rich-quicks of the day that
are dangerous
  greenwater a rich mans camp in which
the public sank from  to -
 during three months that marked
the zenith of the goldfield boom is another
case in point where a confiding investing
public followed a deceiving light and was
led to ruthless slaughter

the
sac
        here was one flat cap above a
jutting rock three hundred yards
away at which jenks had been
shooting fruitlessly for half an
hour thirty-two times he had fired he dis-
covered by an examination of the empty
ioops in his cartridge-belt and six times he
had been rewarded by seeing the flat cap
disappear but always it reappeared in the
same place and always a bullet zumtned
through the air above jenks head or
whanged into the ground to one side or the
other of him
  he felt a deepening animosity against
the wearer of that flat cap this unknown
might have the grace to get in the way of
one of jenks bullets or send one of his own
into jenks vitals that at least would put
an abrupt end to this endless lining of sights
and pulling of trigger at the present rate
it could result only in jenks running out
of cartridges and being forced to crawl back
uncomfortably to where there might be
more three months enlightening experi-
ence had convinced jenks that extra ammu-
nition was always hard to find when it was
most to be desired he did not go out of
his way to lay this up against the gigantic
system of which he formed a part but ac-
cepted it as another galling fact in a chain
of unpleasant realities which went to make
up an unsatisfactory universe
   why dont you stick your hat up on the
end of your bayonet and see if you cant
make that chap break cover  suggested a
mild voice in jenks ear
  the private looked around to see a man
in drab clothes a slouch hat and spiral put-
tees lying prone on the earth behind him
he recognized him as one of the war-corre-
spondents whom the army was kept busy
chasing away from the front where they
could really see things and so write authen-
tic reports of what was going on
  well in the first place jenks answered
argumentatively i dont want that hat
shot full of holes its a good hat and now
and then it rains in this country
  after saying which he sniffed in high dis-
dain and proceeded to follow the others ad-
vice employing a chance stick instead of
his bayonet for the purpose the strata-
gem succeeded the first indications of
success were so violent that the war-corre-
spondent curled up his long legs and hugged
the ground closer for the owner of the
flat cap rattled a magazine full of shots
through the air around jenks hat then
failing to hit it he rose to his full height for
a better shot sent the hat skimming through
the air and got one of the  caliber
nickel-jacketed bullets from jenks rifle
squarely in the pit of the stomach jenks
and the journalist witnessed the fall of the
man in the flat cap with quiet enthusiasm
  through the middle i low announced
jenks
  very pretty complimented the drab-
clad man and they relapsed into silence
there might have been other flat
caps sticking above the gray rocks for
jenks to shoot at but he was in no
mood to hunt for them he laid the rifle to
one side wet his finger and laid it on the
barrel which sizzled sharply jenks swore



adventure
waved- his blistered finger and opened the
breech to let the air through the barrel more
freely
  thirty rounds and you could boil coffee
ou em he complained to the drab man
  the latter nodded agreeably and offered
jenks a cigarfette from a leather case jenks
took it in his big brown blunt-nailed fin-
gers and looked at it critically
  tryin to get a real smoke out of a
cigarette he averred is like tryin to
plow a forty-acre field with a penknife
 the newspaper man laughed and
scratched a match on the sole of his boot
   you come off a farm  he asked casually
  jenks stared at the end of his glowing
cigarette and ndqded soberly several times
  and god knows why he added seri-
ously
  maybe you came because of the same
reason that drove me suggested the jour-
nalist i wanted to see w-hat this business
was like
  the wagging of jenks head was a de-
cided negative
  nope hesaid i aint got no such
sized curiosity i got cured o that when 
was a kid i wanted to see just how hard
a cow could kick i found out all right
and i cant say i was any better off for
knowin nope i didnt care none what
war was like i didnt think it was goin to
be fun i just sort of thought i ought to
go dunno why zactly old man white
come round and talked to a lot of us fellers
down at the corners bout our duty you
oughter go he says its your country
callin ye the place that give birth to ye
the land of yer fathers its yer duty
  jenks paused to snap the butt of iris
cigarette at the stalk of a milkweed
  now me an the u-nited states aint
never got very close together he con-
tinued i alius felt that if either me or
the country died overnight we wouldnt
notice it none if nobody told us but old
man white kind o set me to thinkin i
never took no interest in politics never
went out to vote-didnt even enroll ah
the u-nited states meant to me was an
eagle on the few dollars that come my way
old man white used to tell me i ought to
be ashamed of myself said i want no
citizen maybe he was right iwaskeepin
my woman an the kids fed an runnin my
farm but thats bout as far as my bein a
citizen did go i guess
  jenks was interrupted again by the clat-
ter of a short-lived fusillade along another
portion of the thin skirmish-line hidden by
a twist of the ridge he raised his eyes from
the ground to watch the distant passage of
an officers patrol of cavalrymen in wide
flapping hats the correspondent held out
the leather case again and jenks selected
another cigarette less critically
  theyre so durned small he said as
though to apologize for smoking another
that a feller has to smoke another to re-
member what the last one tasted like yes
i guess old man white drove me off here
i got to thinkin bout things a whole lot
and i just made up my mind that maybe
the debt was on my side i hadnt done
very much for the country and i judged
from what i see in the papers that about a
hundred thousand chaps about my size an
age would come in pretty handy so i sent
millie an the kids to her folks an just come
along
  he stopped abruptly as though having
reached a natural conclusion and sat star-
ing out at the hot ridge opposite its tum-
bling rugged rocks climbing high above thc-
level on which he sat his companion
looked at him narrowly and shifted his
position on the warm earth
  glad you came the correspondent
asked lazily chewing his words as he
shifted the cigarette to the other corner of
his mouth with his tongue so that he might
not have to move his hands
  no answered jenks with surprising
alacrity i aint i hadnt ought to have
done it three months now ive grubbed
around this landscape shootin at people
i aint got nothin against and gettin shot
at by them now theres that chap a few
minutes back i was layin for him sames
ive laid for woodchucks i was plain mad

states wouldnt miss me none if i lit out
right now no sir if i could sneak past
that cussed little lieutenant i could go home
an never be missed but hed see me
sure
  youd desert then if you could
asked the man in drab
  jenks flared with sudden anger not
by a-sight he snorted i aint that
sort i come out for the war an im goin
to stay
  his companion nodded with a show of
understanding there was a bundle -of
notes in his inside pocket which ought to
reach the ware but they could wait a few
minutes
  well suppose he persisted you had
the choice between doing some big thing to-
morrow-getting to the top of that ridge
well say or going home which would you
do
  home with an honorable discharge
queried jenks
  yes
  jenks rubbed a stubbly chin an instant
puckering his lips about the frayed end of
the cigarette
  id go home he announced finally
yeah thats what id do all right id go
home i know what youre thinkin mister
but just look a-here i leave my farm an
people an come out here to go soldierin
maybe i go through all right then i go
back home an what happens do i get

em they dont need me here halfs much
as that gal an the kids does theres a
lot of chaps here could do bill jenks sol-
dierin lor him but they couldnt go back
zn run his farm i aint needed 
  he threw the butt of the second cigarette
at the same milkweed
  old man white he concluded give
me a rum go i aint done my duty i 
  the newspaper man rolled over and
started to crawl away to file his sketchy
despatches he tossed jenks a third cig-
arette as he prepared to go
  dont try to figure it out he advised
that question is only about as old as the
institution of war-which is pretty average
hoary smoke another stick on it so
long
  slong answered jenks and watched
him crawl off through the grass
it was not on the cards thatfwi-iam
jenks should go in search of fresh
cartridges to fill the gaping loops in his
belt his successful shot had been almost the
last of the long rambling skirmish which had
been but the prelude of the serious business
that was in the making while jenks was
still caressing the hot barrel of his rifle and
wondering what he could do with himself
until ordered to move in some direction
the hills rocked under the first shocks of a
tremendous artillery duel the thin skir-
mish-line of which jenks formed a part wa
enfolded by the great masses of dun-coloreo
infantry which swept up behind them and
the whole mass was spread out in hollows
like great windrows or sent trickling off
through steep scrubby defiles while the
batteries thundered over their heads to cut
a way for them
  for days tired wide-eyed officers had
studied the black line across the map which
stood for the ridge that jenks and the
sun-baked skirmishers had watched at
the end of those days the ways and means
for the taking of that ridge had been devised
and the buttons at headquarters had been
pressed which sent all the scattered units of
the great army tumbling forward in appar-
ently aimless confusion
  while the black ridge became hazy with
the smoke of its defending batteries and
scarred from the crashing explosions of
shells the masses of dirty-looking infantry
edged and crept in from every side as the
red flashes from the ridge batteries grew
fewer and the officers through their binoc-
ulars could see the gun-teams looking like
ants in the hazy distance frantically drag-
ging the battered guns out of the rain of
shells the movement of the brown waves
 
adventure
of infantry grew faster more certain un-
guessed lines and straggling blocks of men
sprang from cover deep-slashed defiles
spouted forth brown columns and the con-
verging waves washed and surged about the
loot of the black ridge
  jenks found himself carried along in a
mad frantic tumble up the same slopes
that he had grown so tired of watching
for blurred panting minutes he struggled
over slippery footing through saplings and
low bushes the slope grew steeper and he
found himself clutching at grass for sup-
port-grass so slender that he knew it
would not hold his weight but which he
felt would help him an inch higher and so
make another inch possible his breath
came shorter and shorter until it hurt his
laboring lungs sharply the perspiration
streamed down his face and gathered in
uncomfortable pools under his eyebrows
above all other things he desired to lie
down and pant until he could regain his
breath but the sight of other men-des-
perately tired as he was but still struggling
on-kept him at work
  as yet the fire of the enemy had not com-
menced to hunt them out the crash of the
artillery was still loud in his ears but the
beating volleys seemed still on other slopes
of the ridge jenks breath began to come
more easily the second wind had
caught him when he needed it most and he
found that his brain was now capable of
considering something besides the placing
of his feet and the stabbing of the air at his
chest
  he wondered hazily why he was racking
he very heart out of him in this mad rush
up a dark mountain at the top he would
only kill more men in flat caps-if he ever
reached the top he thought of the man he
iiad shot and no longer felt a species of
nausea at the remembrance of the dark
still figure hanging over the rock with such
pathetic limpness
  he glanced hastily at the other men
around him they were all strangers in
the rush of the attack he had become sepa-
rated from the men of his own company
yet he felt no unease no panicky desire to
find the familiar figures with which he had
toiled and fought for three months these
f-ushed hot eager faces about him were not
strange after all he knew that he must
look very much like them at the moment
and they were just plain ordinary men like
himself with tilings waiting for them at
home they had no more desire than he
to reach the top of the hill and go stabbing
with their bayonets among those dark-
skinned men in the flat caps
  and yet they went-ran with all the
strength of mind and body as though reach-
ing the crest were the one thing in life to be
done aye a thing greater than life itself
for all of these men would not reach the top
  jenks had always been careful of himself
he had been commended by his officers for
his ability to take cover and keep under it
without damaging his usefulness well he
had not wanted to die he had feared death
as a healthy man with a deep unanalyzed
joy in mere animal life does and these
other men around him were as he was he
felt perfectly sure of that and yet they
went now to certain death without that
fear which he knew must have been strong
within them some greater thing than
fear some greater tiling than the love of
life was driving them
  a shell ripped through the upper branches
of a tree and burst with a crash that set the
very centers of his being to twitching an-
other followed it and then the woods were
raked mercilessly by the screeching gusts of
shrapnel the men about jenks did not
pause nor look some of them sprawled
heavily to the earth and lay still others
fell but did not lie still and their screams
and cries mingled with the racket of the
firing the bullets came now too whipping
through the leaves and branches plowing
into the earth keeping up their high-pitched
music-like the sharp twanging of big wires
in the air overhead
  through the thinning trunks of the trees
the bare surface of the crest showed bend-
ing up toward the skyline in a sharper curve
already its black surface was dotted with
crawling brown figures jenks looked and
knew that out on this slope of rocks was
death in a hundred forms he looked at
the men around him and their faces told
him that they knew it too-but did not
care nor did he care not for himself but
because these men about him did not-and
they were his people
they swept out on the open un-
covered surface of the rocky slope
and the whirring scythe-like vol-
leys caught them jenks die rot even
bow his head before the metal blast in-
stead he straightened himself jtnd looked
up with all his eyes everywhere he
jaw the crawling scrabbling brown fig-
ures the black rocks the bursting shells
and the clouds of vapor lining the trenches
above him far ahead and above him
he saw a little tricolored moving dot
that slipped from rock to rock disap-
peared stopped came out again was lost
for a second in a wild scramble of brown
shapes-but always went on a little for-
ward a little farther up jenks raised his
rifle high above his head something wrig-
gled thrillingly inside him and his full-
throated yell sounded high above the roar
of battle men looked at him with an-
swering shouts as he bent his head and
started up the rocks the tired lines moved
aster jenks in front his eyes never leav-
ing that bobbing tricolored spot above him
  straight in front perched on the top of a
natural salient of rock was a battery of
maxims as yet the enemy had kept the
wicked little weapons silent their tiny
muzzles were trained on the wriggling
masses below them the gunners stood with
their hands on the cranks the open boxes
of ammunition waiting beside them their
eyes shifting nervously from the slopes
below them to the swarthy officer at their
side at length when the brown waves
swept closer through the shrapnel and
bullets he nodded and the gunners turned
the cranks as easily as a grocer spins the
handle of his coffee-mill
  into the very center of the group around
the tricolored dot sprayed the first shower
of bullets from the maxims on all sides
men raised their heads and looked an in-
stant as this new rasping grinding note
sounded through the din jenks looked up
and saw the bright dot motionless inert in
the center of a still brown pile he heard
the clatter of the maxims and again his
yell sounded as he bounded up from rock
to rock once he felt a stab of pain in his
arm again in his leg he realized that he
could no longer raise his rifle and flung it
away
  he was conscious only of three things
that the noise of the maxims grew steadily
louder that the bright dot was closer
and that he was growing weaker because
of something wet which kept sliding
away from him down his arm and leg
through a raging riot of noise and motion
he was conscious of reaching down into a
tangle ot figures for the bright thing which
danced crazily before his eyes of jerking
the yellow pole from a thin white hand
with a brown stain across it which clung
to the wooden pole with cold tenacity it
was hard for him to regain his feet because
another of the streams was slipping down
his shoulder now but he lurched from his
knees to his feet with the bright thing
cloth of some sort he discovered clinging to
his arms and legs and impeding his efforts
to go forward
  he sensed rather than knew that the
machine-like explosions had ceased and
that a mid chorus of shouting was sound-
ing high above the firing he reached out
his hand and clutched the searing-hot barrel
of a maxim his hand slipped down to the
cooler metal of the supporting tripod and
with the other hand gripped around the
flagpole he tried feebly to ward off the
blows of a swarthy officer who was slashing
at him with a sword of unnatural bright-
ness-
jenks reached out the three fin-
gers of his left hand to accept the
cigarette which the drab-colored
man proffered him across the foot of the
tiny cot
  still smoke them pesky things he
demanded cheerfully
  the journalist replied that he did and
asked jenks how he was as he held a match
so that the wounded man could light his
cigarette
  well answered jenks as he leaned
back comfortably against the pillows
whats left of me feels pretty good they
take awful good care of me here bout a
dozen nurses cornin in every four or five
minutes to see if i dont want somethin
an more doctorsn i can count an eat

would they had to pare off so much of
me to make the rest good for anything
gangrene i think they said ive got one
arm an bout a leg an three-quarters ill
make a beaut of a farmer wont i 
  the correspondent leaned on the foot of
the bed and asked his question with cold
deliberation for he was very anxious to
know some things

adventure
  dont you wish he asked that youd
gone home that day you and i shot their
outpost through the middle 
  you just bet i dont snapped jenks
why man all i wanted to do was get
home an tend to my farm i never seemed
to think the country needed me some re-
porter chap was in here the other day-
few days after they give me this-and
his hand strayed to the medal on his breast
-an he lowed that maybe we wouldnt
have got up that hill if i hadnt picked up
that there flag now i dont believe that
there was a sight of the boys right behint
me an one of em id a done it if i hadnt

arm an a leg but it was up to me an i
done it an aint i gettin took care of
bout as well as the next one yes sir
old man white done me a good turn i
aint kickin none
  and jenks looked through the smoke of
his cigarette at the mass of red roses beside
his bed
 the war correspondent shook jenks
hand and after a nod from the doctor
dropped several packages of cigarettes on
the foot of the bed then he walked out of
the room feeling unaccountably good and
warm and thankful at the very core of his
being-not so much toward jenks as toward
a grotesque picture of a man in a swallow-
tafled blue coat a pair of red-and-white
striped trousers and a long goatee
odonnellsurfman number six
        by frederick arthur dominy
i w lt was a gloomy group that
i lounged about in more or less
i comfortable attitudes on the boat-
i-room runway and moodily pulled
at pipes that hung dejectedly from the
corners of their mouths in the keepers
office a rumble of voices could be heard and
from the expectant glances the men on the
platform occasionally cast at the closed
door it was evident that they were waiting
a verdict of some description-and were
already convinced that it would be unfavor-
able-from the occupants of the office
  as the suspense became more and more
unbearable billy bennett removed his
pipe expectorated with remarkable accu-
racy at a fly in front of him and then as
though displeased with his skill shook his
head dejectedly
  aint no use shakin your head that-a-
way growled saunders surfman no 
its done an it cant be undone i dont
mean drowndin that fly he continued al-
though nobody had questioned his mean-
ing you all know what i mean ed
bakers leg is broke an the supentenent
wont let us take on the only man wed
have a chance with as a sub but sends us
that elgble list to pick from an weve got
bout as much chance of winnin that cup
as a snowball has in some places i could
mention
  his air was the air of a man eager to pro-
voke a controversy but affirmative grunts
were his only reply and it was evident that
no one had the spirit to argue the question
so he hitched into a more or less comfortable
attitude against the dooi-casing and gazed
surlily at the surrounding sand-dunes
  something had occurred to upset the
usual smooth and cheerful tenor of life at
zachs inlet life-saving station that was
evident and in consequence the crew of that
station were a most disheartened set of men
odonnell surfman number six

  it had happened as they were drilling with
the surf-boat a wave and just an ordinary
sized wave at that had rolled up on the
beach at a most inopportune moment and
likte many other waves had carried before
it everything in its path incidentally throw-
ing the heavy boat on to edward baker
surfman no  and breaking his leg this
leg at that time was doubly precious for
it furnished a good part of the power which
enabled baker to kick his way through the
water to many victories in various swim-
ming contests
  besides his ability as a swimmer baker
was able to cover a foot or so more at the
standing broad jump than the average man
and consequently was a man valuable for
other purposes than those for which he was
drawing pay from uncle sam
  but while it may seem to you a matter
of little moment-this accidental breaking
of a surfmans leg which would mend in
ihe course of a month or so at the least-it
was a matter of great importance to the
members of the zachs inlet crew if they
had not already made their boasts regard-
ing the capture of a certain cup presented
by a retired lieutenant of the revenue
cutter service who had once been the
assistant inspector for their district and
was still interested in the service which
ivas to be contested for on the first day of
the inactive season by the three crews on
oak island they would not have taken it
to heart so badly and now-well they
might finish a poor third they could do
no worse
  at first when they had hauled baker
ashore and discovered the broken leg their
chance had not seemed so seriously im-
paired to be sure they were sorry that
he had been so unfortunate but broken
legs are not dangerous and they knew of a
man who could replace the injured man
that was one of their first thoughts get
charley suydam to substitute for substi-
tutes were eligible to contest and there
would be no weakness in their team but
then along came the superintendents let-
ter coldly stating that as baker would be
off for an indefinite period he was inclosing
the list of eligible surfmen for keeper rorke
 select from and would thank the keeper
to make his selection immediately
  and that eligible list of the five men 
it none was known to the crew of zachs
inlet station which made matters worse
if they could be any worse it was simply
a question of choosing blindly and after
hearing the views of the crew keeper
rorke and the no x man jim reynolds
had gone into executive session in the
keepers office
  finally the scraping  chairs being
pushed over the floor was heard and then
the office door opened and the keeper
stepped into the boat-room followed by
reynolds
  forestalling the questions that were sure
to come he said well boys jim and i
have done the best we could there were
two swedes one dutchman and two amer-
icans on the list and weve picked one of
the americans name william odon-
nell he must have irish blood in him
thats about the only reason we took him
i never saw an irishman or a half-irishman
for that matter who wasnt good at some-
thing perhaps the keeper was influenced
by his own ancestry for he boasted that
many of his ancestors had kissed the blar-
ney stone
  so it was settled and forthwith the list
was returned to the superintendent with
the information that william odonnell
had been selected by keeper rorke to fill
the vacancy at the zachs inlet life-saving
station
when the day came upon which
odonnell had been notified to
report for duty never had a new
surfmans arrival excited so much interest
even charley hulse the most irresponsible
and happy-go-lucky member of the zachs
inlet crew gave up the pleasures of twenty-
four hours leave bn the mainland in order
to be present when he appeared
  numerous were the conjectures as to his
size weight and ability somehow the im-
pression had arisen that this latest addition
to their ranks would be a great husky six-
footer although their reasons for assuming
so could not have been given and hopes
had even been expressed that he would be
able to handle the hammer and shot two
of the events in which the zachs inlet crew
were not particularly good but for which
they were compelled to make entries in the
coming contest
  great was the disappointment then to
those who had been watching a small-sized
sailboat as it gradually neared the beach
and was finally anchored in front of the
adventure
station to see a moderate-sized man throw
 dunnage-bag into the dingey towing be-
dnd and paddle ashore the members of
he crew who were crowded together in the
ookout-tower were loud in their expression
f disgust at his appearance
  little runt growled billy bennett
 i dont see how he passed the zamination
lint over five-foot-five if hes an inch an
ill bet he dont weigh one-twenty
  an get on to that walk of his added
drake no  looks like he had a wooden
ieg he swings it that stiff
  and pessimistic saunders delighted to
lhink that his predictions seemed more
ihan ever sure to be realized exclaimed
didnt i tell you so i said when baker
ot hurt an we found we couldnt get
uydam to sub that we might jest as well
ive up any idea of winnin that cup hes
 hefty lookin critter to help us out now
aint he
  unaware of the dismay his personality
iad caused the newcomer continued up the
oath and soon the watchers above heard
um stamping the sand from his shoes at
he mess-room door then the murmur of
voices floated up to the tower
  might jest as well go down an get in-
roduced an get the agony over with said
bennett i dont spose he can help it
cause hes little an as hes here weve got
o	make the best of it
  so four pairs of shoes clumped down the
tairs and as each man entered the mess-
-m he acknowledged keeper rorkes
introduction to the man standing beside
lim with a handshake and a perfunctory
mowd you do
      a week passed and then another
and the momentous day was swiftly
 drawing near but still the zachs
inlet crew were unable to view their chances
n anything but the most unfavorable light
there was only one event of which they
vere sure of and that was the dash billy
bennett was able to negotiate a hundred
yards in close to ten seconds at any time
md might do a trifle better if pushed that
hey knew and there was no man in the
hree stations that was as good by a second
ut in all the other trials it seemed as if
hey would have to be contented with a
econd or third
  before bakers accident they had also
been practically sure of winning the swim
and the standing broad jump but now
parker of gilgo was the most powerful
swimmer and lee also of gilgo the best
jumper in the three stations the station
slate had been covered a dozen times with
figures indicating the points each station
was reasonably sure of and each time the
ultimate result was the same the other
stations napeague and gilgo were credited
with twenty-four and twenty-one points
respectively and zachs inlet with the re-
mainder eighteen
  there were seven events a one-hundred-
yard dash mile run standing broad jump
swimming race hammer-throw shot-put
and last three men from each station were
to compete in aclay-pigeon shoot and the
points were counted at five for first three
for second and one for third
  calculate as closely as they could there
seemed to be no other result obtainable
and consequently it seemed inevitable that
zachs inlet would finish third
  after odonnell had been in the station
for nearly a ftionth and had satisfactorily
explained the lameness that had so dis-
gusted saunders by remarking one day that
he was recovering from an injury to his
knee-cap jim reynolds met him returning
from fog patrol and took it upon himself to
question him regarding his abilities ex-
plaining the predicament they were in and
expressing the hope that he would be able
to help toward securing that coveted cup
he had received but little encouragement
  sure odonnell had replied ill do
what i can for the boys but that aint
much im thinkin i used to be a bit of a
swimmer when i was a kid so mebbe youd
better put me down in that an ill practise
up these fine mornins
  but aint there anything youre good
at earnestly inquired reynolds aint
there something you can do a little bettern
common
  odonnell scratched his head thought-
fully for a moment before he answered and
then exclaimed enthusiastically sure an
there is ill bet there aint a man on the
beach can beat me jiggin but it aint
jiggin you want he asked anxiously al-
though the twinkle in his eye belied his
words
   oh-  reynolds was too disgusted
for further reply and turned toward the
station then thinking perhaps that even
a moderately good swimmer might be of
odonnell surfman number six

some assistance he stepped and issued the
following order tell you wnat you do
odonnell you practise swimmin every
time you get a chance an mebbe youll get
us a point or two finishin second or third
at a conference the following morning
reynolds detailed the results of his ques-
tioning to the little group surrounding him
and what little hopes they might have had
were immediately dissipated an all he
said he was good at was jiggin growled
saunders jiggin nothing more ex-
pressive than the snort of disgust accom-
panying this could have been uttered and
saunders opinion of odonnells ability
was echoed by the others
  so thats all he can do eh swim a
little an jig well its sure we cant figure
on him then an  reckon that settles it
with this bennett arose and walked toward
the beach where a hundred yards had been
measured off on the hard smooth sand
close to the waters edge
  the rest of the group followed him and
watched him at his training three times
his flying feet covered the distance in record
time and this sight so cheered the others
that for a moment their hopes arose then
that oft-calculated score napeague twenty-
four gilgo twenty-one and zachs inlet
eighteen was remembered and saunders
remarked for about the fortieth time
taint no use billy cant win but one
thing au thats already been figgered on
ill
finally the day came and as
some one declared it couldnt have
been no better if it had been made
to order bright and clear with a cool
breeze blowing from the-ocean along the
beach it was just the weather to incite a
man to put forth the best there was in him
and even the zachs inlet crew joked and
laughed as they tumbled into the keepers
dory for the four-mile run to gilgo the
center station of the three upon the grounds
of which the championship of the island
was to be settled
  everything was- in readiness when they
arrived the napeague crew having pre-
ceded them so the rules governing the
different events were read by one of the
judges and agreed upon as satisfactory and
then the entrants for the one-hundred-yard
dash were notified to take their positions
on the starting-line and the pistol gave
them the signal
  it was bennetts race from the first no
wther sprinter was within fifteen feet of him
as he passed the fifty-yard mark and the
race was made interesting only by the hard
struggle for second and third positions
now king of napeague was a foot or two
in front but the pace was too fast and he
dropped behind havens of gilgo and it
seemed as if they would finish in that order
but a surprise was sprung upon the specta-
tors in the last fifteen yards hulse had
been running close behind the two leaders
of the second division and now it became
evident that he would be a factor in the
race inspired perhaps by the flying
figure of ms team-mate now close to the
finishing-line he made a last desperate at-
tempt for second honors and slowly but
surely passed king and challenged havens
in a final burst of speed that put him over
the line a scant six inches ahead of the
gilgo man
  great was the delight of the zachs inlet
crew at this unlooked-for win and when the
scorekeeper chalked up a large eight on the
board opposite their stations name they
almost began to believe that they had a
chance
  but it seemed as though that were the
only event they were to figure in howell
of napeague beat reynolds best throw
with the hammer by a good ten feet and
another napeague man was third then
reynolds could do no better than finish
third in the shot-put first and second also
being won by napeague the standing
broad jump was easily won by lee gilgos
representative and it seemed as if that
station had a monopoly on jumpers for they
also captured second and third
  then came the mile run and this proved
another disappointment saunders and
drake represented zachs inlet in this and
both were confident of finishing well up
in fact they thought that haff gilgos
entrant was the only one they could not
easily beat and even if he succeeded in win-
ning second and third positions would give
them four points which would just put
zachs inlet in the lead but they had over-
rated their abilities instead of finishing
second and third they were a good one hun-
dred feet behind haff when he crossed the
line with pike and howell of napeague
close at his heels

adventure
  now the points totaled as follows
napeague leading with eighteen gilgo fif-
teen and zachs inlet twelve
  it surely looked as if zachs inlets last
chance were gone and the men were cor-
respondingly discouraged saunders who
had not finished puffing from his recent
exertions in the run stood in front of the
score-board and watched the totals as they
were written by the scorer didnt i tell
you so he declared an there aint no
one to blame but the supentendant suy-
dam would a won that mile easy an there
aint a man on the beach can beat him
shootin clay birds we might jest as well
pack up an go home its only wastin
time foolin with that swimmin race
odonnell aint got a chance
  and it was evident that the others
thought the same regarding odonnell
their only representative in the swimming
match
  but odonnell did not seem particularly
concerned at this lack of confidence on the
part of his team-mates instead he turned
to the downcast crew with a smile of en-
couragement sure boys dont be givin
up yet theres a chance an you aint
beat till the last scores counted come on
an watch me win that swim he urged
but they paid no attention to his chatter
so he left them and walked across the beach
to the bay in which the swimming race
was to be held
  reynolds looked after his retreating back
for a moment and then said come on
boys lets be decent anyhow there aint
a doubt in the world but what hell get
beat but he belongs to our station and it
aint hardly right to stay here an not even
watch him
  so they straggled over the beach hills
and seated themselves on the bluff over-
hanging the bay shore off about three
hundred yards a fair sized float had been
anchored and on this were the starter and
the six competitors the finish was marked
by a small boat anchored close to the shore
and occupied by the judges
at a word from the official on
the float the swimmers took posi-
tions close to its edge and awaited
the signal it was given and six bodies
cleft the water in long clean dives for
a moment all was a confusion of splash-
ing water but as the men came to the sur-
face and struck out sturdily for the judges
boat with long powerful strokes they
gradually separated and it resolved into a
hard-fought struggle with little choice as to
the winner
  half-way in and there was but little
difference in their positions then as the
distance began to tell changes became ap-
parent in their ranks now the stronger
swimmers forged ahead until it finally
narrowed down to a fight between two
with the others stringing out behind
  but the men lying about on the bluff
were hardly interested
  if baker was here that race would be
worth seein grieved drake
  well he aint so whats the use of
kickin bout it snapped hulse i dont
care who wins the dam gup anyhow
spose odonnells somewhere back with
the tail-enders aint he jim he asked
observing that reynolds had suddenly
jumped to his feet and was studying the
race intently
  stand up an holler you chumps
reynolds excitedly replied if that little
cuss aint givin parker the race of his life
ill eat my hat holler i tell you holler 
  and they did over the water they sent
a yell of delight of hopeof encouragement
odonnell odonnell they shouted
come on you billy odonnellf
  their discouragement was forgotten
already it had occurred to them that with
the swimming race won they had a fighting
chance for the cup scrambling down the
steep bushy side of the bluff careless of
tumbles and scratches they rushed to the
waters edge eagerly shouting their team-
mates name and excitedly urging him on-
ward
  and it seemed as if their shouts had the
desired effect for no sooner had the first
ones been uttered than odonnell shot ahead
with a speed that was marvelous swim-
ming low in the water with a curious grasp-
ing stroke that was new to the surfmen he
left parker behind so rapidly that it made
him gasp with surprise straight toward
the judges boat he swam gaining on his
competitors so easily that it was rlmost
laughable
 swim he can outswim a fish
hulse gleefully shouted an we sdd he
never had a chance we did aint we a
smart bunch fools jest plain ordinary
fools thats what we are
odonnell surfman number six

  charley could contain himself no longer
as he saw a wet hand grasp the gunwale of
the judges boat and then odonnells face
peer over the side he yelled again with
delight and dashing into the shoal water
ha if carried half dragged the victorious
swimmer ashore into the midst of the
wildly hilarious zachs inlet crew
  odonnell was the only self-possessed
mann the crowd serenely grinning at
the behavior of the others he let them pull
off the bathing-suit he had worn and fairly
quarrel over the honor of rubbing him
down and listened indifferently to their
praises of his newly discovered ability
only once did he speak and then it was to
remark smilingly sure boys i told you i
could swim a bit but its jiggin thats my
long suit
  when calm had in a measure been re-
stored during the walk across the beach
-hey clustered around the score-board to
view the revised score now the points
were so evenly divided among the stations
chat the shooting-match would decide the
matter and they were fairly confident of
their chance in that parker of gilgo had
finished second and pike of napeague
third in the swim so that the board now
showed the points as follows napeague
nineteen gilgo eighteen and zachs inlet
seventeen
 little time was left them to discuss this
situation however for the judges were
calling for the trap-shooters and they
hurried to secure favorable positions from
which to watch this event
  each station was represented by a team
of three men who were to shoot at twenty
birds each in series of five and the highest
individual scores were to decide the con-
test keeper rorke hulse and bennett
were the zachs inlet entrants and the
keeper was the first man called his start
promised well for zachs inlet for he broke
his five birds in as many shots but this ad-
vantage was not held long for howell of
napeague duplicated his feat although the
gilgo man lee had to be content with
four kills
 then the next three men shot but hulse
broke but three while both napeagues
and - gilgos representatives scored four
each
  now it was up to bennett to retrieve the
lost points and his mates were confident
that he would do it but where was billy
the scorer was calling his name and the
other shooters were showing annoyance at
his tardiness
  reynolds had been scanning the faces of
the crowd in an unsuccessful attempt to
find him  come to think of it he whis-
pered to the nearest man billy didnt
come back cross the beach with us did he 
dont believe he did though i hadnt
missed him was the reply and then it was
discovered upon questioning the remainder
of the crew that none of them had seen ben-
nett since leaving the bay
  drake you go tell the keeper that
billyll be there in a minute an to get
them to go on with the shootin an the
rest of usll hunt him up instructed rey-
nolds so the judges were informed that
bennett would be ready to shoot in a short
time and pike of napeague faced the trap
reynolds saunders and odon-
nell hurried across the tbeach and
upon arriving at the bay-side dis-
covered that another calamity had over-
taken zachs inlet very white and still
bennett lay at the foot of the bluff down
which they had so wildly rushed to welcome
odonnell he looked up at the others with
a wan smile thought youd miss me
fore long he said
  but whats the matter billy rey-
nolds inquired
  guess i must have turned my ankle
when i fell dowm the hill he replied 
yelled at you fellers when i did it but you
was so worked up over that swimmin race
you never heard it then i tried to hop
along after you left but my leg hurt so i
guess i must have fainted
  well this settles it ejaculated saun-
ders if we aint been runnin in the
damdest luck first baker broke his leg
an now billy heres bunged up so he cant
shoot  jest when we thought wre had a
chance too he added mournfully but
it aint no use
  and it did look as if the zachs inlet crew
were hoodooed but as reynolds remarked
it aint of no use crying over spilt milk
that shootin-match is all over far as we
are concerned for there aint another man
in the crew that can break one of them clay
birds out of five well carry billy over
to the station an then report to keeper
rorke
  so they carried their crippled mate across

adventure
the beach and made him comfortable in
the boat-room of the gilgo station then
just as reynolds was about to leave
odonnell stopped him
if billyll lend me his gun he said
 ill try to hold my end of that shootin up
but you never said you could shoot
protested reynolds if you think youve
got a chance though-
  he never said he could swim either
broke in saunders that is he never said
he could swim good by moses jim let
him try it i begin to believe hes one of
them kind that dont brag bout what they
can do if hes willin to shoot i say let
him shoot
  saunders upon receiving a nod from
bennett hustled about took the gun out
of its case put it together and handed it
to odonnell
  now son he instructed him you
hurry out there an do your darndest
if you get beat there wont be any hard
feelings bout it anyhow
  when the judges were informed of ben-
netts accident they consented to odon-
nells taking his place and immediately sent
him to the trap
  he missed the first bird and a despairing
groan arose from the zachs inlet crew
then he broke the next four and that groan
was changed into a joyful cheer
  the shooting continued and as keeper
rorke broke bird after bird and odonnell
did not seem to know what it was to miss
after that first lost bird it became evident
that again this little runt as bennett
had called him was the mainstay of their
team
  then the keeper missed one but recov-
ered and broke his last five cleanly retiring
with a score of nineteen broken which was
evidently most satisfactory to him if you
could judge from the smile upon his face
now odonnells name was called he was
the last man to shoot and upon the result
of those five shots hung the championship
  keeper rorke was high man with nine-
teen and howell and pike of napeague
were tied with eighteen each if odonnell
did not beat the napeague shooters the
keepers score would do no good as the five
points would make zachs inlet but twenty-
two while napeague with a second and
third counting four would total twenty-
three points
  he was by far the calmest man in the
crowd when he faced the trap with four-
teen breaks to his credit it meant that he
would have to make a clean score on these
next five birds to win the championship for
his station one miss and he would tie the
napeaguers two missed and the cup was
surely lost
  are you ready he coolly asked the
trapper ready was the reply pjjii
crack that target was broken into a
thousand particles again the question
and reply followed by the sharp command
pull and another target smashed
  saunders was hysterically patting rey-
nolds on the back and muttering what -was
meant as words of encouragement to- the
shooter
  two more of the clay sauceirs were broken
by that impassive man facing the trap and
now he was calmly loading his-gun for the
final shot	 
  spose he misses -it whispered rey-
nolds
  he aint a-goin to saunders replied
earnestly didnt i tell you so he
shouted as the gun cracked and the last
target was broken but reynolds did hot
hear him for his shout was drowned in the
cheer that arose from-the others of the
zachs inlet crew and their adherents among
the spectators
  there was an excited group surrounding
odonnell who did not have to await the
judges decision they knew they were the
champions of oak island and they also
knew that but for this little man in their
midst they would have lost they were all
talking at once but odonnell listened
with a composed countenance to their ex-
travagant praises until reynolds lifted his
voice above the rest
  he dont look like he amounted to
much he cried but boys i want to tell
you right here well know bettern to pick
a man by his size next time
  then he was interrupted say jim
inquired the object of this flattery sure
an theres one thing id like to know an
thats this do you think theres a man on
the island can beat me jiggin
  and reynolds remembering his reply
when that same subject had been intro-
duced before repeated it oh-lhe
said but this time his voice did not express
disgust and annoyance
i
         formless fringy low-lying
white-brown-and-yellow thing for
all the world like a fried egg afloat
drifted between the blunt-nosed
ferry-boat and her slip it was the canal-
boat caravan the loosely articulated haw-
ser-bound albany tow with its flat white
deckhouses and yellow-striped gunwales
and its fluttering lines of checked jumpers
white petticoats and such all fresh from the
wash-buckets fussy tugs pulled at great
cables ahead fussy tugs scurried around
the flanks trimming in the loose ends
  sharp and fierce the signal bells rang in
the engine-room of the ferry-boat and the
ancient craft trembled under the strain as
her paddle-wheels beat in reversal the
waters gurgled and churned and a stream
of foamy soap-suds surged out from under
tbe bows
  two men stood on the forward deck
leaning against the heavy railing the
ruffled silk hat of one of them was pulled
down over his eyes the eyes were slightly
bloodshot because the owner of them had
been drinking but otherwise they were very
pleasant gray eyes just as the face with its
smooth broad brow and straight beardless
features was a very pleasant face the
garments of the young man-he was about
twenty-five-were- of fashionable material
although somewhat tousled like his brown
hair and they fitted well a clean-limbed
six-foot frame
  the other was older although not much
a short stocky fellow with an aggressively
protuberant chest sharp features and nar-
row shrewd humorous eyes his cutaway
coat gray trousers and black derby hat
were speckless his patent-leather shoes
refulgent his gray silk waistcoat was but-
toned with diamond-centered pearl discs
and his lavender scarf was held by a big
diamond pin
  although standing side by side they had
not spoken since the ferry-boat left the
brooklyn shore the older man glanced
occasionally at the younger the younger
glared gloomily down at the waters the
foamy streak from the paddle-boxes caught
his sight and excited his disapproval
  thought i wash on the fron o thish
boat he said addressing the other
  right you were bo was the cheery
answer
  um wah-whend we turn aroun 
  didnt shes backing up
  goin back to brooklyn
  looks like it
  well she cn go ish she likes im
not said the younger man decisively and
he jumped overboard
dad and destiny
by john a heffernan

		adventure
  oi-yoi exclaimed the other in amaze-
ment man overboard he yelled rais-
ing his voice so that it rang tliroughout the
vessel quickly he slipped oil his coat
transferred a gold watch from the fob pocket
of his trousers to the inside pocketof the
outer garment folded the latter neatly
laid it on the deck and jumping upon te
hat top of the railing dove into the white
surge
  fifty feet away the other man came to
the surface shook the brine from his eyes
with a vigorous twist of his head and flung
his right hand forward in a powerful prac-
tised overhand stroke he was heading
for the canal-boats which were nearer to
him than the rapidly receding ferry-boat
but he looked back in time to see the man
in the gray silk waistcoat plunge from the
rail after him the chill of the river had
cleared his brain and he understood with
some anxiety he watched the bobbing head
of the other swimmer the latter made
progress slowly and as he approached it
was quite plain that he was laboring hard
gray-eyes turned and went after him and
drew up alongside with a few of his long
reaches
  how are you he asked
  bout all-all in gasped the other
 got-got a-cramp in-in my-gurgle-
gurglel 
  the waves closed over his head gray-
eyes slipped down and caught him and
without difficulty got him back to the
surface
  lie perfectly quiet he admonished
holding him by the collar and swimming
easily on his back
  all right the stocky chap answered
  meanwhile in wild excitement passengers
were crowding upon the deck of the ferry-
boat that calliope cry man overboard
having drawn them in haste from the cabins
blue-shirted deckhands were loosening coils
of rope and tying big cruller-shaped life-
preservers to the ends of them the man
in the pilot-house signaled slow speed
ahead to the engine-room and tooted like
mad with his whistle
  tidal action had swung the canal-boat
flotilla around so that the tail of it was
within one hundred feet of the two men in
the water and gray-eyes struck out for the
nearer craft it was easy work for him to
make the distance he soon grasped the
line dropped over the side and still holding
his companion by the collar looked up into
a pair of very large brown eyes that peered
over the rail of a big grain-barge
  thanks he said grinning
  the possessor of the big brown eyes
nodded acknowledgment
  hold tight she directed ill slip a
ladder down to you
  a minute later the end of a long ladder
fell beside him and he swung around so that
his companion could catch a rung
   can you climb up or shall i carry you 
he asked
  i can make it the short man replied
briefly
  all right you go first and ill follow
you
so they ascended the ladder and
gained the deck and the ferry-boat
pilot seeing them safe if soppy
swore with remarkable enthusiasm put his
helm hard-a-starboard and edged around
to the rear of the tow
  gray-eyes looked at the girl who was
standing on the deck she was a splendid
creature with raven hair coiled braid upon
braid upon the back of her head glorious
eyes with tawny glints in the depths of
them sun-tanned cheeks through which the
roses glowed lips of scarlet and shining
strong teeth a soft felt hat was pinned
to the masses of her hair and a canvas waist
with a wide brown collar fell away from her
glorious neck and rested loosely upon her
full bosom across which her bare brown arms
were folded with her canvas skirt snap-
ping around her in the brisk river breeze
and the low western sunbeams slanting
down upon her over the irregular sky-line
of new york with the western windows all
aflame and the scarlet clouds fluttering like
pennants in the amethystine depths gray-
eyes concluded that he had never seen a
picture so magnificent
  further thought upon the subject waf
arrested by a vigorous smite on the nose
the young mans eyes blazed with anger
and clutching the brother of his adventure
by the wet front of his diamond-decked
waistcoat with his left hand he drew back
his right hand to return the blow he had
received so unexpectedly the short man
threw up his hands to guard his head in
a manner that indicated some familiarity
with the rules of the game but the fingers
chat gripped his chest were fingers of steel
dad and destiny

and he was helpless because of the long
reach of the outstretched arm gray-eyes
curbed his anger instantly and instead of driv-
ing in his clenched right hand he opened it
and rubbed his bruised nose with it
  the girl said nothing but looked from
one to the other curiously
  what did you do that for gray-eyes
asked
  for what echoed the other in pure
amazement hey bo see yon kelly on
the sad sea waves it cost me six only last
night and on the deck of that ferry-boat
is a black broadcloth coat  model in-
side of which is my gilt timer with wheels
that go round and round price one hundred
and fifty lost bo lost and just be-
cause you wanted to get as much water out-
side as you had booze inside and i thought
it was up to me to pull you out of the wet
do you think id let any one come across
vith a play like that and no come-back
  you tried to save my life said gray-
eyes
  nix on the melodrama protested the
other and by the way youre rumpling
up my shirt-front something awful you
can throw off your clutch-ive decided to
let you live
  thank you said gray-eyes grinning
as he released him
  the short man raised an inquiring thumb
and two inquiring fingers to his scarf-pin
then he dropped his chin on his soppy
shirt-front and deliberately counted the
buttons on his waistcoat
  you didnt take anything away but
your hand he said at last approvingly
  the younger man flushed i am not a
thief he said coldly

man tranquilly now if youll tell me

joyously madam he went on turning

old armitage ive known him at least a
quarter of an hour on land and sea and it

  mr armitage mr buchmuller said
the girl seriously if you gentlemen she
went on will sit down on these hatches a
few minutes i will see what can be done in
the way of dry garments
  she turned on her heel and swung off
down the deck jake looked after her ap-
probation written all over his expressive
features
  if he sighed at last that skirt is the
captains little daughter lash me to the
mast matey ill never desert the ship
harold nodded
  jake plunged his hands into his trousers
pockets instantly he emitted a loud wail
  oi-yoi oi-yoi he moaned seating
himself upon the hatch covers and rocking
his body to and fro its gone its gone 
whats gone asked harold
   muh bankroll muh lovely little bunch
of money oi-yoi oi-yoi 
  how much was in it

harold drew from his pocket a package
of moist bills and began to count
  fifty a hundred one-ten twenty
thirty fifty seventy eighty two-hundred
two-ten two-fifteen two-seventeen-two
hundred and seventeen dollars he looked
up ill have to owe you the balance

he added

indignantly waving back the prouered bills

dends in weeps over burnt money as the

friskies 
  u-hum im the son of the king of
breakfast foods i was going to say son
and heir but we had a row yesterday and i
was thrown out of house home allowance
and will dad has a real warm red-
headed temper
 now harold-youll excuse me for
pulling on the front doorbell but i do love
to say harold-i know you ought to have
your nut examined getting a souse on and
jumping into a wet river is just anindica-
iion but having a serious fight with pater-
nal millions is proof positive of bats in the
loft did you ever try earning a living
no not yet
  its some more complicated than run-
ning an automobile a fellow that doesnt
have to shouldnt jump into it without seri-
ous consideration what are you going
to do
  i dont know i have just come back
from paris where some money was spent
teaching me to paint pictures but im
afraid i couldnt sell them
  leave that to me bo you paint and
ill be the selling end what do you say to
the firm of armitage  buchmuller
harold clasped jakes outstretched hand
and shook it heartily
  youre a pretty good sort buchmuller
he said well try it out whats your
plan of campaign
  can you paint human things
  yes-you mean portraits
  then job number i for you is to paint
a picture of peaches if i dont sell it to a
complexion-cream outfit ill eat it here

arrangements
      elaine came swinging aft her
arms full of check jumpers and blue
- denim trousers jake advanced to
meet her
  miss elaine he asked are you the
skippers daughter 
no she answered i am the skipper
oof exclaimed jake well cap
we would very much like to take the trip
to buffalo with you how much would it
cost us american plan
  for the first tune elaine showed some
slight signs of confusion well i-i dont
know she stammered we should be
glad to have you of course but-
  perhaps interjected harold miss
elaine is er-er unchaperoned and-
  no thats not it she said turning to
him my brother is on board with his
wife and her sister and a young man friend
but you see we never have taken passengers
before and-
  you dont know what to charge jake
broke in all right captain suppose we
take half the railroad fare from new york to
buffalo for a basis and add ten a week for
the eats and berths
  that would do very well said elaine
follow me please
  she led them to the bow of the barge and
down a companion ladder to the main cabin
jake drew in his breath quickly as they en-
tered a handsome rug lay upon the floor
silken curtains of nile green draped the
little ports and a small piano stood in one
comer there were cosy wicker lounging-
chairs and divans a reading-table of pol-
ished oak and a revolving bookcase whose
shelves were full of handsomely bound
volumes
  some embroidery lay in a womans work-
basket on top of the bookcase and a
dozen magazines were heaped- upon the
table from this compartment a com
panionway led aft and on each side of it
were neat little white staterooms with com-
fortable rocking-chairs and cosy brass beds
into one of these the girl ushered the two
young men
  this is our only spare room she said
 you will have to share it she deposited
her armful of clothing on the bed and went
on the dining-room is at the other end
of the boat when you have changed your
clothing come right aft and meet the others
we have dinner at six she flashed a
golden smile at them and vanished
  jake turned a dazed look upon harold
would you mind pinching me bo he
asked feebly
  why whats the matter harold
asked
  i just want to make sure i am awake
responded buchmuller recent experi-
ences suggest to me that im either in a
dream or pleasantly dippy like the bug
who has a kink that hes john d rocke-
feller im the little fellow who tells real
estate men they ought to advertise for
dad and destiny

ten years i have been blowing all the sur-
plus earnings of muh business in a foolish
endeavor to put a good one over on the
bookies yesterday when im down to
hard-pan behold bo they really win at
big money and i sail home with a thousand
in muh kick muh for the realization of
muh dreams new clothes flashes for the
necktie and vest buttons the gold tick-
tick
  but see how wealth takes wings and the
tide of fortune taken at the flood biffs you
most unexpected and cruel riches this
morning and the fishes playing with muh
bank-roll before the sun sets in the water
out of the water and up we come on a
canal-boat which a fairy with a wide smile
presto-changos into the st regis now
harold-how i love that name-are you
sure that were awake 
  quite sure harold answered with a
laugh this is a nice little stateroom old
fellow but its not the st regis
  youve been in the st regis
  yes
  have you ever been on a canaller
  no
  well i have and take it from me
bo that you may know that this is not the
st regis but i know it isnt any canaller
either besides which these blue-jeans are
too brand new to look the part and no
bloomin low-bridge expert tramps the tow-
path in fifteen-dollar suits of underwear
  this last observation was due to the dis-
covery that two comfortable suits of under-
clothing had been laid out upon the coun-
terpane
  harold did not answer he was too busy
divesting himself of his wet garments and
replacing them with the dry warm habili-
ments so kindly provided
  a little scant but nice and comfy he
commented sitting on the bed and ruefully
surveying the hiatus between the rims of
his trouser legs and the tops of his misfit
shoes
  youll have to put flounces on those
bo remarked jake bending over to fold
up neatly the surplus length of his own
garments now he observed as he
stood up straight and pirouetted up and
down the cabin see that neat and fash-
ionable cuff you may have it on me for
name and lineage harold but as a nob-
by dresser-fade bo fade ive got you
skinned and on the pan
  harold paused with a comb stuck in his
hair
  by the way partner he said we for-
got one item in our business arrangements
a painter must have paint to paint
  sounds like a music-hall gag or a
conundrum mumbled jake taking his
scarf-pin out of his mouth and fastening
the neck of his jumper with it  however
dont let it spoil your digestion well tie
up at some river town and you can go ashore
and buy the paint
  rather timidly they made their way to
the after deckhouse a big oak dining-table
occupied the center of it and a handsome
sideboard stood against the bulkhead
  get hep to the sidebar murmured
jake to himself  cut glass too
  two young women and two men were in
the room with elaine as the guests entered
she introduced one of the men as her
brother mr daniels and the other as mr
brough daniels looked enough like elaine
to confirm the introductory explanation and
mr brough was a lean young chap with a
sandy mustache and a languid manner
mrs daniels was a blue-eyed golden-
haired matron of twenty-five and polly
hawkins her sister was a slim eighteen-
year-old lassie in a tidy checked kitchen
apron
  the men were clothed in blue-jeans and
jumpers and the women in canvas blouses
and skirts harold and jake were cordially
welcomed and took the seats elaine as-
signed them at the table their afternoons
experience had put a razor-edge on their
appetites and they thoroughly enjoyed the
substantial dinner set before them at the
conclusion of the meal daniels reached into
the sideboard and drew forth a box of
cigars
  we generally smoke these after din-
ner he explained as he passed the box to
jake during the day we smoke corn-
cobs ill put a couple and a box of tobacco
in your room if you dont care for the
pipe however you can always find the
cigars in this cupboard
as they pulled comforters over
them in their cosy stateroom that
evening harold concluded that ca-
nal-boat life was the most joyous life a
human being could live they had spent
the evening lounging and reading in the
forward cabin jake had entertained them

adventure
with several popular songs sung to pollys
rattling accompaniment and best of all
harold and elaine had had a tramp around
the deck in the moonlight that- bathed
bank and boat darkling shore and spark-
ling river she was not too communicative
about her business but he gathered that the
barge had come down to new york flour-
laden and was going back empty it
struck him that there was some difference
between his hosts and the crews of the
craft lashed alongside but he dismissed the
question with the reflection that canal society
had its gradations like all other societies
and truly elaine had wonderful eyes
  jake nudged him in the ribs what did
you fight with your dad about  he asked
uh mumbled harold
  why did you leave home and all the
money-a skirt 
  something like yawned harold he
wanted to marry me to his partners
daughter n i-was-umble umble-
  you dont tell me snorted jake in
deep disgust well a guy that can go to
sleep telling how he lost a few million
doesnt deserve to have money ugh
and jake fell asleep also
heigh-ho exclaimed jake
as they turned out to the tune of a
clamorous tom-tom at six the fol-
lowing morning how do you like life on
the bounding marine 
  all right answered harold rubbing
sleep-heavy lids but why all the racket
so early in the morning is the ship afire 
nay bo its pipe all hands to grog-
i mean to grub jake explained and-
loot loot little bright-eyes-on this marvel
of a canaller they supply passengers with a
razor
  they shaved rapidly and hurried aft in
the dining-room polly again wrapped in her
kitchen apron and mrs daniels simi-
larly swathed were skipping back and
forth with steaming platters of buckwheat
cakes while elaine could be glimpsed in the
galley beyond transferring slices of red and
white bacon from the frying pan to a mam-
moth serving-dish daniels was pouring
coffee and brough was dragging the chairs
up to the table
  hi there armitage get that big knife
and cut the bread yelled daniels cheer-
fully  buchmuller help polly in with the
buckwheats
  soon they were all at the table eating
with a north river appetite of which armi-
tage was rather ashamed but jake was as
proud as a peacock
  now what have we to do cap he
asked of elaine we want to be par t of the
crew and jump in and work with the rest
you know
  elaine seemed at a loss her brother
hurried to the rescue
  as we are traveling empty there is really
nothing to do you know he said we
generally sit around the deck and read and
smoke-that is brough and i smoke-and
watch the scenery you see
  yes said jake i see how could a
fellow help seeing he went on under his
breath when its as clear as mud
  as they went on deck he observed a lean
person whose long legs were encased in
cowhide boots and whose chin-whisker of
red and gray looked like the spike on a
picket fence this person was smoking a
black clay pipe and leaning his back against
the tiller
  whos your steersman bo jake
whispered in daniels ear
  a slight flush crept into the young mans
cheeks
  he belongs on the next boat he ex-
plained he comes over to give us a hand
in a neighborly kind of way you know
when were busy how are you hiram
  the lean person straightened up stiffly
and touched his brow with a weatherbeaten
fore-finger
  good morning-
  polly who stood beside them placed her
hand on her heart
  -sir said the helmsman
  ahhhhh sighed polly softly
  but jake didnt seem to have noticed
anything he followed elaine and harold
forward looking down at the deck to
himself he was saying for the love of
mike what are we up against
that night elaine and harold sat
on the hatch-covers the girl resting
her elbows on her knees and clasping
her hands as she looked up into his face
the lights of saugerties twinkled off the
port quarter and a rippling streamer of
silver moonlight lay like a bar upon the
river armitage had just told the girl of
the quarrel with his father
   but why does he insist chat you marry
dad and destiny
her she asked is it because she has-
has money
  oh no he answered quickly dad
has a bunch of it himself and doesnt care
about that end of it but you see her father
and he were mining partners years ago and
made their first big strike together and they
have been brothers in business ever since
it seems that when both of us were babies
they made it up between them that we were
to marry
  well why dont you marry her isnt
she a nice girl
  oh i suppose shes nice enough-ive
never seen her he answered you see
he took care of the western end the manu-
facturing and dad ran the advertising and
selling in new york and then when i was
fifteen i was packed off to boarding school
and later to college and then to paris to
cultivate what i thought was a talent for
painting i have just come home and find
that he has it all arranged that i am to
marry a girl who probably has as little
taste for the thing as i have he insisted
i objected there were fire-crackers and i
got out
  is that the only reason you didnot want
to marry her 
  harold lifted his glance and looked
straight into elaines brown eyes
  that was the only reason he said
was she repeated softly looking
out over the waters
  yes he answered was there is an-
other reason now
  what is her name elaine asked
armitage started you wouldnt really
like me to tell you that now would you
he asked quietly
  no she answered i should think
you horrid if you did
  she looked a while at the red dot of the
port lantern then she turned her eyes ha
the direction of the thin yellow streamers
that escaped from the cabin windows through
which escaped also jakes gay voice raised
in song and the tinkle of pollys vivacious
obligato
  the other reason she said softly her
lashes falling
  why elaine you are the other reason
he said looking up at her frankly i do
not want to be offensive and i havent any
hope but it wont hurt you to know and
perhaps it will help me if i were any
good-if i had been taught how to make a
living instead of painting pictures no one
would buy-why id try to make you love
me and marry me but- oh do not
think too little of me elaine because you
are a splendid competent worker of the
world and i am a good-for-nothing ill
learn how-in time
  your father may relent the girl sug-
gested her lashes still brushing her cheeks
  you dont know my dad harold an-
swered shaking his head
  but i think you can win out alone she
said looking up at him suddenly
  harold looked into her face in a frank
level-eyed way he had
  you are right he said without the
slightest suggestion of a boast in tone or
manner i can but he added it
wouldnt be the square thing to ask any
girl to bet on me
  even in the pale moonlight he could see
the cloud of color that surged into her facc
as she bent her head and whispered
  i would be willing to bet on you
harold
  the singing had ceased in the forward
cabin jake buchmuller stepped out on
deck the red tip of his cigar brightening
and fading and the smoke of it curling
back over his shoulder he looked at the
little tugboats ahead and then swept a care-
less glance back at the barges strung out
astern something dark against the white
hatchcovers on the port side amidships
arrested his wandering glance
  is it one or are it two he murmured
after a minute of careful scrutiny
  it are two he answered his own ques-
tion a minute later and discreetly turned
his eyes ahead
  that young man he remarked con-
fidentially to the hawser-ring at his feet
is some rapid even if his name is harold
in ten minutes he makes a life-long friend
of me and now hes kissing the captain of
this blooming ship
  having delivered himself of which jake
went below and turned in
all the way up the river mr
buchmullers crowning joy was the
enthusiasm of polly that young
lady was just bursting with information
concerning the canal-boat trade and jake
drank it in as the dry earth drinks up the
summer showers
  now what wras it you told me you were
wm

adventure
carrying last trip he encouraged her one
morning as he aided her in the culinary
task of peeling potatoes
  lobsters answered polly demurely
tossing a denuded murphy into a capacious
sauce-pan
  jake looked at her with baby eyes
  how very interesting he said
  yes said polly it was a great sight
to look down in the hold and see them
fighting millions and millions of them
  it must have been jake replied with
conviction
  yes polly went on with growing en-
thusiasm and one night they er - muti-
nied
   mutinied  gasped jake
   um  said polly  they all came clam-
bering up on deck and we barred ourselves
in the cabin and drove them back at the
point of our pistols
  gee exclaimed jake
  polly sighed the trip before that
wasnt very romantic she said
  no queried jake
  no said polly we had on board a
hundred thousand hogsheads of flour it
took us girls two days to get it on board
  gracious how do you do such hard
work and keep your hands so nice and
soft
  oh said polly we always wear our
gloves when were handling hogsheads of
course
  of course how stupid of me said jake
  elaines appearance in the cabin stopped
the flow of pollys eloquence and jake re-
treated to his room from the little port
of that apartment strange muffled sounds
issued and the skipper of the barge along-
side peering through saw a short man try-
ing to swallow a feather pillow and making
a terrible pother about it
the flotilla halted at albany and
next afternoon just as they were
about to resume the journey the
crew of the grain-barge were startled by the
wild croak of a horn and the roar of an un-
muffled six-cylinder a big touring-car
tore down the dock and pulled up with a
creaking of protesting brakes at the barges
side out of the tonneau jumped a ruddy
spectacled old gentleman with streaming
gray sidewhiskers with surprising agility
he leaped over the string-piece and landed
upon the deck
  dad gasped harold in blank amaze-
ment
  hello you obstinate young scamp
his father saluted i knew youd knucklfc
under to the old man-they all do when he
puts his foot down you bet your life bui
how did you get him on the barge edie
elaine looked up her face crimson and
her hand reaching out inappeal toward
harold instead of answering the old gen-
tleman she spoke to his son
  there isnt any elaine harold she
said im edith barnes
  harold looked at her with dazed eyes
and all this- he said looking around
at the barge
  why its simple enough she answered
this barge belongs to your father and
mine richie and nell and polly and i
were tired of town and thought a canal-
boat trip would be a delightful lark dick
had the boat altered a little and furnished
and we were just starting on our trip when
you came on board rather unceremoniously
when i heard your name it occurred to me
that it would be a splendid chance to find
out what kind of chap father had picked
out for me-you will forgive me for fooling
you wont you harold 
  forgive you dear girl why its been
fine but-but how did you know about
it father
  the elder armitage plunged his hand
into his breast pocket and drew forth a
telegraphic dispatch
  how did i know about it he cried
thrusting the paper into harolds hand
didnt you send me this
  with their heads together harold and
elaine read
  you win i have just become engaged to edith
barnes bat the corpulent calf on the brow and
chase me a check	harold
  i was so-so-so dingbusted glad that i
hustled up on a special myself just to see
if it was true exploded mr armitage
  but edith had turned an accusing eye
upon jake he threw up his hands
  guilty he confessed i thought the
old guy might be worried and what was the
use keeping him on the griddle
 but how did you know did polly-
dont pass it up to polly shes been
having the time of her life kidding me
havent you polly as for the engagement
part why harold has been murmuring
the seeds of destruction

  chings in his sleep and as for the rest you
  ahoiid have heard the nice early morning
  chats i have had with old chinny-chin-chin
  - who plays with the tiller he told me how
  much per he got for being so neighborly
  and who paid him and then it wras an
  oversight cap to leave that plate on the
  tiller-post he pointed to a nickel-plated
  sign which bore the inscription
armitage  barnes-barge no 
  and i thought i had you fooled as badly
as harold was polly complained in
heart-broken tones
  oi-yoi chortled jake living the
simple canal-boat life with perfectos for
after dinner and ten-dollar-a-pound mixture
for our humble corn-cob pipes maiden 
may look like a simple child of nature from
the far-off reservation but believe me my
wigwams hard by little old broadway
the
a gray
va darien had waited dinner
until after nine oclock and still
her brother carlile had neither
turned up nor sent the usual mes-
sage explaining the delay he had not even
phoned her to expect it
  it was so unusual and so unlike him that
eva began to feel vaguely anxious then
at ten-thirty the vagueness became a
certainty-acute-intense-unbearable so
much so that at ten-forty-five she rang up
his clubs only to ascertain that he had been
at neither of them at any time that evening
  at one of them-the aviators-the com-
missionaire said that mr darien had been
expected there to meet lord fenton henry
at seven oclock and that lord fenton had
left a message with him in case mr darien
had been delayed and should turn up later
he repeated the message over the wire at
evas request and as she listened she sud-
denly realized that the situation was alarm-
ingly serious
  for lord fenton henry could do great
things for those in whose favor he interested
himself and the message the commissionaire
repeated was of such tremendous conse-
quence to carliles future career that only
a man who was either a fool or else prevented
by some extraordinary happening would
have permitted himself to be deterred from
keeping an appointment of such impor-
tance and magnitude and carlile was
no fool
  with beating heart and swimming brain
his sister hung up the receiver and sank back
inertly in her chair what had happened
what could have happened
  what was to be done ring up the hos-
pitals in case there should have been an
accident but surely if there had been she
would have heard of it ere this carlile was
a public man secretary to sir dean dens-
hain of the secret service known to scot-
land yard and every possible constable in
london sir dean why perhaps sir

adventure
dean would know something or at least
he would be able to advise her
  she picked off the receiver again and
listened impatiently for the operators voice
it was fully three minutes before she got
through and the tension of her nerves was
growing tighter every second she held the
line while the servant made inquiries and
it was with a mixture of gratification and
alarm that she heard sir dean himself reply
to her after a short interval
  is that miss darien good-evening
my man tells me you are asking for your
brother but surely he is at home no
no quite close here-just across the road-
the foreign office to be exact yes he told
me he was to meet lord fenton at seven
oclock i remember commenting on it and
saying it would probably lead to a good
thing left here a little before six yes i
admit it is strange but do not permit your-
self to get anxious just yet he may have
been detained-he may have forgotten the
appointment
  oh no sir dean it was prominent in
his mind from the moment it was made i
know he was building so much on a meeting
with lord fenton though i did not know it
was for to-night he cawi have forgotten it 
  i must confess it is not likely-still-
  was there no answer required to your
errand sir dean do you know if he ever
went to the f 
  eva as she put the question could have
sworn that she heard a peculiar click come
from sir deans end of the wire-a sharp
click as though he had suddenly gritted his
teeth together in quick annoyance
  there was a perceptible pause before his
answer came and when it did come it was
given slowly and haltingly as though he
were weighing most carefully every word-
giving each word a momentous meaning and
gravity
  to be perfectly frank with you miss
darien your question has startled me
your brother left me with a wallet of papers
for the foreign office at about ten or five
minutes to six at six oclock a telephone
message came through that the papers were
safely delivered i was in rather a hurry
and did nothing more than receive the
message i thought at the time it was
dariens voice-darien in a hurry-
  and now asked eva sharply
  and now im not so sure i should not
like to swear to it-
  eva uttered a gasp of dismay-then her
quick brain leaped to a sudden under-
standing
  one question sir bean if no message
had come through at all would you have
made inquiries at the time 
  sir dean hesitated for the barest fraction
of a second then yes miss darien i
would have made inquiries it was ar-
ranged between us that your brother was to
telephone me on the private wire so soon as
the papers were in the care of mr follett
if no message had come through i should
have been uneasy
sws eva put up the receiver with a chill
iimi ear growing up round her heart
       her worst forebodings were becom-
ing stronger and stronger every moment
something had happened to her brother
even in sir deans studied sentences she
had discerned an underlying current of
alarm then there was the message pur-
porting to be from her brother and in his
voice what could that mean was it
car who had sent that message car him-
self or was it part of the mystery had
some one imitated his voice but if so-
why what purpose was it to serve how
could any one know of the arrangement to
inform sir dean of the safety of the papers
how could any one-any outsider-use the
private wire of the f 
  in an agony of apprehension she sprang
up and walked to the door with the in-
tention of getting into some outdoor things
so as to be ready in case of emergency for
by now she dreaded she knew not what-
the worst-the unknown worst
  but as she touched the door-handle the
sudden sharp tinkle of the telephone bell
rang out its brusk summons and she flew
back to the table in the window in a passion
of expectation
  yes-yes-are you there yes i am
miss darien-
  she gripped the receiver and held it to
her ears and as she listened her face grew
white as chalk her body quivered as though
a lash descended on the stroke of even
sinister word spoken over the ware by an
unknown voice
you were speaking a moment since to
sir dean densham quite so oh thanks
i	heard everything i wanted to-i tapped
the wire at a very opportune moment you
are anxious about your brother eh again
the seeds of destruction

quite sc your brother has been useful to
me bn the past two or three occasions-oh
quite unintentionally i assure you-and
he was useful again to me to-night but
to-night im afraid he was just a shade too
smart-for his own sake however that is
beside the mark and concerns only himself
and myself what i rang you up for was
io	say that if you desire to meet your
brother on his return be at sir dean dens-
hams house in whitehall at twelve mid-
night to-night understand twelve mid-
night and you might also acquaint sir
dean densham with the fact that i hope to
make his acquaintance very soon now-and
mr algy brett also can you remember
the names its not really important-it
wont do them any good to know it and
it wont do me any harm good-by so
sorry you were anxious about your brother
twelve midnight 
  in a passion of hysteria of dread of ago-
nizing doubts eva still held the receiver to
her ears begging shrieking to the unknown
sinister voice to explain to say that car was
safe to say that car would be safe
  until the exchange called through to
ask what number she wanted she poured a
prayer of piteous entreaty into the inani-
mate mouthpiece straining every nerve to
catch even the semblance of an answer
  but none came save the operators harsh
demand and with a tortured cry of mental
anguish she ran blindly from the room to the
hall below calling out as she ran for a serv-
ant to call a cab immediately
  within a minute a taxi swept to the steps
and she sprang in bribing the man with a
sovereign to drive his fastest to sir dean
denshams to get her there in ten minutes
to get her there in time bribing him
again to drive faster-faster- a mad-
ness in her brain made her scream to him
again and again to go faster the clock in
st james palace pointed to twenty min-
utes past eleven and again she urged him to
drive faster
sir dean came to her imme-
diately his face showing anxiety
he listened without commenting
until she had finished she told him every-
thing-of her fears and of the unknown
voice at the telephone
  and you suspect foul ply you
think-
  i suspect anything sir dean i suspect
anything and everybody that voice-that
awful voice it was dreadful-every word
a menace
  eva darien sat like a statue of despair in
the chair sir dean had placed for her her
fingers twisted and tore her gloves to shreds
her eyes black with fear never left sir
deans face
  it is barely half-past eleven-we still
have thirty minutes in which to try to find
out what it means i think perhaps some
one ought to be stationed in the porch in
case your brother does not return alone
the odd thing is why darien should come
here instead of to his own home why come
to my house at midnight-i mean why has
the man who evidently knows his where-
abouts counseled him to come to me if
the man who spoke to you on the telephone
is the man who is accountable for your
brothers disappearance then he is also
the man whose benefit it was to secure the
papers-and i can not think that he would
be so ready so eager to permit darien to
give his account of what has happened
only six hours have elapsed since the papers
left my charge-even the most daring crim-
inal does not deliberately send his scapegoat
back to tell his story so early in the game
if you-
  i think i saw jacobs and another de-
tective in the hall as i came in 
  evas voice was jerky but densham
could see her mind working clearly and
quickly behind the enveloping feverish
anxiety
 yes jacobs and martin as a matter
of fact mr sterrith and lord vales are here
-about the missing papers and the two men
are attending them the cabinet have
many enemies just now and- but i will
go down and give instructions to the men
will you wait here
  i would rather go with you sir dean
it is almost twelve-oh let us go
  without a seconds delay the detectives
received their orders and acted on them
stationing themselves within an alcove be-
tween the front door and the flight of steps
leading down to the street the lights in
the hall were lowered and the massive doors
left imperceptibly ajar eva moved rest-
lessly in the shadows and sir dean never
left her side the hall seemed full of whis-
pering shapes barely visible in the dimness
the prime minister and lord vales im-
pelled by the sudden sense of something un-

adventure
toward afoot stepped from the library and
stood listening motionless beside the banks
of palms circling the stair-foot
  the sound of the traffic in whitehall and
parliament street buzzed dully across the
dividing distance the harsh hoot of a horn
echoed like a thunderbolt in the straining
ears of those who watched and waited and
close on the heels of the discordant noise the
clock of st stephens boomed out majestic-
ally-one   twoeleven   twelve
  twelve slow and ponderous notes-a life-
time of agony held between each reluctant
stroke
  twelve ere the resonant vibration
had died away a sudden commotion arose
beyond the door - a great cry ringing
through the night a cry of horror and dis-
may and then the sound of some one run-
ning on the asphalt pavement some one
dashing up the steps to the door taking
them three at a time stumbling on the last
      the double doors opened wide un-
hh der the onslaught and the two de-
tectives and a slim slight boyish-
looking man literally fell into the hall
breathless panting choking back inarticu-
late sobs the newcomer came to a halt
opposite sir dean it was algy brett but
an algy so white and shaken with horror of
something he had seen that his uncle could
scarcely recognize him
  algy he cried starting out from the
shadowy wall and twisting the boy under
the light of the electrolier algy for
g-ods sake-what 
  brett tried to control his palsied mouth
but his lips slid from side to side and his
tongue refused to form the words his
usually merry eyes were wild with the terror
of the thing he had just witnessed his
fingers clawed his uncle as though dreading
he should leave him
  then a voice clear and strong ringing
with despair cut through the babble of
whispers and questions and there was an
insistence in it he obeyed
  my brother my brother you have
seen my brother 
  brett spun round and met evas eyes
  my brother she whispered
  also in a whisper algy answered her but
he laid his quivering fingers over hers as
they rested on his coat and conveyed a
sympathy his distorted words could not
summon
  yes its your brother poor darien-
out there at the foot of the steps in the road
-poor darien what a fate poor lad it
was awful i was coming along in answer to
your message uncle dean-didnt get it
till twenty minutes ago-then just as i was
crossing the street i heard a funny noise
in the air above me-a swishing slipping
noise and stood still it was- oh sir
i wish id run away as hard as i could if
id only run then but i stayed and the
next second something fell through the air
and smashed on the stones at my feet-
something heavy i stooped down to look
at it-i thought it was a bundle it was
poor darien
  dead whispered eva
  stone dead-thank god stone dead-
that devil
  sir deans ears pricked suddenly he
had caught bretts muttered ejaculation and
in a flash the whole black mystery of that
miserable night became clear to him in an
instant he was once again the cool calm
man of affairs and he flung curt orders at
the gaping servants motioned the two
detectives and the men-servants who were
bringing in the secretarys body on an im-
provised stretcher to take their burden into
the little waiting room to the left of the
hall gave eva darien into the house-
keepers charge until she was calmer and
then in a voice of such bitter acidity as made
them wonder called his nephew the prime
minister and lord vales into the study and
shut the door behind him
  and now he said in a voice of thun-
derous anger  and now we will go through
the mill
ii
eva escaped at last from the house-
keepers attentions and protesta-
tions of sympathetic horror and
crept down the stairs till the sound of voices
guided her to the room where sir dean was
closeted with sterrith and lord vales
  a fierce anger against sir dean was burn-
ing in her breast and she blamed him bitterly
for making so inexperienced a youth as car-
lile the messenger for such an important
despatch she felt a hatred for him as the
man to blame for cars death the sound
of his voice raised and slightly shrill pene-
trating the door of his library filled her with
an angry grief-laden sense of wrong she
the seeds of destruction

turned the handle noiselessly and stepped
within the room with some intention vague
and undefined of accusing him of blaming
him
  an immense mahogany screen guarded
the room from the door and she stood still
hidden by it trying to choke down the
hysteric anger surging up in her throat
  and then even as she stood hesitating a
strange feeling came to her it was as
though the room were charged and alive
with electricity-as though a mighty pulse
beat somewhere within those lofty book-
ined walls-a mighty pulse drowning the
throb of hers and of those pigmy men
seated at the distant table she awoke
suddenly to the knowledge that not anxi-
ety or regret for her brothers fate was the
vital factor-there was that other some-
thing that unknown tremendous quantity
which had been embodied in sir deans
voice when he called the prime minister and
the others into his room without even so
much as a glance at the shapeless bundle
that had been his private secretary a few
hours earlier
  it was a something which she had quite
failed to grasp-something which had driven
her to futile anger against sir dean and
now it seemed to loom up out of the shad-
owy room and grip her soul the papers
it was their fate that mattered it was their
fate menaced a nation their fate meant
the fate of an empire the death of her
brother was only a little side issue-a pain
felt by only one person
  she stared at sir deans face it was as
chough she had never seen him before-it
was the face of an old old man there
were four other men in the room air seated
at the table facing sir dean-sterrith the
prime minister lord vales of the ad-
miralty brett pale and distressed still but
animated by a deep excitement that burned
like molten fire in his youthful eyes schles-
tnger the famous detective for whom sir
dean must have sent immediately
  sterrith and vales were very pale and the
same anxiety that lined sir deans face was
becoming visible in theirs and deeper as
every moment passed they were men in
the grip of a fear indefinite in a measure and
yet so horribly real they were men in the
grip of an evil and the evil was very plain-
it was panic-panic-panic even sir
dean was inclined to be destroyed by it its
influence had marked him unmistakably
  schlesinger - a tall narrow-shouldered
man with an emaciated clever face and
sunken eyes overhung with thick brows-
was leaning over the table his hands loosely
clasped before him his all but invisible eyes
never straying from sir deans haggard face
he was speaking in a soft monotonous tone
that barely penetrated to the recess behind
the screen
  the bald facts are sir dean that you
sent mr darien unaccompanied to the
foreign office with the despatches because
you thought it would avert suspicion if there
should be suspicion and because the other
and ordinary channels were in your opinion
being watched and were the most likely to
be attacked-if as i say an attack was
meditated it has to be taken into account
sir dean that you and you only suggest
that your late secretarys death is traceable
directly to his possession of the papers mr
sterrith here does not i take it believe-
  but he must believe it interrupted
algy brett his voice ringing through the
room with vibrating earnestness  you
must believe it if you dont how are you
going to account for the papers where are
they not at the f  not on poor da-
riens body you may take it from me gen-
tlemen that they are safe in the possession
of an old pal of ours he it is who has
waved his magic wand over them our old
pal alsopp ostermann whom you mr
schlesinger are invited to hunt down
   you look supercilious mr sterrith but
if you will cast your mind back you will
remember that you looked supercilious once
before over the prowess of mr ostermann
on the occasion-exactly a week since-of
the affair of the missing war-ships you
scouted the idea that there was any inven-
tion under the sun that the impregnable
british fighting forces on land and sea did
not possess-except in the imagination of
the daily mail i
   when sir dean suggested to you-when
he jolly well tried to poke it down your
throats-that this man ostermann was the
owner and inventor of a marvelous air-ship
you smiled and smiled and lord vales here
smiled and the whole admiralty and the
minister for war was pointed to the miser-
ably few miserably misunderstood aero-
planes which in flat calm weather manage
to fly a few yards or so over laffans plain
and come to earth with a dashed sight
more ease than they rise from it

adventure
  to those amateur and speculative toys
you proudly pointed and boasted of them as
war-ships which would rout any enemy that
dared to invade our shores-always pro-
vided i suppose that they did not dare for
the next forty years or so till we were ready
for them
and in the meantime continued
sir dean some of his old suavity
back in his voice as his nephews
thrilling voice awoke an answering throb in
his heart and in the meantime alsopp
ostermann a man working hand in hand
with a foreign power for the downfall of
england striving night and day to weaken
her defenses is watching with the eyes of a
hawk for the moment when the opportunity
will arise to throw her at the mercy of the
enemy her strength broken-by his means
-her defenses crippled-by his means her
coast unguarded and her army a panic-
stricken mob
   for the past month ostermann has been
working for this-he and his masters across
the water you as prime minister of
england mr sterrith should have known
this you as the first sea lord lord vales
should have known it-twice i have told
you my suspicions and twice you refused to
be warned even now now at this very
moment with those despatches in his pos-
session with the knowledge they contained
at his disposal with the knowledge gentle-
men that we have fallen one over the other
and without a single protest into his trap-
hear me out if you please gentlemen-with
as i say the knowledge that we have swal-
lowed the bait and that for at least twelve
hours almost the entire east coast is un-
protected unprepared you still refuse to
believe you wont take a warning eh
yes a trap i say a trap and you fools
have insisted upon us walking into it
  his voice rose almost to a shout he
threw calmness to the winds-he threw
etiquette to the winds he cared naught for
it the sight of john sterriths smug face
-startled now at his vehemence and twitch-
ing with nervousness-filled him with rage
at all costs he must rouse them at all
costs or england-london-would be con-
quered withm a night by an enemy who per-
haps even now were steaming full speed
across the channel
  john sterrith had risen to his feet his
face was drawn and pallid and he looked
like a man with his back to the wall sud-
denly awake to the reality that he must fight
  a trap he asked thickly what
trap 
  his stupid eyes stared into denshams
snapping gray ones what trap he
repeated
  densham minced no words he was a
wild beast roused he spat out the answer
like shrapnel
  by whose orders were the atlantic fleet
cruisers and the nore torpedo-destroyer
flotilla sent to sea by whose orders was
the atlantic battleship squadron sent on a
wild goose chase to the hebrides by whose
orders was the east coast denuded of a
single man-of-war worth putting into action
by whose orders i say 
  vales stiffened himself into a semblance of
dignified authority
  the orders were sent through in code
from admiral lord fredom-he conferred
with me on the advisability of preparing
for sudden attack and we arranged that
an imaginary enemy was trying to land
forces-
  and as it happens you prophesied
rightly they are trying to land forces
ostermann is a clever rogue
ostermann
  ostermann codes can be stolen-or
perhaps you didnt guess that who but
ostermann sent those orders to the fleets
who but ostermann spoke to me from the
foreign office and gained a clear five hours
by making me believe darien had got the
despatches through safely
  sterrith ran his finger between his neck
and collar as though choking
  my god he said breathlessly my
god
  the despatches continued sir dean
his voice icy with ill-suppressed anger the
despatches were the germs of the terms of a
private treaty with-you know with whom
gentlemen a private treaty which seen
as it stands is so hostile that even a weaker
country than ostermanns a far more peace-
able one would be justified in declaring war
upon us to provide themselves with the
civilized orthodoxy of an excuse ostermann
planned and succeeded in waylaying the
messenger who was taking them to follett
for consideration with those papers in
their possession no power will blame them
for their attack when they publish the facts
i	can not blame them myself they have
the seeds of destruction	 s
been waiting and waiting and preparing
for this opportunity and it is childish to
quarrel with them for being clever enough
to foresee it and seize upon it and in the
oackground-always in the background-is
aisopp ostermann
  but we ought to do something what
can we do  sterrith asked the question of
every one and any one his nerves were on
fire and the thought that england would
hold him largely responsible crushed him
what can we do he insisted appealing
to each one of them little red shoots tinge-
ng his pale shifty eyes his nervous fingers
playing with his high collar
  theres nothing to be done further than
i	have done-just yet i have sent instruc-
tions broadcast every ship has received
orders there is nothing to do but to sit
still and wait
a little silence fell upon the room
and each man was busy with his
thoughts and in that silence
noiselessly like a phantom figure eva
darien walked slowly up the room from
behind the screen not until she was with-
in the yellow circle of light thrown down
from the hanging lamp above the table did
any one speak and then algy brett leaped
to his feet and crossed over to her
  miss darien he said quickly anxiety
in his voice as he looked into the ashen face
surely you ought to have rested-
  she interrupted him with a little gesture
and then continuing her way across the
yellow patch she walked up to sir dean
  i think i have a message for you from
my brother she said simply
  every man was standing and every mans
eyes were on her face she looked like a
woman in a trance her deep eyes burning
blackly in the pale setting of her face the
only sign of consciousness
  a message- sir deans voice was
aimost a whisper and a wave of compassion
passed over his face as he looked down at
her the thought flashed into his mind
that the sudden tragedy had upset her brain
he tried to say something but his tongue
ormed only the words a message-
she looked at him steadily not an
-motion stirred from the frozen chill of her
iace-only those haunting eyes blazing
with something which he could not read as
sorrow met his and told of life
  yes a message just now they per-
  mitted me to see him i kissed his hand-
they would not let me see his face-i kissed
his hand and as i pressed my lips to it it
opened slowly as though drawing my atten-
tion to that which lay within i think it is
a message meant for you-i think it is
  her voice weakened she took a step
nearer the table and laid upon it a paper-
crushed and creased and red in places
  sir dean picked it up and read it through
then read it through again and then again
   i am a prisoner in aisopp ostermanns air-ship
i can remember seeing him walk toward me as i
was halfway down the terrace then nothing more
i suppose they drugged me i am supposed to be
still insensible but i have been conscious for the
last hour they have flung me into a lazarette
between two steel walls-such a narrow space that
makes it agony to breathe and a worse agony to write
this message but i must try and let some one know
the drug still fogs me yet i can hear them talking
quite plainly and clearly in the cabin beyond the
inner wall of steel plates-the rivets of the plates are
sinking deeper and deeper every moment into my
flesh so tightly am i wedged
   whoever finds me take this paper to sir dean
densham in whitehall to him the following-
break the news of my fate to my sister look in
the lower left drawer of your ebony desk and there
find the despatches and papers which by this time
you will believe to be stolen and in the hands of the
enemy but i had observed strangers following me
the last day or so and as a test i carried faked
despatches with me this afternoon
   ostermanns anger is maniac at the deception i
can hear him raving and wrangling and shouting
orders they are going to murder me-to throw
me overboard its horrible the helplessness of
waiting for them to comc for me
   they have wireless on board and the operator has
been working it for the last hour once i heard
ostermann say  call up the fleet and tell them-
the rest of it was lost then another order strew
london with the seeds of destruction strew them
broadcast over england sow them on every ship
they possess seeds of destruction seeds of
death a sower of the name of ostermann a
reaper of the name of gray ghost who will sound the
last trump
   he is laughing now-horrible laughter-and i can
hear him emptying bags on the table-bags of some-
thing that rattle and roll like quantities of bullets
and yet have the sound of stones being heaped
together id give the world to be able to see
through this impenetrable steel to warn you more
clearly
   i think they are coming for me now-the ship is
dropping and shooting to earth eva my last
thought-
  he saved the papers thank god he
save the papers sir dean muttered and
passed the blood-stained page torn from a
pocket-book across the table to schlesinger
schlesinger read it once and handed it

adventure
to algy brett who was next to him with
the brief comment bombs i suppose
  algy read the posthumous message with
his brain working rapidly and ever circling
round the one man-ostermann oster-
mann had been balked of the papers he had
kidnapped darien to get hold of oster-
mann had ordered the wholesale sowing
of seeds of destruction in revenge be-
sides the brutal murder of denshams secre-
tary what did he mean by  seeds of de-
struction bombs schlesinger thought
so bombs could it be were his allies
from across the channel already steaming
toward england with the pennant of war
flying in defiant triumph or had the loss of
the despatches delayed them were the
seeds of destruction purely and solely a
holocaustic revenge on ostermanns part
and entirely independent of the threatened
invasion bombs bombs but if they
were bombs something would have hap-
pened before this london could have been
wrecked in the time which must have elapsed
between the writing of the blood-stained
little note and now now it was almost one
oclock an hour after that fatal midnight
an hour since st stephens had boomed out
carlile dariens death-signal in an hour
something would have happened and yet
that warning written by a hand that was
barely cold in death it was impossible to
disregard it
  and then in a flash light came to him
it was as though a voice breathed in his ear
-the chill wraiths voice of the murdered
darien
  he flung round in a frenzy of excitement
the blood flaming in his face his eyes
snapping
  the late edition of the westminster
gazette he cried eagerly i saw ed-
monds hand it to you uncle
  he searched among the papers on the
desk and found it it was a midnight edi-
tion on the parliamentary crisis he
turned in awkward haste to the stop-press
news and read a short three-line sentence
out loud
   a van-driver was killed late this evening in fleet
street by a meteorite it struck him with such
great force that it was found imbedded in his brain
on arrival at st bartholomews hospital
  brett flung the paper down before schles-
inger
  a meteorite he said his voice shrill
  with meaning a meteorite or a seed of
destruction   which 
iii
the dawn found algy brett return-
ing from a laborious systematic
search which had resulted in his
possessing three peculiarly round peculiarly
similar dead-white lead-heavy stones oee
he had picked up in an area of the new war
office buildings one in the yard of st
pauls cathedral and one he had been per-
mitted to secure from st bartholomews
spotted red with its victims blood
he took them straight to schlesinger
schlesinger looked at them almost care-
lessly and tossed them on to a side table
   bombs-deadly bombs lie said shortly
bombs but devilishly ingenious that
little lot of three must alone have cost a
pretty big sum and the man who is re-
sponsible for their being where you found
them must either be a lunatic or an enemy
more than ordinarily vindictive and cruel
brett received the big detectives verdict
without moving a muscle that the eyilly
pallid things were bombs of some soft or
other he had guessed-it would be absolute
foolishness to attempt to think otherwise-r
and he also realized that whatever their
ultimate purpose at present they were
harmless so he watched schlesinger toss
them oh the side-table with the composure
of a war veteran
  we guessed that at one oclock this
morning he said coolly we only
wanted to authenticate dariens message
that they were sowing what they facetiously
called seeds what i now want to know is
what will send them off that they are
intended to go off at a certain time is obvious
-but when thats the mighty question
when and another mighty question is
how its a certainty that ostermann
when he has finished placing the beastly
things isnt going to spend some more time
hunting em up and setting em off that
isnt likely is it especially if theres a
daisy little fleet of men-of-war twiddling
their thumbs outside there waiting for lon-
don to be blown to eternity so they can
then rush in and sing were-king of the
castle at long long last
  i should say it was no at all likely mr
brett the things will go ctff by them-
selves in due course
the seeds of destruction
 
  and we can do nothing but sit still and
twiddle our thumbs till they do 
  we can do something certainly-we
have done already a great deal sir dean
has made the communication wires in every
inch of england red-hot with instructions
secret agents have almost worn a path from
whitehall to all the arsenals barracks
depots telephone exchanges the coasts are
alive with moving gun-barrels the water is
black with scouting destroyers every ship
is cleared for action sir dean is a wonder-
ful old fellow you ought to be proud of
being his nephew according to him hes
a little proud of you eh i heard of your
adventure of the stolen battleships and the
liverpool affair good lad i wish you
belongedto me
  it would be exciting wouldnt it but
tell me more tell me in what numbers do
you think they have sown these things i
searched the war office from ceiling to
cellar-we all did-and we found nothing
but that one white stone and that was out-
side the building do you think theyd be
satisfied with one
  one would be more than sufficient to
make hay of whitehall itself let alone the
war office staking everything to the unit
system i think we have london anyway
almost freed from the menace my men
have been busy they have swarmed over
the face of the map like bees and theyve
collected a most satisfactory amount of
honey
  phew thats good news isnt it
exclaimed algy his face lighting up
  very good assented the detective
smiling at the others enthusiasm but
it would be more satisfactory if we could
collect ostermann for two reasons i want
him
  its easier to put salt on a birds tail than
to try and catch ostermann what are the
two reasons 
  first he may set to work any moment
the power which is to explode his seeds of
destruction secondly we do not know
that he has sown them all
   if i could only discover the secret-the
unholy secret of those anemic pebbles if
we knew that-
  evflfthen we would not be much better
off than we are now its that man oster-
mann the njaster hand ostermann who
by a finger pressed upon a tiny button can
gain thepower -to slaughter us all
      brett sprang up from his chair
kiw anc over schlesinger peering
into his clever emaciated face with
eyes ablaze
  you know youve solved the riddle
you know the secret of the bombs lord
here have i been chewing my nails trying to
puzzle it out and youve known it all the
time tell me
  the detective famous in two continents
known the world over reverenced by his
satellites consulted by every crowned head
in europe the czars personal friend stood
up suddenly before algy brett and bade
him look at him
  he was more than ordinarily tall emaci-
ated to a point verging on a skeleton with
narrow shoulders shrugged up to his ears
a mass of stringy hair strikingly white and
lifeless a pair of brilliant eyes deeply sunk
above them protruded a pair of bushy
brows whose inky blackness was almost
grotesque in harsh comparison with his
ashen hair and colorless face seered and
lined and pitted as though a lingering un-
conquerable disease devoured and fed it
  look at me he commanded in me
-in the wreck of a fine man you see-a
martyr to science years ago my name was
beginning to be whispered abroad as a
scientist i intended to make it a name to
conjure with perhaps after all i have
succeeded in that aim though not in the
career i loved best in the world perhaps
-who knows-i have done better work
in this sphere than i might have done in
that other but to continue
  one of the mysteries i attacked day and
night was the mystery of why some oper-
ators of what is known as the x-rays should
have become attacked by a virulent incur-
able disease-why its most persistent disci-
ples should almost without exception be
stricken by the deadly malady i failed to
succeed i fell a victim myself and was ill for
years-for so many years that my place was
filled striplings had raced ahead of me i
was a forgotten quantity
  there was nothing for it but to turn my
attention to the profession i loved next after
science i became what you know me to
be to-day but i dabbled still and one day
not a great many since i stumbled across
the secret which had baffled me so long
which had baffled the whole company of
medical men for so long i discovered the
poisonous fangl
adventure
  i discovered one solitary isolated single
uy-a ray so deadly in its undreamed of
power so malignant so tremendous in its
consequences when vised alone that it will
raake the whole world sick with horrified
wonder and dismay when the knowledge is
given to it a thin pale purple ray-in
reality a flaming sword-the swiftest mes-
senger of death ever sent from heaven or
hell or from the cankered mind of him who
also has discovered it he who has known
of it improved on it welded it to his colossal
purpose sold it to his allies for thirty pieces
of silver
  this is ostermanns secret this is how
he will destroy england-how he hopes to
pave the way for that attacking army which
may even now be awaiting the signal to
empty its numbers into london and seize a
victory on the heels of panic first he sows
the seeds and as the sun in the heavens
shines down and brings to life the seeds we
sow so ostermann flashing like a meteor
through the skies will with his purple ray
shine on the seeds he has scattered broad-
cast upon the earth and each of those
curiously shaped curiously innocent-looking
little white stones there will burst forth
and shoot out tongues of fire ingenious
isnt it
  algy licked his lips they were burning
and parched as though a fever gripped him
perhaps it did-the fever of an almost in-
sane and helpless anger against aisopp
ostermaiin
  ingenious he cried bitterly his eyes
wet  ingenious the man of hell himself
couldnt have invented anything more
monstrous-or used it worse ostermann
were helpless were in ostermanns
power
  weve done the one and only thing we
could have done without capturing the man
himself thanks to poor darien weve been
able to do something
you mean reaping his harvest
or at least reaping a patch or two
of it cried brett with a cackle of
laughter shaking his voice
  weve reaped most of it i hope said
schlesinger slowly those bombs must
have taken days and days to fashion and
cost thousands of pounds each it is not
likely on the face of it that our enemies-no
matter how rich and envious and ambitious
-would supply ostermann with a larger
quantity than necessary i am relying on
the theory that ostermann does not allow
for any possible hitch occurring he has
sown every seed of destruction he had
aboard his air-ship and for a space at least
we are safe
  the toss-up is whether he has any emer-
gency store of them somewhere handy to
fall back on
  not in england said schlesinger
grimly
  why not
  the ray would explode the emergency
store at the same time it was blowing up the
others i doubt whether hed even risk
keeping one aboard his air-ship while he was
working the ray apparatus thanks to that
poor fellow darien i think we have him hip
and thigh over this little job eh
  schlesinger clasped his thin fingers and
a flame of triumphal pride shot from his
hidden eyes
  thanks also to your wonderfulbrain
schlesinger cried algy grasping the
folded hands and pressing them with boy-
ish gratitude and hero-worship if you
hadnt figured what those beastly little
pebbles meant and had delayed sending out
every bobby in london-and every village
out of it where they possess a bobby-to
hunt all out wed have been preparing to
die at any moment they ought to let you
loose in the mint for this with a couple of
sacks
  were not out of the wood yet sonny 
said the detective smiling we can not
be certain that we have even picked un
half-
  even as he spoke the ground beneath
them quivered a dull roar filled the little
room with thunder a horrible sickening
sound of tremendous explosion shook the
world and for a long long unending cen-
tury that was but a minute of time it was as
though the universe had fallen and were
crashing about their ears
  stunned and pale they clung to each
other-the man and the boy-fearful and
shaking then they dashed to the window
and tore the blind aside
  peering out they saw the eastern sky just
cutting a thread of opal-tinted pink fore-
telling dawn
  upon the river below the wharfs were
tinging slowly with the reflection of the
thread and beyond the river hovering like
a fog-clogged cloud shapeless and -distant
the seeds of destruction
 

gray and menacing something sailed rapidly
through the clearing air
  algy leaned heavily against schlesinger
craning his neck round the dividing middle
frame of the narrow window
  he pointed to it his breath catching as
though sobs choked him his eyes flecked
with the funny little streaks of red which
had shot through them when he fled from
the secretarys broken body as it lay at his
feet in the street
   gray ghost he whispered pointing
gray ghost
  and the ray assented schlesinger
  yes and the ray it was falling from the
air-ship like a stream of molten lead-thin
purple in color unwavering at times it
also reflected the radiant rose color of the
coming dawn and became a flaming sword
-the sword of battle and murder and
death tinged and streaked with crimson
blood
  and to meet it as though welcoming its
coming the earth shot into red and yellow
flames licking the purple ray and staining
the dawn with smoke-grimed fingers
  woolwich arsenal cried schlesinger
a bitter chagrin eating into his voice  wool-
wich those fools
  ostermann had drawn first blood
iv
an hour passed-an hour of agony
and anxiety london had poured
out into the streets - a jostling
fighting swarm of terrified creatures who
had taken the terrific explosion of woolwich
arsenal to be the sign and signal that the
end of the world was approaching they
marched down whitehall armies of them
ragged and rich singing hymns and offering
up delirious prayers to the heavens which
were red and menacing with the glare of
burning woolwich they massed together
in side streets afraid to go back to their
homes refusing to believe that all danger
was at an end
  and as though to determine them in their
obstinacy a second shock though less vio-
lent than the first shattered the stillness and
made the earth heave and rumble beneath
their flying feet once more the ray had
done its work this time it was farther
away-somewhere toward the mouth of the
river and then in quick succession a
third explosion followed hard on the heels
of the second and again the lurid glow
lightedup the sky
  schlesinger turned to brett
  probably gravesend-and sheerness
the last one was a considerable distance off
probably the unit system has failed to
work though i am thankful to say i did
not rely absolutely upon it especially in
places of naval or military importance but
all the same even three is more than i
hoped he would get
  algy turned round from the window in
the last hour he had not moved an inch
away from it but at the last explosion the
mob had scurried away like frightened
rabbits and the street was almost clear
again he pointed it out to the detective
  its fairly clear now shall i run over
and see uncle dean he asked me to slip
across as soon as i could with safety
yes do ill just get through to him
again and tell him youre going i will fol-
low you perhaps but at present i must
stay here and take the messages as the
come in
the look of age had deepened on sir
deans face it was the face of a
man who had lived a troubled cen-
tury in the hours that had gone he turned
to his nephew with a flash of relief lighting
up the gloom of his eyes
  well boy any more news im very
glad to have you here im very lonely
 has miss darien gone 
  yes vales took her home tell me
what schlesinger thinks algy its driving
me mad to realize that i must sit here and
wait wait while that fiend up there does
his evil work at will three victories for
him in london and four from the country
thank god our ships are safe and are
searching the channel-scouring the north
sea for the enemy though i expect that
as things have not turned out quite as they
planned they have gone back to port to
await further advice from ostermann
thanks to schlesinger this nights work
must be as gall and wormwood in oster-
manns mouth and id give all i possess in
this world if we could only see him tasting
the bitterness of his failure
   i would give the rest of my life itself to
be able to rid england of such an enemy
if i could only do something its this
awful state of helplessness thats driving
me mad if we could do something

adventure
     still the list isnt a quarter as bad as it
  r might have been sir only seven wool-
  wich shorncliffe aldershot a tyneside
  yard and unauthenticated reports from
  dover and sheerness and gravesend a
  severe bucketing but nothing like it might
  have been think of the carnage if schles-
  inger had not acted within five minutes of
  leaving here
   a worse bucketing aye and we
 must swallow it without a murmur because
 we can do nothing we have no proof
 we have a man like john sterrith at our
 head-frightened intent on keeping his
 ministerial fingers clean starving england
 on his peace-at-all-costs policy peace
 forsooth because he is afraid of the sound
 of shots
    well hes got some in advance and un-
  asked for this time perhaps it will wake
  him up if he had only sanctioned that loan
  to hafner and myself we might have had the
  nucleus of a fine fleet of aerial men-of-war
  now and could have gone out on the stroke
  of twelve and fought ostermann on his
  own level even if i could have managed
  star of the sea i would have at least tried to
  wing that monster bird of prey but since
  hafner lias disappeared the engine has
  broken down and  one seems able to
  understand the stupid thing if only
  hafner-
   hafner what has become of him
  disappeared 
    yes immediately we landed after the
  stolen battleship affair i had prophesied
  that his share of the deal would be enough
  to keep him for the rest of his life and that he
  could at least enjoy himself building air-ship
  models i even suggested to him that the
  government might be able to see wisdom
  in a year or so and that then his fortune
  would be made but he didnt care for
  anything i said he seemed dazed
    i think that the excitement of being so
  close to his hated enemy being as it were
  vithin an inch of victory and the consumma-
  tion of his long-cherished revenge and then
  for ostermann to escape him in the last
  was too much for his brain anyway he
  escaped me and though i have searched
  everywhere for him i cant find him 
  suppose hell turn up again some day
    theres one thing that makes me think
  so and that is he gave me his word of honor
  that if he possibly could hed let me in at
  the death and if i know anything of
hafner hes the kind of beggar to glory in the
fact of there being witnesses to his final
gloating triumph oh hafner will turn up
again ive no doubt but i wish hed have
done it before this
  the words were scarcely out of bretts
mouth when the telephone-bell rang sharply
at his elbow and with a nod of assent from
sir dean he took off the receiver and
listened
  a raucous voice stifled and barely in-
telligible came through and at the sound
of it algys face flushed up with sudden
excitement and he uttered a name for his
uncles benefit motioning him to take up the
second receiver
  hafner it was hafners voice hafner
trying passionately to control his words and
falling they came tumbling and racing
through the telephone tripping one another
up stumbling one upon the other some-
what incoherent sometimes utterly incom-
prehensible but always thrilling -with a fer-
vid excitement and a fierce unholy joy
  ive got him ive got him i have
watched all night and wondered what his
game was then when woolwich arsenal
blew up i knew i watched him still im
and is purple searchlight watched him
circling and darting away up and out of
sight then coming back slowly down like
a bird down down close as e dared to the
earth as though searching for summat he
couldnt find sometimes hed go off for a
long time and then swoop back again an
search again with his purple light an then
it appened something went wrong with
gray ghost  i could hear her groaning as
she flew-it looked as though she was coming
straight in my direction and flying low and
fisting badly and one of er wings drooping
shes maimed and broken for the first time
in er life-a bad break and ostermann is
in my power-
  the raucous voice died away in a wild sob
and brett shouted wildly for him to go on-
to go on-that every minute was precious
-every second meant a chance for oster-
mann
  where are you speaking from hafner
where are we to find you he yelled for-
getting everything in his wild excitement
where are you and where is ostermann
  hafner laughed like a madman at the
other end of the wire and they could hear
him gurgling delirious with the frenzy of
his sudden opportunity
the seeds of destruction

  where are you demanded algy for
the third time a fierce impatience shaking
him if you wont tell us we will have to
set the yard on to find him and the moment
we do that he will know and hes not the
man to sit still and wait for them to run him
down is he look here hafner if you
dont work with us youll let him slip through
your fingers where are you
  in a call-office in wapping ive been
doin a bit of work down ere and livin in a
garret of a house the garret has a door on
to the roof and i was up there when i caught
sight of gray ghost ostermann and gray
ghost disappeared somewhere on the river
banks im going out now to find out where
im goin to unt him down and if i meet
him face to face-
  tell me where you are give me your
address you idiot or tell me where i can
meet you you cant hunt that man down
alone wait for me to come along with you
will you why not you promised me i
should be in at the end i promise you i
wont try and stop your taking your re-
venge-you can tear his heart out and jump
on it if you like-only let me be there too
will you
  they listened to him growling and
grumbling and grunting at the other end
and waited anxiously for the decision he
was struggling to and then at last it
came - reluctant and ungracious but a
consent
  well yer can come when ive found im
-not before that mind yer though 
wont ave yer nosing around and giving im
the straight tip to clear out and if yer
wont try and tell me murder aint nice and
the sight not pretty enough to suit yer yer
can come if yerll promise me yerll wait till
i tell yer to come-oh no fear of that ill
give yer time and plenty you go to yer
bed and sleep till i want yer-thatll be
time enough for you aw ill find him
he cant ave gone far he was winged too
bad he was now give me yer word you
wont come hunting round with a lot of
tects till i tell yer im ready thank yer
ill old yer to that mind
  he rang off without a word of warning
and brett hung up his receiver with an air
of bitter disappointment
  more delays he said pettishly flinging
himself back in his chair i am sick of
them all hafner is an ungrateful turncoat
i thought wed got ostermann at last i
thought wed got him at last
  and perhaps we have said sir dean
slowly  perhaps we have at least we are
sure of one thing-gray ghost is disabled and
out of the battle for a few hours and with-
out gray ghost ostermann is powerless
for a few hours then we are safe al-
though we can do nothing for a few hours
we are safe thank a merciful god-safe
and now ring through and tell schlesinger
i	command him to go to bed

  mazaro gonzales kicked the compiled
laws of new mexico that held open the
door of the hot dingy office and crushed
a greasy sombrero with his dirty hands as he
doggedly waited for big bill king to
answer
  do you know what id do mazaro
big bill replied without a moments hesita-
tion i would take just about fifteen
minutes to give that brother-in-law a whirl-
wind finish and id do it with about two-
bits worth of buckshot and the first piece
of ordnance i could lay my hands on 
  me no comprendo grunted mazaro
knitting his bronzed brows and peering
through his pen-slit eyes at the big hand-
some american who sat tilted back in
a common kitchen chair his feet crossed on
top of a weather-beaten desk
  i mean mazaro and king stopped
puffing the big black cigar and faced the
mexican that id shoot him dead full of
buckshot and id do it quick
  biieno amigo was the greasers
only comment as he shuffled out of the
door and big bill king returned to the
business which mazaros timid knock had
interrupted the particular business in
hand and in fact about the only business
in which william gordon king had engaged
since his arrival in paradise six months pre-
viously was cursing the stars that had
guided him to this forlorn town whose big-
gest attraction was its burying-ground and
whose chiefest enterprises were loafing in
the daytime and enlarging the cemetery
by night
  for by one of the jokes of fate william
gordon king the many-sided was doing
time in paradise in the heart of the desert
country with the office of county attorney
serving as the shackle
  as a matter of history it was no star at ai
that guided him to paradise but the greasy
finger of mazaro gonzales whose acquain-
tance he had made a year previous when
both were shifting railroad-ties on the new
line of road entering paradise shifting
railroad-ties was not kings regular profes-
sion neither was county-attorneying
  his original intention and overwhelming
ambition when he journeyed west and
climbed the mountains was to gouge out the
heart of the taos range and become a great
copper king but as months rolled by and
the only copper he found within reach was
the few pieces stamped with indian heads
which he retained of his original capital he
turned to the only paying profession he
could find and it brought him side by side
with mazaro on the new railroad grade
  when the seasons work was over and
mazaro said  go my town paradise he
accepted the suggestion and before the end
of six months bill king found himself
bearing up as best fie could under the title of
county attorney and sitting day after day
in his office in a one-story adobe building
with an equipment of a half-dozen law books

necessitys law
in paradise
stella burke may
necessitys law in paradise

inherited from a suddenly deceased prede-
cessor the law books be it understood
contained all the knowledge of law the office
 of county attorney now held it was not
necessary to know law to be elected county
attorney in paradise
   when the good citizens of paradise had
first suggested the office to william gordon
king he hesitated for a moment but only
for a moment during that moment of
hesitation a vision of the railroad grade
arose before his eyes and the next he
was nominated for county attorney he
argued with himself that granting he had
no knowledge of law neither had he pos-
sessed any knowledge of mining or railroads
and if in the few months he had been in their
midst the inhabitants of paradise had seen
in him the making of a legal light far be
it from him to depreciate himself the
previous occupations of miner and day-
laborer were unknown to his supporters in
paradise with the exception of mazaro
mazaro kept his own counsel and big bill
did the same
   at the hour of mazaros visit bill king
had occupied the office of county attorney
for just two weeks that is he had held pos-
session of the office there had been no
duties to perform so it was not the obliga-
tions of office that caused him to curse his
stars it was not the position of county
attorney it was not even mazaro who
had guided him thither it was paradise
just paradise-the most desolate spot in all
this barren country and in this dreary
desert with its sacrilegious name he had
sworn to stalk for one year as a mighty limb
of the law
the sound of the church-bell an-
nounced the angelus hour and
kicking his cigar-stubs into a cor-
ner the county attorney of paradise
started home to his evening meal at the
ranch of pedro espejo
  there was small companionship between
ihe easterner and pedro the ranch-owner
or his wife and senor king ate his
supper and drank his vile black coffee in
silence
  paradise weighed heavily upon him to-
night and wrapped him in a gloom too dense
for the wreaths of smoke from his big black
cigar to penetrate not even the remem-
brance of mazaro gonzales visit or ma-
zaro gonzales family troubles could seep
through the pall of his own self-absorption
until some remark of espejos wife spoken rf
in spanish to her husband in which she men-
tioned the name of bonita brought him out
of his pit of despair for bonita was the
name of mazaros sister
  i wonder if francisco does beat up his
wife he mused funny that mazaro
should have made that call on me this after-
noon maybe he wanted the benefit of my
legal knowledge and he almost smiled
maybe-great heavens and his breath
stopped as the seriousness of the situation
dawned upon him had mazaro come to
him for legal advice was the story of the
brother-in-law told in the brief words of
this greaser his ignorant way of consult-
ing an attorney
  an overwhelming terror seized big bill
king who had never known fear in his life
the more he thought the greater grew his
fear he had known mazaro as a quiet
peaceable fellow who lived alone in his uttle
adobe shack and seldom spoke of himself or
his affairs once or twice he had spoken of
bonita to bill king when the days work
was over on the railroad grade and always
in a bluntly tender way but never until
to-day had he mentioned the fact of her
domestic infelicity
  so scant was the county attorneys
acquaintance with methods of jurispru-
dence that he had given freely of his advice
to mazaro never dreaming that anything
more than a hypothetical case was being
presented he had spoken to a friend not
a client
  as the evening wore on he became more
and more oppressed with the thought and
finally determined to ease his conscience by
going to mazaros dobe and talking the
matter over
  once outside the ranchhouse he felt bet-
ter and breathed deeply of the still night air
however much the greasers might be stick-
ing knives between one anothers fifth and
sixth ribs within their cabins the night
without was quiet as the near-by graveyard
and the only sound was the howl of the
lobos or big wolves that came from the dis-
tant hills
  king walked quickly along the white
dusty road watching the shifting patterns
traced on the path as the moonlight slanted
through the scattering mesquite
  as he neared the church he heard the
tolling of a bell and rounding a corner he
adventure
heard a wailing moaning sound a coffin
was being borne by six bare-headed men
behind it trailed a dozen or more women
each with a black shawl over her head and
each vying with the other in an effort to
make the loudest noise as they passed into
the church where the wail changed to the
most dismal chant imaginable
  in his present state of mind this wailing
of women and the chanting of the funeral
service added tenfold to his already de-
pressed spirits as he quickened his steps
toward the home of mazaro across the
plaza
  approaching the little wooden bridge
across the arroyo he heard the sound of
hoof-beats clackety-clack clackety-clack-
nearer and nearer came the pounding of the
horses hoofs
  king stepped aside to give the rider the
right of way as the horse dashed past
eig bill kings heart stood still for as the
moonlight fell upon the rider the legal light
or paradise saw francisco the brother-in-
law of mazaro clinging to the bronchos
reck with his left arm while his right hung
iimp and lifeless and blood streamed from
his face and head king opened his mouth
to shout to the broncho to stop but choked
he cry in his throat when the sound of an-
other horses hoofs was borne to him across
ihe arroyo a second time he stood aside
his time in abject terror and as he crouched
down beside the chaparral he recognized
the form of the deputyrsheriff in mad
haste pursuing the pony which bore the
perhaps dead body of bonitas husband
  a thousand thoughts crowded into kings
brain but uppermost of all were thewords he
had said to mazaro a few hours before i
would shoot him dead with buckshot
  imperfect as was his knowledge of law he
icsew enough about procedure in paradise
to hazard a bet that the deputy-sheriff
would arrest mazaro without the formality
of a complaint from what he gathered of
the conversation at espejos ranch the mat-
ter of bonitas family difficulties was a
known quantity in paradise and big bill
knew that a little technicality like the
county attorneys signature on a warrant
for arrest would never bother a peace officer
in paradise
  well he soliloquized as he turned his
steps toward pedros ranch i guess im in
for it but id better keep out of the way
until the brick falls
big bill slept little that night
he had more on his conscience
than he had ever had in all his
life and his conscience had borne some
burdens too for as he once remarked he
had committed about all the crimes in the
calendar except suicide
  there was something altogether discon-
certing in the thought that the first duty
performed in the capacity of county attor-
ney was to advise a greaser to murder his
brother-in-law and the further thought that
the next duty would be to prosecute his
first client
  of course mazaro was arrested it
didnt take deputy-sheriff hawkins long to
trace the criminal mazaro had admitted
and in fact had boasted in the five fingers
saloon that afternoon that he intended to
shoot francisco dead but from all he could
learn of the conversation king could not
find that mazaro had implicated the new
county attorney in any way
  before morning deputy-sheriff hawkins
had rounded up mazaro and had him locked
in one of the kennel-like cells that look out
upon the dirty courtyard called a jail in
paradise
  mazaro offered no resistance with dog-
like silence he submitted to the law never for
a moment making any attempt to vindicate
himself what was going on behind those
dull half-shut eyes the county attorney
could not guess moreover there was
enough going on in the county attorneys
own mind to keep him pretty busy
  for while mazaro slept in his dirty cell
there was little sleep for the county attor-
ney day after day and night after night
he spent in his office in the quaint little
one-story building poring over the few law
books the den afforded moneys digest 
and the new mexico reports were
thumb-marked from beginning to end in
the hope of finding some authority justifying
such a crime as mazaros instead of pros-
ecutor he became attorney for the defense
as he turned page after page uttering mal-
edictions upon the heads of all his prede-
cessors who had left him so small a library
even the copy of compiled laws of new
mexico was gathered up from the floor
where it had served as door-prop but like
the others it failed to throw any light 
the question
  in desperation he dug an abandoned vol-
ume of chitty on criminal law from
necessitys law in paradise

a dusty drawer of fee desk and removed
from its supporting place under the back
ieg of the table bishops criminal pro-
cedure and fell upon them with feverish
anxiety after hours and hours of pawing
through assault with felonious intent to
	premeditated murder he heaved a sigh
of relief as he came across justifiable hom-
icide justifiable homicide he read
in an effort to prevent bodily harm to
parent child brother sister- there
he had them sister-in an effort to pre-
vent bodily harm to sister
  for five seconds he breathed easier but
as he read on came the fact of the premedi-
tation the boasting of mazaro in the five
fingers saloon as for mazaros visit to
him that was known to only the county
attorney and mazaro and unless the
greaser admitted it in testimony the
county attorney resolved that it should be
forever a buried secret nevertheless the
fact remained that mazaro had boasted
that he intended to kill francisco and no
amount of law reading could wipe out the
jact that kept coming back to taunt bill
king that it was purely and simply a case
tf premeditated murder
  well by george he exclaimed as
a new thought struck him francisco
isnt dead yet maybe he wont die so un-
less mazaro treats me to a load of his buck-
shot or that sweet little brother-in-law gets
well and tries to beat me to death i may
ome out all right yet
  but before night a new phase was given
to kings troubles and one that made his
former anxiety fade to a mere mirage in
searching through his legal books and pam-
phlets he learned something new that
in just seven days the annual term of
court would be held in paradise in fulfill-
ment of his oath of office he the county
attorney must on the opening day of
court present to the grand jury all viola-
tions of the law within the jurisdiction of
his office when he took the oath this
meant nothing and the date made no im-
pression upon him now the awful mean-
ing of it stunned him in seven days he
must prosecute mazaro gonzales for taking
his advice
  i cant do it thats all he repeated
again and again i cant prosecute that
poor devil for doing what i told him to do
and if i dont ill have to lay the case be-
fore the grand jury  make a clean breast of
it exonerate mazaro and then-then its
big william once more to the railroad-
ties
all this while mazaro was glorying
in his incarceration hoping pray-
ing that his shot had been fatal
glad to stay in jail willing to eat crusts to
sleep on a dirty floor to suffer anything if
only francisco were dead and little bonita
would smile up into his face as she did when
she used to bake his tortillas before the little
adobe cabin had seemed so lonely and
bonita so sad
  for seven days francisco lay unconscious
on the sheepskin on the floor of old marias
hut where the deputy-sheriff had carried
him on the night of the crime there were
no hospitals in paradise there was seldom
need for them usually the mexicans did
their work so well that a priest and a grave-
digger performed the last rites without the
aid of a hospital
  but mazaro had miscalculated some-
where and death was not instantaneous as
he had prayed it might be if mazaro had
but seen little bonita hovering over her
liege lord during those hours of unconscious-
ness and delirium and ministering to his
wants with her left hand while around her
right she wore a huge bandage covering the
marks of her husbands last caress he
would have bitten through the bars of his
cell and completed his work but mazaro
didnt see he only prayed in his cell
  at last the seven days had passed and the
day before the opening of court arrived
with big bill king in a state of mind border-
ing on insanity in all that god-forsaken
town there was no one ear into which he
could pour his tale of woe with any hope of
sympathy he had determined on the only
course possible-to lay his story before the
grand jury and take his medicine he had
reached the ultimate limit in his state of
anxiety and was waiting for the grand jury
to convene and know the worst
  just out of curiosity he thought he would
make a call upon old maria and inquire after
the ill-being of francisco old maria was
baking in the little bee-hivelike oven out-
side her house
  how is francisco to-day he asked of
her
  he gon-a home tak away from these
plaze senor she replied indifferently
  what he shouted in her ears so loud

adventure
that she dropped the hot coals she was
raking hes not dead and his voice
trembled with the burden of this last straw
  no no dead gon-a home with bon-
ita and she adjusted the black shawl on
her head and turned to go in the low door
but hesitated and added as though un-
certain whether the information contained
news mazaro he gon-a too to hees
plaze and the door closed
  here was new field for thought for the
county attorney the execution of the
law it seemed was being handled in para-
dise unaided by the county attorney
mazaro had been arrested without his sigr-
nature to the complaint and had been re-
leased likewise without his assistance
now that the fear of the grand jury no
longer stared him in the face he was begin-
ning to feel annoyed that the county attor-
ney was of so httle account in paradise
when he remembered that deputy-sheriff
hawkins had told him once that in paradise
they never monkeyed with anything less
than murder if they kills em hawk-
ins had said all right if they dont kill
em we dont have no time to bother with
trials
  well i guess my jobs good for the rest
of the year king assured himself that
is its good unless mazaro gets another two-
bits worth of buckshot and happens around
my way he had never uprooted the
lurking suspicion that mazaro would hold
him responsible for his arrest
  but mazaro didnt trouble big bill
kings slumbers that night and for the
first time since the day mazaro followed his
advice king slept
early in the morning he was at
the office to prepare for the open-
ing of court he had started dust-
ing his library and had reached chitty
on criminal law when a timid knock was
heard at the door
  come in he shouted at least he
started to shout but the in died away in
a faint whisper as mazaro gonzales entered
greasy sombrero in hand
  the county attorney got ready to dodge
the buckshot but found sufficient voice to
ask the mexican to be seated mazaro
stood shyly just inside the doorway in a
voice lowered to the most abject apology
and with his chin drawn in until it rested on
a dirty handkerchief tied around his neck
he mumbled
  senor meester king he began are
you perfeckly disgust with me 
  by this time the county attorneys voice
had left him completely he looked blank-
ly at mazaro and waited
  bowing as though revealing an unpar-
donable sin to his father confessor while
a great light dawned over big bill king
mazaro gonzales gulped twice and said
well you see senor-you see  lars
he dont keep no buckshot you cant kill
no man with birdshot

to send the princess to her kinsman the duke of padua the princess regards him as a mercenary cut-
throat and even attempts to stab him
chapter xvii
an attack from within
could make shift to hold the
place for as long as our scant
provisions lasted unless prince
antonio came against me with a
large force and powerful cannon and i
thought he would not do this until he had
wasted time in sending gianni potrero or
another troop of the same sort-and every
tour gained was an aid to me since in ten
days or thereabouts i might look for succor
from florence at intervals i made the
rounds of the castle to see that my men
were not nodding at their postsi found
nothing of that sort but it was plain that a
spirit of discord was stirring when i came
on two men together they were deep in some
conference which they broke off with an air
half sheepish and half sullen the meaning
of all this was easy to guess there had
been a deal of secret discussion as to why
the princes cousin was our prisoner and
some of my troop had come to the con-


adventure
elusion that the business was not to their
liking
  returning to the hall i kicked the fire
and polished the hilt of my sword a
mutiny and if i fell what would then be-
come of the princess i shuddered to think
what might chance if omeara and i were
cut down and the wild horde about us were
left free to do their own will however it
was useless to worry i needed all my
strength and had better try to sleep but
hardly had i closed my eyes when a new
thought sent me to my feet in a cold chill
what if some among my men should try
tampering with the princess door in the
end i stretched myself at full length close to
her threshold on the stone paving
  in the morning i bade omeara take food
to the ladies whom i had no intention of
seeking that day it was quite useless i
knew to try to convince the princess of my
good faith and i had resolved to make no
further effort
  omeara did not return and after finish-
ing my meal in solitude i began to experience
considerable curiosity as to what he could be
about yielding at last i went quietly up
the stairs and paused with my foot on the
topmost step my mouth falling open in
astonishment
  francesca and omeara had come out
into the gallery i smiled since giulia had
failed the night before in her attempt to
crush me with her anger and her cold steel
no doubt her lady had determined to see if
she might not have better luck in winning
omeara over to their cause
  a wide stone bench was built into the
wall and on this lay madonna francesca in
the most limp and pathetic heap imaginable
her misty golden hair disheveled her dark
eyes full of tears her pretty lips quivering
in a fashion that might well have made any
living man long to kiss them into smiles
the irishman stood before her and at sight
of him i came near to betraying my presence
with a roar of mirth never in my life
had i beheld such a picture of abject cow-
ardice as he now appeared before this little
golden-haired lady
  ah she sobbed piteously enough i
can not believe it of you messer omeara
indeed i can not only two days ago we
were in the princes loggia and you swore you
loved me with all your heart and soul-
  and i did that same he protested
oassionately
  she turned away from him pettishly 
can never trust you again i can never look
on you without fear and horror she in-
formed him relentiessly do you think i
shall ever forget the ride you gave me yester-
day i am stiff and sore and frightened yet
-and see how you bruised my finger against
your steel vest it is blue at the tip you
can see for yourself  and she extended a
little white hand with an intensely tragic
gesture
  the utter horror that instantly depicted
itself on omearas face appeared to mollify
her slightly and amused me to such a point
that i came near betraying my presence by
a burst of laughter a bruised finger
indeed the irishman was accustomed to
see blood run like water and i had seen him
take wounds that were near mortal with
never a groan yet his anguished solicitude
was as sincere as though he were some young
girl who had never looked on a bare blade
i left the two at their wrangling
and made the round of the castle
-	finding nothing that heartened me
greatly the dissatisfaction of the men had
grown in the night presently there would be
an outbreak-and i found myself looking
forward to it with an uneasiness i had never
felt before in time of peril i gave no sign
but strode about briskly praising some
rating others giving curt orders after my
usual fashion but i knew that the instant
my gaze was off them they fell to grumbling
and plotting behind my back the air had
the still tenseness of a coming storm and
if my own troopers turned against me how
was i to hold the castle against antonio
  weary and disheartened i went up on the
battlements gazing across the black woods
and the fertile country that melted away in
the distance how soon might i hope to
see the florentine troop come across that
stretch of land to help me in my need and
what if for reasons of policy they should
forget my old services and fail me i de-
cided that it was best not to consider this
possibility come what might having gone
thus far i must go farther and save the
princess
  i had been reflecting in melancholy soli-
tude for perhaps an hour when hurrying
footsteps sounded near me and pierre came
rushing into sight sir john sir john
he cried eagerly  come below i beg you
messer omeara has sent me to summon you
sir john hawkwood

it is the men-curse them they have gone
mad they say you have betrayed them
and turned the prince against them last
night they saw the jewels the princess wore
and now they swear to seize them and
scatter over italy to seek fortune where
they may but first they will kill you and
messer omeara and as for the women-
  i darted down the stairs with him at my
heels there was a ringing in my ears a
quick darkness before my eyes i was well
used to danger and looked for no other fate
than to die some day by the sword nor was
my life so noble a thing that i would have
grieved greatly over the losing of it but
the princess had i brought her here that
she might fall into the hands of men like my
mercenaries better a thousand times that
i had left her to antonio della scala the
thought lent wings to my feet as i hurried
down into the castle
  the murmur of voices told me that the
men were gathered in the gallery as i
drew nearer i caught the angry note in their
tones the accent of unbridled lawlessness
that spelt terrible danger for a moment
i paused on the stairs knowing better than
to burst in upon theni with any appearance
of haste and fright and in that moment
my anxiety seemed to pass away leaving
me confident of my power to rule the
storm
  a great crash fell on my ears followed by
a hoarse evil shout of triumph delaying
no longer i left the stairs and strode into
the gallery
  the crash had been caused by the break-
ing in of the princess door which had flown
into splinters the men were surging for-
ward now then giving back slightly for in
the opening stood omeara his face white
with anger his eyes blazing and his drawn
sword flashing in his hand behind him
stood madonna giulia she was very pale
and had a look of restrained horror but held
herself proudly erect and made no sign of
ear francesca was clinging to her in
terror trembling and hiding her face
  god curse ye all for a set of cowardly
devils omeara was crying fiercely
come on then-come on and taste cold
-teel never fear princess-and you
-navourneen keep up heart he encouraged
he ladies across his shoulder tis sir
john will be after settling the knaves in the
wink of an eye when he comes he gave a
-ar-whoop of delight at seeing me alls
well now  he went on to the ladies with an
easy assurance most flattering to my powers
make yourselves easy and never trouble
to look any more at these dogs j
i strode across the gallery straight
through the crowd which parted instinct-
ively to give me room i had reached
omeara and the doorway before one of the
men shrieked out bidding the others cut me
off and end me with a dagger-thrust again
they surged forward and i looked on a
circle of fierce evil faces full of the dangerous
passions of the wild beast all were armed
i caught the flash of many a ragged-iooking
knife and many a keen cutlass instinctive-
ly i turned my head for a glance at the
princess her eyes had the look of one who
gazed on a vision of hell nor did they change
as they rested on me to her i was but of
the rest as evil as they as brutal and i
have no doubt i appeared so in that instant
for i had learned long ago that the only
fashion in which one might rule a band of
wild ruffians like my free lances was by
playing the part of a wilder ruffian than the
greatest among them and i confronted
them now with a look fierce and grim
enough to put their swagger to shame
chapter xviii
one against many
  well i said sternly and what
does this mean i should be glad to
hear i commanded that this gallery should
be kept empty i come down to find my en-
tire force assembled in it and a door broken
to bits who is to blame then who has led
you faith i would not choose to stand in
his boots for by my knightly spurs i will
have him beaten to a jelly for this days
work answer me you dogs-what does
this thing mean
  they kept silence for a moment-so
strong is the habit of obedience that my un-
moved front made them quail had i
hesitated ever so little then they would
surely have struck me down and the prin-
cess fate would have been irrevocably
sealed since i confronted them threaten-
ingly they looked half shame-faced and no
one seemed anxious to make the first move
against the door
  well am i to stand here forever staring
at you i demanded and backed the
question with such a volley of camp oaths

adventure
as no doubt offended the princess more than
the sight of steel have you lost your
longues you have lost your courage at
least i see and you have good cause to
lose it for you shall all pay for this what
is there no one of you that dares stand for-
ward and face me rally up your spirits
and a spokesman who will dare tell me what
all this may mean
  there was a growl of threatening anger
and encouraged by the sound the leader
ventured to step forward it was jacques
as i had guessed from the beginning i had
kept him down with a strong hand and he
had many a grudge against me to pay off
knowing him as i did i felt anew the danger
of the moment if i failed if madonna
giula fell into this mans hands-
  so it is you i cried contemptuously
as he came a pace forward a pity they
could get no better leader let me tell you
my friend an hour from now there will not
be an inch of skin left on your back so
flaunt your time while you may and act the
hero go on-have you no tongue after
all
  for a moment he quailed then laughed
maliciously my back is safe enough mon
capitaine he mocked in an hour-in a
half-hour-nay in half of that-you will be
dead we have had enough of you-we are
finished with the white company when
you are gone we will go back to france and
take service there say a prayer sir john
if you have not forgottenthe art we will
give you a moment to save your soul  the
others surging forward ominously laughed
in an evil fashion at the jest
  i am not dead yet i said coolly nor
do i think that such rogues as you can ever
kill me but come you make me curious
why is it that you are all so angered
against me and i began to rock on
my heels laughing as at the best joke in
the world
  because you are a traitor to us mon
capitaine the ruffian answered showing
his teeth in a snarling smile  you turned
against prince antonio giving us no warn-
ing of it and embarked in this scheme against
his cousin now our lives are not worth a
pin here in verona you have put all our
heads into a noose but it is only your neck
that will be wrung what do you say to
that sir john hawkwood he had come
quite close to me and was sneering mali-
ciously into my face
       the situation was desperate and i
took the only possible course one
which might i knew bring ruin 
us or might perhaps save us-there was no
guessing which what do i say i re-
torted  i say that you need a lesson in the
proper fashion of address to use to your
captain and that i shall give it to you
and i caught him by the back of the neck
and began to beat him lustily with the flat
of my sword
  at his cry of rage and pain i was quite
sure that his comrades would sweep forward
and annihilate me but they did nothing of
the sort jacques was not too well loved
among them though he had a large follow-
ing in his rebellion and i have small doubt
it was the general sentiment that one so
boastful as he should be able to defend
himself since he was apparently capable
of doing nothing more than struggle help-
lessly in my grasp and yell to them for
succor they at once experienced a feeling
of contempt for him and an added respect
for me for the moment at least my bold
move had succeeded
  have you more to say you dog 
asked grimly as i belabored him then
let us hear it by all means are you turned
coward already another time you will
mind your manners with mei think
and i added another string of oaths for the
benefit of my hearers who thought no speech
emphatic which was not so garnished
well is your lesson learned or will you
have more ah would you then knave
  he had made a desperate clutch at his
dagger and got it out of its sheath seeing
which and none too soon i struck him full
across the side of the head with the hilt of
my sword and he fell like a log at my feet
in a dead swoon i kicked the body out of
my way
  well i said coolly turning to confront
the others and who comes next to ques-
tion me
  no one answered had they rushed me
where i stood as i had looked for them to
do nothing on earth could have saved me
omeara and i stood alone two against two-
score but as i looked about the circle a
feeling of triumph ran through my veins
like wine
  there were men at the rear of the crowd
who had taken no part in the tumult who
had merely waited to see how the tide would
turn these i knew were not unfriend
sir john hawkwood
to me others were well enough disposed
save for a natural anger at the thought that
i had led them into danger of the princes
vengeance for some purpose of my own
  there was a movement in the crowd and
pierre came through and faced me i
hope sir john youll not use me as you did
jacques he said kicking contemptuously
at the fallen man and grinning broadly  but
id like to ask you a question of my own
youve led us for years now and if in some
ways youve been a hard master youve
been a just one too youve played us fair
and never tricked us i believe the same of
ycfu now we cant tell why you have the
princes cousin here a prisoner but ill
never believe you are leading us into dan-
ger without good reason just tell me as
much and say that you mean to play us
fair and ill stand for you against any odds
that come
tee time for close-mouthed de-
fiance had passed i must quiet
these fellows with some plausible
explanation of my strange actions to be
sure it would not be wholly true and it is
the bounden duty of all knights to scorn
false statements as a common thing i was
as truthful as any other man but in the
present situation with the lives of us all
hanging on tfie fall of the dice i admit with-
out shame that i would have sworn away
my soul if i could thereby have added one
iota to the princess safety
  why you fools i began with an
appearance of bluff heartiness i am lead-
ing you into no danger at all though i will
admit the enterprise is a trifle difficult
since you have come to your senses and
ceased to threaten me i am willing enough
to tell you the meaning of it all a short
time since i overheard prince antonio con-
ferring with della torre and learned that
ae was weary of my services and had it in
mind to turn me off that was a poor
prospect both for me and for you eh so
 looked about for a way to better it well
i knew that this lady was kin to the duke
of padua who claims her as his ward and
has long tried to get possession of her and
i fancied he might be willing to give a rich
reward to those who put her in his hands
i held secret communication with him and
arranged the terms-then i carried off the
iady we are to hold her safe here until the
duke sends a strong escort to bring us
safely into padua where we will be well
treated i can promise you come is not
this better than waiting in verona until
prince antonio is pleased to turn us adrift
and have i not a shrewder head than this
fellow jacques who would have persuaded
you that i had some trick in mind our
reward will pay us well for all our trouble
are you content
  i heard the princess give a low gasp be-
hind me but for the moment i paid her no
heed at all i was looking with desperate
eagerness at the troopers to see if they ac-
cepted what i had said if they did all was
well fired by the hope of gain they
would defend the castle like madmen and
we would be safe until the florentine men
came to my aid after that i cared very
little how soon they knew i had tricked
them in my tale after conferring for a
time they began to give back sheepishly
some of them cursing antonio for his plan to
throw us over and congratulating them-
selves on the rare revenge of robbing him of
his cousin others guessing how much fran-
cesco carrara would give for so great a
sendee presently too they began to cast
furtive glances at me as if uncertain how j
might be inclined to visit my anger at their
unruliness upon them  oh we were fools
to doubt you sir john you have a better
head than any of us one of the ring-leaders
muttered apologetically
  you will be fools if you do it twice for
i shall not be so patient again i answered
grimly take yourselves off while i stay
in a good-natured mood
  they obeyed me with cheers and glances
of admiration and in a moment the gal-
lery was empty
chapter xix
the coming of violante
when the last man had clattered down
the stairs i swung about on my heel
and faced the three who had stood behind
me throughout the episode omeara had
appeared to enjoy himself a great deal more
than the circumstances warranted on my
coming all feeling of responsibility and
anxiety had seemed to leave him and he
had leaned calmly on the wall watching my
struggles with a merry glint in his blue eyes
and laughing heartily when i pommeled
jacques into submission now that all was

adventure
over he sheathed his sword then flung his
arms about me and favored me with a
bears embrace which came near making
ray ribs crack
   glory be twas yourself settled them in
no time but the affair was a close one do
you know that may we never be nearer
dying till our last day comes faith at one
time i was mortal afraid theyd kill you
first he rattled on
   oh hold your tongue michael i said
curtly turning to the ladies francesca was
on her knees with her face in her hands
the princess was standing proudly erect
her pale face turned toward me and breath-
ing such indignant contempt as i shall
never forget
   so now at last i have learned the truth
sir john hawkwood she said in a low
voice that trembled curiously with emotion
you have taken a bribe from the duke of
padua to seize me and bring me to him
now i understand
  for an instant i did not answer her
perhaps i had cherished some vague hope
that the manner in which i had saved her
from imminent death might a little soften
her toward me-might perhaps even lead
her to say a proud word of thanks the
scorn and anger in her face hurt me sharply
  she continued to look at me with a search-
ing disdain listen sir she said pres-
ently in the tone which she might have used
to a dog you care only for money
honor knightliness chivalry-all these are
nothing to you good-i will make you an
offer tell me what francesco carrara has
promised you for this pretty business and i
will give you double the sum to set me free
i bowed low to her thank you ma-
donna i said with a bitter laugh re-
member that even a man as vile as i may
not care to betray the master whose enter-
prise he has undertaken i believe that even
my enemies do not deny me this one virtue
her face twisted suddenly  how
can it be how can it be she cried
turning away from me passionately
is there no good in you that you treat a
helpless girl so for your own gain have
you no shred of knightliness you that wear
aknights spurs she confronted me again
and this time her eyes were kinder  when
you stood between me and that crowd of
cut-throats sir john hawkwood my heart
softened to you i thought at least he is a
brave man at least he does not fear to risk
his life and a moment later i heard from
your own kps for what base motive you had
brought me here it is too much i can not
believe that any man can fall so low
madonna giulia i cried listen to me
what i told the men was but a tale of my
own inventing a means to pacify them and
turn them off do you not-
  her face hardened again i do not
believe you she flung at me by your
own confession you have lied either to me r
to your troopers and i have no trust for a-
knight who lies do your will with me-i
am a helpless woman who can not wielda
sword-	- 
  small matter for that priices-when
you possess a tongue i retorted-stung out
of my manners since you chposejtp dis-
believe me i will say no more as -your
door is broken down i must begyou tocross
the gallery and enter the room thfrft atx the
right
  she hesitated for a moment looking as if
she would speak again butnny grim manner
silenced her she was tinning ajvay when
pierre came hastily into the galley
  your pardon sir john he cried-much
excited but a small companyqfhorse-
men are coming from the direction cfver-
ona what they want i can not guess for
they are not enough to storm the case  
wait for me below i cut him short
then striding across the gallery iopened
the door of the room i had chosen for the
ladies bowed to them and awaited their
entrance the princess stood motionless
her color risen her eyes bright as stars
  men are coming from verona she
cried they are coming to find me to
free me-is it not so 
  that princess i answered coldly is
what i propose to descend and discover if
you will first oblige me by entering this
room
  you will keep me imprisoned here
she cried angrily you will let me know
nothing of this party that has ridden here
to help me 
  depend upon it princess whatever
troop of horsemen ride to castel paura to
effect your liberty will turn tneir horses
heads back to verona with their object un-
fulfilled
  our eyes met in a clashing glance you
have the right of force sirjohnejawkwqod
she said coldly taking francescas hand in
sir john hawkwood

hers and drawing the girl forward they
entered the room together and i closed the
door and drew the outer bolt
   come i said quickly to omeara and
we ran swiftly up to the battlements of
the castle
off in the distance a small group of
horsemen were riding in the direc-
tion of our stronghold they might
have been a dozen not more there is no
danger i said to the irishman drawing a
breath of relief as my eye ranged over them
but why are they coming here
  omeara muttered an oath and caught
my arm do you see-do you see he
cried xcitedly  tis a woman there in the
midst bf them now by all thats wonder-
ful- sir john can you tell me what it is that
a womans wanting here 
   caritell you that she is here for no good
purpose i said curtly for i have just
reqogrijzedker as madonna violante della
torres -wife and of all women i have ever
sceh she is thfc most dangerous let us go
downinfo the court and set pierre to par-
leying with them across the moat
  that worthy presently returned with a
puzzled face  it is my lord ranucio della
torfe sir john-the princes favorite he
tpjdyne he wants speech with you and
begs permission to enter with two of his
party he will tell me nothing of his
business
  cower the draw-bridge and let them in
i commanded but take care that no more
than three pass the portcullis
  a moment later i heard the hoofs of the
horses rattling on the crazy draw-bridge
my troopers came thronging into the court-
yard in great excitement
  della torre came first a splendid sight
as always and as serene and haughty as
though he were riding into the royal palace
at verona i had seen very great gentlemen
look less at ease when surrounded by my
grim-faced ruffians and much as i detested
my lord ranucio i admitted inwardly that
he was no coward
  madonna violante followed him at
sigtft of her a cold shiver ran over me a
presentiment of evil and yet what harm
could come truly i was growing woman-
ish i hastily i turned to look at the third
arrival who proved to be no other than
giannipotrero
  there was a- moments silence then i
stepped forward with a low bow wel-
come my lady-welcome my lord the fav-
orite and you sir knight of the noble order
of bravoes i cried saluting each in turn
 who would have guessed that one day sir
john hawkwood would receive so noble a
party in his own castle-that the great
della torre would be kept waiting at the
moat well and how can i serve you that
you deign to flatter me by taking note of
my existence
  messer gianni gave me a very black look
while madonna violante stared through me
as though i were made of air as for della
torre he dismounted slowly came forward
a step and spoke in a remote indifferent
fashion sir john hawkwood he said
i have not come here to talk of your mad
and fatal act all that you will settle later
with prince antonio i have come here
to-day at my masters bidding to demand
one thing of you which if you possess any
honor you can not refuse
  well i asked curtly it is plainly to
be seen you are no soldier you waste so
much good time in words
  he flushed and gave me an angry glance
prince antonio is filled with anguish at the
brutal seizure of his cousin he said trying
to resume his measured fashion of speech
if you have any spark of chivalry left in
your nature you will allow madonna vio-
lante to speak alone with the princess and
to learn from her own lips whether she has
come to any harm
  i stood in silence for a time reflecting
i was sure that some deep plot underlay the
seemingly simple request and yet my reck-
less pride rose up i hated della torre i
hated violante and i would not have them
think that i feared them or anything they
might do
  i turned to omeara who had stood at my
elbow throughout the scene go to the
princess i bade him  if she wishes for an
interview the matter is all one to me
chapter xx
black clouds
  i trust sir john that this is not a
trick della torre sneered as mi-
chael left us i know something of that
irishman of yours-he would swear black
was white at your bidding
pray do not judge messer omeara by

adventure
yourself iry lord i answered politely
i am well aware that it is your business to
lie in your masters service and that you do
it with great success but it is an accom-
plishment that i have never required from
my followers
  a guffaw from my troopers pointed the
remark and increased della torres fury
he fingered his sword-hilt then controlled
himself with an effort you use insult
safely sir john hawkwood he told me
in a voice thickened with passion you
know that i can not stoop to fight you
perhaps it is more prudent in you to
refrain i mocked you remember no
doubt how i served your friend lord
raimondo
   prefer to wait he answered white
with furj and see the business done by
hands more fit than mine to touch you
the prince has some pleasant plans for
your end sir john you recall how he
served the traitor cagliari your death
fall be more lingering-
  he has not caught me yet i pointed
out  keep your sympathy till it is needed
my good friend is it the wheel he plans
for me or will he despatch me secretly with
a dagger-thrust i have heard that the
latter is his favorite device was it not so
that you and he rid verona of bartolomeo
della scala
  his pallor told me that the blow had gone
home he was about to favor me with a
fierce retort when omearas voice an-
nounced from behind us that the princess
desired instant speech with madonna vio-
lante i shrugged my shoulders and bit my
lip for i had entertained a feeble hope that
she might refuse since she had no love for
she favorites shrewd scheming wife
  della torre went over to his wife assisted
her gallantly to dismount and offered her
bis arm to lead her into the castle i waved
him back  messer omeara will escort the
lady violante to the princess i stated
coldly you my lord will remain here
for the second time della torre flinched
for his wife was the one person in the world
for whom he felt real tenderness
   what matter my lord  she said gently
loosening his clasp  i am not afraid sir
john hawkwood i see enjoys the giving of
orders and the regulating of trifles well
surely it would be cruel in us to deny him
this pleasure-he will have so short a time
to play the master she gave me a con-
temptuous glance then swept into the
castle her head high omeara following her
looking rather grim
for a time there was silence save
for the whispers of my staring
     -	troopers della torre was obviously
uneasy messer gianni in the sulks being
none too happy myself i decided to divert
myself with some further exchange of wit
with these two
  well now potrero i began tell me
frankly as one soldier to another did you
not admire the pretty fashion in which i
seized your prey from under your nose at
the inn yesterday 
  he scowled furiously he laughs best
who laughs last sir john he muttered
yes you played me a pretty trick but for
all that i would not like to stand in our
boots now
   you speak very mysteriously i see you
have a plot in progress against me i
remarked faith i am glad to be quit of
the veronese court-never did i see a place
so full of plots they make the head of a
plain blunt englishman turn round there
is della torre for instance two days ago
he was plotting with his wife to forge a
packet in my hand convey it to the princes
notice and so convict me of conspiracy with
padua and put me from his way forever
della torre turned white as death and
gazed at me as at an apparition from the
grave
  you are mad he muttered through
dry lips after a long moment of frightened
silence which i enjoyed to the full w at
do you mean
  i mean that a man should not plan such
evil tricks in an open loggia where he may
well be overheard i answered airily  you
look extremely foolish della torre if the
prince could see you now i think he would
regret that he ever gave his favor to a person
who so much resembled an imbecile take
my counsel-if you must blacken your noble
soul with such schemes at least school your-
self to meet discovery without such a look
of guilt
  keep your advice  he answered rudely
recovering himself  it is you that are the
fool sir john hawkwood had you flat-
tered the prince and done all he bade you
in time you might have supplanted me and
ruled verona instead you stake your life
on this mad enterprise the saints know why
sir john hawkwood

and will come to such an end as will make
you envy the traitor cagliari 
  that is as may be i answered shrug-
ging whatever my fate proves i shall
never envy you my lord ranucio but
here is madonna violante returned to bear
witness that i have not cut the princess
throat or robbed her of her jewels
  della torres wife paused beside us as
calm and composed as ever  the princess
is unhurt she said to her husband and
has met with no injury save the outrage of
the seizure for which this man must an-
swer to the prince come we have done
our errand let us get back to verona
della torre helped her to her horse
mounted his own and made me a low and
mocking bow farewell sir john he
sneered we give you thanks for your
courtesy when we meet again i think we
shall stand on a very different footing
since truthfulness and plain-speaking
are a soldiers virtues i answered coolly
i must tell you with all frankness that it
would not greatly displease me were we
never to meet again
  i believe it he cried with a mocking
iaugh butthe prince desires otherwise
-and the princes will be done say i
again he saluted me and they moved slowly
out of the court-yard
  i turned to omeara  she did not come
here to pass the time of day with the prin-
cess i said knitting my brows what
have they got in their minds 
  he shook his head ive no power to
read thoughts but its mischief he said
ah i hate her-that woman were i
della torre i would have cut her throat the
day after the wedding except for the fact
that i would never have wedded her at all 
chapter xxi
the waiting
the day passed uneventfully and the
night and the next day under this
inactivity lay something that menaced me
-something that i would learn when it was
too lte
  madonna violantes coming had one visi-
ble result-it wrought a change in the prin-
cess behavior hardly had the little troop
ridden away from the castle when she sent
for me you are shrewd enough to know
sir john that two helpless girls can not fly
across a moat she said with some scorn
and therefore you surely need not fear to
let us go where we please within the castle
walls i am not accustomed to imprison-
ment and it wearies me as for madonna
francesca she is pining likeabird in a cage
i was willing enough to grant her request
for now that my men believed they were to
gain a rich reward for taking her to padua
she was quite safe at their hands  surely
princess go where you please i answered
i would have given you the freedom of the
castle sooner had i guessed you would care
to wander about it
  she shrugged slightly there is small
good in moping over what can not be
helped she said coldly  come francesca
we will go on the battlements and breathe
spring air again since our jailer is pleased
to be merciful
  after that they roamed the castle at their
will more than once i found her ques-
tioning one of my men in her haughty
fashion and getting answers that were
roughly mil most of the time she sat on
the battlements gazing off in the direction of
verona omeara was often with them for
the sight of francesca seemed to draw him
like a magnet and though -the princess
treated him very coldly at first i think she
ended by liking him as indeed few people in
the world could have failed to do after a
brief acquaintance
  as for me i held to myself and spent my
time in solitude if there were hours when
i longed to join the group if at times the
princess proud pale face beckoned me even
as francescas merry mocking eyes drew the
irishman i was too proud to yield she
scorned and distrusted me when i was freely
risking my life to help her very good she
should not have my hateful company to
endure i preferred to pass lonely hours in
the castle hall thinking of many things
wishing vaguely that i might wipe out ten
years of my life and live them over in a
different fashion oh i was not too happy
and if there were sins in my life i think i
paid the price of them in those days when
i held the princess prisoner for the sake of
her own good
it was near nightfall of the second
day and for hours i had been strug-
gling fiercely with the longing to see
the princess i cursed myself angrily for
a fool far better to stay alone to save at
adventure
 ieast a shred of dignity in her eyes by not
 thrusting myself into her presence when she
 had plainly shown me her contempt and
 yet even as i told myself this i got to my
 feet and went slowly into the castle
   there were voices in the room that opened
 from the gallery and i paused at the door
 still silently urging myself to play the man
 and remain apart i could pass on un-
 noticed yet i stood there motionless gaz-
 ing at the princess who sat by the window
 with the last light of the sun falling across
 her dark hair
 she was thinking deeply it appeared for
 her face was turned away from omeara and
 francesca my heart beat more quickly as
 i looked at her she was the loveliest
 woman in the world i thought and the
 farthest from me by birth and nature why
 was i standing there with my eyes glued to
 her face it gave me no pleasure only
 suffering and i would do better to go see if
 my men were keeping their watch
   and so glory be omeara con-
 cluded with great enthusiasm we drove
 them flying before us into the back of be-
 yant and the day was ours-and all thanks
 to sir john
   the princess turned slowly toward him
 you think him a great man this master of
 yours she asked with some scorn in her
 voice
   was it master you said princess
 omeara demanded turning to her with
 ready good-fellowship for he was equally at
 ease with a king or with a beggar no
 youre wrong to use that word theres no
 man in all this broad beautiful earth of ours
 that can call himself master of an omeara
 but if you mean the finest general that ever
 stepped the rarest leader the best friend
 and greatest soldier why then yes im
 thinking hes the greatest man ive ever
 known or ever will know
   i had dragged myself a few paces from the
 door repeating again and again that i must
 not enter francescas pretty voice came
 to me faintly as she broke in at first i
 hated your captain she told him but now
 there are times when i think he does not
 appear altogether evil he has the look of
 one who suffers for his sins-
   you are mad child cried the princess
 think of the tales they tell of him in
 verona-a ruffian a cut-throat drinking in
 taverns quarreling in the streets swearing
 and buffeting ruling his men by terror
she broke off as if in utter distaste for my
many crimes
  my hesitation was at an end come what
might of it i would see her and talk with
her though heaven knew what i could say
for her charges were all true enough and i
had no intention of denying them
  thats as unjust a speech as ever you
uttered madonna cried my faithful com-
rade  youve heard these tales from court
fops ill swear-jackdaws not fit to touch
sir johns shoes let them once try to
equal what hes done and theyll change
their tune tis blithe id be to set them
in the midst of a bloody battle with the
odds all against them and the day well-nigh
lost and then see if theyd be after knowing
the way to bring order from slaughter and
victory from despair as ive seen sir john
do more times than i cculd count-
  there michael you have chanted my
praises enough i said and they started as
i strode across the room i have just come
from the battlements where the evening
breeze is very soft and sweet madonna
francesca i am sure would enjoy it greatly
if you took her there to walk
  francesca i thought felt no great dis-
taste for the proposal but she evidently con-
sidered it due herself to crush me for my
presumption i will go if the princess de-
sires me to leave her and not otherwise sii
john she answered saucily with a fling of
her head
  madonna giulia folded her hands in her
lap and assumed a look of proud endurance
have you not learned yet child she
asked that sir john hawkwood is the
master here and that we needs must do as
he wills what matter whether i desire you
to go or stay if he bids you go
  you wrong me princess i said looking
at her straightly do me the justice to
admit that i have not once entered your
presence save when you have sent to bid me
come if you desire it i will leave you nov
-you are the mistress and may command
i had not guessed it she retorted
but there what matter go francesca
and i will stay to hear what our jailer de-
sires to tell me
francesca went out readily
enough omeara following her in
unmistakable rapture at the pros-
pect of an interview in which to urge his
suit the princess and i kept silence for a
sir john hawkwood

time then she turned her head and looked
at me perhaps sir john she said you
have thought better of my offer to out-bid
the duke of padua is it of that you wish
to jpeak
  no i answered grimly why had i
sought speech with one who had such power
to hurt me with every word
  it would have been better for you had
you accepted that offer when i made it she
murmured and i thought there was a tinge
of regret in her voice now i shall escape
in spite of you and the prince will not show
you any mercy
  i do not need his mercy yet i an-
swered more cheerfully and i hope that
i never shall
  we were silent again i turned and
walked the length of the room twice or
thrice seeking for words to express the
things i wished to tell her looking up sud-
denly i caught her regarding me with a
gaze that held reluctant pity and my
thoughts went back to violantes strange
visit then i forgot all else in the con-
sciousness of madonna giulias softer atti-
tude toward me the sadder look in her
proud eyes the gentler curve of her scarlet
lips
  it was she who broke the long silence and
i started fearing an angry word but her
voice was curiously sad and gentle i
wonder why you ever came to italy sir
john she said as if to herself i wonder
what evil fate ever brought you to verona
i did not answer her lest my voice should
break the spell
  you fought bravely in france she
went on you won a knights spurs all men
honored you what trick of destiny turned
you into such a path as this now you will
come to a most cruel end you that might
have lived out a long and honored life in
your own land it is a sad thought and
against my will it hurts me
  i too have often wondered why fate
played such tricks with me i answered
soberly and have cursed destiny and my-
self but now princess i am content
she would not understand i knew that i
was content because i was now standing
between her and antonio della scala the
one defense that kept her evil kinsman from
her surely this was payment enough for
all the sufferings of my life
  the trouble in her beautiful face was
growing steadily she clasped her hands
and pressed thepi against her heart  there
is something under all this that i can not
understand she said looking at me
strangely   there is more in you than i can
read sir john i have felt it from the first
and struggled against the belief and tried to
think you entirely evil but to-night-
when it is too late-i find myself doubting
and regretting the pride was all gone
from her eyes now and only anxiety re-
mained  sir john she said in a low un-
certain voice tell me the truth tell me
why you brought me to this place
  will you hear me without anger i
asked  will you listen with an open mind
to a strange story
  she bowed her head i will try she
answered
  then you shall hear said i and i
swear by the soul of the black prince that i
will say no word that is not the truth
chapter xxii
foe love of a woman
tjxr a time there was silence in the dim
	room while i gathered my thoughts and
tried to still the beating of my heart and
the princess sat motionless gazing at me
with that strange look of trouble always in
her eyes at last i spoke
  before i tell you why i brought you
here i said there is something else that
you should know-something that has ruled
my actions for a long time that has led us
both where we stand to-night will you
listen princess
  yes she said in a low voice
  i have been in verona for some eight
months i began i came here for no love
of the scaligeri but because prince antonio
offered me good payment for my sword
you know what i am-a free companion
wandering where my service takes me fight-
ing now for one man and now another it
is not a very noble profession though as i
have practised it there is no dishonesty in
the trade as for the life i have led you
know that too-i should be foolish to de-
fend it i heard you tell omeara what
you held me-a swaggering cut-throat a
drunken mercenary
  perhaps she said wistfully i did you
wrong
  no you were right i answered for i
had sworn a solemn oath that she should hear
adventure
only the truth from my lips i was what
you thought me-though i think that now
i am somewhat better well i came to
verona and entered the princes service
one day i went to the palace to take leave of
him before marching for an attack on a
paduan fortress and then suddenly i saw
you for the first time
  a startled look crossed her face you
saw-me  she murmured
  yes i said i saw you standing in the
alcove of a window with a jeweled lute in
your hands you wore a dress the color of
dull gold and had pearls on your neck and
in your hair a little crowd of gentlemen
were all about you and you were singing a
soft catch of song i could repeat it word
or word it has rung in my ears ever since
in battle in quiet even in my dreams
when you had finished all the room ap-
plauded you and you smiled in a proud in-
different fashion and tossed the lute away
as you did so our eyes met i suppose you
noted me no more than if i had been a
picture on the wall but it was otherwise
with me i went on into the princes closet
and he was greatly angered because i seemed
to pay no heed to what he told me faith
i could not have listened to him then had he
possessed the tongue of an angel
  the princess had straightened herseif
slightly i do not understand sir john
she said with pride and displeasure entering
her voice once more you are surely
wasting words what matter when you saw
me first	
  be patient princess i answered with
a slow smile when you know the truth
you will see that i deserve some kindness
from you-and i ask as my rewafd only this
one hour and the right to tell you freely
what is in my heart
  she sank back in her seat looking at me
with the same strange air of perplexity and
trouble
  as time went on i continued i saw
you often many a time you passed me on
the streets riding out to the hunt or with
a falcon on your wrist sometimes i saw
you in thepalace garden walking among the
flowers or plucking roses and lilies more
than once i watched when the prince led you
out to dance and always always from
the first moment when my eyes fell on you
i loved you with my whole unworthy heart  
   sir john hawkwood  she cried sharply
 how dare you say such words how dare
you speak of love to me you a mercenary
an adventurer her softness was gone
now and the scornful lady of the past looked
at me once more from her lovely face
yes a mercenary an adventurer
unworthy god knows to touch your
finger i answered soberly but
yet a lover worshipping you with as deep
and reverent an affection as any crowned
king or mighty hero ever gave his lady 
had no thought that you would ever learn
it no hope that i might ever win you 
believed that i would never even stand face
to face with you and change words on in-
different subjects knowing well how far
i stood below you i had no wish to lower
you by any contact with me and yet
whenever i might i gazed on you from a
distance and suffered silently and endured
proudly-and loved you with all my heart
with all my heart
   you loved me-you a tanners son 
she cried it seemed to me that now there
was less anger in her tones though she strove
hard to make them cruel
  i am the son of a tanner i answered
yet i love you as never man loved woman
before i could recount to you the tale of
each day i saw you once as i passed you
a clasp fell from your sleeve and i raised it
and placed it in your hand you thanked
me coldly not glancing at me and my heart
beat until it hurt my side since the day
when first  saw you your face has been be-
fore me always i saw it in camp when 
lay before the fire and longed to sleep and
could not for the pain in my soul i saw it
as i rode into battle and it so maddened me
that at times i prayed for a straight sword-
thrust to end my useless life and all its
agony night and day i saw you in the
streets in the palace in the conflict in the
open country-
  say rather in the tavern she mocked
disdainfully but her voice was faint now
  yes in the tavern too i said when
i sat over the cups till dawn does that
offend you it is true and many a night
i drank till i lost all knowledge only be-
cause the dull pain in my heart was beyond
my bearing and i could not endure the
proud indifferent gaze your eyes turned on
me you were part of my life princess-
you were with me in my best moments and
in my worst ones you have made me pay
for all my sins-never doubt it i when i
sir john hawkwood

thought of what you were and of what i
was and how far i had fallen from what i
might have been then do you think i did
not suffer 
  she did not speak she was staring at
me her face very pale in the gloom night
was coming fast and i could see her only
with dimness now
  there is no need that you should feel
anger at me i told her gently  my love
never harmed you it harmed no one save
myself and even to me it has brought great
good do you think madonna giulia that
i would have had it otherwise i would
rather suffer for your sake than be happy
because i had never seen you and i have
known happy hours too will you hate me
if i tell you this well i must take the
risk since i have sworn to tell the truth
  sometimes i lay by the camp fire at
midnight and dreamed i was a great prince
and free to tell you of my love sometimes
i pictured what i well knew could never be
-what i would not have had be for your
sake i dreamed that if you knew me and
learned to love me out of the nobleness of
your heart you might find the power to toss
away rank and greatness and gladly give
yourself to a poor soldier of fortune who
stood alone save for his sword i saw my-
self shield you and protect you and make
poverty so sweet a thing that you would
never look back with longing to the days
when you reigned a princess i saw you
hearn that want sweetened by love is far
happier than state and power without it i
pictured us all alone you and i hand in
hand walking through life well contented
sinte we had each other was not that a
foolish dream madonna giulia yet it was
so dear to me that i could not tear it from
my heart 
the room was dark now and i
could see nothing but the dim out-
line of her form she did not speak
as i paused and i was glad for i- had not
dared to hope that she would hear my tale
with so much patience
  i had a third dream i said slowly
sometimes i thought that since i could
never possess you it would be the crown of
my life if i might die in doing you some
service i was accustomed to hold this the
most foolish of all my vain imaginings and
yet at last the time has come when i can
serve you and i do it gladly and proudly
and if i die in the enterprise i will die in the
most worthy act of all my life first i
must get you into safety then i care not a
jot what may come-it would be as well
that my life should end with its best deed
  end she breathed the word so softly
that i hardly heard it
  you will think i said in a low voice
that my love was a poor thing since it
made me no better than i was before i
raged against fate and my anger drove me
to many evil things and day by day i made
myself more and more unworthy of a glance
from your eyes in one short night i be-
came another man since i have brought
you here i have not been the mercenary who
served antonio della scala at verona i
have been an english knight once more
  in the pause there was a sound of stum-
bling steps outside and pierre came in from
the gallery bearing lights the blackness
of the room flamed suddenly into brightness
and i saw something that made my heart
leap pierre set the candles down then
stood staring stupidly until i curtly bade
him begone
  the princess was lying back in her chair
her face hidden in her arms her shoulders
shaken she was not angered at me for my
presumption not embittered at my daring
-she was weeping as if her heart would
break what had i done to wound her
i cursed myself for a rough fool who had no
place among women and racked my brains
for a way to soothe her
  are you weeping because you pity me
madonna i asked thrilling with joy de-
spite myself at the thought there is no
need god knows i had not meant to pain
you see you although my love is mad and
hopeless it has done great good for as long
as i may live now i can never be again what
i was a week ago
  she said nothing and i crossed the room
and fell on one knee beside her  you have
brought back the old sir john hawkwood
princess i said and i thank you and
am your servant for as long as my life shall
last i gently raised one of her hands from
where it lay against the chair and touched
it to my lips it had the chill of death
   that is all i said cheerfully stepping
back i thank you for your patient hear-
ing which will be a sweet memory to me in
days to come when i am far from you and
may not see your face now i will tell you
what chanced in verona a few days since

adventure
and why i brought you here to save you
from antonio della scala-
  no no do not tell me ah what mat-
ter now
  the princess had sprung up from her
chair and was fadng me white as death and
with such terror and anguish in her eyes as
made me cold with horror
  what is it i cried what is it
madonna
  i did not know she cried pitifully ap-
pealing to me as if for pardon i did not
know-you never told me ah why did i
not hear you patiently on the first night you
brought me here now it is too late and
there is no help-
  what is it i cried again frightened by
the look of pale anguish in her face
  they are coming she wailed throw-
ing her arm across her eyes they are
coming within the hour they will be here 
chapter xxiii
  the scarp with the gold flowers
cxdr a moment i stood staring at her
 too dazed for words at last the mean-
ing of her warning burst on my clouded wits
and i sprang forward and caught her by the
hand be calm madonna giulia i said
quietly though my blood was all on fire
do you mean that antonio della scala is
coming here to-night
  she uncovered her eyes and looked wildly
at me and the sight of her anguish moved
me as the thought of danger could never
have done yes she murmured half
inaudibly
  but how can you know that who has
cold you i asked in utter amazement
  madonna violante she answered with
cears of despair running down her cheeks
she came here and you let her see me and
together we formed the plot you can do
nothing they will be here within the hour
in an instant all was clear to me ah
i cried with a sudden sharp unreasonable
bitterness gnawing at my heart you
plotted this with madonna violante-you
told me nothing of it you did not trust
me ever so little princess and yet i was
freely risking my life to do you service
every vestige of her pride and scorn had
left her she looked at me with the pale
desperate face of a suffering child i did
not know that you loved me that you wished
to help me  she wailed her hands stretched
out in prayer for pardon you had not
told me this i had heard you say that you
would sell me to francesco carrara to fill
your purse and the purses of your bravoes
madonna violante told me that i was not
safe in your hands she said that one day
you would boast that-
  do you not know that ranucio della
torre and his wife would lie away their souls
if they could gain thereby do you trust
them do you know me so little when 
have striven so hard to serve you
  you had not spoken then she re-
peated drearily i did not know ah
what have i done sir john 
  no great harm save that by your mis-
trust you have hurt me i answered forcing
myself to cheerfulness let them come
they shall not get you we will give an-
tonio della scala such a welcome as will be
little to his fancy i swung on my heel
with a laugh for the prospect of a fight was
sweet to me
  she caught my arm oh you do not
understand they will not attack the castle
walls-they have a surer way to make their
entrance i have killed you sir john when
you were striving hard to serve me all
my life i shall have your blood on my hands
and your death on my soul
  a wild triumph filled me at the words for
now i saw that she trusted me tell me
all madonna i said never fear i mil
find a way to outwit them
  you can not she moaned and hid her
face again antonio knows this castle well
he knows the secret passage-
  the passage my heart was beating
faster
  yes yes there is an underground pas-
sage that crosses beneath the moat and opens
through a moving block of stone in the
castle store-room they can enter it
through a great hollow oak in the wood
yonder they will come and take you and
i have doomed you to certain death she
looked at me with hopeless eyes
  no matter madonna giulia  said
cheerfully i have seen more desperate
affairs than this we will barricade the
entrance to the passage-
  she shook her head with a moan it is
too late how can i tell you what i have
done i begged you to give me the freedom
of the castle only that i might get speech
with your men and t bribed your fellow
sir john hawkwood

jacques-the soldier whom you beat the
morning of the mutiny-
  yes i said go on princess i
knew now that the matter was desperate
but if my wild life had done me no other
good it had at least given me the power of
meeting danger with coolness and my voice
was calm and unhurried
she looked at me in amazement
do you not understand  she cried
       i have brought you to ruin the
man was eager for revenge i bribed him
with the jewels i wore and a promise of
gold in the future and he helped me
  i understand i answered what did
he do tell me in as few words as may be
he has taken off the stones from the
mouth of the passage and left it free for
my cousins men she answered he has
done what you can not repair by hours of
work-and at any instant we may hear the
cries of my cousins men they will kill
you-they will cut you down before my
eyes or worse they will take you back to
verona and end your life by torture why
do you not curse me sir john 
  she had taken my wild look for anger and
small blame to her my calm was gone
jacques had made an entrance for an-
tonios men and had ruined my scheme for
the saving of antonios cousin i could not
hold the castle now the princess was
doomed
  curse you child i said at last and
my voice had a strange hoarse note that i
had never heard in it before but which i
had heard in the voices of men who turned
cowards at the pinch the sound shamed
me and yet i swear i felt no fear for myself
and took no thought for my own life all
my mind was set on her why should i
curse you i am trying to devise a way to
save you this is a terrible thing that you
have done so innocently it will bring
you great trouble-
  to me the princess cried raising her
face in a bewilderment that drowned her
terror  what harm can come to me are
you mad sir john i shall be safe among
my own people it is you that will be in the
hands of your foes-
  you do not understand i said dully
 can you not see that there were two plots
woven about you the day i carried you
from the inn to the castle here gianni po-
trero was hard upon my heels he had been
minded to do the same thing-and by ths
princes orders
  the princes orders and why ske
cried staring
  because you would not wred him when
he wooed you i muttered not thinking of
what i said only wondering how i was to
save her he planned that you should
be carried off by gianni potrero who was to
make pretense at holding you for ransom
later you were to be rescued by the prince
and he fancied that you would feel much
gratitude and admiration for him and listen
more willingly to his suit i overheard the
plot in the palace loggia and planned to save
you by taking you to the duke of padua
do you understand now 
  she did not answer me and i turned to
look at her struck by her silence she could
have turned no whiter than she was before
but all her strength seemed gone and she
swayed and fell limply into her chair she
believed me-she took my statement with-
out question though it concerned her own
cousin even in this desperate pass i felt
a reckless triumph in the thought
  yes she breathed struggling hard for
composure yes i understand at last
in an hour i shall be in antonio della scalas
hands and at his mercy in this wild lonely
place what will become of me when he
finds that i have no gratitude for him that
i am not duped that i fear and loathe him
oh always i have known that he was an
evil man though for the sake of our com-
mon blood i have struggled hard to think
otherwise and of late i have had a horror
of him when he wooed me the ghost of dead
bartolomeo rose between us i fancied i saw
blood upon his hands he has sworn to wed
me and to-night i will be in his power
she drew herself up with a gesture of des-
perate pride oh i am ashamed sir john
--i have ruined you and brought you to
your death and now i am cold with fear of
my cousin and what may come to me when
you are slain
fgg think as i might rack my brains as
jiilp much as i chose i could plan noth-
ing save to barricade the room into
which the secret passage opened and hold it
as best i could and this would prove effica-
cious only for a brief time but now a new
thought flashed into my head and i wheeled
to face the princess with an exclamation
of joy

adventure
  she misunderstood me you do not
care what may come to me then she cried
bitterly it does not distress you that i
shall fall into my cousins power ah then
all this talk of love with which you enter-
tained me a few moments since was but a
cheat
  no princess i answered quietly i
love you and it is for me to save you-and
so i shall do with gods help be calm
now waste no time in fear for we shall be
hard pressed to carry out my scheme before
antonio comes
  you will save me she cried in-
credulously
  voices and laughter came to us from with-
out francesca and her irish lover were
returning from the battlements a mo-
ment later they were in the room and the
laughter died on their lips as they gazed
from the princess white face to my grim
set one
  whats gone amiss sir john omeara
cried springing forward and catching me by
the arm
  i laid my hand on his shoulder and drew
him to me michael i said soberly
you are the one friend i have in all the
world i have trusted you for years though
i trust no one else on earth you would not
refuse me anything on which my heart was
set would you lad 
  he looked bewildered and somewhat emo-
tional faith and i think youve got no
need to ask that he answered almost
angrily its ask and have sir john
tell me to go to verona and strike the prince
across the face or to besiege the city walls
all alone and ill not say no-
  i am sure of that i answered keeping
my hold on his shoulder  but would you
do something harder michael would you
turn your back on a deadly fight for my
sake and ride for safety as fast as ever your
horse could take you 
  the irishmans expressive features twisted
in an obvious struggle  tis a deal to ask
of any man and above all of one of my
country he cried but bedad i love you
so well i believe id be after doing even that
if you asked it but youll not ask it will
you sir john dear he pleaded in mani-
fest alarm
  i must michael i answered he was
staring at me now with his mouth fallen
open francesca conscious that an evil
moment was upon us had run to the prin-
cess and put her arms about her antonio
della scala is to come here within the hour
and will enter by a secret passage that runs
beneath the moat we can not resist him
therefore we must not let him find the prin-
cess here i had meant as you know to
remain here until a strong troop of floren-
tines might escort madonna giulia safely
across the paduan boundaries but since
this is impossible you must take her to-night
-at once you shall have twenty men it is
not a great number but i can do nothing
better for you ride as if the devil were at
your heels cut through any obstacles that
cross your way never draw rein for an
instant till you reach padua and duke
francesco
  and what of yourself meanwhile sir
john said omeara in a very low voice
  oh i shall have plenty to do never
doubt it i answered cheerfully i will
remain here and hold the castle as long as
may be against the prince that he may be-
lieve madonna giulia is still here and make
no move to pursue her that should give
you a safe start
yes we should get away safely
said omeara vaguely and indiffer-
ently as if he cared little whether
they did or not but you tis signing
your own death-warrant you are-
  hush i whispered fiercely with a
glance at the princess he broke off and
stood silent very pale biting at his lip i
went over to madonna francesca and spoke
to her gently  madonna you can help us
greatly in this matter if you choose are
you brave enough to run some risk for the
sake of your lady 
  she looked at me in a bewildered fashion
i do not understand she murmured
 the princess is in no danger-what harm
can come to her through falling into her
cousins hands it is what she desires-
  no no child cried the princess des-
perately  i have been tricked i have been
duped by the prince it was his plan to
have me brought here that he might force
me into marriage with him sir john heard
the plot and did all that a true knight could
to save me and in my madness i have ruined
him if antonio takes me now the virgin
help me
  will you aid us in saving your lady
i asked francesca again
  she drew away from the princess and
sir john hawkwood

stood erect her pale face raised i am not
brave and i am very foolish and feather-
headed she answered with a pitiful little
effort at mirth  but i would gladly give my
life for madonna giulia tell me how i
may help her and you shall have no cause
to call me coward
  then you must stay here in the castle
while she leaves us i answered  omeara
go get your men to horse choose out the
most evil and greedy of the troop-the ones
who would be most like to fail me when they
found the pinch a hopeless one in that way
i shall have the stancher men left for the
holding of the castle and you will have no
trouble for those who ride with you will
look for a rich reward in padua
  he hesitated looking at me uncertainly
ive said id leave you and ill be keeping
my word though it hurts me near beyond
all bearing to do it he said coming close
to me but madonna francesca there
sir john sure and death is all in the
days work for us men but what of a
sweet little girl like that who never has
looked on a drop of blood and never
should have we got the right to bring
her into peril
  she had heard him and even at this mo-
ment a faint smile played about her mouth
i shall not be in great danger messer
omeara she said prettily coming up and
laying her fingers on his arm  prince an-
tonio will not dare do me any serious evil
no matter how far i enrage him my
family is poor now but we have kinsmen
who are powerful and all verona would cry
out if harm came to me never fear but
i would-i would- she broke off with
tears filling her eyes
  what then mavourneen he cried
passionately
  i would she repeated between tears
and laughter that you were not going
messer omeara you must find means to
come back to verona some day for if i
should never see you again-
  yes yes tell me then he urged
eagerly
  i would find me a convent she an-
swered sobbing and laughing at one and the
same time  for i will be a nun i vow it
before my lord ravignani shall call me
wife or any other noble of verona or any
nan on earth save-save-
  it was here that omeara forgot all the
world in his rapture and caught her in his
arms and covered her face with kisses she
clung to him laughing joyfully through her
tears as pretty a picture as i had ever seen
and though i well knew that every moment
was precious to me i had not the heart to
interrupt the brief heaven of these two who
might never meet again on earth
sir john hawkwood said
the princess voice in my ear she
was standing close beside me pale
and tense but very composed i will not
go she said and with an accent of finality
that chilled me i have caused all this by
my own fault i shall stay and share the
evil that is coming that is the only repara-
tion i can make you now
  the other two were oblivious to us and
did not see that i bent and took both the
princess hands in mine you speak like a
great lady and a brave woman i answered
but you are wrong there is a greater
reparation than that which you can make
me whether you stay or go my death is
certain but it rests with you whether i die
in all content having redeemed my spotted
life in some part or whether i die with all
my sins uncleansed and my heart in a tu-
mult of despair go-let me feel that i have
saved you that i have not lived in vain
you will let me die in peace madonna
giulia i have tried to serve you i have
risked all in your behalf and this is my first
and last prayer the only thing that i shall
ever ask you
  she was silent for a long moment and i
saw that there were heavy tears on her
lashes yes i will go she said at last
very softly
  i thank you princess i could say no
more than that in a steady voice
  she raised her eyes to mine and they had
a wonderful star-like look  do you remem-
ber sir john she said that one day in
the palace loggia-it was the afternoon when
you would have warned me of my cousin
and i would not listen-you took my scarf
have you it now
  yes i answered in amazement
  then give it to me she said
  you desire it i asked with a keen
stab of pain at my heart i was unworthy
of it when i took it true-but am i all un-
worthy now may i not keep it until the
end tie end which will soon be here
  she shook her head and held out her hand
slowly biting my lips to keep down the

adventure
pain i drew the soft gold-embroidered
thing from the breast of my doublet and
gave it to her she took it and now i saw
that she was smiling in a wonderful fashion
such as i had never before seen on the lips
of any woman it was at once so sweet and
so sad
  you are the only man who has ever
served me for my own sake and for no object
of his own she said softly you are the
truest knight i have ever known sir john
and with her own hands she passed the
scarf across my shoulder and knotted it over
my bright cuirass
  for a moment i could find no words nor
any power to speak them coming to my-
self at last i went on one knee and kissed
her hand princess i said my voice
quavering in a womanish fashion for which
i felt no shame at all you have given me
back my knighthood and i ask no greater
joy or honor than to die for you
                     to be concluded
ents r the hero
by ruth comfort mitchell
own through the endless miles
of maguey fields gray-green and
dusty under the glare of the hard
turquoise sky past huddled brown
villages leaving the pyramids behind and
picking up the faint silhouette of mt ori-
zaba on the horizon swaying lurching the
vera cruz train sped eastward mr gelb-
hausers new private car dianthe play-
ing snap-the-whip on the end
  young tommy jerrolds who had been
asked only to play with the levering girls
and hadnt said ten words to them since
they left los angeles held his usual point
of vantage beside miss millard reveling
alike in her favor and the scowls of herman
gelbhauser jr who regarded him wrath-
fully from across the aisle the boy
stooped to rescue the book which slipped
from her lap to the floor  thats five times
in half an hour must be studying hard
miss millard nodded her thanks without
turning her gaze from the window im
too busy tommy
  heavens he protested what can
you see in this endless pulquc-psxcyi miles
upon miles of smiles acres of mornings
after-
  she shook her head impatiently oh
not this especially but all of it-the coun-
try-the people-the air-i cant explain it 
her host leaned toward her his broad
face beaming im delighted that you
are enjoying yourself miss millard there
is indeed much of interest-to one capable
of appreciating it
enter the hero	
  whew i guess that cut said young
tommy cheerfully but leave your scene-
less scenery long anough to do your span-
ish miss di come on-wed gone as far
as what does your honors papa want
he wants the soap and the young lady
needs the silk handkerchief of the french-
man-careless young lady now then
que necesita la-
  mr gelbhauser youll have to come
and play the rubber with me called a
cross voice from the other end of the car
jims asleep again
  herman gelbhauser rose reluctantly and
miss millard turned to the boy with a
quick whisper tommy you mustnt 
 well you know you dont want-
he began defensively but she cut him short
  shi do go and talk to the girls
  oh theyre busy he looked over his
shoulder to where the misses levering
lolled in their chairs and jabbed vicious eye-
lets in their embroidery look here its
none of my business but i know youre not
strong for hermie you cant be his
freckled face flushed hotly youre so
beautiful and keen youre there a million
and whats he besides the old codgers
son he nodded to the farthest corner of
the car where a little old man with a hand-
kerchief over his head snored gently
  miss millards lip curled vulgarly
speaking tommy fies there a million-
several of them
  dont said the boy sharply it
isrt like you
  she squared herself to the window her
elbows on the sill and watched the sliding
picture with somber eyes  i dont see why
you think anything thats sordid and cal-
culating and mean is unlike me its all
ive known
  well its not doggedly and it
makes me hot to have that bunch down
there talking you over saying youll make
up your mind on this trip whether its to be
hermie or chase
  a slow blush spread over diana millards
beautiful face from chin to brow i dont
know why i let you talk to me like this
young tommy moved closer ill tell
you because you know im only a kid
and out of the running and because i-i
understand and know youre the sweetest
finest-well you are and it makes me sick
to hear them betting itll be chase because
his pictures are the rage or hermie with
his imitation polish and the old mans
money-and the car that he named for you
as near as he dared
  from the group at the other end came
the acid aftermath well naturally when
i led you the ten-make up your own
signals as you go along dont you a
man pushed his chair back noisily and
flung himself out on to the platform bang-
ing the door behind him
  hermies car said the boy softly
full of sweet jolly congenial people who
like him for himself alone miss di-
the train jarred to a standstill with a great
flurry of whistles and bells and the occu-
pants of the dianthe sprang to their
feet in welcoming haste
  miss millard stood on the lowest step
and let the rest clamber past herwatching
them merge into the stream of pullman
passengers who rushed to the venders of
dulces and tortillas and the shacks of the
mexicans
  not going to mingle asked derwent
chase joining her
  no said the girl disgustedly look
at them crowding into their huts stepping
on the dogs snatching up the babies peek-
ing into the kettles laughing at them-
ugh were the barbarians
  she looked over the snarl of people on
the platform to the rolling brown country
where a dusty road led away to the dimp-
ling hills four oxen plodded toward them
drawing a crude two-wheeled cart piled
high with golden hay their great heads
pushed forward under the heavy beam
bound to their horns beside them pat-
tered a peon all in dingy white save for his
yellow sombrero and the scarlet band at his
waist a pair of forlorn minstrels a blind
man steered by a little lame old woman
wormed their way through the crowd and
halted before diana wailing a mournful
ballad to the thin strumming of the mans
guitar
  young jerrolds hurried back to his post
some class isnt it  he grinned looks
like a stage setting-all the scenery and the
chorus and-by jiminy look there in
the station door-enter the hero
standing in the low doorway
like a picture too large for its frame
was a tall man in well worn english
riding-clothes his fresh coloring and the
fair hair under his canvas helmet in striking

adventure
contrast to the dusky faces about him he
stood for a moment looking with frank curi-
osity at the tourists thronging the plat-
form his blue eyes resting fr a permissible
second on miss millard thi swung past
them and boarded the car ahead
   say me for him strong cried tommy
warmly kind of a cross between the
brushwood boy and that fellow in sol-
diers of fortune by golly i bet that chap
knows lots about this country im going
to talk to him see you next station he
raced down the platform as the train began
to move and jumped on the steps of the
pullman
  i dare say you can spare the infant
class  laughed chase as he took tommys
seat
  the train had hardly slowed down for
the next town when the boy rushed back
to the dianthe say mr gelbhauser
theres a mighty interesting fellow in there
-think youd all enjoy him can i bring
him in
  herman jr considered ponderously
that will be as the ladies of the party
wish he said looking only at miss millard
  diana looked at the boys eager face and
then smiled at her host it might be very
pleasant
  tell your friend-if youre sure of
course that hes a proper sort of person-
that well be pleased to have him join us
for tea said mr gelbhauser graciously
and tommy dashed oil to return with his
discovery in tow
  he was one edgar blythe-masterson it
seemed late of england and now in charge
of an extensive sugar hacienda near cor-
doba the dianthes party in the main
fell upon him with the cordiality born of
much boredom and he took their tea and
cakes and their advances with frank appe-
tite tommy curled into an incredibly
small space on the floor that he might be
near his divinity listened rapturously
looking up at her for approval when the
englishman in answer to the queries of the
other men told of crops and conditions and
politics and by reason of quaint diction and
much ingenuous earnestness infused the
simplest statement with color and warmth
  then it isnt all poppycock this revolu-
tion story asked chase theres al-
ways danger of an outbreak 
  tommy saw dianas dark eyes traveling
consideringly from the newcomer to her-
man gelbhauser much too carefully dressed
and mannered to chase weary-eyed and
much too clever to the other men of the
group modifications of the two types
  well rather the englishman an-
swered with a laugh down here in the
tierra caliente things are always simmering
dyou see-and the lids just about due to
fly off again theres a charcoal-burner a
sort of half-witted chap-florenzio some-
thing-or-other-who thinks hes had visions
and theyve been rioting all over the shop
with him at their head oh therell be
nothing big you know-the government
will be down on them like a shot before
theyre fairly started and stand a hundred
of em against a wall and snuff out the revo-
lution with a few volleys and the vision
chap will be packed off to san juan de
ulua-the very unpleasant island prison
youll see in the harbor of vera cruz-to
rot out his life in a cell where the waters
knee-deep at high tide and-
  nevertheless gelbhauser cut in with
authority its generally conceded that the
government is most excellent and that
diaz has redeemed mexico from a nation
of savages
   granted said blythe-masterson pleas-
antly hes a napoleon of a sort is diaz
and hes worked nothing short of a miracle
with the crude stuff he took hold of but-
he hesitated you cant have omelette with-
out breaking eggs and theres always the
other view-point and so long as there are
fellows who think it a glorious privilege to
get themselves shot or sealed up alive for
the sake of libertad well be having
revolutions
  but my gracious mr blythe-master-
son chirped the elder miss levering
isnt it dangerous living in such a wild
country
  oh of course theres always the off
chance that some misguided patriot will
pot you on general principles but i rub
along very comfortably y see ive tucked
away a run-away enganchador or two-
contract laborers you know-and the beg-
gars know ive a leaning to their side
  does your company like to have you
risk antagonizing the government asked
herman jr
  my-oh im for myself you see yes
it makes it rather jolly i shouldnt like
being accountable my word heres ori-
zaba and im-getting off here ive en-
enter the hero

joyed meeting you no end youll be stay-
ing over in crdoba of course and youll
all come out to the hacienda for tea or-
better still-stop the night that would
be jolly ive a goodish bit of room for
im expecting the people from home over
this year and i can perfectly well put you
up ill call it a promise then
  he stood with his hand on young tommys
shoulder his cheery glance running over the
languid group till it rested eagerly on miss
millard
  good-by then for a bit-beg pardon
youre having the car cut off here youre
staying over in orizaba oh i say what
luck he dropped into his chair again with
frank delight

and so it fell out that when the
dianthe started on the wonderful
drop from orizaba to cordoba three
days later on a marvelous green and gold
morning it was the englishman who sat
beside miss millard on the observation plat-
form tommy standing guard close by and
messrs gelbhauser and chase hovering
unhappily in the middle distance the
boy managed to whisper in her ear  guess
im poor as a discoverer-t columbus
jerrolds please write  and diana blushed
 the bjushiest blush you ever saw tommy
wrote his mother afterwards and there
your angel son sat playing the human
barbed wire fence listening to scraps
iike-and so youve been in surrey beeen
mumsie almost in sight of my home
only fancy -and chase and iiermie
thirsting for my gore
  all too soon there was crdoba smiling
up at them and then cordoba station with
the villagers drawn up to meet the train for
all the world like a comic-opera chorus and
a slim mexican with chesterfieldian man-
ners riding a dancing horse and leading an-
other to meet blythe-masterson who
called a hearty hello romaldo how
are you
   senor replied romaldo with a glitter-
ing sftiile with great difficulty removing
his sombrero and restraining both horses
i am your honors servant who kisses
your hands and all is well at las golon-
drinas
  they watched the englishman mount
and ride away the elegant romaldo falling
correctly behind but his master pulled up
sharply at a shrill cry leaning down to
greet a droll little row lined- up to meet
him there were two tiny boys almost
eclipsed by sombreros and three small girls
with heads sedately covered by rebosas the
youngest sucking a bashful finger he
leaned gravely down to shake each one
by the hand rummaged in his pocket for a
parcel of dulces waved again to the di-
anthe and clattered off down the sunny
street
  mr gelbhausers party climbed on the
mule-car which runs between the station
and the town and were jolted through
avenues of tropical trees past the clamor
of the market-place beside the gay plaza
with the old cathedral on its edge into the
heart of the tierra caliente
  wonder which way his hacienda is
said tommy will we go out to-day or
to-morrow
  i dont know that we will go either to-
day or to-morrow answered his host
crisply we are probably capable of en-
tertaining ourselves during our brief stay
there seems nothing to see-besides the
laziest set of idlers weve seen yet
  that fellow frivoling away his time with
the saratoga for instance  asked tommy
sweetly pointing to a slender youth with a
heavy trunk slung on his back and a basket
in his hands or his friend loafing along
behind with the four suit-cases and the two
satchels
   the gentleman transplanting the boiler
seems to be rather busy too laughed
chase nodding toward an aguador trotting
briskly under his enormous water-jar and
herman jr joined grudgingly in the laugh
  perhaps it was the aftermath of that irri-
tation that held him in its grip in the deli-
cious cool of the evening as they strolled
back from the concert in the alameda
when not even dianas face under a pale
blu rebosa could light his gloom nor
could the excellent supper the porters had
set out in the dianthe for he stood
moodily apart while the others ate hinting
darkly of an early morning departure a
crowd-some who had been listening to the
concert and others who had swelled the
number-came swarming down to the sta-
tion singing and shouting and halted near
the car
  i wonder if our friends are merely out
for the air or if this is a rallysaid chase
looks rather promising
  the crowd swayed nearer gesticulating

adventur-e
and pointing to the windows of the di-
an the
  oh please cried the younger miss
levering timidly maynt we have the
shades down
  i see no reason why said gelbhauser
sourly
  isnt it just possible said diana dryly
that the sight of us at our fifth meal may
be a little irritating to people who may
have difficulty in getting two
  his heavy face flushed unpleasantly
youve become inoculated with british-
mexican socialism i see but i shall pay
no attention to them it is not our affair
if they choose the vicinity of our car for
their meeting
  revolution run away come again some
other day little hermie wants to play
chanted tommy softly and the misses
levering giggled nervously gelbhauser
who had caught the drift wheeled on the
boy with his face stormy but a stone
whizzed through the window grazing his
cheek and just breaking the skin
  that settles it he shouted running
into his state-room while a pocket edition
of pandemonium reigned in the car and re-
turning with his revolver
  gelbhauser are you crazy cried
chase springing at him what-
  ill show you he screamed furiously
ill show you how to deal with these cat-
tle shaking off the restraining hand he
fired into the crowd there was a cry of
rage and pain and then all that had gone
before in the way of noise became as the
calm of a summer day-shrieks curses a
fusillade of stones a knife which gleamed
past diana and imbedded itself in the wall
  chase and tommy sprang to the doors
calling to the rest to pull the shades and
the members of the dianthes party
looked at each other in pallid silence while
the menacing roar grew louder then sud-
denly a new note was added to the tumult
-a shout which sent the color flooding
back into miss millards whitte face i
knew he would come for us she said with
a little laugh and tommy threw open the
door to admit blythe-masterson breath-
less and imperative
  quick he gasped youll have to
run for it i heard they were meeting and
hurried to- he looked at the pistol
in gelbhausers limp hand you had the
bad luck to wing florenzio-the vision-
chap and theres the deuce- to pay get
the women out of the window on-that side-
its dark-romaldos there-hell take you
to the hacienda quick i say ill stand
them off here till you get a bit of a start
tommy and chase had flown to obey
him as he spoke but herman jr brand-
ished his pistol hysterically am i to 
abandon my car to these savages 
  man alive shouted the englishman
ill do my best to save your car but i-pi
trying to save your skin quick i tell yoyl- 
he opened the door and shouted something
in spanish to the mob then slammed it
again and ran to tommy and caught-his
arm i say youll look after her v -
bet your neck said the boy- briefly
and blythe-masterson went out on the-plat-
form and shut the door behind him
the elegant romaldo was-receiv-
ing the limp and terrified ladies
from the arms of tommy arid
chase and when they were all on thfe
ground he pointed to the left motioned for
silence and set off through the lark at a
run the americans stumbling after him
diana had been the last to be lifted down
and she clutched tommys hand andhung
back
  what will they do to him she whis-
pered fiercely we cant-
 come along said tommy impor-
tantly he told me to take care of you
diana stood still tommy did he hon-
estly when what did he say
  come on panted the boy pulling her
do you think this is a pink tea hurry
from the other side of the car they could
hear the englishmans voice in earnest ex-
postulation and the yells and hisses of the
crowd
  tommy theyll kill him we cant
leave-
  now youve done it theyre coming
round pull that thing over your face
sh back into the shadow
  a section of the crowd swayed round the
end of the car and tommy dragged mise
millard deeper into the shade creeping be-
side the car to the end of it then stumbling
and pushing through the friendly dark
jostled by the mob which was breaking
and surging to all sides they made a
spurt to a freight-car and leaned against
it gasping	
  sh broathfd tommy if anybody
enter the hero

 comes near say something spanish-any-
 thing
    i c-cant think of anything but the soap
 	or the silk handkerchief of the french-
 man   she whispered wildly  oh tommy
 theyre coming this way
   they ran on again tommy pulling and
 urging run run didnt you ever
 play basket-ball didnt you ever play
 tag faster
   on through the soft murky darkness
 away from the station and the lights till
 the sound of the voices grew faint and died
 away and miss millard sank down in re-
 bellion not-another-inch-tommy
 oh if i ever-breathe again
    and now were lost like the babes in
 the wood satd tommy
    never mind said diana breathless
  but serene hell come for us hell find
  us
   tommy found breath to whistle rule
 brittania and he whistled it again an
 hour later when he heard a galloping horse
   my word im glad to find you ive
 been scouring the jungle the english-
 man had flung himself off and was holding
 both miss millards hands youre safe
 youre quite sure youre not hurt then
 reproachfully to tommy you promised
 ras youd look after her
   well she- began the boy but a
 frantic cough from diana checked him
 we were slow in getting started and the
 mob cut us off from the rest then we
 beat it-my friend miss diana of the
 chase and me and-
    you shall ride my horse blythe-mas-
 terson said to miss millard and jerrolds
 and i will walk beside you i didnt want
 to alarm the others when i saw you were
 not with them at the hacienda and i told
 them you were safe at the hotel so they
 havent been worrying
    they set off through the velvet blackness
  of the night tommy limping wearily and
  considerately in the rear and romaldo met
  them at the gate of las golondrinas
   senor he said i am your honors
 servant who kisses your hands and your
 guests are all sleeping save only the fat
 senor who wails for his car
    diana wtis given a steamer chair in the
  ksgrjtatpatio and the wife of romaldo
  surirfffqiiecf to attend her she was also it
-	qjfpeargd- tfie senors servant who kissed
  his hands pnd he chfef of-her joys was ris-
 ing at one oclock to prepare chocolate
 for beautiful and famished young ladies
 after that she showed miss millard to
 her room
  ft and it seemed hardly an hour after
-jigpv- her soft buenos noches that she
was saying buenos dias beside
the bed with another cup of steaming
chocolate diana hurried down to the
patio and found the dianthes party
assembled weary-eyed and much subdued
  it seems beastly inhospitable to speed
your going this way said their host un-
happily but i know youll feel more com-
fortable when youve put a good bit of
country between you and your adventures
of last night i got them to take your car
down to vera cruz on the midnight freight
romaldo will drive you to atoyac where
youll catch the train i-im no end sorry
to hurry you he led the way to the gate
where the four-horse stage and three sad-
dle-horses were waiting and helped the
women in
  diana dazed and wondering leaned
down to speak to him you-you are
coming with us 
 unfortunately no i-er-i have
things to look after here-things to be at-
tended to at once its beastly luck but i
cant possibly leave the ranch this morning
romaldo one moment
  miss millard watching in utter bewilder-
ment saw him slip a folded paper into the
mexicans hand and whisper to him earn-
estly then romaldo leaped to the drivers
seat cracked his long whip and they were
off in a cloud of golden dust
  young tommys hand found hers undei
the robe as he ran his horse close beside
when they slowed down for a turn i
dont know how he whispered but
hermie did it he was with him half an
hour before the rest came down and-
you saw blythe-mastersons face shall i
slay hermie at once or reserve him for
torture
  she pulled her thick veil down over her
face and leaned back in the corner of the
seat in silence careless of the close-clipped
smiles of the levering girls and the hard
fun in chases eyes five little days then
was to be the sum of it all the  dianthe 
was waiting herman jr was waiting
life as she had known it was waiting a
brisk fresh wind had swept through the

adventure
   lot-kouse revealing it cleansing it but
   the door was shut now and the air was
   danker than ever-spent stale heavy with
   	forced blooms
     gelbhauser thudding solidly on his slim
 moflnt reined in beside her a chastened
diearon his wide face alls well that
endswell eh miss millard im sorry i
was so upset last night i hope i dont have
tojxplain to you that it wasnt the broken
window it was the principle of the thing
 by the way collier will be in town the
- -night we get in and i want to consult you
 about a little party-
 
         in spite of the multiplicity of
  ifs cares which kept him at home the
   master of las golondrinas spent the
  morning on his upper veranda like sister
  anne watching every cloud of dust and
  romaldo found him waiting at the gate
senor he said i am your-
did you give her the note romaldo
but surely sefior and she has read it
two times and three and the young sefior
has laughed out with a great gladness and
torn a leaf from his book and held his hat
for her to write upon and the fat senor has
looked evilly upon-
where is it
romaldo had never seen his revered em-
ployer grab before the revered emplojer
also read two times and three
-but i am not not not engaged to him and
i never-
senor said romaldo politely and
patiently i am your honor servant
who-
saddles my horse cried his master
and gets a months wages if i make the
two-ten for vera cruz
the fight of
patsy mglynn
by edward alexander phillips
       is a step sounded at the street
door the widow mcglynn glanced
significantly at her daughter and
the two as though acting upon a
signal jerked the comers of their aprons to
heir moist eyes and assumed an air of
cheerfulness but rapid as the change had
been it did not escape the quick eye of the
powerfully built young man who suddenly
appeared in the doorway and now sent his
searching half-accusing gaze from one to
the other
  crying again eh he challenged more
in deprecation of a foolish habit than in
unkindness toward those who indulged it
well i suppose it does women-folks good-
the fight of patsy mcglynn

ive heard so but you mustnt cry any more
to-night mother see what ive brought
you-a brand new five-dollar gold-piece
   thfc widow took the coin slipped it in her
bosom and disappeared from mortal sight
into the yawning chasm formed by her big
boys outstretched arms and expansive
cliest held thus for a full minute in total
eclipse the world must ever remain in
ignorance as to how she would have inter-
preted the series of astonishing facial con-
tortions with which the young giant now
favored his staring sister nor was that
rattled young woman herself able to guess
what was intended to be conveyed to her by
the volley of cumbrous winks smirks and
grins whjck came her way there was
something so ridiculous in the pantomime
with its impromptu setting that she laughed
outright-and was sorry in a second as a
fierce frown of disapproval darkened her
brothers face in apparent disgust at her
dullness he jerked his head toward the door
by which he had just entered and-released
his prisoner
    patsy youre a regular old grizzly bear 
 gasped the smiling old mother now re-
 stored to the best of humor you nearly
 smothered me so you did youre that
 strong  wheres annie
   stepped across to the morrissys-back
in a minute and while youre fixing us a
bite to eat mother ill drop down to the
corner and see if there is any news from the
factory
   a few minutes before filled with appre-
hension of the calamity she felt must speed-
ily come upon the little family the widow
now moved with sprightly step about the
narrow kitchen humming an air to the ac-
companying rattle of pots and pans-an air
that came faith-full and hope-laden from the
heart and dissipated every fear such are
mothers of big boys
   to be sure the boiler-factory had been
closed for months keeping patsy out of
work the coal-man was importunate
the grocer refused further supplies the
rent-collector had threatened to put them
out for the past few weeks patsy had
earned varying sums at some training-
quarters across the bay where he had
assisted in preparing certain athletes for
certain conjing contests-she didnt know
what she only hoped he was not mixing
up with prize-fights and those terrible prize-
fighters anything but that
  her sons small and irregular earnings had
been far from adequate troubles seemed
to be coming from every direction threaten-
ing to culminate all at once during the long
day when her son was away she simply
could not avoid the dreadful picture of
hurrying disaster human reason refused
to justify any hope of escape there was fio
avoiding the inevitable how was it that
in face of the coming calamity patsy man-
aged to remain cheerful she couldnt
understand it yet she was forced to admit
that it was no more strange than the regular
disappearance of her own fearful apprehen-
sions when night brought him rollicking
home and stood him there in the center of
the little sitting-room his great arms spread
out like the wings of some gigantic bat in-
viting her to the enjoyment of her regular
evening smother
  but even the training-club employment
was now at an end patsy had said so him-
self when he gave her that five-dollar piece
bidding her make the most of it matters
were thus worse than ever still she hummed
that air fear had flown hope was in
her heart why
now you look here sis com-
manded patsy mcglynn towering
over his sister annie in the half-
light of the areaway before their little flat
you look here
  im looking said the girl squaring
herself in mock belligerency
  i want advice he announced curtly
  well sir youve come to the right shop
what seems to be the nature of your
trouble 
  no josh-this is serious i want ad-
vice but it has to be advice with a siring
to it
  advice with a strin-what do you
mean
  i mean i want you to give me the
advice i tell you to give me are you
game 
 game you know im game state
your case
  its like this you know that fellow
mike doolan ive been training for the
heavyweight fight friday night well hes
supposed to be the hardest proposition the
coast has ever turned out they had to go
to australia to get a man to lick him-jack
farnum even at that the betting is ten
to seven with doolan the favorite which
 
adventure
shows how the insiders feel about it
now you listen to what im saying for i
wouldnt say it to any one else on earth-
without your advice
     doolan first hired me to wrestle with
 him because im husky and heavy and he
 nsesed a lot of hauling about to prepare him
 for work in the clinches he got all the
 jiauling he wanted all right well the
 fhird day after i began work one of his
 sparring partners failed to show up and 
 t was asked to spar with him for four rounds
 at the end of the bout he called me into his
 dressing-room and offered me the job of
 boxing with him at odd times up to the date
 of the fight he said though i was young
 i had speed and as that was the main thing
 he had to overcome in farnum i was just
 the kid he needed to make him extend him-
 self he didnt want me to do any leading
 he said-only to block his leads and counter
 lightly when i saw an opening
   look at me sis i hadnt boxed with
 that fellow three times before i knew i could
 hit him when and where i pleased more
 than that i knew i was faster could hit
 harder and that he couldnt put a glove on
 me in a week if i didnt want him to and
 heres another thing-a couple of em i
 knew that he knew i was at least his equal
 at all points of the game and i knew that he
 knew that  knew it follow me
   now make a note of this i never did
 extend myself boxing with doolan mother
 needed that five-spot thegreat heavyweight
 was paying me for each set-to and i
 couldnt afford to lose the job so while he
 couldnt have helped knowing i was as good
 at the game as he was he didnt know whai
 an easy mark hed be for me if it came to
 a real go
   now ive not told any one these things
 it would sound like boasting and ive no
 ambition to be a fighter only you and i
 are wise for though a good many wit-
 nessed our bouts i carefully followed my
 bosss instructions working always on the
 defensive and keeping the sting out of my
 leads counters and swings
   we boxed the last bout this afternoon
 and when we got through doolan took me
 into his private room and offered me 
 to second him at friday nights fight i told
 him how mother and you feel about prize-
 fighting but he said he could arrange it so
i	could serve under an assumed name
that  looked mighty juicy the way
 things are with us sis and i finally agreed
 to act as doolans second
  then something happened that just
about knocked me dean silly what do
you suppose that alleged sport told me
that friday nights fight was fixed sure-
a fake doolan was to foul farnum in the
eighth round and i was to admit the claim
when famums second made it thats as
far as he got with my instructions when a
gang of newspaper men and others broke
into the room and my boss shook me by the
hand and said wed go further into the
details to-morrow so you see sis this
brace of pug highwaymen propose on nexl
friday night to steal between thirty thou-
sand and forty thousand dollars from the
califrisco club which is promoting the
contest and the public which is always
ready to encourage legitimate sport with
its good hard money and your fair-
haired brother is supposed to be in with
the robbery what do you think of it
  i think its a shame and a scand-
  hold heres where i test your game-
ness you know id rather have my head
cut off than betray the confidence of a
decent man dont you
  certainly i know it
  well this is the first time ive been
honored with the confidence of a thieving
scrub i want you to advise me to go to
mr fulmer president of the club and
explain the whole situation
  thats easy i advise it
  and after that i want you to advise
me to do what i think best for all con-
cerned
 but what--
  no buts be game i want you to
advise it
  well-er-g-go ahead
  good now you wouldnt throw a
man down for doing what you advise him to
do would you 
  why no-that is-certainly not
then when i get through doing what
you have advised me to do i want
you to stand up like a thoroughbred
and tell mother that i did it at your
suggestion
 but-you-you-
  are you a quitter
 n-no-but i-
  be game sis will you stick
  y-e-es
  then come on mothers waiting
the fight of patsy mcglynn

ii
patsy mcglynn stepped from
the side door of president fulmers
residence and hurried down the
street three blocks away he slackened his
pace and walked leisurely in the direction of
the ferry i dont want to get over there
ahead of the old man he said so ill
mosey along easy like
  it was mid-afternoon when the young
athlete sauntered up to the training-quar-
ters a big crowd was about the place and
the sports reporters photographers and
others who had come to see the noted heavy-
weight don the gloves for the last time be-
fore the great fight were voicing their dis-
appointment at doolans announcement
that he would box no more until he faced
farnum in the ring two days hence acci-
dents he had explained were likely to hap-
pen he might injure his hands or strain
a tendon the event was the most impor-
tant in his career and he couldnt afford to
take chances he was in perfect condition
for the fight of his life his friends and
backers would have to excuse him
  the disgusted visitors growled and moved
away to catch their train back to the city
only a few remained and of this number
patsy noticed without surprise president
fulmer the treasurer and two of the club
directors they were talking to doolan
who now appearing for the first time to
notice the presence of his late sparring part-
ner called him up and introduced him to the
distinguished visitors patsy was glad to
meet the gentlemen especially the famous
mr fulmer of whom he had heard so much
-though he had pictured him a much older
man he said
   i got that crowd out of the way on pur-
pose explained the pugilist  these gentle-
men want to see me in action get your
ring clothes on patsy well box four
rounds for em its only a-
  ill tell you what we want mcglynn
broke in the pompous president taking mat-
ters into his own hands we want to see
some real glove-work-something fast and
furious of course youre liable to get
battered up some but youre no doubt used
to that heres ten dollars to buy salve for
the bruises that are waiting for you and
he rattled on  to encourage you to do your
best we four spectators will each give you
another ten dollars if you succeed in knock-
ing this big fellow out all hands joined
in the laughter which greeted this announce-
ment from the great sporting promoter and
patsy thieved a knowing glance at him asie
started for his dressing-room muttering
four tms tens forty and ones fifty-
mother have a fit	 
 
bjw pugilist and pupil sat in opposite
imu corners f e training-ring antf
president fulmer watch in hand
squeezed through the ropes and addressed
the audience
  gentlemen he said i am running
this show and i hope that fact will be a
sufficient guarantee that it is on the square
at the first sign of faking on the part of
either of these principals the contest will be
declared off and there will be things doing
which are not down on the bill
  doolan laughed at this little joke
though to tell the truth that laugh of his
did not add materially to the sum total of
the worlds supply of mirth there was a
note of seriousness in fulmers speech and
manner which was not to be mistaken as
for patsy he was kept busy during the
presidents remarks in two directions-the
sustained simulation of absorbing interest
in official instructions and the avoidance
of a series of desperately winked signals
from doolans corner
  as fulmer proceeded with increased em-
phasis to picture the dire things in store for
the first man who showed signs of faking
the bearing of the big professional now
plainly disgusted at patsys gaping dullness
was observed to undergo a sudden change
a new idea seemed all at once to possess
him he ceased to smile his face became
set he glared at the man in the center of
the ring at the young athlete in the oppo-
sit corner and jammed the thin layer of
padding back from that part of the glove
which covered his right knuckles patsy
observed all this he knew what it meant
though making no outward sign he smiled
-smiled as the late lamented bill nye would
have said-elsewhere
   time called the self-appointed referee
shake hands
  doolan jaws set eyes a-gleam moved
warily to the center of the ring patsy with
right hand extended stepped lithely for-
ward to meet him doolan drew close to
the young fellow and instead of grasping
the proffered glove with his right hand he

adventure
threw the weight of his left upon it and
before- mcglynn could divine his purpose
hjs mighty right whizzed through the open-
ing caught patsy flush in the face and sent
him reeling against the ringpost across the
enclosure limp and dazed
    doolan bounded across the ring to finish
 ins work before the victim of his treachery
 could recover from the shock but fulmer
 sprang in front of him and waved him back
 the three spectators were on their feet
 yelling foul shame but the an-
 gry referee commanded silence and stand-
 ing between the boxers ordered doolan to
 hi corner the slight delay gave mcglynn
 n opportunity to collect his scattered
 senses and after giving his head a shake or
 two he was himself again except for a
 rapidly swelling lump under the left eye
 fulmer started to make another speech
 hesitated bit his lip glared from one to the
 other of the boxers and then stepping over
 to mcglynn asked do you want this
 contest to proceed
   certainly answered the young fellow
 cheerily im good as new
   then well make that read twenty in-
 stead of ten from each spectator if you
 knock him out whispered fulmer in his
 ear
   thanks and gazing across the ring
 at the scowling doolan he muttered  four
 fcms twentys eighty and tens ninety-
 motherll have two fits
  time
   patsy stepped to the center and waited
 doolan took a couple of strides from his
 comer and stopped the youngster mov-
 ing like a cat lessened the distance between
 them by a yard-another foot-another
 at all but reaching distance they faced each
 other standing like graven images motion-
 less each waiting for the other to lead a
 full minute of this tense inaction then a
 quick feint caused the veteran to drop his
 left hand-an inch it was enough across
 the lowered guard flashed the fist of the
 hard-hitting novice it found a target at
 the point of the jaw and-the lights went
 out for mr doolan
   ten minutes later the  pride of the coast 
 came out of his trance and propounded
 the usual question he was informed that
 he was on the floor of the shower-bath room
 having been carried there by patsy mcglynn
 and three attendants that he had met with
 an accident while boxing that he was the
 victim of a compound fracture of the jaw
 that he was shy sundry molars incisors and
 bicuspids that president fulmer was wait-
 ing to see him
  as soon as he could be made presentable
mr doolan went into executive session with
fulmer and his directors patsy mcglynn
was also present it was not a long session
mr doolan falling readily into the views
expressed by the president of the califrisco
club and his fellow officers the club
through its representatives expressed poign-
ant regret yea pangs of pain at the mis-
hap which would prevent mr doolans
appearance at the coming fistic entertain-
ment and with panting interest for his
future welfare pointed out the benefits of
continuous travel beyond the limits of the
state mr doolan with fiis hand to his
jaw nodded the thanks he could not find
words to express and-the session adjourned
im sure ive tried to bear up
eg under the strain sighed the widow
w mcglynn  but it doesnt seem to do
any good matters become worse every day
there is no hope anywhere the rent-
  whats the matter with me cried
patsy bursting into the room like an ele-
phant rampant on its hind legs aint 
a tolerable imitation of the hope youre
talking about look me over-im a
billionaire
  patsy patsy how can you be so fool-
ish the rent-man and the coal-man and
the grocer have been here again and were
going to be put out next monday morning 
well this is only wednesday night
but how are we going to live i paid
bills with that money you gave me last
night and we havent a cent how can
we-
   mother look here did you ever know
anybody to win anything by being gloomy
and looking on the dark side of things
  well what is the use--
  did you
  i suppose not but--
  and havent you noticed that good
fortune always follows cheerfulness
  not always
  yes always drawing a hand from his
pocket the incorrigible held it above his
mothers head and with the other taking
her gently but firmly by the chin he com-
manded now smile smile
  her sons ridiculous attitude forced the
the fight of patsy mcglynn

good woman to smile in spite of herself and
instantly the massive hand above her head
opened and she was submerged under a
shower of greenbacks and coins
 patsy wh-where in the name of-
where did all this money come from 
  from that smile of yours of course
teased the roaring patsy let it be a
lesson to you and while the happy
mother went into retirement against the
dancing heart of her big boy sister annie
collected the scattered fortune with a broom
in
the thursday morning papers an-
nounced under scare-heads that
owing to an injury received while
training the famous pugilist mike doolan
would be unable to meet the australian
heavyweight jack farnum on friday
night fortunately however the cali-
frisco club management had been able to
procure a substitute for the injured fighter-
an unknown whom farnum had agreed to
meet under conditions absolutely identical
with those arranged for his fight with the
coast favorite
  these conditions called for a purse of
twenty thousand dollars winner take all
and a division of the gate-receipts on a basis
of seventy-five and twenty-five per cent to
the winner and loser respectively all bets
on the interrupted event had been declared
off and the first effect of the announcement
had been to make the australian a big fa-
vorite over the unknown the  wise ones 
figuring that barring doolan no heavy-
weight then on the coast had a chance
against the foreigner
  mr fulmer owned one of the finest pri-
vate gymnasiums in the city and it was
there that patsy mcglynn spent all of
thursday perfecting himself in a few tricks
of foot-work and trying to demonstrate
to the personal friends of his patron that the
club had been fully and entirely justified
in presenting him as a substitute for the
injured fighter of course it was impos-
sible to conceal the identity of the unknown
from the newspaper men but when the
young fellow frankly explained to them
his reasons for wishing to keep his name
out of the papers they patted him on the
back promised him all possible protection
and wished him all kinds of success
next day the young athlete lounged about
home until late in the afternoon keeping his
mother and sister in merry humor and
explaining with minute attention to every
horrible detail the ghastly fate he had
planned for them if he ever again caught
them giving way to sad and gloomy
forebodings
  the only way to make the bugbear of bad
luck hike to the woods is to grin in his face
he said laugh at him-thats the dop
now i want you two to keep grinning till
i get back home ill be a little late maybe
but you keep grinning start in right now 
-one-two-three-thats it now keep
it up and he was gone
mcglynn said fulmer x
want a serious word with you
ive got a big bunch of money
here mostly my friends to be wagered at
the ringside i dont want to lose it
bet it on me then mr fulmer and get
it all placed before the first round is over
but why are you so certain of success
patsy this man famum is a mighty tough
proposition i want to know the grounds
for your confidence of course i think you
have a fair chance but why are you so
absolutely certain about it 
  mr fulmer returned the young boxer
in a tone of unusual seriousness im going
to win this fight because i think im going to
you can do anything if you think you can 
theres lots of glory in it if you win
im not looking for that brand of glory
mr fulmer im after that big purse your
club has hung up and the long end of the
gate-receipts im fighting to-night for-
for mother and annie itll be my first and
last prize-fight and im going to win so
get your money up early-the odds wont be
so good after the first round
   well go to it my boy ill take a chance
on you
big jack farnum shouldered his way
along the crowded aisle mounted
the stage steps and squeezed his
bulky form between the ropes of the arena
seating himself in his comer he sent his
gaze across to where the substitute and
attendants were busying themselves with
the glove-lacings a sneer curled his lip
  they tell me thats the kid they had
sparring with doolan he snarled in his
seconds ear they say hes fast fast
his speedll do im a-of a lot o good

adventure
i spose tiie club had to give some kind of
a smvy and that amateur was the only thing
tlcy could get to go agin me tighten up
that glove
 maybe youd better lei the bout go a
few rounds jack wliisptred the second
sos to give the crowd a little bit of a run
ter its money
 few rounds nothin sneered the vet-
eran pug do you think it id do my
reputation any good to have that brat
boastin that he went any distance with me
not yet when the gong strikes i spose
hell just stand in his corner an shiver
ill walk over an clout him a couple o stiff
ones and-well catch that midnight train
for chicago
  the principals and their seconds were
motioned to the center of the ring where the
former shook hands and listened to the
referees interpretation of the rules as the
two boxers stood there the backers of the
australian could already hear their win-
nings jingling in their pockets their man
towered fully two inches above the substi-
tute fighter and his great muscular shoul-
ders loomed formidably in comparison with
those of the younger man what most of
the enthusiasts in the audience failed to note
was that patsy stood hunched over so
that he appeared a couple of inches shorter
chan he really was and that the shuffling
awkwardness of his movements as he trav-
eled to and from the center of the ring was
a decidedly clever bit of acting the ap-
pealing look which the young fellow bent
upon the professional was interpreted by
that amused gladiator as a bid for mercy
so he was confirmed in his original deter-
mination to make short work of it
  the gong struck and big jack farnum
started across the ring on ins mission of
mercy he had negotiated the first half of
ms second stride when something hit him
it came from the opposite corner and bore
all the outward semblance of a human
thunderbolt the audience saw it streak
like a comet across the intervening space
collide with the giant and send him stagger-
ing to his corner then as the rope
tightened by his weight hurled him back he
was met by a blinding hail of fists which
pelted his rocking head and face unmerci-
fully giving him no time to recover the
furious patsy drove him with slashing
uppercuts and body-smashes along the side
rope to the corner-post where he brought
up bloody and blinded by the battery of-
blows limp and helpless
  the crowd went wild the referee pushed
patsy toward the center of the ring and
stood over the gasping gladiator counting
-one-two-three-four-
  get up yelled the australians second
five-six-seved-eight-
  get up
  farnum let go the ropes and reeled like a
drunken man into the ring his hands hung
at his sides he leered about him foolishly
  finish him mcglynn ordered the
referee
  hit a man like that why sir i
couldnt-
  finish him i tell you the rules de-
mand it
   rules or no rules i cant and i wont 
  put up your hands farnum put up
your hands and fight commanded the
official
  the veteran slightly recovered very
slowly raised his fists and threw himself into
a fighting attitude patsy measured the
distance accurately estimated the necessary
force and then-a feint a short-arm jolt
and the pride of kangaroo-land toppled over
and took the count
  in handing farnum the losers end of use
gate-receipts the head of the califrisco club
felt called upon to make a few remarks
  its the first dollar jl have ever parted
with grudgingly he said i learned all
about that scheme you and doolan faked up
to rob the club and the public i want to
say to you and through you to your partner
mike doolan that my regret at having to
give you this money is more than counter-
balanced by the delight it has given me to
see an unknown boy lick the stuffing out of
both of you good-by mister farnum 
now sis while im getting my
factor ready for business and fix-
ing up our new home i want you
and mother to go over and give the swells
and belles of europe a treat and when
you get her off in some dark corner
away from all lines of communication i
want you to stand up like a thoroughbred
and confess how you advised me to become
a prize-fighter
  oh patsy i can never do that
  you can do anything you think you
can  he said-
adventuring in tiburon
a personal narrative of exciting weeks in the
gulf of california gy john a avirette e    
       he two burke boys charlie kan-
aka and i sat in close consulta-
tion great deference was given to
charlie by the rest of us since the
natter under discussion was a boat was
he not a salt of the sea from the pacific
islands where men swam out in amphibious
temerity to slay the terrible man-eater
shark in his own element
  charlie finally said that she must be
twenty-two feet long half-decked and with
at least five feet beam we should steal a
rail from the southern pacific r r bend
it to suit and bolt it firmly to her bottom
for a keel this he said would stiffen
her give her low ballast and if we struck a
sunken rock in a blow would save her
from holing thus in lieu of sinking we
should only turn over
  charlie had his way we built the boat
half-decked her stole the rail from collis p
and one glorious november morning chris-
tened her with a bottle santa maria
never had boat a more propitious launching
and never had crew a fairer promise of fun
galore-for were we not bound for the mouth
of the colorado river lower california and
tiburon island and where pray was a
wilder or more dangerous coast on which to
venture to ones hearts content
  frank was the elder of the two burkes
he had six notches on his gun while pete
as a modest younger brother had only four
i had killed bear and deer while charlie had
once licked a french cook we were thus a
crew of valor and prowess fit for all adven-
tures by sea or land
  old man shaunnessy and the other half
of yuma came down to see us off and bid us
god speed shaunnessy is an irish prince
-a remote descendant of brian baru he
has kept saloon in every government
post every mining camp and town in al
arizona he is a kind old man with a
stutter and fine principles-for he gave us
a gallon
  we up-hooked about  a mnovem-
ber nth to the tune of revolver-shots cheers
from the bank the braying of burros and
the barking of dogs that night we had
made only twelve miles for we put in at
hall hanlons ranch near pilot knob-for
watermelons hanlon gave us six whop-
pers then helped us punch a hole in the
gallon for california like arizona is a very
dry country hanlon is a missourian from
kentucky when drunk and a very hospit-
able man at all times he is much beloved
and feared in yuma since he is not only
kind to a fault but is also hasty-when
crossed
  nov -we are now down opposite the
colony the immense tule-flats on either
bank of the river are simply alive with hogs
gone-wild descendants of the lordly
berkshires and poland-chinas abandoned
here by the blythe colonists when the mos-
quitoes ran them off we camped on an
island to minimize the mosquitoes and
while the rest cooked supper i took the skiff
and pulled for sonora and pork i got the
pork i came near getting too much pork
for when i shot the pig he squealed about
twenty great wild hogs responded to his cry
of distress and bounding out of the tule
rushed at me in fierce wrath i stood not
on the order of my going we made it in one
heat to the river bank whence i dived head-


adventure
long into the muddy waters of the colorado
whpi things had cooled off i sneaked care-
fully back for my rifle and the pig to those
wjjp know humanity it is needless to state
that my arrival at camp was the signal for
 merciless jeers mollified somewhat when i
produced the pig
    nov -to-day we are camped at ship-
  yard slough some two hours after our
  arrival we saw the famous iide-rip run in
  from the gulf a wall of roaring water
	at least thirty feet high rushed into the
  mouth of the river at express-train speed
  i lelt much awe at the sight for many
  deaths have occurred at this point when
  ftither greenhorns or careless folk have been
  caught in the fierce tide luckily charlie
  knows all about this coast so we were hauled
  up high and dry out of all danger this
  tide is at its greatest at new-moon or full-
  moon and if it happens that at the same
  time a strong wind is blowing up the gulf
  the tide reaches truly formidable propor-
  tions sweeping over even the highest banks
  and destroying both property and life
  this of course in old days when there was
  a port here now there is sand solitude and
  sky
nov -to-day we ran out of
 whisky so frank concluded to give
 up the trip and return to yuma
 his brother pete also concluded that the
 salt-water looked too dry for him frank
 argued that it was only three miles across
 the tule flats to old ponciano dominguezs
 ranch he had heard that dominguez
 sold contraband mescal to the cocopah
 indians so the thing looked both promising
 and easy he and pete could easily pack
 their rifles and blankets across secure
 horses from dominguez and return to yuma
 charlie and i expostulated in vain frank
 had made up his mind and pete didnt have
 any after they were gone charlie and i
 smoked mournfully for a time then charlie
 said -now while i fully agreed
  with him i mentioned the fact that the
  grub would last two men twice as long as
  four at this sapient remark charlie
  brightened up and began to sing in the
  honolulu language
    nov -this morning i killed a -
  pound jewfish with a finely-placed shot
  as he broke water i pulled trigger the
  shot cut the spine at the base of the skull
  we are making jerkey out of him the
bushes around camp are strung with ropes
great and small and every rope is weighed
down with great white flakes of fish at
noon i shot an egret cutting his neck in two
with the -long winchester his plumes
were in fine shape glossy and beautiful
egret plumes are worth  per ounce in
yuma-in good hard iron money at
sundown the long expanse of the river-
mouth was alive with leaping mullet mil-
lions were in the air at one time i have
never seen so many fish this fish is about
fourteen inches long plump and juicy and
of fine flavor gray on the back bright silver
on the sides and dead white on the belly
we got eleven with the gill-net within ten
minutes the mullet run into the river
from the gulf with the flood-tide as far as
the water is brackish with salt they pene-
trate every slough of the great tide-flats and
with a net as the tide runs out they may be
caught by the ton these waters are un-
fished and are simply alive with finny
denizens
  the bones of four large vessels project
from the sands of shipyard slough these
derelicts date from the days when yuma
was a proud united states port long be-
fore collis p huntington built his southern
pacific railroad across the continent this
spot was a busy and thriving city of four
houses the climate being perfect the
people slept on board or on the sands
around the houses going inside for a drink
if not broke now all this civilization is no
more only empty whisky-bottles and the
bones of the dead ships attest the former
opulence sea-going ships anchored here
to meet the river-steamers that carried all
freight to yuma whence it was freighted on
wagon-trains to forts towns and mining-
camps for hundreds of miles over the desert
now the great tule and hemp flats are
peopled with only wild hogs millions of
aquatic creatures and billions of mosquitoes
sic transit gloria mundil
  nov -we are now on montague
island it is five miles across to the lower
california bank and eight to the sonora
side at shipyard slough the island is some
ten miles long by one mile wide-a low
flat sand-island covered with short salt-
grass and birdnests innumerable pelicans
cranes geese ducks gulls flamingoes and
heaven knows what other winged creatures
come here to breed the birds are very
tame showing little fear of man the near-
adventuring in tiburon

cst human habitation is that of old man
dominguez beyond his one lone house
there is no other dwelling-place nearer than
la grulla eighty miles to the north both
coasts here are treeless waterless sunburnt
sand wastes here and there a reef of black
malpai rock crops out of the eternal sand
rain seldom falls and when this rare phe-
nomenon does occur it is likely to be a sum-
mer thunder-shower wetting a meager and
limited patch of sand
  many great turtles crawl out on the
beaches of this island to lay from one
nest we dug some two bushels of eggs this
looks as if several lady turtles did busi-
ness together the eggs are palatable and
in my opinion preferable to sea-bird eggs
the mexican fishermen of this coast call
this turtle the carapachi and are said to
esteem its flesh very highly we found no
sign of human beings on the island not even
the char of an old campfire charlie said
that no one ever comes here but stray pearl-
fishers from la paz or muleje and then only
when they are in hard straits for drinking
water and put into the mouth of the river
to fill their kegs
nov -after a most glorious sail
of sixty miles we are safe and sound
behind point san felipe if there
was ever a desert paradise on earth this is
one somewhere up on the american line
the sierra nevadas split in two one of the
forks strikes down by the southeast to butt
boldly into the gulf of california we have
found a sheltered cove some shade trees and
a small spring of sweet water at extreme
low tide a hot spring boils up from the
sands at the waters edge this water is
very hot and somewhat sulphurous our
drinking spring is a mere trickle from the
cliffs a dainty rock-pool holding but a
few gallons
  we found many wild-game tracks around
this spring apparently those of mountain
sheep or deer the tide-rocks are covered
with great masses and clumps of oysters
the water of the inlet is so clear that even
small fish may be seen at great depths we
have blockhauled the boat and are pre-
pared for a long stay for truly we have
found a sportsmans paradise
  nov ig-alas our eden has its ser-
pents charlie has killed six rattlesnakes
and i nine unfortunately this is not the
worst of it for this place is wormy with
hydrophobia skunks - diminutive spotted
pests more dangerous than anyother
living animal during the night oneff
these abominations touched my face giving
me a fine scare after this i sleep in te
launched boat charlie is a stoic and neis
no nerve-tonics my wild yell in the niglfl
brought him up sitting rifle in hand
  whats de matta he asked
   one of theseblankety-blank-ety blshfi
skunks touched my face i cried
   did him bait you 
  no said i but he scared nine kinds
of tar out of me
  well said charlie philosophically if
you is scare you cant sleep so mak up firt
an keepm off me i sleepy
  so my guide philosopher and friend lay
calmly back in his blankets and snored
peacefully the rest of the night charlie is
a gentleman even his snore is musically
gentle he carries his sixty years like a day
and his frame is as vigorous as that of a boy
of twenty he is a primitively simple and
honest man taking no thought for the future
hating no man and fearing no living thing
under the sun happy charlie
  these hydrophobia skunks are the most
horrible of created creatures they are less
than one quarter of the size of the ordinary 
skunk are spotted and are very vicious  in
new countries where men camp out and
sleep on the ground they are more danger-
ous than a hundred rattlesnakes the
snake strikes solely in self-defense while the
skunk is a nocturnal prowler biting without
provocation the unfortunate sleeper about
ten per cent of the deaths in lower cali-
fornia are due to the bites of this skunk
the people are poor and apathetic they
sleep on the ground and have no doors to
their huts the skunks are numerous are
vicious with the disease and bite them the
bitten person contracts hydrophobia from
the bite and dies a terrible death it is
gods will for if he willed it not how
could it happen who may go against the
will of god  they are worthless folk and
fatalists
  nov -to-day has been a peach at
daybreak i took the - carbine and went
out for deer i did not get a deer but i did
get two tremendously fine bighorn sheep
i ran into a band of twelve and proceeded to
lay out the two patriarchs of the flock
both were fat as butter and each had a
splendid head of horns fortunately i

adventure
i made the kill near camp for both sheep were
  very heavy i went in with one staggering
  under the heavy load charlie was dis-
  gusted
   what for you shoot ole he one he
 snorted
     when i got my breath i said for the
  horns charlie they will make such splendid
  frophies
    n we no eat horn  he asseverated sourly
     that is true charlie said i but just
  think of the immense satisfaction of the
  trophies
    after ruminating over this strange view
  of hunting charlies native gentility came
  to his aid he smiled wanly and then said
  hopefully mebbe you sell m horn to
  tenderfoot
    mebbe so i conceded weakly
    going up to the spring for water i shot a
  mountain hon i came very near not seeing
  him as he crept away among the rocks
  he too had gone for water to find death at
  the hands of a strange creature that he had
  never seen before no more juicy fawns for
  his lion ship his skin isnt overfine but
  maybe i can sellm to tenderfoot
nov -we have jerked both of
the sheep they made a full gunny-
sack of jerky the meat is fat
savory and tender so i have risen in
charlies esteem
    we have neighbors four lean dirty
  mexican pearl-fishers from muleje they
  beat around the point of rocks about  p m
  saw our smoke and steered for our boat
  when near one of them called out to know
  if we had found fresh water on our reply-
  ing in the affirmative they landed when
  they were ashore they came up to shake
  hands we picked up our rifles and de-
  clined this honor contenting ourselves with
  directing them to the spring this is a lone
  place far from courts of justice they each
  carry a long knife and their looks are very
  villainous and our boat and outfit are very
  desirable to such as these so we are warily
  polite knowing that dead  gringos  tell no
  tales they unloaded four water-kegs and
  started for the spring when they returned
  i called one of them over and gave him
  some jerked meat some coffee and tobacco
  after a mellowing-up smoke he became
  very communicative down the coast
  said he where two sharp rocks project
  from the sea there is much oro gold
  why didnt they dig it out
  they were only pearl-fishers and knew
nothing about gold-mining he had seen
the grains of gold however in the sands
of a dry gulch
  is there any fresh water there
  no water
  how far is it
  two days sail if the wind is good
   where are you going 
  back to muleje with our pearls he
here undid a greasy belt and showed us some
really beautiful pearls he frankly ad-
mitted that they were poachers god said
he had made the sea and the pearl-oyster
a bad government had sold the pearl
monopoly to english and french pearl-
companies thus depriving the poor of a
natural right he for one did not concur
so he poached this pearl said he is
worth at least  pesos yet we will get
scarcely  pesos for it since we are con-
strained to sell our pearls to illicit pearl-
buyers who cheat us he would however
sell it to us very cheap we thanked him
but declined on the plea of poverty he
sniffed incredulously and then took his de-
parture after bidding us good-night and
thanking us for the food
  that night i slept all night while charlie
watched he was to have awakened me at
midnight for my turn but he did not do so
for charlie is as i said a gentleman
  nov -they went away at dawn-
back down the lower california coast
when they were decently around the point
i took the - carbine and slipped out on
the farther rocks to see that they really went
when i peered cautiously over the last rock
they were a mile away under full sail for the
south i sat on the rocks and watched the
sunrise almighty god how wonderful are
thy works out from the bosom of a silver
sea rose the sun in spotless splendor far out
at sea a school of whales played and gam-
boled spouting into the air streams of spun
silver then diving to reappear farther on
the boat of the mexicans became a mere
dot on the southern horizon i was glad to
be alive for was not the world beautiful
beautiful beautiful
  i	went back to charlie and a steaming
pot of coffee
  gone
  yes really gone did he believe the story
about the gold
  yes he believed it for captain polhemus
adventuring in tiburon
i
of yuma had told him the same story
polhemus was no mexican and no liar
should we hunt for it
   yes if i wanted to go we had six empty
five-gallon coal-oil cans that would hold
fifteen days water-if we didnt wash
ii
       nov -the jerky is all packed
buy the coal-oil-cans are lashed tight
amidships and every canteen and
bottle is a-brim for the trip we have
cooked ten days rations of bread so as to
economize water when once off down this
dry coast at xx a m we pulled out with
the oars far enough to catch the breeze
as the sail bellied out and the ropes drew
taut we waved a farewell to our snaky
pole-catty paradise like all mundane
things it has its good and evil intimately
blended we were not bitten and we did
have fine hunting fishing and bathing the
sun was clear and warm the breeze pure and
 the bills very very beautiful
   charlie was right to a dot about stealing
the rail for a keel this heavy ninety-
pound rail trims the craft beautifully and in
a stiff breeze the boat behaves like a thing of
life we are making about three knots
and at this rate should sight the twin rocks
by noon to-morrow we have pored over
our u s coast survey chart and have
come to the conclusion that the greasers
twin rocks must mean the san louis
islands in the bay of vistado some seventy-
five miles se by s
   the wind freshened to a half-gale by 
p m so we took two reefs in the mainsail
charlie is a bolder sailor than myself i
prefer to do my dying on dry land so when
a comber slaps me in the face it dampens
my enthusiasm bailing water ceaselessly
for some hours becomes real true exercise
after the second hour charlie had the
tiller and i had the bailing-can and the
brine that dripped from my noble brow did
not all come from the ocean about half-
past six we saw a cove and steered for it
the shore was rocky and uninviting but a
closer acquaintance showed a little creek-
like slough where the water was still as a
church i landed and collected enough
brush to cook supper and breakfast
   nov -this morning we pulled out into
the offing and waited for a breeze as no
breeze showed up we began to fish catching
a number of worthless croakers two young 
sharks and five fine rockbass afeout 
a m the wind came so we up-stick-and-
away for the south the wind freshened
steadily until about four oclock when it
began to blow in puffs toward night we
watched the coast for an inlet and findilf
none resolved to sail in the moonlight just
before sundown we sighted the islands thej
almost immediately saw the high hill-pcfint
of cape final charlie turned in for tje
first sleep and i let him sleep until half-past-
three in the morning the sea was fairly
smooth and the night-breeze soft and dsi- 
dous great fish leaped at intervals from at
the dim sea and unseen gulls called from the
distant shore after the moon went down
the sky became a marvel of glittering worlds 
ah but i love the night and her stars
  nov -when i woke i smelled coffee
peeping out of the cuddy-hole i saw charlie
with a finely puckered brow frying fish and
trying to dodge smoke the  smoke-nui-
sance  of our great dties is not in it with the
smoke of a measly brush campfire times
innumerable i have circled a campfire like
a merry-go-round but the smoke would
persist in blowing my way going up my
nose making my eyes water and making me
swear like a pirate
  breakfast over we hoisted the sheet and
started to cruise ajong the mainland looking
for a good shelter we found none to suit
us so we picked out a smooth path of sand
and ran the boat ashore we then rigged
our block and tackle and pulled the boat
clear into the brush so as to hide her from
any stray sea-prowlers who might happen
along in the afternoon i took the -
carbine and went prospecting about a
mile inland i came upon two fresh human
tracks evidently those of an indian buck
and his squaw going back i told charlie
who only grunted
  if said i any indians live around
here they drink fresh water lets look
them up
  charlie grunted again but this time it
was a grunt of assent
  nov -we started at daybreak with
our rifles and the two-gallon canteen i
took the trail of the indians and followed it
some three miles inland here we came out
on the edge of a deep canyon that had a
wide flat bottom down in this flat we saw
a dozen or two wickyups the smoke from
which showed them to be inhabited we
 
adventure
slipped down a small side ravine and came
out beside a large wickyup where a squaw
was skinning a turtle when she saw us she
dropped the turtle squalled and lit out like
a streak the whole village now took to
the brush leaving us alone with the huts
we called loudly to them in spanish say-
ing amigo amigo but with no further
result than to accelerate their speed
  we now examined the huts the wickyup
ol the turtle-lady had two large water-
ollas threeearthen cooking-pots a metate
for grinding corn or seeds and a couple of
fisli-spears in one corner we found a gourd
partly full of pumpkin-seed a piece of
broken mirror and a joint of reed shaking
the joint of reed we found that it rattled
inside and further examination disclosed
the fact that it contained about an ounce of
placer-gold
  we now started to look for the water-
hole and found it some half-mile down the
canyon the indians had dug a hole in the
sands of the arroyo where at the depth of
some four feet they had found passable
drinking water then we went back to the
wickyup of the turtle-lady and left some
tobacco on her stone metate as a free gift
we returned to the boat and
there at sundown an old indian
hailed us from the bluffs on our
making him friendly overtures he came
down to see us ke spoke fairly good
spanish and seemed very intelligent we
gave him a good supper and whfle he got
on the outside of this we talked he said
his name was tomas and that the name of
his people was simangitos this tribe
he said was very poor and very few in num-
ber he said that they lived on grass seeds
picayunes fish turtles and an occasional
deer they had no corn because the coun-
try was too dry to plant corn he said that
they washed a limited amount of placer-
gold out of the sands of the dry-washes at
long intervals one or more of tiiem took this
gold across on the other side pacific and
traded it to mexicans for flour and cloth
  have any white men ever come here
before  i asked
  two parties have come said he the
first to come were two white men who came
in a boat like yours these brought a ma-
chine dry-washer and took out much gold
they were good men and cured our sick but
they themselves got sick and died when
they were dead we hid their machine in a
cave and told no one for we were afraid that
the mexican police would think that we had
killed them we loved them and did not
kill them
  of what did they die i asked
of the bubble-sickness he replied
seeing that i did not comprehend charlie
told me that the indians called smallpox the
bubble-sickness from the pustules that
broke out on the patient
  the others said tomas came in a
very large boat that smoked much these
were rough and bad men they were ten in
number seven of these were mexicans
who stole our food and attacked our women
we ran away into the hills and in the night
our young men slipped back and slew four of
them the others then made a great smoke
on their boat and went away
  dat was captain polhemus an his
outfit put in charlie i remember dat
time dey come in steam tug an polhe-
mus he bring seven mexican from yuma
i gave tomas a pound of tobacco one of
coffee two of sugar and ten of flour  here
said i are some gifts take these home and
come again early to-morrow
  the old man took his gifts and silently
disappeared in the night presently we
heard the subdued gabble of voices from the
cliff tomas had not come alone but like
a prudent general had hidden his forces for
reprisal in case of bad faith
  nov -about six this morning tomas
was back with a sack of roots that he
claimed were very good eating six young
men came with him these had good faces
and were lithe quick straight fellows
their deportment was the epitome of grave
modesty they sat on the sand in silence
speaking only when spoken to and evincing
no curiosity i made a great pot of coffee
and then served them a huge meal of coffee
bread and jerked jewfish when they were
as full as they could hold every face beamed
with good feeling
  charlie said i i believe we can trust
these people
  yaas said charlie if you dont do
em no bad ting trust em
  the indians now had a great confab in
their own tongue when they were done
tomas said the two good white men who
died here were our brothers they cured
many of us from the bubble-sickness their
medicine was so strong that we have never
adventuring in tiburon

understood why they died we have now a
fine young man very sick a month ago he
took our gold and went over on the other
coast to trade when he came back he be-
came very ill first a bad cold-spirit makes
aim very cold then a hot-spirit makes him
burn we would like that you cure him if
your medicine is as strong as that of the
other two good white men
  i will consult with my partner said i
the indians now respectfully withdrew
 charlie said i this sick indian has evi-
dently contracted malaria on the other coast
we have plenty of quinine and calomel so
j am going over to cure him
  very well said charlie go and cure
him
  i now made up a bed-roll took the needed
medicine and called over one of the young
men come said i you are strong
bring my bed along
dec -the sick man is cured of his
chills and fever he is still very
weak but thecoldandhotdevilshave
jled before the strong medicine of the
white man nothing can exceed the silent
esteem and gratitude of these poor savages
this morning ahtu the sick man took my
right foot and put it upon his head the
assembled onlookers all cried tu-roo tu-
rool good good
  tomascagie in from a turtle huntat noon
he said you men are now our brothers
you white men love gold we have the ma-
chine hidden in a cave and it is still good
we will give it to you so that you may gel
much gold
  dec -the machine is a thirty-ton dry-
washer as this climate is so dry that
nothing rots all that the machine needs is
overhauling and grease we will set it up
in the same place it was worked before
  dec -ahtu charlie and myself have
now run the dry-washer for two days we
have taken out four and a half ounces of
gold at  per ounce this makes  a
day per man it is needless to state that
we are well pleased i have sent four of the
young men across to encinal to buy flour
charging them strictly to say nothing of our
presence to any one whatsoever
  ahtu has offered me as a free gift his
most precious possession to wit his wife
 have thanked him kindly stating that we
while men when good men love only one
woma n and that as i already love the one
woman i can not honestly love two this
phase of male virtue seems beyond is
primitive philosophy yet he has silently
acquiesced as he does in all things that are
my will i believe he loves me in his dumb
and simple fashion-and i am not displeased
  charlie is making googoo eyes at a coy
widow this ladys name is ma-hat-mi
and she is the relict of two successive gentle-
men who have both passed out by the bubble
sickness route the lady herself has the
face-of-a-thousand-pits for she had the
disease herself she is fairly young how-
ever kindly and industrious i have
noticed that charlie is easily pleased and
that his ideas on some subjects resemble
strongly those of the upper-class stone age
  dec -ma-hat-mi to-day became mrs
charles kanaka the ceremony was short
sweet and unaffected the bride wore
neither veil nor orange-blossoms being
adorned with only her native virtue a new-
red handkerchief a bag skirt of calico and
a mans shirt the latter presented by my-
self she was very proud of this gift wear-
ing it outside of everything d la chinaman
at  p m a drum was beaten by the brides
brother while a cousin blew plaintive notes
on a reed flute this wedding-march was
continuous during the nuptial feast said
feast consisting of coffee beans boiled com
dried pumpkin fish and turtle-eggs we
had also some edible roots baked to a turn
the soul and core of the ceremony itself
consisted in the bride and groom eating a
small turtle together the turtle being a
sacred emblem
  after the feast we smoked told stories and
gambled for gold-dust fortune favored
ahtu whose skill or luck was phenomenal
  dec -last night ahtu surreptitiously
added his winnings to my sack of gold-dust
this indian is a gentleman one of gods
fools-such as he who found richard cceur-
de-leon in his austrian prison of course
i wont keep the dust but i am touched
beyond words tomas has the belly-ache
-too much turtle-egg i am giving him a
dose of salts one of the turtle-eggs must
have been sour
  dec g-yesterday charlie resolved to
move his honeymoon up to the dry-washer
ma-hat-mi is now chief cook and bottle-
washer for the three of us-ably assisted by
mrs ahtu she watches charlie like a
faithful pup who loving and trusting his
master ever yearns to lick his hand some

adventure
 white ladies might take a leaf out of ma-
 hat-mfs book-else i have been a sorry
 observer the gold is piling up rapidly
 skunks are none snakes are few and the
 winter weather is ideal
dec -a ragged starved mexican
 peon was found down on the beach
 by one of the women he has a
 great livid wound in his head and is in
 the last stages of emaciation from hunger
 and thirst we went down to see him
 then had the indians bring him up to
 camp where we fed him broth every two
 hours tomas was displeased at our ac-
 tion better kill this mexican said
 he these people are like snakes - if
 you warm them they bite you all the
 village got into a great discussion at this
 finally i went out and said to them i will
 not have this man slain when he is well
 we will bind his eyes so that he can not see
 the trail and send him away to encinal
 as usual they deferred to me
   dec -the mexican is much better and
 stronger he says that his name is pedro
 castaneda and that he is a pearl-fisher from
 la paz last september he and four others
 sailed from la paz in an open yawl to
 poach for pearls they had poor luck until
 a month ago when they struck a phenome-
 nally rich bank from which they took two
 hundred pearls in ten days some of them
 worth great sums running short of water
 they landed just south of cape final to
 search for a spring they had been told was
 there he jpd one of his comrades had
 gone inland to look for the spring and when
 they returned to the beach the men pearls
 and boat were gone leaving them marooned
 to a dreadful death his comrade had be-
 come violently insane with fear and had
 assaulted him with a club inflicting a great
 gash in his head luckily he had his
  knife-
   where did you kill this man i asked
   on the beach some five hundred meters
 south of the point he replied
   the indians heard him in silence but i
 could see disbelief plainly written in their
 faces they have suffered much harm in
 the past from mexicans hence do not love
 them tomas says he will send two young
 men down there to read the tracks
   dec -the two sign-readers are back
 they say that the mexican is a liar it is
 true that a boat has recently landed behind
the point that five men landed from the
boat true that one dead mexican lies on the
beach the rest of the mexicans story is
false since the tracks show plainly that all
five men were in the struggle tomas be-
lieves that castaneda and the dead greaser
tried to sneak away with the boat and pearls
while the others slept he thinks that they
were discovered and set upon at the waters
edge where one was slain and our frieil
castaneda knocked senseless and abandoned
charlie and i concur with him we will
send this man away so soon as he can stand
the four days walk in the meantime we
will keep silent about the dry-washer nbt
wishing to bring a horde of greaser gdld-
seekers down on our simangito friends or on
ourselves	y
  dec -castafieda has been sentaway
he bitterly objected to the blmfoid but
submitted sullenly when he saw that re-
sistance was useless to-day ma-uat-ipl
found a nugget weighing six ounces she
had gone up a little red canyonv to- dig
edible roots for dinner she found one of
the plants she sought growing in the vety
bed of the wash digging dswfifor the
root she struck bed-rock and this beautiful
nugget ahtu and i are going bafk with
her to-morrow taking a shovel a pick and
a gold-pan
  dec -talk about luck mrscharlie
is a brown replica of the goddessulfirself
the gulch is rich rich beyond our fondest
hopes-rich as - we move the dry-
washer over in the morning when charlie
saw our cleanup five pans he said jack
if dat-greaser know what we do here
we get all de - yellow cut-troat from
other side
  that is unfortunately true charlie
said i but i couldnt have him killed like
a beef thief and liar though he be
  seeing the wrinkles of apprehension on
charlies brow ma-hat-mi rose silently
filled his pipe and brought it to him a live
coal neatly balanced on top of the tobacco
she has most white ladies looking like thirty
cents-and even her smallpox marks become
her of late
  dec iq-we have taken out  pounds of
gold in the last three days  per pound
multiplied by -just thinly of it
we are searching for the ledge it eroded
from although most old miners claim that
coarse placer seldom or never comes from a
vein in this instance they eem to be borne
adventuring in tiburon
out by the facts our gulch is short steep
and bare from where we are working on up
the hill from there up the rocks of the
sidehills are simply barren and rotten
schist bedrock a hundred yards below the
machine our gulch debouches into the great
dry-wash where the bed-rock is buried
under hundreds of feet of sand pebbles and
boulders as it now stands our rich chan-
nel is being buried deeper and deeper at
every foot that we mine downhill up the
gulch there is neither earth nor gold-only
the bare rotten schist
  dec -gosh-wii and ah-chit-weh are
back they report that they left castaneda
in sight of encinal they took him to the
top of the last sand ridge and told him to
git
  did he try to follow you back i asked
  no said gosh-wa he no come
  that night ahtu said to me if my
brother will promise not to be angry i will
give him some news when i promised he
continued when gosh-wi and ah-chit-
deh took the mexican away they saw that
hiheart was bad for he had secretly made
sfriall hfcles in his bandage so that he could
see the trail when they started gosh-wa
had ten arrows in his quiver and ah-chit-
weh twelve gosh-wil returned with nine
arrows and ah-chit-weh with ten we
sjmp-ngitos are careful of our arrows since
straight stems are very scarce we recover
the arrows when we shoot game we de-
stroy them when a man dies or when we
slay an enemy
  i am sorry to hear this ahtu said i
 vet at the same time it may be for the best
since tjascsda was as you say an evil
man	--
dec -this is christmas day
we have made a great feast and i
have told the indians the story of
the death of the christ they said that
they had heard this story long ago from
their fathers who had heard it from mission
priests they had not believed the story
however since if god had the power he
need not have slain his son when his sim-
plest wish would have made all men good
they were content with the religion of their
fathers since the story of tse-huh and
the  great turtle  seemed more reasonable
  jan -our rich streak is worked out as
far as the heavy overburden will permit if
we had asteam hoist timbers and heavy

                  
 boards we would attempt to go under thfi
 deep sands of the great dry-wash as it
 now stands it would be courting death
 to attempt it our rich dirt has spoiled us
 for the i-a-day diggings so we are going
 to leave here and look for the rich pearl- 
 bank castaneda told of we have told pie
 indians and they are very sad ahtu and
 his younger brother to-we are going with
 us where you go i go said ahtu mrs
 ahtu and mrs charles kanaka are out on 
 the ridge howling mournfully under the
 stars the grief of mrs ahtu is in a minor
 while that of ma-hat-mf is g major fioth
 ladies are like mrs noah-they want to go
 in the boat
ill	
jan -twenty and two simangifcos
 sat dejectedly on the beach as we
 rowed the boat out into the offing
 mrs ahtu and mrs charlie kanaka ran
 distractedly up and down the beach making
 the air resound to their cries i steered the
 boat and charlie pulled the oars ahtu and
 to-wee sat stoically silent in the bow all
 at once charlie dropped the oars and stood
 erect he was much affected for tmce he
 started to call to his indian wife and twice
 his voice broke tell her ahtu that i am
 coming back to her to stay said charlie
 in a choked voice ahtu stood up and
 putting his hands to his mouth gave a
 peculiar call both women were at once
 silent listening with strained attention
   ahtu now called tothe women that
charlie said he would surely come back to
ma-hat-m and that when he came back it
 wold be to stay
   ma-hat-mi now ran into the water and
 cried out joyfully charlow say come
 back charlow no lie him come me wait 
 she then turned back to ahtus wife and
 began to comfort her an hour later all the
 small black specks on the beach climbed the
 face of the cliff and disappeared
   jan -we are unable to find the good
 bank of pearls we have cruised as far
 south as the animas and san lorenzo is-
 lands yet have taken only ten inferior
 pearls the pearl oysters are plentiful but
 they are fat and hearty to-we took a
 fine pearl yesterday a blue-black one worth
 perhaps  we are going to look for a
 harbor on the east side of san lorenzo island
 hoping that on the reefs we may do better

adventure
    jan -to-day charlie made a kill on
  a large shark- la kanaka we were an-
  chored over a reef and ahtu to-wee and
  myself were diving for the shells while
  charlie was opening them the rocks of the
  reef were thick with shells yet they were
  depressingly healthy and hence free from
  poftl ahtu and i sat naked on the bow
  taking a blow and rest when to-wee dived
  for the rocks underneath we saw his
  streak go down to the bottom charlie
  tat naked smoking and opening the pearls
  with a long knife all at once he spit out
  his pipe and dived for the boy i then saw
  she shark i grabbed a harpoon and poised
  it for a throw but before i could cast
  charlie was alongside the sharks upturned
   belly i saw a sudden whorl under the
  water then the shark shot up into the air
  with a great rip in his belly to-wee and
  charlie came up together the first sputter-
  ing with fear the latter cursing because his
  pipe had gone overboard
    the-pipe is black said charlie
  the-reef is also black now it vill be
  ---to fine dat pipe
     well after repeated dips we found it but
   we took no more shell that day
     tbfitfhell of the pearl-oyster is from four
   to seven inbes across the base or hinge
   of the shell is aat straight line from which
   ihe body of the shejaulges like three quar-
   ters of a full moon the pearl is found
   either in the stomach of he oyster or in its
   outer feeding-fringe in te first case the
   pearl is likely to be large andustrous in the
   latter small aid  less meat not over
   one pearl in a humred has a nape perfect
   enough to give it much value at one side
   of the hinge a tuft of coarse horaua
   like tentacle protrudes from the inside of the
   shell it is with this coarse hair-like ten-
   tacle that the oyster adheres to his native
   rocks a large oyster will test the strength
   of a strong man to dislodge his hold a sud-
   den quick jerk will do the job however so
   soon as the knack of jerking under water is
   learned there are tricks in all trades even
   under the water
    jan -we took a hunt to-day on san
  lorenzo island as pete kitchen says it
  was chiefly a hunt-and a-pore ketch 
   a few seagulls gave us a mournful ha-ha as
   we passed them outside of this it was
   chiefly a rattlesnake hunt the island is
   full of them and how they got there is a job
   for a philadelphia lawyer either they
must a swum or the island was once
part of the mainland saint pathrick is
badly needed on san lorenzo once clear
of snakes it would make a great place for
an irish picnic and an orange-catholic
affair of great spirit could be arranged if
hand-sized rocks mean anything after
due reflection i withdraw the above as
whisky is as scarce as true charity between
society ladies coming back we found an
old camp and some human bones from the
gold-filling in the teeth of the skull we
thought it must be the skull of a white man
poor devil i suppose a rattler bit him
  jan -we have had four dreadful days
of rain and wind time after time i thought
we were gone and but for charlies fine sea-
manship and our faithful bailing we should
be with the fishes we have four lives and
 in gold aboard so it would be a
double pity to swamp in a storm i am
tired beyond words
  jan -we are short of drinking water
the storm battered our water-cans until
some of them have holes in them we have
only four great cans that are still water-
tight we are now four drinkers in lieu of
two the storm blew us across the gulf and
left us at the southern end of tiburon island
we are now beating up the channel between
the island and the sonora coast the wind
is good but a fierce tide is running against
us so tiiat for the last few hours we are at
a standstill if the wind holds we ought to
get north like an express when the tide
changes our way
  we have seen several seri indians who
seem to be watching us from the cliffs of
their island ahtu declares that-nese in-
dians arranafhlki anumat they are treach-
erous and cruel beyond words this is un-
fortunate news since we are compelled to
land on the north end of the island for water
the chart shows no other water within one
hundred miles so we must take the risk if
they buzz around us too close we will try
some of dr colts and dr winchesters
pills on them
  jan -we are now exactly opposite the
spot where the chart shows fresh water
we have also divided the last sup of water
at breakfast we held a council of war and
decided to land for water and take chances
we cant get back to the coast of lower
california at vistado bay for the wind is
dead in the west if we keep on north for
the colorado river a change of wind may
adventuring in tiburon

become a head-wind and so cause us to
perish of thirst so we have resolved to
land since we might as well die fighting as
die of thirst ahtu has just seen a squaw
come out of a clump of brush with a water-
ed on her head this may be a decoy to
lead us into a trap anyway here goes-
for water or a row or water and a row
jan -well we had the row
ahtu has two bullet-wounds one in
the flesh of the shoulder and a glanc-
ing shot in the head i think his skull is
very hard charlie is shot twice in the
same leg if god ever made a brave and
devoted man ahtu is one here is how it
happened ahtu and i being the best
shots we acted as guards for to-we and
charlie who were hurriedly to fill the cans
ahtu took the - and i took the -
  we waded ashore and each took a high
knoll of sand on either side of the water-
hole seeing no seri indians we waved for
charlie and to-we to come on with the
cans charlie carried two of the good five-
gallon cans and the - carbine to-wee
came behind him with the other two good
cans and the three canteens he also
brought an iron pot to fill with to-wee
was unarmed
  just as charlie and to-wee began to fill
thecans we vere fired on by concealed
sens who lay  some scrub brush about one
hundred yards away ahtu called to me
to watch on my right i turned just in time
to see a big seri buck aiming at me-not
over thirty yards away i ducked as he
fired then shot him in the mouth he fell
flat at the shot lying sprawled on the sand
with the whole back of his head blown out
by the bullet to-wee shouted and run-
ning over amid a shower of bullets got his
gun-a  winchester carbine seeing this
the serfs yelled and rushed us losing four
more men in this rush they wounded ahtu
in the shoulder and charlie in the right leg
  when the serfs broke for cover charlie
and to-wee began hastily filling the cans
just as these were nearly full they began
yelling again and opened a hot fire this
time they broke charlies wounded leg with
another shot we could see numbers of the
indians hastening down from the high
ground to reenforce those who were engaged
with us to-wee now ran to the boat with
two full cans and returned for more char-
lie was unable to stand but sat grimly on
the sand pumping lead at the brush to-
we now secured the other two cans and
again ran for the boat
  this left charlie and three full canteens
at the spring seeing that charlie could
not walk ahtu ran down shouldered char-
lie took up the three canteens and stared
staggering for the boat at this the sfclis
rushed again yelling and firing like devils
ahtu now set charlie down on the sand and
both men began firing on the serfs ahur 
was now struck in the head falling to the
ground i ran from my knoll to succor the
two men on the ground but before i got
there ahtu rose up and killed the nearest
seri i here upset two serfs in succession
and they again broke for cover
  ahtu picked up charlie once more while
i took the three canteens thus we reached
the boat and put out under a heavy fire
from the brush to-wee and i now set the
mainsail and we were soon out of range i
gave to-wee the tiller and began to look
after the wounded i tore up two shirts
bandaged charlies bleeding leg and made
him as comfortable as i could ahtu had
fainted from loss of blood and his heroic over-
exertion but i gave him some hot coffee and
this brought him to as i bathed arl
dagiiwuncls i saw hir weakly smiling
 what in the-are you grinning about 
i asked him
  we killed many of them and we are all
alive he answered
  to-we was the most dejected man of the
lot a perverse demon seemed to have
entered his savage sou at supper he
refused to eat what is the matter with
you  i asked he replied that he was an
old squaw since he had not slain an enemy
he deplored the fact that he did not know
how to hit with a rifle had i had my
bow and quiver of arrows  could tell a
better story said he i first chided him
then complimented him on his valor saying
that but for his coolness and devotion to
duty we would all have been slain at this
he brightened up and ate a hearty meal
jan  - ahtu is much better
youth and a stout heart are helping
him recover at a bound his wounds
were only flesh-wounds and while he is
weak and a bit feverish he is getting well
fast i am wetting the bandages of both
men with sea-water though salt and pain-
ful i believe it does their wounds good

adventure
charlie is in great pain and is slightly de-
lirious at times i am afraid that his age
and severe wounds are going to give him a
hard rub so i am much distressed for old
charlie is a fine man this morning to-we
said that if i would land on the sonora coast
he would get good medicine he was gone
inland about an hour returning with a
squat fleshy shrub which we pounded up
and applied to the wounds we also made
tea of it and gave it to them to drink it
seemed to refresh them very much espe-
cially charlie
  jan -i have been too busy and tired
to write much diary ahtu while still
weak and sore is otherwise well i tend
charlie constantly for he is very ill he is
out of his head most of the time at such
limes he talks kanaka of which we can not
understand a word if his wounds dont
gangrene i think we are going to save him
the wind is from the northwest and we are
making slow but steady progress for the
mouth of the colorado a storm now
would be fatal to poor charlie we have re-
filled the cans from a swamp near the beach
we boil this water and it is drinkable
  feb -no sign of gangrene yet he has
iesr feverhan any day this week i believe
he is going to live and i am overjoyed ac-
cordingly ahtu now takes his turn at
tilings and this lightens my load so that i can
get a little sleep to-wee is a fine boy but
there is no one like ahtu for he is a man-
a man the wind has shifted to the south-
west and we are making great headway
we ought to sight montague island to-
night or in the morning
  feb -we are now thank the lord safe
and sound in shipyard slough and have
plenty of water to drink charlie is per-
fectly clear-headed but very weak poor
devil he has suffered the tortures of the
damned but he is a game old cock and takes
his medicine like a stoic he says that his
leg is numb so we rub it gently every few
hours i am sending to-wee with the skiff
to try to find old dominguezs ranch the
sloughs are many and crooked but if he has
luck he may stumble on the right one i
have warned him about the bore or tide-rip
so that he wont get caught and drowned
  feb -to-wee is back but could not find
the ranch ahtu will look after charlie
to-morrow while to-wee and i have an-
other try for the ranch i wonder if the
burkes made it across on foot burdened as
 they were with bed-roll and rifles one
 wrong step in the bottomless mud of one of
 these sloughs would preserve one for future
 ages of geologists they could then argue
 even more than the present day wiseacres
 they might class frank burkes skull as
 neolithic or paleolithic but petes would
 come under the class of plain bone-head
 frank insisted that he knew the tide-flats
 and if that was true the chances are that he
 made it all  k
   feb -we are just back from the ranch
 old dominguez is a kind old sow but he is
 the-est liar this side of hades most
 greasers are natural born liars but old
 dominguez is a liar by heredity education
 practise inclination general principles and
 mendicitis he props his fat belly up in
 the shade and starts early in the morning
 he knows where there are tons of buried
 treasure he has the cinch on  lostmines 
 that are pure gold-each vein being a mile
 wide and an inch long well anyway
 i bought a bottle of brandy from him
 some milk and some sagu this ought to
 strengthen old charlie wonderfully
   a cocopah indian at the ranch told me
 that frank burke was dead and that
 pete was now town marshall of yuma
 he said also that it was rumored in yuma
 that charlie and i had been drowned by the
 bore charlie and i are not drowned by a
 -sight he may wind up shy a leg but
 he has a fine stake of gold to keep him and
 if he needs it he can have my share as well
 as his own dominguez says that a young
 new york doctor is up in the bottoms hunt-
 ing for deer i have sent the cocopah with 
 letter begging him to come down and at-
 tend to charlie
   feb -the doctor  was not a doctor
 he was ah unfortunate tenderfoot  lunger
 out here trying to prolong his consumpted
 life a few more years old dominguez had
 seen his cartload of medicine bottles and
 had drawn his usual correct conclusion if
 he should ever happen to tell the truth it
 would be instantly fatal to him
   we have sent over to the nearest cocopah
 village to hire four bucks to row and tow us
 up to yuma it will be-going through
 the mosquito-belt the next few days com-
 ing down-stream with the current and every-
 body well and hearty is very different from
 bucking the river with a sick man
   feb -the four cocopah bucks are here
 we are to feed them and pay them twenty-
adventuring in tiburon

 five dollars for the trip they say that they
 can make it in four days as there is a
 strong wind blowing in from the gulf i
 think it will be wise to sail up as far as we
 can charlie seems morally encouraged at
 his nearness to a good doctor one of the
 wounds is well the other is continually
 suppurating and his leg pains him all the
 time he has had a hard time with three
 rude but willing nurses we are all cheer-
 sul and hoping the best for him
  feb -we are now more than half way
up to yuma i sent a runner to yuma to
get a doctor to meet us at la grulla if he
comes we wall take him aboard and send
his horse back by the indian runner the
mosquitoes are very bad our faces are bitten
terribly these naked indians do not seem
to mind them in the least and their skins are
as tough as bull-hide our best relief from
the mosquitoes is obtained by daubing our
hands and faces with a thick layer of soft
river-mud this seems either to fool them
or their bills can not reach through to the
skin this towing up-stream is slow and
irksome traveling a little more patience
feb -doctor heffernan is here
he says that charlies leg will have
to be operated on he has sand and
pieces of broken bone is thewoysd and they
must be removed lie thinks the leg will be
ssved afchough charlie will always have a
slight limp charlie is pleased that he
wont lose the leg and says that a limpy is
better than a peg-leg
  ahtu to-day licked one of the cocopah
bucks because of a fancied disrespect to me
the cocopah buck was grinning and making
what ahtu considered insulting gestures in
my direction quick as a flash ahtu was
at him with a stick of driftwood knocking
him silly with a terrific blow i stopped the
row and when explanations were made it
turned out that the indian was describing
a row he had had with another cocopah
some months before i scolded ahtu for
overzealousness gave the cocopah a dollar
and so salved the broken peace
 feb -yuma at last the boys all
came down to greet the wanderers and lend
a helping hand shaunnessy came in person
and brought a felicitous quart which being
mountain dew lasted the crowd about as
long as a puff of smoke charlie was car-
ried up to the hospital and the many sympa-
thizing friends were not thinned out by the
sight of the bags of gold-dust we de-
posited this at the express office and cleaned
up for a restful loaf money is a great thing
to tune the human heart to lively sympathy
-with the possessor this may sound like
cynicism-yet i have ever noted that the
sorrows of the unfortunate poor are likelyjlo
fall on dull ears
  ahtu and to-wee were the recipients of
much kindly curiosity which as i saw it
offended ahtu i firmly put a stop to he
to-wee and i are to live together in my old
dobe shack in easy reach of the hospital
the old santa maria was hauled up on the
bank for a coat of paint and a general fixing
up she is a stanch boat and can stand
many another trip down the river
  mar -i went down this morning to
see them off the santa maria was loaded
down to the guards with grub and presents
for tomas ma-hat-ml mrs ahtu and the
rest of the simangitos ahtu has refused
food these last two days and has cut off his
hair in sign of mourning at leaving me i
have promised him that some day i will
come and pay him another visit to-we
has two new rifles and cartridges galore he
is all fuss and fine feathers-a perfect pea-
cock of a dandy he boasted to me that if
ne ever fpught again he woud shoot kill
many the young ladies of the simangi-
tos may now prepare for the heartache
since this proud young savage is becoming a
gay lothario
  charlie is entirely well save for a slight
limp that he will always have to remind him
of tiburon he said to jpe jack i now
pretty soon been old i never go back to
honolulu ma-hat-ml a good vooman an 
lak her plenty
  i am sorely tempted to drop all else and
go with them-but i am of another race and
another world of men an occasional lapse
back into primitive life is good for the soul
however and some day if god is willing
i	will go to them for a time
  the parting from ahtu is a bitter thing
for me sophists may assert that there can
be no true love and sympathy between the
indian and the anglo-saxon that this is
untrue is proved by the great affection and
perfect trust between this savage youth and
myself under the dark skin of this primi-
tive man dwells a soul that is truth itself
and between this soul and mine own there is
a bond of love-strong as the promise of
god may god go with them

sweeny his brother-in-law proprietor of
a doubtful hotel where bed could be had
for five ten and fifteen cents had refused
him shelter ihis shoes had great reas in 
them through which trie water sloshed in
and out and the crown of his limp black
hat several sizes too large for him occasion-
ally overflowed sending a cascade of dirty
black water down his back
  never in all his years along the water-
front could he remember when there was
not at least one drunk to be rolled but
now even this was denied him no vinous
sailor-man staggered into his snares pedes-
trians kept their coats tightly buttoned
over illusive gleams of gold watches even
shop-girls hurrying down gloomy streets
displayed no gaudy jingling purses fate
made sport of the wise one the biter was
bitten the hunter hunted denny was
broke
  out of the darkness a blue-coated arm
suddenly shot fingers clutched his shoulder
the arm belonged to billy mcshane the
fingers to a hand he had many times crossed
with pieces of silver this time the hand
was not greedy but was the embodiment
of the law-of all that was fearful of a
black wagon of clanging doors of bars and
brutal treatment
  denny wiggled away with a convulsive
rat
i g h t
movement leaving a goodly portion of his
coat with the officer half-way across the
street he paused to heap upon the offend-
ing head all the choice assortment of vile-
ness he had picked up in his thirty-odd
years billy mcshane waved a friendly
hand and nodded some day the rat
would pay for this they both knew it and
worked up to a frenzy of fear and hatred
denny xmvtinivu- to express his opinion of
the other until thinking tile joke had gone
far enough the policeman raised his wiiisue
to his lips with that denny vanished
  seated in an alley where the raindrops
seemed neither so large nor so cold he took
counsel with himself then as fully born
as venus from her sea-foam an idea sprang
into his mind
  under its watery dirt his face paled a
trifle what he was about to do was a brave
thing many men who did not deserve the
appellation of rat or whose eyes were not
set so close together would have hesitated
but for the moment between the gnawing
at his belly and the goose-flesh on his skin
he was no longer the timid scavenger whc
pokes his nose fearfully about in the dark
that part of his nature which craved food
tobacco alcohol was in the ascendency
he turned the project carefully over in his
mind then rising quickly made his way
to grogans saloon
  the barkeeper was in the act of drink-
ing a glass at a hospitable strangers ex-
pense he paused to glare angrily at the
intruder
the
g

denny the rat

  back again he snarled reaching for
ihe bung-starter at any other time denny
would have fled but for the present he was
completely obsessed with his great idea
with his hand he made a motion well un-
derstood between the two the barkeeper
gave in sullenly as if sorry to lose the op-
portunity of using his weapon the thief
slipped quietly into a back room after a
long time the garrulous stranger finished
his drink and departed denny drew a
deep breath and eyed the barkeeper stonily
across the sloppy table
  gimme a poice o poiper-none o
yere dirty pad cully-an enwelop and a
stamp now chase yerself this is me busy
day
  grogans night helper rose reluctantly
this was not the man he knew come to
bully he found himself relegated to the
position of servant nevertheless he went
such is the dominance of a splendid con-
ception 
  the material at hand the rat wrote
with many blotches laborious lip-spelling
of words and hunching of elbows with
his letter finally finished safe in the en-
velope and addressed he rose to face the
bartender leaning over his shoulder that
worthy stretched out a soft white hand
  come in and have a dram he said
and ill wrap you up a pint
  where youse goin to stay he asked
when the drink was gone now ive got
a cot he added tentatively if you
think- and the rat said he did think
in rather a bored tone for he was still under
the spell of his great idea
by the time denny awoke on his
bravely earned cot the missive was
in the hands of the chief of police
and while it may have caused intense ex-
citement in that individuals pouter-pigeon
breast he displayed no undue elation graft
is a delicate thing a butterfly whose gold-
powdered wings must be brushed ever so
gently the chief therefore having pon-
dered long and thoughtfully pushed a but-
ton and gave a careless order affairs of
importance should be hid under a bushel
  a little later denny somewhat tremulous
at having to invade this holy of holies en-
tered the nights rest had not done him
good twelve hours of contemplation had
weakened his nerve for the deed he was
about to do sat uncomfortably upon his
cowardly nature he sidled crabwise to a
chair and clutching his limp black hat
watched the chiefs movements appre-
hensively the latter without looking up
passed him the letter to read
   denny in a quavering voice began
 he wondered greatly at himself-where he
 a robber of drunks snatcher of womens
 purses purloiner of fat mens watches ever
 conceived the hardihood to formulate such
 a plan
   the chiefs attitude toward him had as
 subtly changed as had the barkeepers
 there was just a spark of contempt in his
 eyes where denny had been accustomed to
 find a blaze also-which- warmed the
 cockles of his heart-there was a little hint
 of respect which he thought due him now
 he was in a fair way of becoming a desper-
 ate character alas denny it was only
 the fear of rubbing the dust from the but-
 terflys wings
   however not being given to self-analysis
 his chest took on an arch not unlike the-
 chiefs own he felt that fate so long ad-
 verse was beginning to relent
   the note read something like this
   honored sir-yu kant find who has wrote thi
 unjes-yugimme yure word not to prose-p fer past
 -offenses	tried tc jiuii me last night as a
 vag also im wanted on a charge of dipping gim-
 me a clean bill an  put yu wise on how to katch
 larry lackmore we done several jobs together
 and got another framed up i want haf the money
 five hundred plunks pass the woid to grogans
 nite man if yu mean biz signed a friend p s this
 is no bum steer
   did you write that asked the chief
   i aint no dip protested the rat ve-
 hemently
   lets put it this way said the chief
 diplomatically could you put your hand
 on the man who did write it
   denny thought that under certain con-
 ditions he might be able to find him the
 agreement having reached a point where as
 the law has it  there is a meeting of minds
 they proceeded amicably
ii
larry lackmore as he was
known at that time was a peculiar
if not eccentric character bom of
rich and influential parents he chose vol-
untarily to espouse a career of crime and
strange as it may seem his success in this

adventure
new line of endeavor had been even
greater than that he had achieved as
a cotillion leader he was a thorn in
the side of the police of two continents
-an irritating thom which not only
refused to be removed but which gave
notice every time it was going to rob
the social body of a bit of its precious
cuticle
  instead of eschewing the light larry
seemed to take a malicious delight in turn-
ing his tricks under the sun of public no-
tice he invariably warned his victims a
detail which in no wise interfered with his
getting what he went after many people
laid this down to an inordinate vanity
and predicted his speedy capture larry
claimed it was the one straight rule in a
crooked game
  at first the public howled while the police
raved to the country at large it was a
tremendous joke on the thick-headed min-
ions of the law larry slipped through all
the traps set for him like a greased pig at a
country picnic
  there was one more tiring which should
have made larry an easy capture for
every operation that netted him a clear
ten thousand dollars he changed his name
rhesg	were alluring allitefstfobs
the byrd diamonds had - disappeared from
their resting-place in the vault by the aid
of adair atkinson the commercial se-
curity company had been filched under
the name of bamaby blackstone denny
had assisted one culberson crothers in the
matter of a few old paintings according
to larry it was a short cut to bookkeep-
ing he had only to count how many
letters his name was from a multiply
it by ten and he had the number of thou-
sands he possessed anything over the
len-thousand limit and the results of his
smaller operations went for cigarettes and
tips
  by counting from a to l you get
the figure twelve it is thus easy to see
that larry was on velvet to the extent of
one hundred and twenty thousand dollars
the public being able to solve this simple
problem arrived at the same conclusion
their howls of laughter changed to roars
of rage and like a thunderstorm on a high
peak the conflict raged about the chief of
police no wonder then the grimy little
sneak thief appeared to him in the guise
of an angel
  larry was again in need of assist-
  ance and being by nature a master-
  ful man preferred that his helper
  should be as feeble an instrument as pos-
  sible to this end he turned to the rat
  on whose unquestioned obedience he was
  depending
    in the holland house every afternoon a
  very rich and very stingy old man could
  always be found his name doesnt mat-
  ter-we will call him the millionaire in
  a way he too was nature-twisted his
  money had been made by sly schemes
  broken promises betrayed friendships his
  skating on the ice of the law had been
  wrong but not illegal a writ had no ter-
  rors for him but something else had his
  conscience made him fearful of others so
  it was that the remark of a casual stranger
  would send him back into his shell like a
  frightened mud-turtle
    he had only one failing there reposed
  always in his pocket like an amulet a
  thick leather wallet and rumor had it that
  this never contained a less amount than
  the sum necessary for larry to choose an-
  other alias
    how the plan was to be worked the rai
  had not been told dressed as a chauffeur
  on the drop of a handkerchief he was to
  ilifean mr lackmore that the car was wait-
  ing the two millionaire and burglar
  would leave the hotel arm in arm they
  would be driven far out in the country
  here on some pretext he was to leave
  them for this the rat was to receive
  two hundred dollars but this was the fly
  in the ointment the money hinged on the
  contingency of the plans being successful
    denny had some improvements to offer
  instead of taking the direct route to the
  country he would circle around by the
  police station it was then a simple matter
  for him to toot his horn and jam on the
  brakes the rest of the performance inter-
  ested him little
     out in the sunlight with the crisp rustle
  of bills in his pocket the rat sighed almost
  happily what danger could there be
  for once he was with the law not against
  it its forces were at his back to help
  even billy mcshane lost something of his
  fearful aspect the chief had assured him
  that larry would get at least twenty-five
  years and what might not happen in
  twenty-five summers and winters
    he had long had his eye on a little to-
denny the rat

  bacco-shop the five hundred would make
   it his and then there was a girl even if
  she hated him she was a good girl and
  would obey her mother mercury pro-
  tector of nimble-fingered rogues enveloped
  his head in rosy clouds
ill
 in the holland house one after-
 noon two gentlemen were seated
 side by side they were evidently
 strangers for they did not speak pres-
 ently the younger one after puffing sev-
 eral times on a dead cigar asked his
 neighbor for a light the millionaire for
 it was he smiled disagreeably and was
 about to refuse but somehow he didnt
 he searched in his pocket and brought
 forth a dirty little pine stick with just a
 tinge of red on one end it was not much
 of a match as matches go in the pocket
 of a millionaire it was a crying offense
   as might have been expected the match
 flickered feebly and went out the younger
 man turned around and talked his words
 were not such as the holland house is ac-
 customed to hear they were not directed
 toward the unoffending lucifer but toward
 the man who would carry such a-article
 larry then stalked solemnly to the cigar-
 stand lighted his cigar and returned to his
 seat
   the millionaire was charmed he had
 never had any one talk to him like that
 to his mind it represented the quintessence
 of what he most desired-disinterestedness
 the words themselves fell from his back
 like water from a ducks like achilles he
 had only the one vulnerable spot and his
 heel was in his pocketbook at last he
 had found a man who wanted nothing
 this was no beggar for a philanthropic
 cause no soft-voiced confidence man
   an apology for the match and the two
 jell into conversation the millionaire had
 a hobby like most of us two in fact-
 books and municipal improvements he
 thought every city should be beautiful
 to this end he would abolish the ugly
 the poor and ugly going together he would
 abolish the poor likewise the laboring
 class could be allowed to enter the city at
 daybreak having done their work they
 should be driven out
 larry while hating him agreed he
 went one step further he thought all poor
should be isolated in some sort of colony
such as lepers have this idea met with
the millionaires instant approval
  over a cocktail they talked of books-
larry paying for the drinks and showing
a vaster knowledge than the millionaires
own towardthe close of the afternoon
they had another drink and some cigars
for which the millionaire was too slow in
finding his change the rat transformed
into a monkey stiffly informed larry that
de car was woitin larry graciously
offered the millionaire a lift the mil-
lionaire as gracefully accepted it was
something for nothing why not
  in the luxury of the car larry momen-
tarily allowed former suspicions to be lulled
to rest it had seemed too easy like
many successful young men he was too
prone to self-confidence he forgot his
own teaching-in time of greatest ap-
parent security to be most vigilant but
his eyes ached from the study of civil im-
provement the spring air was soft and
balmy holding more than a hint of radiant
summer the macadam smelled as though
freshly boiled the car scarcely bounced
at all the millionaires raucous voice
seemed softened a little he would be very
gentle with the old man when he took his
money
  the rat too was not such a bad sort-
sneaky of course and would bear watching
but he had played his part fairly well he
would give him three hundred instead of
the promised two after that he would gc
away new york was no place for a gen-
tleman in summer he was scarcely aware
of his companions saying now my idea
of a model municipality-or of his own
vague answer when the car came to a sud-
den stop
  he saw the rat leap from his seat and
run to the shelter of a massive gray build-
ing heard the millionaires protest and felt
those hands at which he had so often jeered
seize him and drag him out	i
  instantly his old-time alertness returned
he thought for a minute of trying to bluff
it out until he saw denny talking with the j
sergeant then he knew he had been be-
trayed he suffered peaceably the two
officers to take his arms and lead him inside
with only a backward glance at the avenue
deepening into purple twilight the low-
bodied car panting eagerly to be off the
millionaire gesticulating wildly and denny

adventure
his twisted soul showing through his
crooked lips going into the chiefs office
to receive his blood-money
  it takes a thief to catch a thief and larry
was caught red-handed all his money
won under so many fascinating nom-de-
plumes could only help his work how-
ever had been clever and they could con-
vict him on but one count so for ten years
the light of heaven was denied to larry
lackmore the great gate clanged for the
last time on a slim elegant figure the
prison barber shaved an aristocratic head
and larry became number 
iv
-as the ten years had come and gone
gffijf and denny the rat sat sipping beer
at his old table at grogans the
night bartender might have been but
wasnt the same at all events the table
seemed to be it was in its old condition
of sloppiness flies crawled stickily over thin
streams of beer the windows were no less
dirty outside it was wet again gust after
gust of wind and rain swept through the
narrow alley
  time had dealt gently with the rat he
was a little more bald a little more weasely
a little more despicable his thinness was
accentuated by a slightly protruding
paunch in other respects he remained
unchanged his calling was even the same
the water-front was still his home drunken
sailors still his prey but the years were
neither so lean nor so hard for with the five
hundred dollars he had purchased the
tobacco store and the woman the one
flourished the other lived merely because
of necessity
  there entered with a whirlwind of rain
and sleet a workingman very far gone in
the matter of liquor the barkeeper eyed
denny and denny eyed the barkeeper
then the latters hand strayed from his
bottle of knockout drops and substituted a
bottle of whisky it seemed extravagance
to waste dope on one so nearly down
  the workingman lurching heavily
brought up against the bar at the same
time awkwardly brushing back his hat the
head thus displayed was close cropped
denny knew what that meant and prepared
to go to sleep but the man paid for his
drink out of a handful of crumpled bills
one of these unnoticed slid to the floor
it was a twenty the man then pushed
open the swinging doors and disappeared
into the night
  instantly denny was after him pausing
only long enough to pick up the bill and
throw it to the bartender he would claim
his share of it later for the present duty
was urging him on
  the swaying figure was far down the
street before its pursuer caught up with it
and then he had to fall back destiny
directed the wavering footsteps through
lighted streets ill fitted for the black-jack
nursed carefully in the rats pocket but
he had learned patience with age not for a
second did he allow his quarry to be lost
to view there were few people about and
these between the rain and minding their
own business gave scant attention to the
two the chase led up one street and down
another but finally the man veered toward
the harbor denny seeing his time ap-
proaching crept closer
  denny picked out the spot on the mans
head where the blow was to fall in pre-
vious years he would have gaged its
force taking into consideration his victims
lack of hair but while the years had
brought him caution concerning his own
skin it had likewise brought with it that
callousness of spirit always found in those
who prey upon their fellows between a
dead man and an unconscious one there is
but a slight step
  so denny drew closer intent on nothing
but the blow in the shadow of a dingy
warehouse the man suddenly stopped
wheeled and closed with his pursuer there
was a slight scuffle a slighter squeal of fear
and rage and the rat found himself picked
up in strong arms with a heavy hand on
his windpipe he had no choice but to obey
the hoarse command for silence
  a few yards away a catboat tied fast to
the wharf lay tossing in the water thither
with steady steps quite at variance with
his former erratic movements the drunken
man carried his burden once aboard he
deposited him in the cabin and without ex-
planation sought the deck denny could
hear the ropes being cast off the creak of
blocks and felt the gentle swaying of the
boat
  soon the movement grew stronger and
he knew they were beating out of the har-
bor the night was a hard one its force
in the alley was magnified a hundredfold
denny the rat

on the water by peering out of a small
window he could see the lights of the city
gradually fade from view several times
they passed ships anchored in the roadway
and he strained his lungs to make them hear
his cry for help but none answered the
wind roughly threw the words back in his
face as contemptuously as he had listened
to his victims cries there was something
malicious about the way it forced his breath
back on him something malicious and yet
disdainful as though he were of no more
account than a withered autumn leaf
  later by the dangerous rocking of the
little craft he knew they were out on the
ocean swift-driven foam cut his cheeks
spume and the fear of death forced him
back to a corner where he squatted close
to the floor his twisted lips drew back
over his yellow teeth for all the world like a
rat in a trap why any one should want to
kidnap him he did not know but remem-
bering the wrongs he had done in the past
denny was afraid
sat twelve oclock die catboat
came to anchor his captor de-
scended and having first taken his
weapons bound his eyes and led him on
deck then he felt himself being lifted
over the side the water crept from his
knees to his waist from his waist to his
shoulders it was cold and he cried out
again and again with the water lapping
ms neck the inexorable pressure down-
ward was withdrawn he found himself
resting easily in the water supported by
his hands on the gunnel the bandage was
whipped from his eyes and denny the rat
found himself confronted with a face he had
condemned to a ten years death
  he did not cry out again his tongue was
glued to the roof of his mouth his brain lay
dormant in the minute they looked into
each others eyes he could think of nothing
but the change wrought in the countenance
above him the sharp features clean-cut
as a thoroughbreds had broadened and
coarsened in place of the cool tolerance
through which larry had viewed the world
there was a bigoted passion for one idea
the lips were as thin as before but the
years of imprisonment had straightened their
bow if anything they curved downward
with a cruel sweep wrinkles of laughter
had been replaced by creases of suffering
the unnecessary suffering that sours the
heart between them denny and the
prison had achieved a miracle-they had
turned a man into a beast
  denny said larry at length and the
rat trembled more at the sound of that
half-forgotten voice than he had at the
touch of the cold water here is where
you and i square accounts if i punished
you as you deserved youd die by slow tor-
ture drowning is an easy death they
say he clutched the thin shoulders and
twisting him fiercely around pointed to
some lights in the distance
  that is shore said larry it is
three miles away and you cant make it in
this sea you swim on and on and on at
first it wont be so hard but later with
every stroke you will sink lower in the
water your arms will weaken first then
your legs you will turn on your back and
float but always you will grow weaker
every second of the time you will think
youll remember each time you have seen
me from the first to the last you will
recall i always treated you square the
faces of the men you have knocked on the
head will haunt you and then my dear
friend denny water will creep up and into
your mouth you will sputter and strug-
gle maybe even scream a little your chest
will sput with agony and then dear dear
denny you will go down down to hell where
you belong
  he thrust the rats hands off and lying
flat downward on the deck watched the
swimmer being swallowed up in the dark-
ness while he was still a vague blot on
the water larry made a trumpet with his
hands and called after him and remem-
ber denny the baltic sails to-night
  as for denny he swam easily and
chuckled to himself at the thought of whal
a great fool larry was three miles to
shore hadnt he seen the lights them-
selves three miles in a rough sea was
nothing to one bom on the docks prison
had crazed larry there was no other ex-
planation when he landed he would buy
dry clothes have billy mcshane now a
sergeant arrest his enemy and he the
rat would live long and prosper
      he swam for an hour pleased
mwith these thoughts then rearing
       high in the water looked toward the
lights in spite of the distance he had come
they looked no nearer the night must be
adventure
getting misty or he must have wacer in
his eyes he rubbed them carefully and
after a short spell on his back treaded
water surely the lights were farther off
now than before  his craven heart flut-
tered fiercely and in a panic he raced along
winded he finally brought up and set him-
self steadily and powerfully to overtake the
lights
  his muscles still worked rhythmically
the years had done little to impair his
powers his mind reverted to larry what
was it the fool had said about dead men
mocking him men he hit never came
back with his black-jack he could crush
their skulls like an eggshell dead men
tell no tales was his motto and if they
told no tales surely they could not come
back but what else had larry said oh
yes that he would think over every time
they had been together from first to last
this was easy he could number them on
the fingers of one hand
  the first time had been at grogans and
the second at atlantic city when they had
attached those priceless antiques every
morning they had taken a dip in the ocean
swimming far out to sea one of the life-
guards had told them they usually covered
six miles and here was larry trying to
drown him in half that distance then
for some reason his thoughts shifted to the
last time he had seen larry lying face
downward on the deck and megaphoning
his last words to him through his hands
at the remembrance of that the rat threw
up his hands and screamed hoarsely no
wonder the lights were fading
  he had set himself to overtake an ocean liner i
  but such is the love we bear for life that
denny the rat totally without hope
swam on and on
brekvtaai salt
by edward crossland smith
vincent came into the dining-
room with such a calamitous ex-
pression on his full-moon face that
one accustomed as i was to his
habitual radiance could not ignore it he
sank into the chair opposite and gave an
order for soft boiled eggs and coffee
  is there a competent dentist in this
place he inquired dejectedly
  i named one of good repute in the calling
toothache i suppose
  loose filling i suppose ill have to live
on liquid diet now until its fixed you
see he complained as his ascetic breakfast
was put before him ive been eating dry
toast to keep down fat and ill have to cut
that out until this tooth is fixed you cant
eat dry toast with a loose filling rattling
around in your tooth like a roulette-bal
when the wheel slows down
  i conceded the point and reverted to the
business in hand  when we get out there
bread and salt

to-day i counselled dont just take
blacks word for everything make some
soundings for yourself
  instantly his native optimism came to the
front and the clouds began to disappear
youre soured george he returned
lightly they havent all had your luck
besides how on earth can they salt a placer
mine its preposterous 
  i dont know i replied doggedly i
dont know whether they can or whether
they cant all that i am laboring to get
into your head is that you cant believe all
black says mind i dont say that black
ever did salt a mine but i do know that he
sold a couple of bonanzas to easterners like
you and by some mysterious law of nature
they ceased to produce just about as soon as
the purchase price was paid over
  vincent nodded indulgently quartz
any fool can salt a quartz mine-shoot it in
with a shotgun mix it in the dump squirt
chloride of gold into the sample sack with
a syringe-forty ways thats easy but
now you talk to me about salting a placer-
where you just shovel up the dirt and pan it
out-acres and acres of it i say its out of
the question
  vincent had made his money in the east
in commerce and a man that can do that
without help as he had is ordinarily able to
take care of himself o the other hand
this was montana and gold mines and be
a-scsans business ability what it may any
easterner is a tenderfoot when it comes to
mining it was no fault of mine that he
had fallen under blacks spell though i did
introduce vincent in the club where black
got to him but the man who has suffered
himself from the mining fever-and i had-
feels an obligation to protect the unwary
from exposure moreover as vincent had
done me a good turn once i conceived it my
duty to throw cold water
   placer mining is not what it used to be
i stated disparagingly
  but my shot went wild he began to
spout statistics like an eruption of old
faithful of course not he assented
with animation neither are methods
what they were the old-timer with his
pan and sluice-box let enough gold escape
him to pay the national debt look at tie
fortunes that have been made by cyaniding
the old dumps look at the low-grade ore
they work these days look at the old
placers worked over for the third time at
d
a profit why do you know how much you
need to make placer ground pay now under
improved methods ten cents a yard in
the right places twenty-five cents is big
give me a piece of ground that rims twenty-
five cents to the yard and ill make a fortune
your old-time prospector wouldnt fool with
ground that didnt run five cents a shovel
generally they wanted about ten dollars
to the pan
  oh if youve got the ground- i
began
  he made a sweep with his egg-spoon that
left golden traces on the white tablecloth
ground thats the point black says
theres oodles of it he says it rims forty
cents to the yard as far as he has tried it
thats all i want
  yes thats what black says i returned
grudgingly unwilling to yield ive had
a little experience with mines myself and
ive seen a few of them sold that-
  again he stopped me quartz he re-
peated serenely and exasperatingly and
furthermore george he continued with
dignity rising from the table i am perhaps
not a complete ass despite the fact that
i wasnt born west of the mississippi
g through the windows a big tour-
jl ing-car could be seen lazily rolling up
to the curb at the hotel entrance
there they are remarked vincent with
a sigh of relief  get your coat and well
be going
  i maneuvered black into the front seat
with the driver i hadnt yet resigned my
trust as guardian angel even if the job was
a thankless one and i didnt propose to
leave vincent with black where i couldnt
hear all that was said so black was forced
to lean over his seat and expound his theo-
ries in the face of my openly exhibited skep-
ticism he treated vincent to a highly
scientific disquisition on placers full of such
phrases as mother lode in the neighbor-
hood old river channel pay streaks
volcanic upheavals and something about
only a foot and a half to bed-rock while
i assumed a look of exquisite boredom as
one to whom it was all ancient and stale
  the day was such as is seen only in the
high altitudes of the rockies-a clear june
morning filled with the tang of pure air dry
and cool the car sped faultlessly over the
hard smooth road on such a day even my
settled habit of suspicion slowly yielded to

adventure
my sensuous appreciation of the weather
and the environment  gold is where you
find it sayeth the proverb the fact that
i had failed was no evidence that black
hadnt found it plenty of others had
  about nobn we reached the river and the
placer ground a little stream of crystal
water raced madly down between two
mountains and debouoted upon a flat too
suddenly to select its own course and was
broken and spread out into a wide estuary
of numberless tiny rivulets between flat
black sand-bars with surfaces almost flush
with the water and level as bilhard-tables
at the junction with the river these bars
were gradually submerged but for a consid-
erable distance downstream the left bank
was filled in with the same character of
deposit
  black got out first and removed a pan and
shovel from the bottom of the car this
is the place he said waving his arm
toward the sand-bars fred you run the
car over to millers and see if you can get
some gasoline from him im afraid were
short come back here for us
  we climbed out and vincent surveyed the
expanse with delight in his eyes calculating
its extent
  all the land you can use said black
replying to vincents look and a river-
ful of water to work it-and no expense for
pumping
  has it all been tested-prospected
asked vincent nodding toward a couple of
shallow holes in the bar opposite
  black shook his head by no means
havent had the time for it but you can
see for yourself the formation is the same
all over the flat what holds good for one
part of it must hold good for it all come
and ill show you
  he stepped across the little stream at his
feet and advanced to the middle of the bar
we followed him the driver had already
turned his car about and disappeared behind
the shoulder of a hill black confidently
thrust his shovel into the sand and dumped
the contents into the wash-pan this he
carried to the waters edge and half filled
with water which he proceeded to slush this
way and that spilling it out now and then
with the mud and gravel and continuing the
motion until all of the water and most of the
dirt had been poured away
  see here he said at last holding up
the pan
  he pointed to some tiny yellowish parti-
cles at the lower edge of the black dirt re-
maining in the pan it was perhaps as mucb
as five cents in gold
  but he added that isnt saying thats
all there was in the pan washing with
a pan is the most primitive of methods
now lets see what we get here
  he made several trials six in all i believe
five out of the six showed colors not one
of the washings produced as much as
twenty-five cents in gold-and that wasnt
expected-but on the whole the showing
was good and vincent was plainly impressed
i saw that it was no longer a question of his
buying but simply one of price we re-
turned to dry ground found a comfortable
seat under a scrub pine and they began to
discuss terms
if you all are going to sit here
and dicker i said i am going
to take a walk about and stretch
my legs
  i had a little plan of my own and i wanted
to see that chauffeur it was a good mile to
the farmhouse whither he had gone and
after i had seen him and transacted my
business i returned to the scene of the bar
gaining
  fred says theres something out of
whack with that machine i announced as
i came up to them
  blacks eyebrows contracted with annoy-
ance let him fix it then he answered
irritably
  he says he cant do it i informed him
   why what in thunder is the matter 
he demanded
  thats more than i know said i sitting
down im not a mechanic
  he got up in great disgust and began to
dust lus trousers well ill be everlast-
ingly and eternally-i wonder what that kid
thinks hes fit for anyway the car was all
right this morning well have to go over
there and see whats the trouble i suppose
  i deliberately took my pipe from my
pocket and filled it i am supposing im
not going to walk that mile again i said
with finality ive got a prickly-pear
needle sticking a full inch into my foot arid
ive decided to wait here you can come
back this way for me ill be here
  he favored me with a side-long scowl and
i could see he didnt like it would you
like to walk over vincent he suggested
bread and salt

  under cover of my hands raised to light
my pipe i gave vincent a wink and he de-
clined the suggestion and after a little fur-
ther fretting black was compelled to set of
by himself
  i gave him plenty of time to get out of
sight and hearing then i took up the pan
and shovel myself
  well do a little prospecting on our own
hook i laughed i thought id manage
to get rid of him somehow
  i chose a spot some distance from where
black had taken his dirt we filled the pan
and washed it out we got nothing
  however that really doesnt prove any-
thing said vincent hopefully
  not a thing i admitted and dug up
another panful this time we got two little
colors almost microscopic and of no calcula-
ble value i shifted ground and washed
again no showing
  do you know what i begin to believe
vincent  i said
  yes but you might be off the pay-
streak you know
  like hamlet and his friends we once more
removed our ground i thought i knew
our friend black pretty well i chuckled
again iheaved the black sand into the pan
and dipped up water and swished it about
and spilled it over the rim while vincent
leaned over my shoulder and watched in-
tently
  -let me have it he urged finally you
go at it too carelessly
  i resigned the pan to him and stood aside
while he scooped up more water and care-
fully slopped it over the brim a spoonful at
a time i thought he would never have
done tired at length with standing still
i took a turn up and down the bars i tried
to find evidence on the surface of the ground
but the bars all lay so low that the least rise
in the creek would overflow them and search
was useless passing by vincent on my still
hunt i heard him suddenly catch his breath
and stopped to see what was the matter
  suffering sassafras he ejaculated awe-
somely come look here george
  i looked and just peeping up out of the
handful of mud left in the pan i beheld the
smooth yellow top of a gold nugget as big
as a pea with tremulous fingers vincent
picked it out and contemplated it with rap-
ture finally he handed it over to me
it was a good nugget pure gold and worth
two dollars at the least
  i take it all back vincent i said
thats the real thing annie nobody
salted that here i reckon this is a placer
claim all right
  lets hurry up and see if we can find any
more before black gets back proposed
vincent grabbing thepan  why this may
be another alder gulch
peg just then the chugging of the
machine came to our ears for a
 momentvincent hesitated then gave
it up we havent time he murmured
disappointedly bending down to wash the
pan clean then we went back to the dry
ground again regaining our place just as the
car rounded the hill i still held the pre-
cious nugget in my hand
  put that thing in your pocket vin-
cent commanded excitedly for heavens
sake dont let black see it hed triple the
price of this land and keep quiet about it
too
  black himself was driving the auto the
driver having been relegated to the back
seat in disgrace i knew why
  nothing in the world the matter but
a spark-plug blown out black explained
wrathfully as he brought the car to a
stop any fool ought to know how to
sx that
  vincent and black sat together on the
way back and sparred for points all the way
in the agreement was eventually reached
just a short way from town by a concession
on blacks part which i am certain he was
ready to yield all the time rather than not
make the sale
  at the hotel we parted black going to
find his attorney to prepare the necessary
documents vincent was elated the day
in the open had given us both splendid ap-
petites and we had a sumptuous dinner
vincent threw all his dietary injunctions to
the four winds and ate like a wolf when
we finally got down to the cheese and water-
crackers he sighed like a young simoon and
announced that he would have to fast for
a month to get back into shape
  but i did a good piere of work to-day
george he remarked by way of justifica-
tion at the same time adding a piece of
cheese and bite of bread to the burden his
mouth closed upon the morsel apprecia-
tively while a wave of gastronomic delight
spread itself from chin to eyebrows my
amused study of his perfect satisfaction

adventure
however was rudely disturbed when he
suddenly leaped to his feet and dapped his
hand to his cheek his whole countenance
twisted in a spasm of pain
  crucified cuspidores he yelled in a
voice that filled the room
  why what on earth i inquired in
surprise
  without answering lie made a sudden
dart for the door half-way there he
wheeled and as suddenly rushed back to me
whats blacks phone number be cried
wildly
  i dont know ask the clerk whats
the matter
  he took his hand from his mouth mat-
ter enough that magnificent transcend-
ant potential glimmering gold-mine of ours
is nothing more than a vainglorious inflated
burlesque and fraud i thats whats the
matter
  l was bewildered what makes you
think that
  with an effort he regained his composure
and resumed his seat  anyway i can call
the deal off when he comes here to-night
he said the reason why i think it he
added sullenly is because that nugget we
thought so much of is nothing more nor less
than the filling out of my tooth
  the filling of your tooth i echoed in-
credulously
  just that and we thought it was
a gold-mine that filling was loose this
morning must have slipped out of the
cavity while i was staring like a petrified
catfish with its mouth open at you washing
out that mud to-day
  i drew the supposed nugget from my
pocket and inspected it he was correct
the precious lump upon which we had pred-
icated a gold mine was merely a dentists
filling under an enlightened scrutiny its
shape betrayed the previous character of its
servitude
   ill call the deal off repeated vincent
determinedly what do i want with his
desert of black sand ill show your friend
how hell salt mud-geysers and buffalo-
wallows and what-not and shove em off on
me for gold-mines
  a bell-boy appeared at the entrance to
the dining-room glanced about the tables
and loudly called vincent
  vincent hastily drew back from the table
thats black now he exclaimed ill
favor that gentleman with a statement of
my opinion of the ethics of this little game
of his
  i finished my coffee and in a few moments
followed him i located him and black
in the deserted writing-room vincent very
warm and scowling black quite composed
and smiling the promoter of bonanzas
fingered a little slip of paper as he spoke
you seemed rather anxious to secure the
property on the way in to-day he was say-
ing with a mocking note in his voice
here is a little memorandum of the temis
of sale that we made out for the lawyers
guidance
  but the whole thing is a blame fraud
retorted vincent hotly i was buying
that for a gold-mine and it turns-ouf that
what i took to be placer gold was -just a
tooth-filling what do you suppos x jvaht
with that sand-bar unless its whatl tookit
to be
  black rose with the air of a man weary of
discussion i am sure i cant say mr
vincent he returned cooil i only
know that i have here your signed-ligree-
ment to buy the property at the price stated
in our state that is sufficient to enforce the
carrying out of the contract-which i shall
certainly do by suit at law if necessary
and here he concluded placing a neatly
folded document on the settee is your
deed properly executed i wish you good-
evening and good luck and he passed out
of the hotel
  i turned to vincent who had picked up
the deed he shrugged his shoulders
my own fault he murmured i
suspected he was tricky and i wanted
something to hold him so i suggested
that infernal memorandum confound
that tooth
however as has been remarked
by others dame fortune is a fickle
lady who sometimes jests as she
turns the wheel winners are not winners
till the game is all played and lottery
prizes go by chance not favor
  i notice i remarked laying aside the
newspaper as black came into the club
a few days since that vincent has just
made another big clean-up at thatplacer
mine you sold him last summer
  he favored me with-such  scowlas lit
might have given me had i stepped on his
favorite corn oh -- be growled
and went on into the bjir

chapter xxviii
m last-sight of the reverend john
laputa
i wtt was dark before i got into the
 gorge of the letaba i passed
 man patrols but few people
spoke to me and none tried to
stop me some may have known me but
i think it was my face and figure that tied
their tongues i must have been pale as
death with tangled hair and fever burning
in my eyes also on the left temple was the
splash of blood
   at main drift t found a big body of po-
lice holding the fort i splashed through
and stumbled into one of their camp-fires
a maij questioned me and told me that
	arcoll had got his quarry hes dead
they say they shot him out on the hills
when he was making for the limpopo
biit i kitew that this was not true it was
burned on my mind that laputa was
liivt nay was waiting for me and that
it was gods will that we should meet at
the cave
  a little later i struck the track of the
kaffirs march there was a broad tram-
pled way through the bush and i followed
it for it led to duprees drift all this
time i was urging the schimmel with all the
vigor i had left in me i had quite lost any
remnant of fear there were no terrors left
for me at duprees drift i rode the ford
without a thought of crocodiles i looked
placidly at the spot where henriques had
slain the keeper and i had stolen the rubies
there was no interest or imagination linger-
ing in my dull brain my nerves had sud-
denly become things of stolid iron
  at umvelos i had not the leisure to do
more than glance at the shell which i had
built i think i had forgotten all about
that night when i lay in the cellar and heard
laputas plans indeed my doings of the
past days were all hazy and trivial in my
mind i sawr only one sight clearly-two
men one tall and black the other little and
sallow slowly creeping nearer to the rooi-

adventure
rand and myself a midget on a horse spur-
ring far behind through the bush on their
trao
  i had no exhilaration in my quest i do
not think i had even much hope for some-
thing had gone numb and cold in me and
killed my youth i told myself that treas-
ure-hunting was an enterprise accursed by
god and that i should most likely die
that laputa and henriques would die i was
fully certain the three of us would leave
our bones to bleach among the diamonds
andin a little while the presters collar would
glow amid a little heap of human dust
i was quite convinced of all this and quite
apathetic it really did not matter so long
as i came up with laputa and henriques
and settled scores with them that mat-
tered everything in the world for it was
my destiny
  i had no means of knowing how long i
took but it was after midnight before i
passed umvelos and ere i got to the
rooriand there was a fluttering of dawn in
the east i must have passed east of ar-
colfs men who were driving the bush
towards majinjes i had ridden the night
down and id not feel so very tired my
horse was stumbling but my own limbs
scarcely pained me to be sure i was still
and nerveless as if hewn out of wood but
i had been as bad when i left bruderstoon
i felt as if i could go on riding to the end of
the world
  at the brink of the bush i dismounted and
turned the schimmel loose i had brought
no halter and i wanted him to graze and
roll the light was sufficient to let me see
the great rock-face rising in a tower of dim
purple the sky was still picked out with
stars but the moon had long gone down and
the east was flushing i marched up the
path to the cave very different from the
timid being who had walked the same road
three dights before then my terrors were
all to come now i had conquered the terror
and seen the other side of fear i was cen-
turies older
but beside the path lay something
which made me pause it was a
dead body and the head was turned
away from me i did not need to see the
face to know who it was there had been
only two men in my vision and one of them
was immortal
  i stopped and turned the body over
there was no joy in my heart none of the
lust of satisfied vengeance or slaked hate
i had forgotten about the killing of my dog
and all the rest of henriques doings it
was only with curiosity that i looked down
oh the dead face swollen and livid in the
first light of morning
  the man had been strangled his neck
as we say in scotland was  thrawn and
that was why he had lain on his back yet
with his face turned away from me i
looked closer and saw that there was blood
on his shirt and hands but no wound it
was not his blood but some others he
had been dead probably since before mid-
night then a few feet off on the path
i found a pistol with two chambers empty
  what had happened was very plain
henriques had tried to shoot laputa at the
entrance of the cave for the sake of the
collar and the treasure within he had
wounded him-gravely i thought to judge
from the amount of blood-but the quick-
ness and marksmanship of the portuguese
had not availed to save his life from those
terrible hands after two shots laputa had
got hold of him and choked his life out as
easily as a man twists a partridges neck
then he had gone in to the cave
  i saw the marks of blood on the road and
hastened on laputa had been hours in the
cave enough to work havoc with the treas-
ure he was wounded too and desperate
probably he had come to the rooirand
looking for sanctuary and rest for a day or
two but if henriques had shot straight he
might find a safer sanctuary and a longer
rest for the third time in my life i pushed
up the gully between the straight high walls
of rock and heard from the heart of the hills
the thunder of the imprisoned river
  the hidden turnstile in the right wall
stood ajar i entered and carelessly swung
it behind me the gates clashed into place
with a finality that told me they were firmly
shut i did not know the secret of them so
how should i get out again
  these things troubled me less than the
fact that i had no light at all now i had
to go on my knees to ascend the stair and
i could feel that the steps were wet it
must be laputas blood
  next i was out on the gallery that skirted
the chasm the sky above me was growing
pale with dawn and far below the tossing
waters were fretted with light a light
fragrant wind was blowing on the hills and
fresver john

a breath of it came down the funnel i saw
that my hands were all bloody with the
stains on the steps and i rubbed them on
the rock to clean them without a tremor
i crossed the stone slab over the gorge and
plunged into the dark alley that led to the
inner chamber
  as before there was a light in front of me
but this time it was a pin-point and not the
glare of many torches i felt my way care-
fully by the walls of the passage though i
did not really fear anything it was only
by the stopping of these lateral walls that
i knew i was in the cave for the place had
only one single speck of light the falling
wall of water stood out gray-green and
ghostly on the left and i noticed that higher
up it was lit as if from the open air i
walked- a few paces and then i made out
ihat the spark in front was a lantern
  my eyes were getting used to the half-
tight and i saw what was beside the lantern
laputa knelt on the ashes of the fire the
keeper had kindled three days before he
knelt before and half leaned on a rude
altar of stone the lantern stood by him
on the floor and its faint circle showed some-
thing i was not unprepared for blood was
welling from his side and spreading in a dark
pool over the ashes
i had no fear only a great pity-
pity for the lost romance for vain
endeavor for fruitless courage
greeting inkulu i said in kaffir as if
i had been one of his indunas
  he turned his head and slowly and pain-
fully rose to his feet the place it was
clear was lit from without and the daylight
was growing the wall of the river had
become a sheet of jewels passing from pel-
lucid diamond above to the translucent
emerald below a dusky twilight sought
out the extreme corners of the cave la-
putas tall figure stood swaying above the
white ashes liis hand pressed to his side
  who is it he said looking at me with
blind eyes
  it is the storekeeper from umvelos
i answered
  the storekeeper of umvelos he re-
peated  god has used the weak things of
the world to confound the strong a king
dies because a pedler is troublesome
what do they call you man you deserve
to be remembered
  i told him david crawfurd
  crawfurd well crawfurd you have
been the little reef on which a great vessel
has foundered you stole the collar and
cut me off from my people and then when
i was weary the portuguese killed me
   no i cried  it was not  you trusted
henriques and you got your fingers on his
necktoo late dont say i didnt warn
you
  you warned me and i shall repay you
i will make you rich crawfurd you are
a trader and want money i am a king and
want a throne but i am dying and there
will be no more kings in africa
  the mention of riches did not thrill me as
i had expected but the last words awakened
a wild regret i was hypnotized by the
man to see him going out was like seeing
the fall of a great mountain
  he stretched himself gasping and in the
growing light i could see how broken he was
his cheeks were falling in and his somber
eyes had shrunk back in their sockets he
seemed an old worn man standing there
among the ashes while the blood which he
made no effort to stanch trickled down his
side till it dripped on the floor he had
ceased to be the kaffir king or the christian
minister or indeed any one of his former
parts death was stripping hi to his ele-
ments and the man laputa stood out be-
yond and above the characters he had
played something strange and great and
moving and terrible
  we met for the first time three days
ago he said and now you will be the last
to see the inkulu
  umvelos was not our first meeting
i said do you mind the sabbath eight
years since when you preached in the free
kirk at kirkcaple i was the boy you
chased from the shore and i flung the
stone that blacked your eye besides i
came out from england with you and
henriques and i was in the boat which took
you from durban to delagoa bay you
and i have been long acquainted mr
laputa
  it is the hand of god he said solemnly
your fate has been twisted with mine and
now you will die with me
  i did not understand this talk about
dying i was not mortally wounded like
him and i did not think laputa had the
strength to kill me even if he wished but
my mind was so impassive that i scarcely
regarded his words

adventure
  i will make you rich he cried  craw-
furd the storekeeper will be the richest
man in africa we are scattered and our
wealth is anothers he shall have the gold
and the diamonds-all but the collar
which goes with me
  he staggered into a dark recess one of
many in the cave and i followed him
there were boxes there tea-chests cart-
ridge-cases and old brass-ribbed portuguese
coffers laputa had keys at his belt and
unlocked them his-fingers fumbling with
weakness i peered in and saw gold coin
and little bags of stones
 money and diamonds he cried
once it was the war-chest of a king and
now it will be the hoard of a trader no by
the lord the traders place is with the
terrible ones an arm shot out and my
shoulder was fiercely gripped you stole
my horse i that is why i am dying but
for you i and my army would be over the
olifants i am going to kill you craw-
furd and his fingers closed in to my
shoulder-blades
  still i was unperturbed no you are
not you can not you have tried to and
failed so did henriques and he is lying
dead outside i am in gods keeping and
can not die before my time
  i do not know whether he heard me but
at any rate the murderous fit passed his
hand fell to his side and his great figure tot-
tered out into the cave he seemed to be
making for the river but he turned and
went through the door i had entered by
i heard him slipping in the passage and
then there was a minute of silence
  suddenly there came a grinding sound
followed by the kind of muffled splash that
a stone makes when it falls into a deep well
i thought laputa had fallen into the chasm
but when i reached the door his swaying
figure was coming out of the corridor then
i knew what he had done he had used the
remnant of his giant strength to break down
the bridge of stone across the gorge and so
cut off my retreat
      i really did not care even if
i had got over the bridge i should
probably have been foiled by the
shut turnstile i had quite forgotten the
meaning of fear of death i found myself
giving my arm to the man who bad tried to
destroy me
  i have laid up for you treasure in
heaven he said your earthly treasure
is in the boxes but soon you will be seeking
incorruptible jewels in the deep deep water
it is cool and quiet down there and you
forget the hunger and pain
  the man was getting very near his end
the madness of despair came back to him
and he flung himself among the ashes
   we are going to die together crawfurd 
he said  god has twined our threads and
there will be only one cutting tell me
what has become of my army 
  arcoll has guns on the wolksberg
i said they must submit or perish
  i have other armies-no no they are
nothing they will all wander and blunder
and fight and be beaten there is no leader
anywhere-and i am dying
 there was no gainsaying the signs o
death i asked him if he would like water
but he made no answer his eyes were
fixed on vacancy and i thought i could
realize something of the bitterness of that
great regret for myself i was as cold as
a stone i had no exultation of triumph
still less any fear of my own fate i stood
silent the half-remorseful spectator of fall
like the fall of lucifer
  i would have taught the world wisdcttn
laputa was speaking english in a strange
thin abstracted voice  there would have
been no king like me since charlemagne
and he strayed into latin which i have been
told since was an adaptation of the epitaph
of charles the great sub hoc condi-
torio he crooned  situm est carpus joannis
magni et orthodoxi imperatoris qui imperium
africanum nobiliter ampliavit et multos per
antws munduni feliciter rexit under
this monument is laid the body of john
great and orthodox emperor who nobly
extended the empire of africa and ruled the
world happily for many years he must
have chosen this epitaph long ago
  he lay for a few seconds with his head on
his arms his breast heaving with agony
  no one will come after me my race is
doomed and in a little they will have for-
gotten my name i alone could have saved
them now they go the way of the rest
and the warriors of john become drudges
and slaves
  something clicked in his throat he gasped
and fell forward and i thought he was dead
then he struggled as if to rise i ran for-
ward and with all my strength aided him to
his feet
preater john

  unarm he cried the long days
task is done with the strange power oi
a dying man he tore off his leopard-skin and
belt till he stood stark as on the night when
he had been crowned from his pouch he
took the presters collar then he stag-
gered to the brink of the chasm where the
wall of green water dropped into the dark
depth below
  i watched fascinated as with the weak
hands of a child he twined the rubies round
his neck and joined the clasp then with
a last esort he stood straight up on the
brink his eyes raised to the belt of daylight
from which the water fell the light caught
the great gems and called fires from them
the flames of the funeral pyre of a king
  once more his voice restored for a mo
ment to its old vigor rang out through the
cave above the din of the cascade his
words were those the keeper had used three
nights before with his hands held high and
ihe collar burning on his neck he cried  the
snake returns to the house of its birth
come he cried to me the heir of
john is going home
  then he leaped into the gulf there was
no sound of falling so great was the rush of
water he must have been whirled into the
open below where the bridge used to be and
then swept into the underground deeps
where the labonga drowses for fifty miles
far from human quest he sleeps his last
sleep and perchance on a fragment of bone
washed into a crevice of rock there may
hang the jewels that once gleamed in
shebas hair
chapter xxix
   climb the crags a second time
t remember that i looked over
the brink into the yeasty abyss
with a mind hovering between perplexity
and tears  wanted to sit down and
cry-why i did not know except that
some great thing had happened my
brain was quite clear as to my own posi-
tion i was shut in in this place with no
chance of escape and with no food in a
little while i must die of starvation or go
mad and throw myself after laputa and
yet i did not care a rush my nerves had
been tried too greatly in the past week
now i was comatose and beyond hoping
or fearing
   sat for a long time watching the light
play on the fretted sheet of water and won-
dering where laputas body had gone
i shivered and wished he had not left me
alone for the darkness would come in time
and i had no matches after a little i
got tired of doing nothing and went feel-
ing among the treasure-chests one or
two were full of oin-british sovereigns
kruger sovereigns napoleons spanish and
portuguese gold-pieces and many older
coins ranging back to the middle ages and
even to the ancients in one handful there
was a splendid gold stater and in another
a piece of antoninus pius the treasure
had been collected for many years in many
places contributions of chiefs from ancient
hoards as well as the cash received from
i d b
  i untied one or two of the little bags oi
stones and poured the contents into my
hands most of the diamonds were small
such as a laborer might secrete on his per-
son the larger ones-and some were very-
large-were as a rule discolored looking
more like big cairngorms but one or two
bags had big stones which even my inex-
perienced eye told me were of the purest
water there must be some new pipe i
thought for these could not have been
stolen from any known mine
  after that i sat on the floor again and
looked at the water it exercised a mes-
meric influence on me soothing all care
i was quite happy to wait for death for
death had no meaning to me my hate
and fury were both lulled into a trance
since the passive is the next stage to the
overwrought
  it must have been full day outside now
for the funnel was bright with sunshine and
even the dim cave caught a reflected radi-
ance as i watched the river i saw a bird
flash downward skimming the water it
turned into the cave and fluttered among its
dark recesses i heard its wings beating the
roof as it sought wildly for an outlet it
dashed into the spray of the cataract and
escaped again into the cave for maybe
twenty minutes it fluttered till at last it
found the way it had entered by with
a dart it sped up the funnel of rock into
light and freedom
  i had begun to watch the bird in idle las-
situde i ended in keen excitement the
sight of it seemed to take a film from my
eyes i realized the zest of liberty the pas-


adventure
sion of life again i felt that beyond this
dim underworld there was the great joyous
earth and i longed for it i wanted to live
now
  my memory cleared and i remembered all
that had befallen me during the last few
days i had played the chief part in the
whole business and i had won laputa
was dead and the treasure was mine while
arcoll was crushing the rising at his ease
i had only to be free again to be famous and
rich my hopes had returned but with
them came my fears what if i could not
escape i must perish miserably by de-
grees shut in the heart of a hill though my
friends were out for rescue i was now in
a fever of unrest
my first care was to explore the
way i had come i ran down the
passage to the chasm which the slab
of stone had spanned i had been right in
my guess for the thing was gone laputa
was in truth a titan who in the article of
death could break down a bridge that would
have taken any three men an hour to shift
the gorge was about seven yards wide too
far to risk a jump and the cliff fell sheer and
smooth to the imprisoned waters two hun-
dred feet below there was no chance of cir-
cuiting it for the wall was as smooth as if it
had been chiseled the hand of man had
been at work to make the sanctuary in-
violable
  it occurred to me that sooner or later
arcoll would track laputa to this place
he would find the blood-stains in the gully
but the turnstile would be shut and he
would never find the trick of it nor could
he have any kaffirs with him who knew the
secret of the place of the snake still if
arcoll knew i was inside he would find some
way to get to me even though he had to
dynamite the curtain of rock i shouted
but my voice seemed to be drowned in the
roar of the water it made but a fresh
chord in the wild orchestra and i gave up
hopes in that direction
  very dolefully i returned to the cave
i was about to share the experience of all
treasure-hunters-to be left with jewels
galore and not a bite to sustain life the
thing was too commonplace to be endured
i grew angry and declined so obvious a fate
i had come through worse dangers and
a way i should find to starve in the cave
was no ending for david crawfurd far
better to join laputa in the depths in
a manly hazard for liberty
  my obstinacy and irritation cheered me
what had become of the lack-luster young
fool who had mooned here a few minutes
back now i was as tense and strung for
effort as the day i had ridden from blaau-
wildebeestefontein to umvolos i felt like
a runner in the last lap of a race for four
days i had lived in the midst of terror and
darkness daylight was only a few steps
ahead daylight and youth restored and
a new world
  there were only two outlets from that
cave-the way i had come and the way the
river came the first was closed the second
a sheer staring impossibility i had been
into every niche and cranny and there was
no sign of a passage i sat down on the
floor and looked at the wall of water it
fell as i have already explained in a solid
sheet which made up the whole of the wall
of the cave higher than the roof of the
cave i could not see what happened except
that it must be the open air for the sun was
shining on it the water was about three
yards distant from the edge of the caves
floor but it seemed to me that high up
this distance decreased to little more than
a foot
  i could not see what the walls of the cave
were like but they looked smooth and diffi-
cult supposing i managed to climb up to
the level of the roof close to the water how
on earth was i to get outside on to the wall
of the ravine i knew from my old days of
rock-climbing what a complete obstacle the
overhang of a cave is
  while i looked however i saw a thing
i had not noticed before on the left side
of the fall the water sluiced down in a sheet
to the extreme edge of the cave almost
sprinkling the floor with water but on the
right side the force of water was obviously
weaker and a little short of the level of the
cave roof there was a spike of rock which
slightly broke the fall the spike was cov-
ered but the covering was shallow for the
current flowed from it in a rose-shaped
spray if a man could get to that spike
and could get a foot on it without being
swept down it might be possible-just
possible-to do something with the well
of the chasm above the cave of course
i knew nothing about the nature of that
well it might be as smooth as a pol-
ished pillar
prtsier john

the result of these cogitations was
that i decided to prospect the right
wall of the cave close to the water-
fall but first i went rummaging in the
back part to see if i could find anything to
assist me in one corner there was a rude
cupboard with some stone and metal ves-
sels here too were the few domestic
utensils of the dead keeper in another
were several locked coffers on which i could
make no impression there were the treas-
ure-chests too but they held nothing save
treasure and gold and diamonds were no
manner of use to me other odds and ends
i found-spears a few skins and a broken
and notched ax i took the ax in case there
might be cutting to do
  then at the back of a bin my hand struck
something that brought the blood to my
face it was a rope an old one but still in
fair condition and forty or fifty feet long
i dragged it out into the light and straight-
ened out its kinks with this something
could be done assuming i could cut my
way to the level of the roof
  i began to climb in my bare feet and at
the beginning it was very bad except on
the very edge of the abyss there was
scarcely a handhold possibly in floods the
waters may have swept the wall in a curve
smoothing down the inner part and leaving
the outer to its natural roughness there
was one place where i had to hang on by
a very narrow crack while i scraped with
the ax a hollow for my right foot and
then about twelve feet from the ground i
struck the first of the iron pegs
  to this day i can not think what these
pegs were for they were - old square-
headed things which had seen the wear of
centuries they can not have been meant
to assist a climber for the dwellers of the
cave had clearly never contemplated this
means of egress perhaps they had been
used for some kind of ceremonial curtain
in a dim past they were rusty and frail
and one of them came away in my hand but
for all that they marvelously assisted my
ascent
  i had been climbing slowly doggedly and
carefully my mind wholly occupied with
the task and almost before i knew i found
ivy head close under the roof of the cave
it was necessary now to move towards the
river and the task seemed impossible
i could see no footholds save two frail pegs
and in the corner between the wall and the
roof was a rough arch too wide for a body to
jam itself in just below the level of the
roof-say two feet-i saw the submerged
spike of rock the waters raged around
it and could not have been more than an
inch deep on the top if i could only get
my foot on that i believed i could avoid
being swept down and stand up and reach
for the well abovethe cave
  but how to get to it it was no good
delaying for my frail holds might give at
any moment in any case i would have the
moral security of the rope so i passed it
through a fairly stanch pin close to the roof
which had an upward tilt that almost made
a ring of it one end of the rope was round
my body the other was loose in my hand
and  paid it out as i moved moral sup-
port is something very gingerly i crawled
like a fly along the wall my fingers now
clutching at a tiny knob now clawing at
a crack which did little more than hold my
nails it was all hopeless insanity and yet
somehow i did it the rope and the near-
ness of the roof gave me confidence and
balance
  then the holds ceased altogether a couplc
of yards from the water i saw my spike of
rock a trifle below me there was nothing
for it but to risk all on a jump i drew the
rope out of the hitch twined the slack
round my waist and leaped for the spike
chapter xxx
the edge of the cliff
it was like throwing oneself on a line
of spears the solid wall of water
hurled me back and down but as i fell
my arms closed on the spike there j
hung while my feet were towed outward
by the volume of the stream-as if they had
been dead leaves i was half stunned by
the shock of the drip on my head but i
kept my wits and presently got my face
outside the falling sheet and breathed
  to get to my feet and stand on the spike
while all that fury of water was plucking at
me was the hardest physical effort i have
ever made it had to be done very cir-
cumspectly for a slip would send me into
the abyss if i moved an arm or a leg an
inch too near the terrible dropping wail
i knew i should be plucked from my hold
i got my knees on the outer face of the spike
so that all my body was removed as far as

adventure
possible from the impact of the water
then i began to pull myself slowly up
  i could not do it if i got my feet on the
rock the effort would bring me too far into
the water and that meant destruction
i saw this clearly in a second while my
wrists were cracking with the effort but
if i had a wall behind me i could reach back
with one hand and get what we call in scot-
land a stell i knew there was a wall
but how far i could not judge the per-
petual hammering of the stream had con-
fused my wits
  it was a horrible moment but i had to
risk it i knew that if the wall was too far
back i should fall for i had to let my weight
go till my hand fell on it delay would do
no good so with a prayer i flung my right
hand back while my left hand clutched the
spike
  i found the wall-it was only a foot or
two beyond my reach with a heave i had
my foot on the spike and turning had both
hands on the opposite wall there i stood
straddling like a colossus over a waste of
white waters with the cave floor far below
me in the gloom and my discarded ax lying
close to a splash of laputas blood
  the spectacle made me giddy and i had
to move on or fall the wall was not quite
perpendicular but as far as i could see
a slope of about o it was ribbed and
terraced pretty fully but i could see no
ledge within reach that offered standing-
room once more i tried the moral support
of the rope and as well as i could dropped
a noose on the spike which might hold me
if i fell
  then i boldly embarked on a hard trav-
erse pulling myself along a little ledge till
i was right in the angle of the fall here
happily the water was shallower and less
violent and with my legs up to the knees in
foam i managed to scramble into a kind of
corner now at last i was on the side of the
gully and above the cave i had achieved
by amazing luck one of the most difficult of
all mountaineering operations i had got
out of a cave to the wall above
my troubles were by no means
over for i found the cliff most diffi-
cult to climb the great rush of the
stream confused my brain the spray made
the rock damp and the slope steepened as
i advanced at one overhang my shoulder
was almost in the water again all this
time i was climbing doggedly with terror
somewhere in my soul and hope lighting but
a feeble lamp i was very distrustful of
my body for i knew that at any moment
my weakness might return the fever of
three days of peril and stress is not allayed
by one nights rest
  by this time i was high enough to see that
the river came out of the ground about fifty
feet short of the lip of the gully and some ten
feet beyond where i stood above the hole
whence the waters came was a loose slope of
slabs and screes it looked an ugly place
but there i must go for the rock-wall i was
on was getting unclimbable
  i turned the corner a foot or two above
the water and stood on a slope of about 
running from the parapet of stone to a line
beyond which blue sky appeared the
first step i took the place began to move
a boulder crashed into the fall and tore-
down into the abyss with a shattering thun-
der i lay flat and clutched desperately at
every scrub but i had loosened an avalanche
of earth and not till my feet were sprayed
by the water did i get a grip of firm rock and
check my descent all this frightened me
horribly with the kind of despairing angry
fear i had suffered at bruderstoon when
i dreamed that the treasure was lost i
could not bear the notion of death when
i had won so far
  after that i advanced not by steps but by
inches i felt more poised and pinnacled in
the void than when i had stood on the spike
of rock for i had a substantial hold neither
for foot nor hand it seemed weeks before
i made any progress away from the lip of the
water-hole i dared not look down but
kept my eyes on the slope before me search-
ing for any patch of ground that promised
stability once i found a scrog of juniper
with firm roots and this gave me a great
lift a little farther however i lit on a
bank of screes which slipped with me to the
right and i lost most of the ground the bush
had gained me my whole being i remem-
ber was filled with a devouring passion to be
quit of this gully and all that was in it
  then not suddenly as in romances but
after hard striving and hope long deferred
i found myself on a firm outcrop of weathered
stone in three strides i was on the edge of
the plateau then i began to run and at
the same time to lose the power of running
i cast one look behind me and saw a deep
cleft of darkness out of which i had climbed
prester john

down in the cave it had seemed light
enough but in the clear sunshine of the top
the gorge looked a very pit of shade for
the first and last time in my life i had ver-
tigo fear of falling back and a mad craze
to do it made me actually sick i managed
to stumble a few steps forward on the moun-
tain turf and then flung myself on my face
when i raised my head i was
amazed to find it still early morning
 the dew was yet on the grass and
the sun was not far up the sky i had
thought that my entry into the cave my
time in it and my escape had taken many
hours whereas at the most they had occu-
pied two it was little more than dawn-
such a dawn as walks only on the hilltops
before me was the shallow vale with its
bracken and sweet grass and the shining
links of the stream and the loch still gray in
the shadow of the beleaguering hills here
was a fresh clean land a land of home-
steads and orchards and children all of
a sudden i realized that at last i had come
out of savagery
  the burden of the past days slipped from
my shoulders i felt young again and
cheerful and brave behind me were the
black night and the horrid secrets of dark-
ness before me was my own country for
that loch and that bracken might have been
on a scotch moor the fresh scent of the
air and the whole morning mystery put song
into my blood i remembered that i was
not yet twenty
  my first care was to kneel there among
the bracken and give thanks to my maker
who in very truth had shown me his good-
ness in the land of the living
  after a little i went back to the edge of
the cliff there where the road came out
of the bush was the sprawled body of
henriques with two dismounted riders
looking hard at it i gave a great shout
for in the men i recognized aitken and the
schoolmaster wardlaw
chapter xxxi
i go again to tnandas kraal
i must now take up some of the rag-
ged ends that i have left  behind me
it is not my task as i have said to
write the history of the great rising
that has been done by abler men who
were at the center of the business and had
some knowledge of strategy and tactics
whereas i was only a raw lad who was
privileged by fate to see the start if i
could i would fain make an epic of it
and show how the plains found at all
points the plateau guarded how wits over-
came numbers and at every pass which the
natives tried the great guns spoke and the
tide rolled back
  yet i fear it would be an epic without
a hero there was no leader left when
laputa had gone there were months of
guerrilla fighting and then months of re-
prisals when chief after chief was hunted
down and brought to trial then the am-
nesty came and a clean sheet and whitt
africa drew breath again with certain grave
reflections left in her head
  on the whole i am not sorry that the his-
tory is no business of mine romance died
with  the heir of john and the crusade
became a sorry mutiny i can fancy how
differently laputa would have managed it
all had he lived how swift and sudden his
plans would have been how under him the
fighting would not have been in the moun-
tain glens but far into the high-veld among
the dorps and townships with the inkulu
alive we warred against odds with the in-
kulu dead the balance sank heavily in our
favor i leave to others the marches and
strategy of the thing and hasten to clear up
the obscure parts in my own fortunes
  arcoll received my message from um-
velos by colin or rather wardlaw received
it and sent it on to the post on the berg
where the leader had gone close on its
heels came the message from henriques by
a shangaan in his pay it must have been
sent off before the portuguese got to the
rooirand from which it would appear that
he had his own men in the bush near the
store and that i was lucky to get off as i did
  arcoll might have disregarded henriques
news as a trap if it had come alone but my
corroboration impressed and perplexed him
he began to credit the portuguese with
treachery but he had no inclination to act
on his message since it conflicted with hif
plans he knew that laputa must come
into the berg sooner or later and he had
resolved that his strategy must be to await
him there
  but there was the question of my life
he had every reason to believe that i was in
the greatest danger and he felt a certain
io
adventure
responsibility for my fate with the few
cen at his disposal he could not hope to
hold up the great kaffir army but there was
a chance that he might by a bold stand
effect my rescue henriques had told him
of the vow and had told him that laputa
would ride in the center of the force a
body of men well posted at duprees drift
might split the army at the crossing and
under cover of the fire i might swim the
river and join my friends still relying on
the vow it might be possible for well-
mounted men to evade capture
  accordingly he called for volunteers and
sent off one of his kaffirs to warn me of his
design he led his men in person and of
his doings the reader already knows the tale
but though the crossing was flung into con-
fusion and the rear of the army were com-
pelled to follow the northerly bank of the
letaba there was no sign of me anywhere
arcoll searched the river-banks and crossed
the drift to where the old keeper was lying
dead he then concluded that i had been
murdered early on the march and his kaf-
fir who might have given him news of me
was carried up the stream in the tide of the
disorderly army therefore he and his men
rode back with all haste to the berg by way
of main drift and reached bruderstoon be-
fore laputa had crossed the highway
my information about in-
andas kraal decided arcolls next
move like me he remembered
beyers performance and resolved to repeat
it lie had no hope of catching laputa
but he thought that he might hold up the
bulk of his force if he got guns on the ridge
above the kraal a message had already
been sent for guns and the first to arrive got
to bruderstoon about the hour when i was
being taken by machudis men in the kloof
the ceremony of the purification pre-
vented laputa from keeping a good lookout
and the result was that a way was made for
the guns on the northwestern comer of the
rampart of rock it was the way that
beyers had taken and indeed the enterprise
was directed by one of beyers old com-
mandants
  all that day the work continued while
laputa and i were traveling to machudis
then came the evening when i staggered
into camp and told my news arcoll who
alone knew how vital laputa was to the
success of the insurrection immediately de-
cided to suspend all other operations and
devote himself to shepherding the leader
away from his army how the scheme suc-
ceeded and what befell laputa the reader
has already been told
  aitken and wardlaw when i descended
from the cliffs took me straight to blaau-
wildebeestefontein i was like a man who
is recovering from bad fever cured but
weak and foolish and it was a slow journey
that i made to umvelos riding on aitkens
pony at umvelos we found a picket who
had captured the schimmcl by the roadside
the wise beast when i turned him loose at
the entrance to the cave had trotted quietly
back the way he had come
  at umvelos aitken left me and next day
with wardlaw as companion i rode up the
glen of the klein labonga and came in the
afternoon to my old home the store was
empty for japp some days before had gone
off post-haste to pietersdorp but there was
zeeta clearing up the place as if war had
never been heard of i slept the night
there and in the morning found myself so
much recovered that i was eager to get away
i wanted to see arcoll about many things
but mainly about the treasure in the cave
  it was an easy journey to bruderstoon
through the meadows of the plateau the
farmers commandoes had been recalled but
the ashes of their camp-fires were still gray
among the bracken i fell in with a police
patrol and was taken by them to a spot on
the upper letaba some miles west of the
camp where we found arcoll at a late break-
fast i had resolved to take him fully into
my confidence so i told him the full tale of
my nights adventure he was very severe
with me i remember for my daft-like ride
but his severity relaxed before i had done
with my story
  the telling brought back the scene to me
and i shivered at the picture of the cave
with the morning breaking through the veil
of water and laputa in his death-throes
arcoll did not speak for some time
  so he is dead he said at last hah
whispering to himself well he was a
king and died like a king our job now is
simple for there are none of his breed left in
africa
  then i told him of the treasure
  it belongs to you davie he said and
we must see that you get it this is going
to be a long war but if we survive to the end
you will be a rich man
prester john

  but in the meantime i asked sup-
posing other kaffirs hear of it and come back
and make a bridge over the gorge they
may be doing it now 
  ill put a guard on it he said jumping
iip briskly its maybe not a soldiers
job but youve saved this country davie
and im going to make sure that you have
your reward
      after that  went with arcoll to
inandas kraal i am not going to
tell the story of that performance
for it occupies no less than two chapters in
mr uptons book he makes one or two
blunders for he spells my name with an
o and he says we walked out of the camp
on our perilous mission with faces white
and set as a crusaders this is certainly
not true for in the first place nobody saw us
go who could judge how we looked and in
the second place we were both smoking and
feeling quite cheerful at home they made
a great fuss about it and started a news-
paper cry about the victoria cross but the
danger was not so terrible after all and in
any case it was nothing to what i had been
through in the past week
  i take credit to myself for suggesting the
idea by this time we had the army in the
kraal at our mercy laputa not having
returned they had no plans it had been
the original intention to start for the oli-
fants on the following day so there was
a scanty supply of food besides there
were the makings of a pretty quarrel be-
tween umbooni and some of the north-
country chiefs and i verily believe that if we
had held them tight there for a week they
would have destroyed each other in faction
fights
 in a little they would have grown des-
perate and tried to rush the approaches on
the north and south then we must either
have used guns on them which would have
meant a great slaughter or let them go to do
mischief elsewhere arcoll was a merciful
man who had no love for butcher besides
he was a statesman with an eye to the future
of the country after the war but it was his
duty to isolate laputas army and at all
costs it must be prevented from joining any
of the concentrations of the south
 then i proposed to him to do as rhodes
did in the matoppos and go and talk to
them by this time i argued the influence
of laputa must have sunk and the fervor of
the purification be half forgotten the
army had little food and no leader the
rank and file had never been fanatical and
the chiefs and indunas must now be inclined
to sober reflections but once blood was
shed the lust of battle would possess them
cur only chance was to strike when their
minds were perplexed and undecided
chapter xxxii
i deliver larutas word
arcoll did all the arranging he
had a message sent to the chiefs
inviting them to an indaba and presently
word was brought back that an indaba
was called for the next day at noon that
same night we heard that umbooni and
about twenty of his men had managed to
evade our ring of scouts and get dean away
to the south this was all to our advan-
tage as it removed from the coming indaba
the most irreconcilable of the chiefs
  that indaba was a queer business a rcoll
and i left our escort at the foot of a ravine
and entered the kraal by the same road as
i had left it it was a very bright hot
winters day and try as i might i could not
bring myself to think of any danger i be-
lieve that in this way most temerarious
deeds are done-the doer has become insen-
sible to danger and his imagination is
clouded with some engrossing purpose the
first sentries received us gloomily enough
and closed behind us as they had done when
machudis men haled me thither then the
job became eerie for we had to walk across
a green flat with thousands of eyes watching
us by-and-by we came to the merula tree
opposite the kyas and there we found a ring
of chiefs sitting with cocked rifles on their
knees
  we were armed with pistols and the first
thing arcoll did was to hand them to one of
the chiefs
  we come in peace he said we give
you our lives
then the indaba began arcoll
leading off it was a fine speech he
made the finest i have ever listened
to he asked them what their grievances
were he told them how mighty was the
power of the white man he promised that
what was unjust should be remedied if only
they would speak honestly and peacefully

adventure
he harped on their old legends and songs
claiming for the king of britain the right of
their old monarchs it was a fine speech
and yet i saw that it did not convince them
they listened moodily if courteously and
at the end there was a blank silence
  arcoll turned to me for gods sake
davie he said talk to them about la-
puta i its our only chance
  i had never tried speaking before and
though i talked their tongue i had not
arcolls gift of it but i felt that a great
cause was at stake and i spoke up as best
i could
  i began by saying that inkulu had been
my friend and that at umvelos before the
rising he had tried to save my life at the
mention of the name i saw eyes brighten
at last the audience was hanging on my
words
  i told them of henriques and his treach-
ery i told them frankly and fairly of the
doings at duprees drift i made no secret
of the parti played i was fighting for
my life i said any man of you who is
a man would have done the like
  then i told them of my last ride and the
sight i saw at the foot of the rooirand
i drew a picture of henriques lying dead
with a broken neck and the inkulu
wounded to death creeping into the cave
  in moments of extremity i suppose every
man becomes an orator in that hour and
place i discovered gifts i had never dreamed
of arcoll told me afterwards that i had
spoken like a man inspired and by a fortu-
nate chance had hit upon the only way to
move my hearers i told of that last scene
in the cave when laputa had broken down
the bridge and had spoken his dying words
-that he was the last king in africa and
that without him the rising was at an end
then i told of his leap into the river and
a great sigh went up from the ranks about
me
  you see me here  said by the grace
of god i found a way up the fall and the
cliffs which no man has ever traveled before
or will travel again your king is dead
he was a great king as i who stand here
bear witness and you will never more see
his like his last words were that the
rising was over respect that word my
brothers we come to you not in war but
in peace to offer a free pardon and the re-
dress of your wrongs if you fight you
fight with the certainty of failure and
against the wish of the heir of john i
have come here at the risk of my life to
tell you his commands his spirit ap-
proves my mission think well before
you defy the mandate of the snake and
risk the vengeance of the terrible ones
  after that i knew that we had won the
chiefs talked among themselves in low whis-
pers casting strange looks at me then the
greatest of them advanced and laid his rifle
at my feet
  we believe the word of a brave man
he said we accept the mandate of the
snake
arcoll now took command he
arranged for the disarmament bit by
bit companies of men being marched
off from inandas kraal to stations on the
plateau where their arms were collected by
our troops and food provided for them
for the full history i refer the reader to mr
uptons work it took many days and
taxed all our resources but by the end of
a week we had the whole of laputas army
in separate stations under guard disarmed
and awaiting repatriation
  then arcoll went south to the war which
was to rage around the swaziland and zulu-
land borders for many months while to
aitken and myself was entrusted the task o
repatriation we had inadequate troops at
our command and but for our prestige and
the weight of laputas dead hand there
might any moment have been a tragedy
the task took months for many of the
legions came from the far north and the job
of feeding troops on a long journey was diffi-
cult enough in the winter s-on when the
energies of the country v  occupied with
the fighting in the south
  yet it was an experience for whicu i shall
ever be grateful for it turned me fr m a rash
boy into a serious man i knew then the
meaning of the white mans duty he has
to take all risks recking nothing of his life
or his fortunes well content to find his
reward in the fulfilment of his task that
is the difference by tween white and black-
the gift of respoi	the power of being
in a little way a ling and so long as we
know this and practise it we will rule not
in africa alone but wherever there are dark
men who live only for the day and their
own bellies
  moreover the work made me pitiful and
kindly i learned much of the untold griev-
prester john

ances of the natives and saw something of
their strange twisted reasoning before
we had got laputas army back to their
kraals with food enough to tide them over
the spring sowing aitken and i had got
sounder policy in our head than you will find
in the towns where men sit in offices and
see the world through a mist of papers
  by this time peace was at hand and
i went back to inandas kraal to look for
cohns grave it was not a difficult quest
for on the sward in front of the merula tree
they had buried him i found a mason in
the iron kranz village and from the excel-
lent red stone of the neighborhood was
hewed a square slab with an inscription
it ran thus
  here lies buried the dog colin who was
killed in defending d crawfurd his master
to him it was mainly due that the kaffir
rising failed
  i leave those who read my tale to see the
justice of the words
chapter xxxiii
my uncles gift is many times
multiplied
we got at the treasure by blowing
open the turnstile it was easy
enough to trace the spot in the rock
where it stood but the most patient search
did not reveal its secret accordingly we
had recourse to dynamite and soon laid
bare the stone steps and ascended to the
gallery the schasm was bridged with
planks and arcoll and i crossed alone
the cave was as i had left it the blood-
stains on the floor had grown dark with time
but the ashes of the sacramental fire were
still there to remind me of the drama i had
borne a part in
  when i looked at the way i had escaped
my brain grew dizzy at the thought of it
i do not think that all the gold on earth
would have driven me a second time to that
awful escalade as for arcoll he could not
see its possibility at all only a madman
could have done it he said blinking his
eyes at the green linn indeed davie
i think for about four days you were as mad
as they make it was a fortunate thing for
your madness saved the country
with some labor we got the treasure down
to the path and took it under a strong
guard to pietersdorp the government
was busy with the settling up after the war
and it took many weeks to have our business
disposed of at first things looked bad for
me the attorney-general set up a claim
to the whole as spoils of war since he argued
it was the war-chest of the enemy we had
conquered i do not know how the matter
would have gone on legal grounds though
i was advised by my lawyers that this claim
was a bad one
  but the part i had played in the whole
business more especially in the visit to
inandas kraal had made me a kind of
popular hero and the government thought
better of their first attitude besides arcoll
had great influence and the whole story of
my doings which was told privately by him
to some of the members of the government
disposed them to be generous accord-
ingly they agreed to treat the contents of
the cave as ordinary treasure-trove of
which by the law one-half went to the dis-
coverer and one-half to the crown
  this was well enough as far as the gold
was concerned but another difficulty arose
about the diamonds for a large part of
these had obviously been stolen by laborers
from the mines and the mining people laid
claim to them as stolen goods i was ad-
vised not to dispute this claim and conse-
quently we had a great sorting-out of the
stones in the presence of the experts of the
different mines in the end it turned out
that identification was not an easy matter
for the experts quarreled furiously among
themselves a compromise was at last
come to and a division made and then the
diamond companies behaved very hand-
somely voting me a substantial sum in
recognition of my services in recovering
their property
  what with this and with my half-share
of the gold and my share of the unclaimed
stones i found that i had a very consider-
able fortune the whole of my stones
i sold to de beers for if i had placed them
on the open market i should have upset the
delicate equipose of diamond values when
i came finally to cast up my account i found
that i had secured a fortune of a trifle over
a quarter of a million pounds
  so much wealth did not dazzle so much as
it solemnized me i had no impulse to
spend any part of it in a riot of folly it had
come to me like fairy gold out of the void

adventure
it had been bought with mans blood almosl
with my own i wanted to get away to
a quiet place and think for of late my life
had been too crowded with drama and there
comes a satiety of action as well as of idle-
ness above all things i wanted to get
home they gave me a great send-off and
sang songs and good fellows shook my hand
till it ached the papers were full of me
and the prime minister made a speech in
my honor at a farewell banquet but i
could not relish this glory as i ought for
 was like a boy thrown violently out of his
bearings
  not till i was nearing cape town in the
irain did i recover my equanimity the
burden of the past seemed to slip from me
suddenly as on the morning when i had
climbed the linn i saw my life all lying
before me and already i had won success
i thought of my return to my own country
my first sight of the gray shores of fife my
visit to kirkcaple my meeting with my
mother i was a rich man now who could
choose his career and my mother need
never again want for comfort my money
seemed pleasant to me for if men won it by
brains or industry i had won it by sterner
methods for i had staked against it my life
i sat alone in the railway carriage and cried
with pure thankfulness these were com-
forting tears for they brought me back to
my old commonplace self
my last memory of africa is my
meeting with tam dyke i caught
sight of him in the streets of cape
town and running after him clapped him
on the shoulder he stared at me as if he
had seen a ghost
  is it yourself davie he cried i
never looked to see you again in this world
i do nothing but read about you in the
papers what for did ye not send for me
here have i been knocking about inside
a ship and you have been getting famous
they tell me youre a millionaire too
   had tam to dinner at my hotel and
later sitting smoking on the terrace and
vatching the fiying-ants among the aloes
j told him the better part of the story  have
here written down
  man davie he said at the end yejve
had a tremendous time here are you not
eighteen months away from home and youre
going back with a fortune what will you
do with it 
  i told him that i proposed to begin with
to finish my education at edinburgh col-
lege at this he roared with laughter
  thats a dull ending anyway its me
that should have the money for im full of
imagination you were aye a prosaic body
davie
  maybe i am i said but i am very
sure of one thing if i hadnt been a
prosaic body i wouldnt be sitting here
to-night
two years later aitken found the
diamond pipe which he had always
suspected lay in the mountains
some of the stones in the cave being unlike
any ordinary african diamonds confirmed
his suspicions and sent him on the track
a kaffir tribe to the northeast of the rooi-
rand had known of it but they had nver
worked it but only collected the overspill
the closing down of one of the chief existing
mines had created a shortage of diamonds in
the worlds markets and once again the
position was the same as when kimberley
began accordingly  he made a great for-
tune and to-day the aitken proprietary
mine is one of the most famous in the coun-
try-
  but aitken did more than mine diamonds
for he had not forgotten the lesson we had
learned together in the work of repatriation
he laid down a big fund for the education
and amelioration of the native races and the
first fruit of it was the establishment in
blaauwildebeestefontein itself of a great
native training college it was no factory
for making missionaries and black teachers
but an institution for giving the kaffirs the
kind of training that fits them to be good
citizens of the state there you will find
ever kind of technical workshop and the
finest experimental farms where the blacks
are taught modem agriculture they have
proved themselves apt pupils and to-day
you wall see in the glens of the berg and in
the plains kaffir tillage as scientific as any
in africa they have created a huge ex-
port trade in tobacco and fruit the cotton
promises well and there is tajk of a nev
fiber which will do wonders also along the
river bottoms the india-rubber business is
prospering
  there are playing-fields and baths and
reading-rooms and libraries just as in a
school at home in front of the great hall
of the college a statue stands the figure of
the chair that smiled	
a black man shading his eyes with his hands
and looking far over the plains to the rooi-
rand on the pedestal it is lettered
prester john but the face is the face of
laputa so the last of the kings of africa
does not lack his monument
  of this institution mr wardlaw is the
head he writes to me weekly for i am
one of the governors as well as an old
friend and from a recent letter i take this
passage
i often cast my mind back to the afternoon when
you and i sat on the step of the schoolhouse and
talked of the kaffirs and our future i had about
a dozen pupils then and now i have nearly three
thousand and in place of a tin-roofed shanty and
a yard i have a whole countryside you laughed at
me for my keenness davie but ive seen it justified
i was never a man of war like you and so i had to
bide at home while you and your like were straight-
ening out the troubles but when it was all over
my job began for i could do what you couldnt do-
i was the physician to heal wounds
  you mind how nervous i was when i heard the
drums beat i hear them every evening now for
we have made a rule that all the kaffir farms on the
berg sound a kind of curfew it reminds me of old
times and tells me that though it is peace now-a-
the
 days we mean to keep all the manhood in them that
 they used to exercise in war
   it would do your eyes good to see the garden we
 have made out of the klein labonga glen the
 place is one big orchard with evep kind of tropical
 fruit in it and the irrigation dam is as full of rainbow
 trout as it will hold out at umvelos there is
 a tobacco-factory and all round sikitolas we have
 square miles of mealie and cotton fields the loch
 on the rooirand is stocked with lochleven trout and
 we have made a bridlepath up to it in a gully east of
 the one you climbed
   you ask about machudis the last time i was
 there the place was white with sheep for we have got
 the edge of the plateau grazed down and sheep can
 get the short bite there we have cleaned up all the
 kraals and the chiefs are members of our county
 council and are as fond of hearing their own voices
 as an aberdeen bailie
   its a queer transformation we have wrought and
 whep i sit and smoke my pipe in the evening and
 look over the plains and then at the big black statue
 you and aitken set up i thank the providence that
 has guided me so far i hope and trust that in the
 bible words the wilderness and the solitary place
 are glad for us at any rate it will not be my
 fault if they dont blossom as the rose come
 out and visit us soon man and see the work you had
 a hand in starting
   i am thinking seriously of taking ward-
 laws advice

the chairthat smiled
by edith rtckrrv
           iis room said the housekeeper
           is never shown
the tourist whom she had
been conducting through the
long upper gallery of selward house stood
obstinately in front of the low oaken door
to which she referred
  it is not a private apartment he in-
sinuated  i should particularly like to see
it he held out a sovereign as inducement
mrs green turned her back upon the
golden temptation and said haughtily it
is not in my power sir the room has not
been opened since i can remember
  she turned to move on but the visitor
remained standing with his feet wide apart
and his hands in his pockets his boots
his clothes and his chin proclaimed him a
successful american
  indeed he said that is odd but
i suppose there is always a way to do these
things is sir charles at home 

adventure
  she was obliged to come back to him
no sir he has gone to the meet
  and you are sure you have no key that
would unlock the door 
  i know my own keys sir
  he shifted his ground weli is there no
other member of the family- he
absently played with several gold coins in
one palm
  theres only miss elizabeth sir shes in
the garden but i couldnt trouble her-
  the americans face suddenly twinkled
see here my good woman if youll kindly
get the young lady to step up here ill bet
you fifty dollars-thats ten pounds-shell
find a way to let me into that room and
if she doesnt you shall have the fifty any-
way so you stand to win in either case
if mrs green thought she was dealing
with a madman the two notes that he held
out to her vouched for a degree of sanity
besides she reflected she ran no risk except
of miss elizabeths anger the young lady
knew no more than herself where the key of
the room was kept-if indeed it had not
been lost before any of them was bom
  she pressed a button in the wall and to
the footman who appeared gave the brief
direction that he should look for miss
elizabeth in the garden and ask her whether
she would be so kind as to come to the house
a moment
  she then conducted the persistent in-
truder back to the entrance-hall and with
him awaited her ladys pleasure
  he was especially interested in a full-
length portrait that hung over the chimney-
piece
  that was the first sir charles she told
him  who founded the fortune of the family
and built the house in the days of queen
elizabeth
  is it allowable to ask how he obtained
the money asked the american with a
curious dry smile
  in the wars againsi spain she an-
swered curtly
   indeed and the present sir charles-
any resemblance 
  sir charles is clean-shaven only the
promise of the two five-pound notes kept
her civil
  he moved to the next portrait and the
red-haired young lady dipped in pearls is
the founders daughter
  his wife began the housekeeper but
was interrupted by a fresh voice asking
haughtily did you wish to see me lie
turned to face a pretty girl in white linen
not so unlike the portrait he had been
studying
   miss sel ward  he bowed and handed
her a card upon which she read the name
ramon stanley and a new york address
  i must plead a desire to see your secret
chamber-not due as you might suppose to
idle curiosity he paused and began
again with his curious smile what should
you say if i were to tell you exactly what is
in that room
she looked at him with some slight
interest cobwebs i should say
how do you know i never was ip
it myself and i dont know whats thejg- 
do you green 
  nomadam said the housekeeperf but
i have heard my grandfather tell as how it
was haunted he used to say as your
grandmother lady maria was the last as
ever entered the room what she saw
nobody ever knew but she came out scream
ing and was took with convulsions and died
within the day it hasnt been unlocked in
my time-not to my knowledge
  do you know whether there is a key
asked miss elizabeth with evident curios-
ity and as mrs green shook her head she
turned to the stranger at least i should
be interested to hear you tell what you think
there is in the room
   i dont think said he  i knou- almost
as well as if id seen em i may be wrong
in a few details theres a big round table
covered with gilt and embossed leather
supported by three lions of painted leather
leather exclaimed the girl
  and lions gasped the housekeeper
   over this should be hanging seven lamps
-also of leather-representing the seven
deadly sins if they were lighted the flame
would come out of the mouth of each-
  the girl was wide-eyed now and mrs
green dumb with amazement
  on the table he pursued calmly is a
big wine flagon built like a spanish galleon
of the armada-also of leather and a
dozen-there should be a dozen-tankards
shaped and painted like grinning faccs with
pointed hats for their covers
 still of leather  asked miss sel ward
all of leather said he and round
the table are leather chairs a dozen of them
shaped and painted to look like men so that
the chair that smiled

when you sit down you seem to sink into
the arms of a human being-so i under-
stand-
  of all the madness exclaimed miss
selward
  for that reason said mr stanley
you can perhaps pardon my eagerness to
seam whether i am right not that i have
much doubt myself but i thought it
worth a trip across the ocean to make
sure
  tell me how you knew she com-
manded
  he considered a moment therewould
be no point in my doing that until the case
is proven afterward i should be bound
to explain he added meditatively and
 ach of the chairs has a ring on the forefinger
of the left hand and all the faces have eyes
 liat follow you round the room and one it
is said has a smile that comes and goes-
he stopped and added with a change of tone
im not making up all this stuff you
know
  miss selward hesitated have you any
 theory as to how my grandmother came by
her death
  he answered without hesitation yes a
theory--which the room itself would prove
or disprove
  miss selward made up her mind  green
im going to have a look for that key in the
study i know where father keeps all his
keys-it cant do any harm do you sup-
pose its labeled haunted chamber
  she moved away followed by the house-
keepers protest-words quickly muffled
however by the arrival of the promised
notes in her palm
  stanley had had time to examine all the
portraits in the hall before miss selward
came back breathless they were all
labeled but these she said fathers
most methodical i dont believe he knows
what these are himself they are clumsy
and old enough-its a chance
  she ran up the wide oak stairway quickly
followed by stanley and by the time that
mrs green had labored up to them in the
gallery they had already tried and rejected
half the bunch
  suddenly stanley who had been wrestling
with the stiff lock looked at the girl it
turned
  open-open she cried eagerly
  still he hesitated do you know i dont
quite like to i begin to doubt my own state-
ments now im afraid i shall be made out
a liar after all
  however he was perhaps unconsciously
pushing harder than he realized for a mere
touch of her hand above his bent shoulder
sent the door inward with a crash
  the room was darkened by a green cur-
tain bung across a large window opposite the
door but this curtain was full of rifts and
holes that admitted strong rays and patches
of light
  miss selward who had leaned eagerly
forward fell back with a suppressed scream
and clutched the housekeepers arm stan-
ley himself looking in gripped the doorpost
hard so strong was the illusion upon him
that a company of men sat drinking at the
round table while over their heads shadowy
monstrous dragons or crocodiles threatened
descent upon them
  the next moment triumph was upper-
most by george said he what did
i tell you
  mercy on us ejaculated the plump
housekeeper feeling that the emergency was
altogether beyond her shall i ring for
help madam
  what for asked stanley no weli
just wait to get a little five air into the place
so that we dont all die of suffocation and
then well look round and see how nearly i
was right
  the air that came out into the draughty
corridor was peculiarly dead full of dry rot
attesting that the room and its windows had
been shut for generations
stanley was the first to enter
with a careful avoidance of the
ghastly seated figures he crossed to
the large window and cautiously tugged
to draw one of the green curtains aside
it first resisted then tore under his
hand with a great cloud of dust then gave
way above so that he had barely time to
dodge its folds half blinded and choked
he groped his way back to the gallery where
the two women stood coughing the younger
with her handkerchief over her mouth
  one good thing said stanley when he
could speak the germs are probably as
dead as the air shall we explore further 
im not sure that we oughtnt to wait
until my father returns said miss selward
but curiosity overcame her there can be
no harm in looking
  i want to prove that my list was right

adventure
said stanley whose eyes had been busy
look now isnt it so here is the leather
table supported by lions on it the galleon
and the twelve leering mugs above it the
seven deadly sins to give light and round
it the twelve chairs like elizabethan dan-
dies with frills and slashes they have even
the rings that i spoke of on their fore-
fingers by george notice their eyes-they
look alive can you make out which is the
one that smiles 
  he went from one chair to another trying
to discover minute differences in their
seeming sameness suddenly miss selward
said faintly open-the window-please 
while he struggled with the rusty catch
he heard a slight thud and turned in time to
see her sway and fall into the chair at the
head of the table
  for a moment he was paralyzed not at
the sight of her fair head drooping sideways
over the leather arm but at the expression
of the painted chair-back that looked and
leered above her shoulder there could be
no doubt which chair it was that smiled
  for gods sake he cried to the house-
keeper as he rushed toward the two
women get her out of that
  but mrs green stood like a wooden
image and miss selward straightened her-
self with an effort to speak naturally im
all right i was only a little faint do you
know this ring looks as if it were set with
real rubies and its loose-i believe it
would come off-
  she got no further for stanley was bend-
ing over her white as chalk before she
could exclaim he had caught her by the
arms and dragged her from her place so
violently that they both nearly fell over
to save them he clutched at the table and
set all the tankards rattling the nearest
one rolled to the floor from one of the
dragons above something was jarred loose
and fell with a snap on the table but no-
body looked at it both women stared at
the stranger who was wiping his forehead
with his eyes shut by george said he
that was a near go
  miss selward was the first to recover her
composure now she said will you
kindly explain
  stanley opened his eyes with a slight
start its all right-only dont sit down
again that was the queens chair you
mustnt sit in the queens chair
  what queen said she
   elizabeth thats the chair that smiled
no mistake about it i saw it plain as day
miss selward looked back at it it isnt
smiling now she said gravely you must
have imagined in fact im not sure now
which of these two i sat in but i can soon
tell it was the one on which the ring was
loose
  she turned to see but stanley caught her
arm without ceremony dont wait till
i tell you something
  her attention was diverted by a clatter of
hoofs in the court below the open window
that will be my father she said and
then  green will you go down and ask sir
charles to step up here at once and not
a word to the servants please
  the wooden image came to life with a
gasp of relief and waited for no second telling
now said miss selward
   perhaps you did not notice said stan-
ley that my christian name is ramon
she nodded spanish she said 
wondered a little
  i am of spanish descent said he and
in that moment she saw his race in the
quality of his bearing but my people
have been settled in america for genera-
tions you have no idea how this furniture
came to be here no well i have the
story of it in a small tin box full of parch-
ments-three hundred years old and more
the family didnt know what was in them-
weve always been country gentlemen not
scholars but when i went home from johns
hopkins i stumbled upon the box in my
fathers safe and tried to figure out the
contents they were written partly in
spanish and partly in latin but i couldnt
make much of em so i got the bright idea
of bringing em over to an expert at the
british museum now i have neat copies
in duplicate one of which i shall be happy
to lend your father some day-if he is
interested among the papers was a plan
of this house as built by the first sir charles
and an inventory of the contents of this
room hence my visit to-day 
  but how in the world-
  its easy when you know your an-
cestor happened to be an ardent admirer of
queen elizabeth mine the first raymond
stanley-he was an irishman in the service
of king philip of spain-happened to be one
of the countless victims of mary stuart
 it sounds like a fairy-tale  she breathed
with parted lips
the chair that smiled

       its plain history said he the
kind of fact thats stranger than fic-
tion just listen to this when poor
old philip found his armada show was no
good he was pretty near broken-hearted and
that was the time raymond stanley went to
him with a neat scheme for revenge on his
old enemy elizabeth-a little gift of furni-
ture for her palace of hampton court or
staines or where you like he had hap-
pened to come upon a leather-worker-of
cordova i think it was-and between them
they devised this pretty suite for the queen
and her maids of honor theres a little
delicate irony in the design do you see-a
hint at the taste of the virgin queen and her
ladies for the knees of courtiers in the light
of the seven deadly sins-thats pretty
ucar a brilliant idea isnt it not to speak
ofserving the wine in a spanish galleon
  i dont know whether the plan was to
drug the drink-plenty of dare-devils about
seminary priests and others who would
have undertaken it for a handful of silver
i could tell you the names of some of them-
ejiglish and irish soldiers of fortune harry
young and hugh cahill moody walpole
edmund yorke-a dozen or more generally
of sir william stanleys regiment sir
william was raymonds uncle-but never
mind all that you shall read it later this
splendid gift was shipped for england-under
captain middleton i believe and raymond
stanley and some of the others went with it
off ushant they encountered an english
man-of-war commanded by one captain
charles selward-
  ahsaid the girl now i beginto---
  they fought-naturally selward was
the better seaman-the maria reina was
pillaged and sunk-most of the crew
drowned middleton and raymond stan-
ley were picked up by french fishermen
afterward stanley came to england in
disguise and by his own account haunted
selward house awhile trying to get pos-
session of his stuff or to take revenge on the
english captain whom he terms that in-
sufferable pirate and enemy of god he
failed in fact in our old papers-written
for his son with the express command that
that young man should follow up the feud as
he saw his chance-he says that selward
with the aid of the devil saw through the
plan and betrayed it to the queen who
thereupon was so - mewed up in her chamber
that no stranger could come into her pres-
ence when he found that the queen had
not only knighted sir charles but had be-
stowed the furniture upon him for his pains
he lost heart and went back to spain
his son may have been a lazy rascal or a
pious chap-anyway nothing happened
except that the papers and the name ray-
mond in its spanish form have been handed
down until now
  but why did he want the queen to have
the furniture and why were you so
alarmed when i sat in that chair asked
the practical miss selward
  thats the cream of the plot said
stanley but was interrupted by the sound
of heavy footsteps in the corridor he
turned to confront a short stout man in
mud-splashed hunting pink whom he
rightly assumed to be sir charles
  hoity-toity said this individual after
a hasty glance about the room whats all
the row 
  stanleys answer was to seize his gray felt
hat and drop it on the floor then seem-
ingly oblivious of father and daughter he
knelt and fumbled for some seconds rising
rather flushed but calm i have just
caught a mouse he observed amiably and
showed a beady-eyed gray snout wriggling
between his thumb and forefinger  it was
a lucky chance i happened to see it if you
dont object we will try an experiment
before i explain myself
  he went up to the chair from which miss
selward when she had fallen into it had
brushed away some of the dust
if you will kindly stand by the table
you will be able to tell me whether my im-
pression of a smile was a delusion or not
he sat down deliberately and leaned back
miss selward half put out her hand but
dont-isnt it-dangerous she gasped
  the huntsman was speechless seemingly
on the verge of apoplexy at these strange
doings in his house
  i know the risk said stanley calmiy
watch me you observed that the ring
was loose and were on the point of playing
with it when i grabbed you a loose ring is
a great temptation for idle fingers-espe-
cially a beautiful ring set with rubies
watch my hand he leaned away from
the chair-back as the girl had done and
holding the squeaking mouse firmly between
his thumb and first two fingers set it upon
the ring using it as a sort of pad and pro-
ceeded to twirl this round and round

adventure
  miss selward dung to her fathers arm
lather faint
  in two or three seconds stanley held out

  miss selward was fast losing her self-
control father father she sobbed
hysterically he saved my life i was
going to play with the ring
 - - said sir charles and
nothing more
its this way said stanley
each ruby is set in a circle of tiny
stilettos-tipped with poison i
wasnt at all sure it would have kept its
strength so long but i thought best to be
on the safe side old raymond saicl it
would kill a cat in ten minutes and a
human being in several hours all the
other rings are of painted leather this is
of real gold and rubies as you see this
fact was to be pointed out to the queen
and the hope was that with her love of
priceless toys she would sit down and
grab it before she thought of a possible
trap
  let us get away from this horrible
room sobbed the girl
 -- said the huntsman i
think its time
  but say asked stanley rising from
his chair did either of you notice the
smile 
  it seemed they had not unnaturally been
absorbed in watching the mouse
  well i guess we arent in a state to
experiment any more to-day but i like to
fancy that old raymond planned the grin
for the spectators after her majesty had
toyed with the ring long enough we can
look into that another day there may be
a spring that releases a smile upon the
leather
  he perceived that the old gentleman with
his daughter on his arm had halted ma-
jestically by the door and was adjusting a
monocle surveying the stranger as if he had
that very moment first discerned his pres-
ence
  and what am i to do for you young
sir  he demanded
  in an instant there was a curious atmos-
pheric change from the eyes of ramon
flashed the wild spirit of his irish-spanish
ancestor encountering the choleric face of
elizabeths old sea-dog then the twentieth
century returned and the young american
laughed why i guess you can sell me
this lumber-room stuff-thats all ive
taken a fancy to it and ill give you a good
figure-
  sir interrupted the enraged british
householder ill do nothing of the
sort
  oh yes i guess you will said stanley
easily we dont want to rake up an old
quarrel but ive got about as good a claim
to it as you have i might get the british
law to work op lost property-or treasure-
trove or some such thing i can prove it
belonged to us all right
  i think said sir charles swallowing
his indignation in an access of dignity  that
it is high time to prove something
  quite right papa said miss selward
now recovered sufficiently to be her own
mistress you shall have the whole story
of how we came to break into the bluebeard
chamber but first you are going to ask
mr stanley to tea and let him wash and
brush off the dust of centuries and then we
can have explanations by the drawing-room
fire-
  i will not sell him anything growled
the british father marching ahead
  miss selward flung a look at stanley that
said quite plainly we shall bring him to
time and to the hunched shoulders of the
pink coat she remarked you seem to have
forgotten how nearly your daughter shared
the fate of the mouse i should think youd
be glad to get rid of the chair that smiled
anyway-
  -the- was the growl that en-
sued
  but miss selward held out her hand to
stanley as a peace-offering  i think wed
better bury the hatchet said she  prob-
ably the ownership of the furniture will
adjust itself in time
it was not a matter of great
surprise in england and america
when such an adjustment shortly
after took place
  the bride insisted that the leather furni-
ture be kept in seclusion and the ruby ring
thickly swathed in bandages and shown with
great care but whether the chair smiled in
reality or in imagination is a point upon
which there is dispute to the present day

ithout knowing where or how

signs of a nice little revolution which was
just being shaped up so i sold my ship and
took quarters at the hotel freitas to watch
developments
  when the last emperor of brazil dom
pedro ii was dragged out of bed at night
and deported without the firing of a shot in
the peaceful revolution of november 
 deodoro da fonseca was made presi-
dent before his weakness had become
apparent he was made constitutional presi-
dent and floriano peixotto was elected
vice-president deodoros policy was weak
and vacillating and his popularity waned
rapidly a revolution had been quietly
fomented by floriano the vice-president
he soon had the army at his back and
gained the support of admiral mello
ranking officer of the brazilian navy and
admiral soldanlia da gama commandant
of the naval academy they brought mat-
ters to a head on the morning of november
  mello took up a position at the
foot of the main street of rio is the cruiser

adventure
riachuelo the finest ship in the navy
trained his guns on the palace of itumary
and sent word to deodoro that he would
open fire on him in two hours if he did not
abdicate in favor of floriano deodoro
abdicated in two minutes dropping dead
soon afterward from heart disease and
floriano was proclaimed president
  before he had time to get his new chair
well warmed he had a row with mello who
considered that he was rightfully entitled to
be the power behind the throne floriano
made it plain to him that while mello might
give friendly advice he could not go an inch
beyond that floriano was perhaps one
half indian and the rest corrupted portu-
guese sixty years old with dear brown
eyes and iron-gray hair and whiskers-a
strong fine character perfectly fearless
absolutely honest and devoted to his coun-
try whose interests he greatly advanced
he was proud of his indian blood which he
made a synonym for courage and fairness
and often referred to it he was the best
president i have ever known not excepting
even the great guzman
  mello was a younger man and more of
a spaniard in his blood and his characteris-
tics he had considerable bravery of the
kind that is best displayed in the presence
of a large audience but he was impetuous
and at times foolish at that he was more
a man after my own heart for he stood for
revolt and anarchy while floriano stood for
law and order soldanha da gama the
third figure in the drama was a strange
mixture of naval ability cowardice and
theatrical warrior
  mello worked chiefly among naval officers
aristocrats adherents of dom pedro and
the catholic clergy and in the end they all
became his allies he was unable to shake
the army and the influence of the priests
was minimized by the fact that the people
generally were blindly in love with the new
scheme of self-government and were loyal
to floriano
  as mellos plot shaped up i began to sus-
pect that his real purpose was to restore
dom pedro to the throne and make himself
the power behind it mello cared nothing
for titles it was his ambition to be the dic-
tator of brazil later events led me to
believe that he had an understanding with
several european rulers who were keenly
anxious to see the divine right of kings
perpetuated in south america dom pedro
had issued a protest against his deposi-
tion as soon as he reached europe in which
all the princes of the house of coburg
joined and was conducting an active cam-
paign for his restoration
 it was amusing to watch the de-
g velopment of mellos rebellion
one would have thought two friendly
leaders were planning rival surprise parties
in which there was to be nothing more seri-
ous than the throwing of confetti flo-
riano surrounded by spies and assassins but
also by many loyal and devoted friends
knew perfectly well from his own spies
what mello was doing but relying on his
own strength and the public sentiment be-
hind him he made no move to check him
mello was well aware that floriano knew
all that was going on yet neither one gave
any outward sign of this knowledge and
when they were together they appeared to
be friends
  it was along in july or august  that
mello sent for me and expressed a wish that
i go down to santa catarina island off the
southern coast of brazil and blow up the
refmblica the one brazilian warship whose
officers had so far remained loyal to floriano
though finally just before the revolution
was declared they went over to mello
with the exception of soldanha da gama
who was neutral but whom he regarded as
more of a friend than an enemy mello had
converted the rest of the navy to his cause
he offered a cash payment and a commission
in the navy in return for her destruction but
i could never get him down to definite
terms
  while we were still negotiating  received
a call from one of florianos aides who
asked me to accompany him to the palace
he took me in the rear entrance and up
a back stairway to florianos private sala
where after presenting me he left me as i
supposed alone with the president
  i understand said floriano that you
were in venezula with president guzman
and have had military training and experi-
ence
  that is correct sir
  i am told too that you have made
a study of high explosives and have in-
vented a remarkable torpedo
  that is also true
  would you be willing to undertake
a mission that would involve considerable
looking for trouble

danger but for which you would be well
paid
  i am open to anything except vulgar
assassination that is my business
what do you charge for your services
that depends entirely on the nature of
the work
  then we can leave that question open
until the nature of the work has been de-
cided on provided it is understood that your
compensation will be such as you are ordi-
narily accustomed to
  very good sir
  brazil may need your services colonel
boynton
  i beg your pardon i interrupted
 captain boynton
  i repeat colonel boynton he replied
with a smile and the suggestion of a bow
 brazil may need your services but i can
not tell how soon nor in what capacity
if i enter your service it will be a loyal
service to the end i told him
   consider yourself then in the service
of brazil as he said this he raised his
hand and from behind a curtain appeared
captain cochrane a descendant of the
english admiral cochrane who had fought
for brazil seventy years before
  as we were strangers i took this precau-
tion explained floriano it will not be
necessary again
  it was perfectly justifiable i replied
captain cochrane then repeated in
english my conversation with the president
to be sure i understood it immediately on
my arrival at my hotel i sent word to mello
that i would consider no further proposition
from him
mellos rebellion breaks out
a few days later the revolution was de-
clared under conditions such as one
would look for on the light-opera stage but
never in real life not even in south america
on the evening of september th floriano
went to the opera accompanied by mello
soldanha and several other officers of ihe
army and navy and they all sat together in
the presidential box mello and soldanha
excused themselves after the second act
they left their cloaks in the box and said
they would be back in a few minutes
knowing full well the reason for their de-
parture floriano bowed them out with an
ironical excess of politeness soldanhs
who had not yet taken sides though his
sympathies belonged to the rebellion
with which he subsequently allied himself
retired to the naval school on an island
near the city and mello went on board his
flagship the aquidaban
  during the night he assembled his cap-
tains and impressively gave them their final
orders with the dramatic announcement
that the standard of revolt would be hoisted
at sunrise his fleet in addition to the
flagship consisted of the guanabara tra-
jano and almirante tamandale protected
cruisers the siete de selcmbro a wooden
barbette ship the gunboat centaur and two
river monitors the protected cruiser re-
publica whose officers had just decided to
join with the rest was coming up from down
the coast and the riachuelo with which
mello had forced the abdication of deodoro
was cruising in the mediterranean it was
not an imposing force but it was sufficient
to give mello command of the sea while
floriano was in control of the forts and the
land forces
  at daybreak mello seized all of the gov-
ernment shipping in the bay and announced
a blockade of rio harbor he then sent
word to floriano that if he did not abdicate
without naming his successor by four
oclock that afternoon he would bombard
the city this threat was also communi-
cated to the foreign ministers evidently
in the hope that they would try to
persuade floriano to step out in the
interests of peace but they promptly pro-
tested to mello against any bombardment
under any circumstances they told hims
unless he proposed to violate the interna-
tional rules of warfare he could not bom-
bard until after formal notice of forty-eight
hours to allow the removal of neutrals and
non-combatants
  florianos reply was an emphatic refusal
to abdicate and precisely at four oclock
mello answered it with one shell from a -
inch gun which exploded near the american
consulate and killed a foreigner during
the next week mello fired forty or fifty shots
into the city every day but they did little
damage the fact that they apparently
were not aimed at any particular -spot
probably made no difference in the execu-
tion frequently he would send boats
ashore for supplies to which nobody paid
any attention and at four oclock every
afternoon the aquidaban would steam

adventure
solemnlyover and engage in a comic-opera
duel with fort santa cruz which was
located at the point of the harbor entrance
opposite sugar loaf hill
  hellos shots invariably went clear over
the fort or buried themselves in its walls
while the gunners at the fort could not have
hit him if he had stood still for an hour so
no damage was done to either side after
about twenty shots the aquidaban would
return to her anchorage slowly and with
great dignity and hostilities would be over
until the next day at the same hour this
daily duel which was the star act in the
serio-comic program always drew a crowd
to the water-front business went on as
usual throughout the revolution which
was regarded with amused interest rather
than with fear
very soon after the firing of the
	- i first shot italian english german
austrian and portuguese warships
appeared at rio ostensibly to protect the
rights of their citizens but their prompt
arrival made possible only by the fact that
they were cruising close at hand which was
in itself significant and the attitude they
assumed made it plain to me that they were
there under secret orders to aid in the res-
toration of dom pedro mello was not
a rebel but a pirate yet the commanders of
these foreign ships all representing mon-
archies gave him their moral support and i
have always believed that only the belated
arrival of an american naval force pre-
vented them from giving him their active
support as well
  their influence was so strong that when
rear admiral oscar f stanton of the
united states navy finally reached rio he
made the mistake of saluting mello for
this he was speedily recalled rear admiral
gherardi being sent down to succeed him
stantons excuse was that he wished to
maintain a neutral position but no question
of neutrality was involved i know that
several of the american naval officers who
arrived later shared my view that mello was
a pirate and should have been blown out of
the water by the combined fleets it was
evident from the prompt recall of stanton
that the navy department at washington
held the same opinion but had not sufficient
courage in its convictions to order the sup-
pression of mello the ranking officer of
the combined fleets was the italian vice-
admiral magnani the senior british
officer present was captain lang of the
sirius until the arrival of an officer of
flag rank captain henry f picking of the
charleston was the senior officer present of
the american navy and next to him was
captain now rear admiral retired silas
w terry on the newark
a torpedo enterprise
  a bout a week after the firing of the first
shot i was on my way to the water-
front to witness the regular afternoon duel
between the aquidaban and fort santa
cruz when i was overtaken by a govern-
ment carriage and colonel pimental whom
i knew well asked me to get in with him as
he had orders for me from floriano he
drove along the shore of the bay to a new
galvanized building at a point some distance
beyond the island of the naval school and
near the railway machine-shops on the
way he explained that this building had been
erected for my use and in it i was to con-
struct as rapidly as possible a large torpedo
with which to destroy the aquidaban
  i was to have whatever i called for but
from the time the work was begun on the
torpedo until it was finished i was to allow
no one to enter or leave the building for fear
that word of what was being done would gel
to mellos spies  the structure was of ample
size and had comfortable living accommo-
dations for ten men which was as many
as i could use i took up my quarters in the
building at once and after drawing on the
master mechanic of the railroad for a lot of
copper plates and such other supplies as i
would need got right to work
  late that evening i heard the rumble of
a carriage outside and a moment later in
walked floriano an old gray shawl around
his shoulders with the secretary of the
treasury the secretary of marine and a
senator floriano inquired first as to my
comfort and i assured him i was entirely
satisfied then he said i am relying on
you colonel boynton to save brazil from
further trouble by destroying the aquidaban
you will have to make and use your torpedo
with such help as we can give you now
that you know what you are to do what is
your price
  i told him i would expect to be paid the
appraised value of the ship if i sank her or
put her out of commission after consulting
m
looking for trouble

with the others floriano agreed we fixed
the value of the ship at  gold and
a contract along these lines was drawn up
and signed the next day
  the torpedo i built for this business was
the largest i had ever made it was twelve
feet long four feet in diameter in the middle
and carried more than five hundred pounds
of dynamite for i wanted to be certain that
the ship would be at least disabled by
her contact with it it floated just below
the  surface of the water floriano came
down to witness the final test and handed
me a commission as colonel in the bra-
zilian army he approved the plan of
campaign which i had mapped out and said
the necessary orders would be issued at
once
  i believe you will succeed were his
parting words  i hope you vail come back
as general boynton 
whle mello had seized all of the
government vessels in the harbor
there were a few tugs left which to
prevent his interference were flying the
british flag on the pretense that they were
owned by englishmen i was to be given
one of these tugs and my plan was to steal
around into nictheroy bay at night and
anchor close under the hill at the end of the
peninsula where i would be hidden from the
rebel fleet in the morning i would load the
torpedo and wait for the daily exchange of
cannon courtesies between the aquidaban
and the fort an officer at santa cruz was
to signal me when mello left his anchorage
and then towing the submerged torpedo by
wire rope too small to be detected i would
steam out across the course of the aqui-
daban which would pick up the towing-line
on her bow drag the torpedo alongside and
be destroyed by the contact
  the line was  feet long supported at
intervals by little floats painted the color of
the water i did not think mello would see
anything suspicious in an insignificant little
towboat under the british flag running
diagonally across his bow at a distance of
a quarter of a mile there never has been
any doubt in my mind that the plan would
have worked perfectly but for the fact that
mellos spies in high places had kept him
constantly advised as to what we were
doing
  my tug in charge of a french engineer
and four brazilians was sent down to me on
the afternoon of september th and as soon
as it was dark with the torpedo covered with
canvas on deck and twelve -pound boxes
of dynamite in the pilot house we steamed
around to nictheroy bay to have loaded
the torpedo before we started would have
been extremely dangerous for any acci-
dental pressure on one of its arms would
have blown all of us to pieces we anchored
well out of sight of the rebel fleet and as
soon as it was daylight i unscrewed the
manhole of the torpedo and proceeded to
pack it full of dynamite
captured by the british
i was just putting in the last box of the
explosive when there was a shrill whistle
and a launch from the sirius swung along-
side the lieutenant in charge jumped
aboard of us and came aft before i could
brush the dynamite from my arms
  who commands this craft he de-
manded
  i do i replied
  what are you doing with that flag up
there pointing to the british ensign
  that flag was there when i came aboard
and took command i said which was true
i am flying it for protection from a pirate
fleet just as others are displaying it on rio
bay and in the city your commanding
officer has sanctioned that custom by his
silence i am an officer of the established
brazilian government obeying the orders
of my superiors in brazilian waters and i
claim the right to take advantage of that
custom if i care to do so just as others have
done and are doing
  i think the other cases are different from
yours replied the lieutenant what is
that  pointing to the dynamite
  examine it for yourself
  it looks like dynamite
  probably
   well sir i am ordered by captain lang
to take you on board her majestys ship
sirius
  it was of no use to make a fight so i ac-
companied him with excessive and sarcastic
politeness he took all my crew with him
leaving a guard on the tug captain lang
was on deck waiting for me and was quite
agitated when i was brought before him but
he was much more heated before we parted
company and it was a warm day to begin
with

adventure
 captain boynton what does this
mean  he roared at me
  what does what mean i innocently
answered
  your lying over there in a vessel loaded
with munitions of war and flying the british
flag
  it means simply that i am an officer in
the brazilian army on duty under the guns
of a rebel fleet and that i am flying the
british flag for whatever virtue it might
have in protecting me from that pirate
admiral mello that flag has been used as
a protection by many others and you have
silently acquiesced in such use of it
  but sir are you not aware that this is
piracy
  i am not aware sir that it is any such
thing
   but i tell you that it is piracy to fly the
british flag over the ship of another nation
and carrying munitions of war
  it might be just as well captain lang
for you to remember that you are not now
on the high seas an act of the british
parliament is of no effect within another
country and if you will consult your chart
you will find that we are in the enclosed
waters of brazil under such conditions no
mandate of yours which effects my rights
can be enforced unless you have the nerve
to take the chances that go with your act
you may soon find to the contrary
shouted the captain who was letting his
temper get the best of him  i have a mind
to send you to admiral mello as a prisoner
you know what he would do to you
  oh captain lang i said jeeringly
you know you wouldnt do that
  and pray why not sir
  because you dare not do it and thats
why i told him as i pointed to the
charleston which with her decks cleared for
action was anchored only a few hundred
yards off to port i dare you to do it
 defy you to do it send me aboard the
iquidaban if you dare
  i was making a strong bluff and i got
away with it the outraged britisher
swelled up with anger and turned almost
purple but he did not reply to my taunt
instead he summoned the master at arms
and placed me in his charge ordered his
launch and dashed off to the charleston
he returned in half an hour and without
another word to me ordered a lieutenant to
take me aboard the charleston
       i will not deny that i was a bit
  easier in my mind when i saw my
l- own flag flying over me yet had
i known the treatment i was to receive
under it i would have felt quite differently
  it was easy to see from the reception
captain picking gave me that he had been
influenced by the attitude of captain lang
i told him that i was an american citizen
temporarily in the employment of the bra-
zilian government that i had violated no
law of the united states or of brazil and
i demanded that i be set ashore he coldly
informed me that i would be confined to the
ship at least until he had consulted with the
american minister and communicated with
washington and soon after i arrived on the
charleston i was confined to my room as
a dangerous character who threatened the
peace of nations with this decidedly un-
pleasant recollection however it is a pleas-
ure to know that the other american naval
officers who arrived later took exactly my
view of the whole situation and became
champions of my cause they told picking
that mello was a pirate and should be
treated as such and that i was being de-
prived of my liberty without the slightest
warrant of law but they were powerless to
accomplish my release
the detroit shows her teeth
looking forward a little the manner in
which that old fighter rear admiral
benham put an end to the revolution in
the following january soon after his arrival
at rio should be well remembered for it
was a noble deed and an example of thegood
judgment generally displayed by american
naval officers when they are not hampered
by foolish orders from washington in the
vain hope of arousing enthusiasm for his lost
cause mello had gone down the coast
where he figuratively and literally took to
the woods when he saw the folly of his mis-
sion leaving da gama in command of the
blockading fleet the captains of several
american merchant ships who had been
prevented for weeks from landing their car-
goes for rio appealed to admiral benham
who took prompt action
  to show his contempt for the rebels
whom he properly regarded as pirates
admiral benham assigned the smallest ship
in his squadron the little detroit com-
manded by that great little man com-
m
looking for trouble

mander now rear admiral retired w h
brownson to escort the merchantmen up to
the docks at the same time he warned
da gama not to carry out his threat to fire
on them when they crossed his line with
his ship cleared for action brownson stood
in alongside one of the merchantmen he
steamed over close to the trajano on which
da gamas flag was flying and which with
the guanabara was guarding the shore
  i will recognize no accidental shots
shouted brownson to the rebel admiral so
dont fire any  if you open firel will respond
and if you reply to that i will sink you
  as the merchant ship came in line the
trajano fired a shot across her bow brown-
son replied instantly with a six-pound shell
which exploded so close to the trajano that
it threw the water on her forward deck
a musket-shot was fired from the guana-
bara and it was answered and silenced with
a bullet from the detroit
  after seeing his charge safely tied up to
dock brownson circled contemptuously
around the trajano and ordered a marine to
send a rifle-shot into her stempost as an
evidence of his esteem for her commander
the discomfited da gam who was looking
for someexcuse to end his hopeless revolt fell
over himself getting into his launch raced
over to the detroit and tendered his sword to
brownson the american told him he had
not demanded his surrender as he seemed
to think and could not accept it but that he
must keep his hands off american shipping if
he wished to continue his mortal existence
  the revolution ended right there but
unfortunately i was not present to witness
its collapse the august naval authorities
were scandalized when this display of good
sense was reported to them and they care-
fully prepared a message of censure to ben-
ham for permitting such conduct but before
it was despatched the new york morning
newspapers reached washington and after
a perusal of their enthusiastic editorials on
the subject a message of commendation was
sent to him instead
during my confinement on the
charleston i was occasionally allowed
on deck for exercise but i had no
other diversion than to watch the intermit-
tent bombardment of the city and the regu-
larly scheduled exchange of shots between
the rebel fleet and the forts in hope of
meeting with greater success mello would
sometimes engage the forts with several of
his ships and as time wore on thefe was
some improvement in the marksmanship on
both sides though nothing like reasonable
accuracy was eyer attained the only in-
cident which was at all exciting was the
sinking of the javary one of mellos moni-
tors a shell from fort sao joao dropped
between her turrets and as she heeled over
from the explosion an accidental shot from
fort santa cruz struck her below the water-
line she went down by the stem with
a rush the guns in her forward turret
were pointed toward the town and they were
fired in a spirit of sheer bravado just as she
disappeared mello threw a few shells into
the city every day as evidence that he was
still in rebellion but i was told that less than
half a dozen of them did any damage and
they certainly produced little excitement
soldanha da gama came out in the open and
joined forces with mello while i was on the
charleston
  i was not allowed to communicate with
any one on shore and except from hearsay
floriano had no means of knowing whether
i was alive or dead captain picking
claimed to have been told by a church digni-
tary who of course was a friend of mello
that it would be unsafe to set me ashore as
i was certain to be assassinated by mello sym-
pathizers but that doubtless was a subterfuge
by which he sought to justify his position
  after i had been subjected to this out-
rageous treatment for two months i was
suddenly transferred to the detroit which
immediately put to sea off cape frio we
met another sirius a lamport  holt liner
bound for new york and in charge of
ensign james f carter i was transferred to
her we reached new york december 
 and i was taken to the brooklyn navy
yard an hour after my arrival a message
was received from washington ordering my
release the navy department in line
with the vacillating policy then in vogue
took that method of getting me away from
the danger-zone
venezuela
the orinoco company
it was in vexed venezuela that i was
destined to end my days of deviltry but
not until after a protracted warfare none
the less bitter because it was conducted at

long range with castro the contemptible
who came into power two years after  had
finally settled down at santa catalina as
manager for the orinoco company cipri-
ano castro had been in congress as dipu-
tado or member of the house from one of
the andean districts while i was in caracas
with president crespo and though he was
regarded as a good fighter and a disturbing
element he was never considered as a presi-
dential possibility
  with all of my hatred for castro and
everything pertaining to him it must be
admitted that he was an exceedingly shrewd
scoundrel had he been half as honest he
could have made himself the greatest man
in south america he supported anduesa
palacio the deposed president who had be-
trayed guzman blanco in his final cam-
paign against crespo before the latter was
recognized as dictator and defeated gen-
eral morales in the battle of tariba may
  for some time after that he was
in full control of that section of the country
but with the firm establishment of the new
regime he gave up the fight
  in recognition of the military ability he
had displayed crespo offered to make him
collector of customs at puerto cabello
he declined the position but egotistically
exaggerating the purpose of the proffer
pompously promised crespo that he would
not attempt to overthrow his government
he then came to congress where he would
have been almost unnoticed but for the
amusement he created by solemnly remov-
ing his shoes and putting on black kid gloves
every time he sat down to the-to him-
herculean task of drafting a bill he was as
rough and uncouth as the rest of the moun-
taineers short of stature secretive of mind
and suspicious of every one excepting only
a few of his brother brigands from the andes
  at the expiration of this term he returned
to the hills and bought a farm just across
the colombian border he posed as a cat-
tle-raiser but all of the reports that reached
caracas said he was much more of a cattle-
rustler or stealer he was a persistent tax-
dodger and his herd-which was said to
show fifty different brands that represented
as many thefts-was driven back and forth
across the border to avoid the venezuelan
and colombian collectors he was engaged
in this profitable pastime when i left cara-
cas and had disappeared from all political
and revolutionary calculations
i first arrived at santa catalina
whither i had gone on the urgent
advice of crespo early in  it
was a straggling little town with the com-
panys headquarters standing close to the
bank of the piacoa river a branch of the
orinoco opposite the lower end of the is-
land of tortola-the iwana of sir walter
-raleigh
  the building contained a store with
a large supply of goods adapted to the needs
of colonists in a new and tropical country
and around it were carpenter- blacksmith-
and machine-shops the company also
owned three small steamers which were
used to bring supplies from trinidad and
run back and forth to barrancas thirty
miles upstream at the head of the macareo
river the main estuary of the oriftoco
through which all of the commerce passes
the atlantic ocean was  riiiles below us
and ciudad bolivar the principal city on
the orinoco and the head of all-the-year
navigation was  miles above
  tradition says that santa catalina was
named by raleigh who according to the
native story camped there when he was
pushing his way up the orinoco in search of
the fabled el dorado with its golden city
of manoa just above barrancas are the
ruins of a strong fort he built for a part of his
force while he went farther on up the river
it is perhaps the irony of an unkind fate
which pursued the great adventurer that
near this fort from which searching parties--
were sent out is the rich mine of el callao
if raleigh had been looking for gold by the
pound instead of by the ton and had
searched more carefully he probably would
have found enough to satisfy him
  stretching away to unmeasured lengths
from the pin-prick the headquarters village
made in it was the virgin forest with its
wealth of gold and iron rubber and asphalt
and its square miles of mahogany spanish
cedar rosewood carapo greenheart and
mora wood all within the confines of our
concession far off to the southwest in a
region i never could find time to explore
was the mythical dwelling-place of the
people whom raleigh described-though
only on the word of the natives-as having
no heads but with eyes in their shoulders
and mouths in their chests with a long mane
trailing out from their spines down the
orinoco half way to the coast was imitaca
mountain a great hill of iron ore which is
looking for trouble

said to be one of the largest and richest
deposits of the precious metal in the world
the jefe civil at catalina assisted
pgj me in my effort to open up the coun-
        try and active operations were soon
under way the natives who were living
just as when columbus discovered them
and wearing no more clothes that could be
noticed were attracted by the prosperity
which it was presumed would follow our
development work and little pueblos sprang
up along the river on both sides of us
  our concession covered a territory larger
than the state of massachusetts nearly all of
which was terra incognita it was out of the
question to think of trying to go all over it
but for the boundary dispute between
venezuela and england the orinoco com-
pany never would have secured its conces-
sion for the shrewd guzman granted it with
the idea that americans would colonize the
territory and effectively resist the british
invasion
  in their progressive search for gold-the
continued pursuit of raleighs will-o-the-
wisp-the englishmen in guiana were ad-
vancing farther and farther into venezuela
and carrying the boundary with them or
claiming that it was always just ahead of
them which so far as venezuelas protests
went amounted to the same thing it was
in fact the sweet siren song of gold that
caused the establishment of the three
guianas so that the british french and
dutch might prosecute the search under the
most favorable conditions
  an expedition i made guianaward was
the hardest trip i have ever undertaken and
yet one of the most interesting we had to
cut our own trail through the thick under-
brush and could carry few supplies but it
was easy to live off the country not know-
ing what to make of us the jaguar puma
tapir and ocelot came so close that they were
easily shot while overhead were millions of
monkeys parrots and macaws to say noth-
ing of great snakes that would have made
the fortune of a menagerie manager
 at long intervals we encountered a few
wild indians living  the banks of rivers
who were terrified until they found we were
not tax-collectors sent to take them into
slavery on account of their inability to pay
extortionate taxes levied for no other pur-
pose than to compel them to work for
years without pay when they became con-
vinced that we meant them no harm they
were very friendly and generously offered us
things to eat which i was afraid to touch
they never had seen a white man before and
i regretted that some of my friends were not
hidden in the bushes to witness the rever-
ence they showed me
  they were armed with bows and arrows
which they used with wonderful accuracy
and crudely fashioned spears and wore
nothing much but feathers in their hair
theyiived on fish and game with yams and
plantains and sometimes corn as side
dishes and native fruits for dessert and they
were the healthiest looking people i have
ever seen i pushed into this veritable par-
adise for all of a hundred miles which car-
ried me close to the border and discovered
one outcropping of gold which will some day
be developed into a rich property our
progress was so slow that it was two months
before we were back in catalina
  a popular election and a revolt
after getting the development work
well started i returned to caracas and
early in  resumed my old confidential
position with president crespo his term
expired the following february and i found
that hehad already decided on general
ignacio andrade as his successor he had
planned to continue as dictator of the coun-
try a la guzman and spend much of his
idle time and money abroad and he
wanted a man who could be relied on to keep
his organization intact and turn the office
back to him at the end of his term for the
venezuelan constitution prohibits a presi-
dent from succeeding himself
  donna crespo who besides being the
greatest smuggler in the country was
a shrewd judge of men had taken a pro-
nounced dislike to andrade and advised
strongly against his selection without
knowing how truly she spoke she predicted
that if andrade was made president crespo
would be dead within six months i added
my advice to the donnas for i knew an-
drade was a weak man and one who could
not be trusted powerful friends of crespo
in trinidad also urged him to select a
stronger man but he could not be moved
he credited andrade with having saved his
life and planned that he should be made
president by the first popular election in
the history of venezuela the peons idolized

adventure
crespo and he had such a strong grip on the
country that he was able to carry out his
plan but with disastrous results
  on election day the soldiers at gualira
guarenas and petare doffed their uniforms
and donned blouses with their revolvers
strapped on underneath marched to the
polls and voted as often as was required
other towns throughout the country wit-
nessed the same performance the peons
also voted for andrade either because they
knew crespo wanted them to or because the
soldiers so instructed them and they kept at
it until the designated number of votes had
been deposited for a popular election it
was tlae weirdest thing that could be
imagined
  it was immediately followed by mutter-
ings of discontent from the better class of
citizens and on the night of andrades in-
auguration general hernandez the famed
el mocho who was minister of public
improvements in crespos cabinet but an
opponent of the new president took to the
hills at the head of  troops crespo
really was responsible for the curse of cas-
tro for had he selected a strong man as his
successor the mountain brigand never could
have commanded a force sufficiently power-
ful to overthrow him
within a month andrade went
through the form of appointing
crespo commander in chief of the
army in order that he might clinch his
dictatorship for a while crespo con-
tented himself with enjoying his new title
and directing operations from the capital
but the hernandez revolution finally as-
sumed such proportions that he took the
field in person to stamp it out the two
armies met in the mountains near victoria
june   hernandez was led into
a trap given a drubbing and captured
after the battle crespo walked across the
field and was leaning over a wounded man
when he was shot from behind and in-
stantly killed
  it was claimed that the shot was fired
from the bush by one of the escaped rebels
but the bullet that killed crespo was of
a peculiar pattern and exactly fitted the pis-
tol of one of his own officers who was not
a venezuelan i doubt whether there was
another weapon exactly like it in the whole
country the responsibility for the mur-
der could easily have been fixed but the
cowardly andrade refused to order a real
investigation crespos body was packed
in a barrel of rum and brought to caracas
for burial
  the capture of el mocho checked the
spirit of revolt but not for long andrade
had nothing to commend him but his hon-
esty a quality so little understood in vene-
zuela that it counted for nothing and he be-
came more and more unpopular only in-
ability to agree on his successor prevented
his speedy overthrow
  some few months after crespos death
castro who had made himself governor of
the state of los andes visited caracas and
called on andrade to demand an important
position in the new administration as the
price of peace andrade to his credit be it
said flouted him castro left the yellow
house in a rage sought the councils of an-
drades enemies and after many confer-
ences a general insurrection was arranged
for early the following summer the presi-
dency was to go to the leader who developed
the greatest strength during the campaign
the rise of cepriano castro
astrowent back to his mountain home
k j to discover that his cattle had been
seized and a warrant issued at the instance
of andrades friends for his arrest for cattle-
stealing he resorted to his old trick of
dodging across the border but a similar
warrant was secured from the colombian
government which had no more love for
the indian upstart than had the one at
caracas in fact castro at one time seri-
ously considered starting a revolt in colom-
bia in the hope of gaining the presidency
  with officers of both countries searching
for him he went into hiding and remained
under cover until may   when he
invaded venezuela with a force of sixty
pemiueros so called from the fact that they
were armed with the peinilla a sword shaped
like a scimitar they were the lowest type
of indian but they were brave and hard
fighters his old cattle-rustling neighbors
hailed him with joy for until then they
never had dreamed that any man from the
mountains could become a really important
factor in venezuelan affairs and more than
a thousand of them flocked to his standard
he encountered little opposition and as he
captured successive towns he opened the
prisons and the freed convicts fell in behind
looking for trouble
i
him when he reached valencia less than
one hundred miles from caracas he had an
undisciplined but effective force of 
bloodthirsty brigands general ferrer was
stationed there with  well-equipped
regulars and though he was by no means
enthusiastic in his loyalty to andrade he
did his duty as a soldier according to the
quaint standards of the country
  he marched his men out and surrounded
castro with the exception of a conspicuous
hole through which he could escape and
then went into camp for the night this
proceeding was in strict accord with the
ethics of that strange land except in ex-
treme cases it is the unwritten law that
when a rebel leader is encountered by a su-
perior government force the regulars must
surround him with a great show but be care-
ful to leave a wide hole in their line through
which he can run away during the night
invariably he takes advantage of his oppor-
tunity and it is officially announced that he
escaped of course after a rebel chief-
tain has made several escapes of this kind
and still continues in revolt he is surrounded
in earnest but harsh measures are not re-
sorted to until he has had ample oppor-
tunity to escape or come into camp and
be good
  castro violated all precedents by failing to
run through the hole that had been left for
him when ferrer saw him the next
morning in the middle of the ring calmly
waging for the fight to begin he was non-
plussed he could not understand that
method of warfare and concluding that
castro must be a real hero and perhaps
as he even then claimed to be a genuine
man of destiny he solved the problem
by joining forces with him for which he
was subsequently rewarded by being made
minister of war
castro learned from ferrer that
he was alone in the revolution his
promised partners having failed to
take the field on account of bickerings and
jealousies among themselves this discov-
ery and the addition of ferrers forces gave
him his first really serious notion that he
might become president and he marched
forward in a frenzy of bombastic joy he
picked out a star as his own and ceremoni-
ously worshipped it at victoria only
thirty-five miles outside of the capital he
made terms with general mendoza who
was disgruntled with andrade and picked
up another army
  when the tottering president heard of
this final evidence of disloyalty he boarded
a gunboat at la guayra taking with him
a well-filled treasure-chest and went to
trinidad the alleged warship leaked
badly and andrade who had a sense of
humor sent word back to castro by her
commander to have her repaired at once so
that she would be in better shape for a hur-
ried departure when it came his turn to be
deposed
  by this time the people of venezuela
believing that no one could be worse than
andrade and finding out as had castro
himself what a powerful person he really
was accepted him as their master he en-
tered caracas without opposition october
  and rejecting the modest title of
provisional president which his predeces-
sors had used proclaimed himself jefe
supremo or supreme military leader
  he filled all important posts with men
from the mountains on whose loyalty he
could rely and as they were able to secure
plenty of graft not one penny of which was
overlooked he very soon had a tight hold on
the country one of his first acts was to
release general hernandez he soon found
that the old warrior was too patriotic and
too dangerous to be at large so he slapped
him back into san carlos on the pretense
that he was planning an insurrection and
kept him there for years
  march   castro was elected by
congress to fill out the unexpired part of
andrades term and in the following febru-
ary he was elected constitutional president
then began in earnest his reign of robbery
through the establishment of monopolies
whose profits went to his private purse and
his viciousanti-foreign policy which through
the murders and injustices committed in its
name made the boxer uprising in china
look like a soft-spoken protest
       i was not in caracas to witness the
advent of castro as i had returned
to catalina more than two years be-
fore immediately after crespos funeral
i had come into possession of a block of
stock in the orinoco company which made
it better worth my while to stay with it
but it was only the influence of the jefe
civile that had kept the natives in bounds
before and with the death of my friend
 
adventure
crespo that official suddenly became at
least lukewarm in his loyalty to the law and
to me
  it naturally followed that the natives
overran the concession refused to pay roy-
alty on the balata gum which they carried
off in enormous quantities and stole every-
thing except the headquarters building and
the iron ore which was too heavy and not
worth while extortions of all sorts were
winked at or openly approved as an-
drades unpopularity increased natives took
sides and began to spy on each other with
the result that false and malicious reports
were sent to caracas as to the companys
attitude
  when castro took the field andrade as-
sumed a much more friendly air but it was
too late to be of any value he sent gen-
eral marina up the orinoco to try to arouse
enthusiasm for his cause in the east which
furnishes the only soldiers that can cope
with the hardy mountaineers of the west
mariana told me that if i did my best to
hold my district in line for andrade the
president would grant anything i asked
as soon as the revolt was suppressed at
just about the moment this request was
made andrade was fleeing from la guayra
and castro was assuming full control at
caracas
  castro and the orinoco concession
almost the first thing he did was to
- annul our concession along with a
dozen others on the ground that its terms
had not been complied with as the begin-
ning of his war on all foreigners i denied
this right to cancel our grant especially as it
contained a clause which stipulated that any
disagreement between the government and
the concessionaire should be referred to the
alta corte federal or supreme court for
adjustment as the case had not been
brought before that court i held there could
be no legal annulment even if that power
did rest in the executive which i denied
this contention was subsequently upheld by
the international court of arbitration fol-
lowing the blockade and bombardment of
the allied powers which decided that our
concession was still in full force
  when castro saw that we did not propose
to submit to his arbitrary annulment and
realizing that so long as i remained on the
concession we could claim to be in full pos-
  session he proceeded to harass me in every
conceivable way in the hope of making it too
hot for me under our contract we were
to nominate and pay all of the officers within
our territory and the government was to
appoint them my old chief of police
abreu was arrested and taken away on some
false charge and a new man tinoco in
whose selection i had no voice was sent to
take his place he was i learned a spy and
had orders to send in reports which would
make it appear that the company was stir-
ring up revolts and otherwise violating the
terms of its concession this i discovered
in time to induce tinoco with the aid of
a pistol to sign a statement in which hc-
denied all of his dishonest reports and gave
the company a clean bill of health he died
soon afterward
  castro created a military district knowii
as the territorio delta-amacuro which
took in all of our property and made cata-
lina the capital so that the governor and
the other officials could keep me ufider their
eyes they all had instructions to make
the place so uncomfortable for me that j
would leave fortunately when itrecsved
its concession the company had bought the
land on which its buildings were erected
only the fact that i was an american cit-
izen and held the deeds to the property
restrained them from expelling me by main
force and awkwardness however i could
see trouble coming so i dug rifle-pits under
the porches on the two sides of the hoase
from which we could be attacked i had
plenty of arms and ammunition and about
twenty men of whose bravery and loyalty
i was sure
  i was prohibited from buying anything
at the pidperia or commissary and we were
hard put to it at times for enough to eat
we caught fish in the river and my men
stole out into the woods to hunt at ever
favorable opportunity but the moment they
left our property they exposed themselves
to arrest on some trumped-up charge some-
times we were able surreptitiously to buy
supplies from the natives and we managed
to get along i filed protests at caracas
with the governor and with my company
but they accomplished nothing i was told
by the officials of the company that they
were doing the best they could with repre-
sentations to the state department at
washington and that i would have to do
the best i could and i did it
looking for trouble

the troops were continually spy-
ing on us and annoying us with ficti-
tious charges but it was a year or
more before the government angered by its
failure to get rid of me resorted to extreme
measures a new governor was sent down
with strict orders to remove me by force if
necessary he advanced toward the house
with about seventy-five soldiers i ordered
ray men into the rifle-pits and met the gen-
eral at the gate
  what- do you want i demanded
fiercely
  i beg your pardon replied the com-
mander with all the treacherous suavity of
his race but i have orders to take you
under my care and escort you to trinidad
in order that no injury may come to you
our country is troubled and the govern-
ment is anxious as to your safety
  my compliments to president castro
i told him and assure him that i feel per-
fectly secure here and quite comfortable
ypu can also tell him that i propose to stay
heffe
 that is much to be regretted re-
sponded the still overly polite general for
in that case i have to inform you that my
orders are to arrest you and take you to
trinidad
  in that case i said imitatively 
have to inform you that you will find it
impossible to carry out your orders and
i advise you not to attempt it
  you mean that you will resist arrest
he exclaimed in surprise
  most assuredly i replied this is
my property you have no right to invade
it for  have violated no law of venezuela
if you enter on it i will fire on you
  but he almost shouted as he waved
his arms excitedly toward his ennervated
patiiots my men are here to enforce my
orders you would be insane to resist
you do not know the venezuelan army sir 
you are mistaken i told him i do
know the venezuelan army it is you who
are ignorant you do not know my army
it is because i know both that i have no
fear you have not a shadow of right for
seeking to arrest me and your blood will be
on your own head if you advance
  with this declaration which in keeping
with the comic-opera custom of the country
was delivered with all the dramatic effort
i could throw into it in order that it might
earn- greater weight i retired to the house
we have a little fight
the general could see my rifle-pits but
he did not know how many men they
held nor how well they could shoot after
a short consultation with his staff he gave
the order to advance while he bravely
directed operations from the rear as his
men crossed the line we fired and eight of
them fell they continued to advance and
we fired again dropping nine more of them
while several others were hit that was too
much for them and they broke and ran
leaving seven dead and ten badly wounded
  they did not fire a shot perhaps because
our men were so well concealed that venezu-
elan marksmanship would have accom-
plished nothing against them the gen-
eral and his staff returned in an hour and
asked permission to remove his fallen war-
riors after burying their dead they re-
turned to their steamer and went on up the
river
  in two or three days they came back with
their force slightly increased and the gen-
eral again called on me to surrender under
penalty of being arrested as a disturbing
factor i gave him the same reply as before
and after thinking it over for a while be
marched his troops away again
  that little encounter produced pro-
nounced respect for the americans among
castros soldiers and they did not give us
much trouble afterward though they con-
tinued to annoy us for a time with the
establishment of the blockade of venezuelan
ports by the allies-england germany and
italy-in the latter part of  and the
signing of the peace protocols at washington
early in the following year there came a ces-
sation of hostilities against us so far as
driving us off the concession was concerned
castro seemed to have given up the fight
but on account of the disturbed condition of
the country and the fact that the govern-
ment was known to be inimical to us it was
impossible to do anything of consequence
toward the development of the property
  this enforced idleness eventually became
intolerable and early in  the company
in the meantime having sent one of its offi-
cers to caracas to protect its interests i
returned to new york after having held
the fort for ten years i came back
much poorer in pocket but with a fund of
information regarding venezuela and its
people

adventure
poor venezuelas golden future
i have been in every country in south
america and have studied all of them
and there is no possibility of doubt that
venezuela is beyond comparison the richest
in its natural resources with the setting
up of a firm and civilized government which
must come in the end under an american
protectorate if by no other means all of the
fairy-stories that were told of it centuries
ago will come true and its development will
eclipse all of the dreams that have been real-
ized in our own country
  it is a strange fact that cumana in ven-
ezuela their respective names then being
new toledo and new grenada which was
the first european settlement in south
america of which there is authentic record
was founded one hundred years less one
before the pilgrims landed at plymouth
sock in each case there was a fervent
prayer for divine aid in establishing a chris-
tian colony and building up a great country
vvhy one prayer was answered and the other
was not is a question i will not attempt to
answer
  like her west indian neighbors-of which
beautiful isles americans now know so little
but of which they will know much more
when their flag flies over all of them as it
must within the life of the present genera-
tion-venezuela has been treated most
bountifully by nature and most brutally by
man cursed they all may have been by
the seas of innocent blood in which they
were barbarously bathed during their ex-
tended infancy and their prolonged child-
hood from which they have not yet
merged it seems that all the powers of
darkness have conspired to retard their
growth and hold them slaves to savagery
accustomcd from the days of the spanish
cmquistadores and the pirates who followed
them to being plundered and persecuted in
every way that the mercenary mind of man
could devise the venezuelans have grown
so hardened to turmoil and torture that it has
become second nature to them to live in an
atmosphere which generates riot and robbery
their blood is an unholy mixture of
indian carib and spanish with other and
more recent strains of all sorts they are
the most inconsequential emotional un-
grateful and treacherous people on the face
of the earth-and yet i love them the
ambition of their leaders runs only to graft
while the underlings yearn for war as a child
cries for a plaything at the behest of some
self-constituted chieftain who has strutted
in front of a mirror until he imagines him-
self a second simon bolivar they rise in
rebellion because it gives them a chance to
prey on the country and if their revolt is
successful to continue and extend their prey-
ing but some day a real man will rise up
among them and lead them out of their
blackness and butchery into peace and pros-
perity and venezuela with her wild waste
of wealth will become great beyond the
imaginings of her discoverers
this is not the full story of my life
but it tells some of the incidents
that i have enjoyed the most my
best fight was with old moy sen the pirate
long in the china sea and my closest
call was when i was sentenced to be shot at
sunrise in santo domingo these events
supplied the most delightful feasts of the
excitement which my nature has ever
craved yet i have lived well in that respect
all along i have fought under nineteen
flags and i am proud of the fact that i gave
to each of them and to every one of my
undertakings in a life-long search for adven-
ture the best that was in me
  i have no disappointments and no regrctss
except that this existence is too short if j
had my life to live over again it would be
lived in the same way though i would
hope with a still greater share of excite-
ment because it was for just such a life that
i was created what the purpose of it was
i neither know nor care nor am i in the
least concerned as to what my destiny next
holds in store for me i hope however
that in some land with opportunity for
wide activity i will be reincarnated as a
filibuster and a buccaneer and that i will so
continue until my identity is merged into a
composite mass of kindred souls
ft
j w woke suddenly in a strange
i place-a long room with light oak
i carving i was lying on soft
l-m -j cushions on the floor a rug had
been thrown over me but i was dressed
there were two long rows of sleepers-men
women and children-and a number was
put at the head of each mine was -
 london one or two numbers had
a name underneath but mine was not there
it was elsie anderson if i remembered my-
self rightly but my memories did not
come readily
  my left-hand neighbor was holding my
wrist he was   government george
raynor i remembered the name and
when i raised myself on one elbow to take
a good look at his face i remembered
him i had met him once at an at-home
he was a nice fellow and i liked him he
had said that he hoped wc should meet
again
  next i noticed a manuscript in my right
hand i pulled it out and read the title
the history of the years of sleep iqi-
 by george raynor
  i gave a sharp cry if it was  had
slept for four years i made an effort to
remember what happened to me i was
going to town for a singing-lesson and there
were swarms of little green flies at dulwich
station they stung people and the people
whom they stung fainted i screamed and
tried to beat off the flies with my handker-
chief but they flew upon me-and tht was
the last thing i remembered i must have
fainted and the faint had lasted for four
years perhaps longer for more years
might have passed since mr raynor
wrote the history
  how had i come to this placer where was
it who were the other sleepers why
did he put the book under my pillow why
did he hold my hand i guessed that it was
a big hospital or building where they had
put the sleepers for their security and
i thought that mr raynor had brought me
chere because he knew me and that he held
my hand because he expected me to be
lightened when i woke alone i was
frightened-so frightened that i dared not
move or call for i did not know what
might have happened in all these years and
something dreadful must have come again
to send mr raynor to sleep
 i lay still for a long time shivering and
listening i heard no sound but the faint
breathing of the sleepers i thought that
every one but myself must be asleep then
i heard a howling somewhere outside the
bowling of wild beasts it came nearer and
nearer till at last it was outside the window
the window seemed to be a good way above
the ground but i wasnt sure i clung to
mr raynors arm and begged him to wake
but he did not stir he and the rest were
evidently in a deep faint or stupor i gave
a scream and then i fainted too the
noise had gone when i recovered
  as soon as i was able to tise i got up and
staggered to the door but dared not open
it i staggered toward the windows but
dared not look out i feared to find the
world in the possession of the howling
beasts or of some unknown monsters i
went and shook mr raynor again and
by owen oliver


adventure
called in his ear entreating him to wake but
without the slightest effect
  i sat down again on my cushions-i
seemed to have been made more confortable
than any one else and i was sure that i had
to thank mr raynor for that-and took up
the history but i was afraid to read it
and learn what horrible things had come to
pass-perhaps to find that i was all alone
i prayed a prayer that some one might be
still waking in the world and come to me
and then i heard voices in the passage
  at first i thought they came in answer to
my prayer but after listening for a few
moments some instinct checked the call on
my lips i went cold with fear and lay
down hastily and covered myself and the
book with the rug and pretended to sleep
they are enemies i told myself ene-
mies if they should come in-
  they came in and i peeped at them under
my eyelashes they were a red-faced eld-
erly man and a gray-haired lady with
a pale handsome face and cold cruel eyes
it was she whom i feared i think i should
have spoken to the man if he had been
alone though i did not like him
rjjs since you will see himhe said
mf speaking as if she had annoyed him
there he is he jerked his head
toward mr raynor and she knelt beside
the unconscious sleeper
  he is due to wake in three days
yes he answered and the girl the
day after according to the books but the
reinoculations do not always last their full
time you know she might happen to rouse
a day sooner two or three days even
oh she said the woman scornfully
she doesnt matter she goes to-night
with the rest of them
  you cant dispose of themall the man
protested we must have some to fight
the cursed wolves its no use shaking your
head we must i tell you we neednt
rouse them all but i cant get along without
a few thousand men the beasts are get-
ting too much for me you know what it
was like coming here
  yes yes she said you can have
your men but we dont want women at
any rate not her she dies to-night
very well he said rather sulkily  the
women can go-those of this batch youll
have to save some of the later sections or
youll have a mutiny but it doesnt mat-
ter about her in particular shes just an
ordinary stupid pretty girl so far as i can
see the only point is that he has an infatu-
ation about her the important question
is what are you going to do about him
i rather like die chap but-
  i dont know she said rocking herself
to and fro  he has disobeyed three times
i gave my word that the third time he
should die- he is so like my son 
  i suppose the red-faced man com-
mented your son was like you if he is
and he wakes and finds that you have made
away with this  london of his
hell kill you if you must wake him why
not wake the girl and let him have her
hell be all right then if you kill her and
spare him hell be our worst enemy i warn
you
   hed be my enemy anyhow the woman
said bitterly he would not serve me as
i need service for his own life or even for
hers they must go to-night with the rest
of their batch keep  men-no
women and children  of them in
london the rest in the usual propor-
tions telegraph at once yes he must
die but hes like my son
  she bent and kissed him laughing a
strange laugh it reminded me of the
howling of the beasts then she rose
  my last weakness she said its
over i shall go on to the end now do not
fear
  ive never feared anything all my life
except you the red-faced man said
sometimes i think youre the salvation of
the world sometimes i think youre the
devil i dont know
  i dont know myself said the gray-
haired woman
  then they went and i fainted again
when i came to i judged from
the light that it was the after-
noon i felt weak and ill and very
thirsty and so terrified that i could not
think properly i believe i should have
simply lain still and waited to be killed if
mr raynor had not been before my eyes
and if i had not felt sure that i owed my
life so far to him
  they shall not kill you i declared and
sat up and clenched my teeth and hands
and made myself consider what i could do
to save him i decided that the first step
was to read the history which would proba-
the awakening

biy enable me to understand the situation
better
  it was a long story-far too long to set
down here but the main points were these
  the fly-but some people said it was
a poison-dust not an insect-appeared
everywhere all over the world august 
 and stung people into a dense stupor
nearly all the inhabitants of the earth went
into the sleep the account said those
who remained awake were almost all clever
cruel people they formed new govern-
ments and called the head people pow-
ers the chief power in england was the
gray-haired woman her name was ash-
bury she did not wish the sleepers to
wake because she wanted to go on ruling
so she proposed to kill them the power
of the world an american jew named
abrahams who had been a hotel-keeper
and considered a bad and unscrupulous
man but who was really a good one
would not agree to this but when the
sleepers seemed likely to wake he had to
inoculate them to make them sleep longer
because there wasnt food for them
  ee tried to grow food but the harvests
were bad and the dogs who had become
tike wolves from hunger overran the coun-
try there were pestilences and storms and
those who woke were in great trouble
out at last there was a good harvest and
after most of it had been sown for the next
year he thought it would produce enough to
keep everybody so he persuaded most of
the wakers to go to sleep too until it
would be ready so as to economize sup-
plies that was how mr raynor came to
go to sleep he did not know if he would
wake for the chief power was plotting
to depose the power of the world and if
she did she was sure to kill mostof the
sleepers
  he had rescued me and the disobedi-
ences for which she wished to kill him were
all  my account there was a chief
physician and he was a good man and had
helped him and liked me he was one
of those left awake he said that he
meant to dance at my wedding with mr
raynor the history made it quite plain
that mr raynor was in love with me
he called me pretty little  lon-
don the sleepers had all been num-
bered and i suppose the wakers had
been numbered first because mr raynor
was r
ii
      i decided at once that-i would
jgf try to find the chief physician
        the history said that he lived in the
building where we slept it was the war
office
  i opened the door and looked into a very
long corridor paneled with brown wood
it was quite empty i lifted mr raynor in
my arms and staggered out with him and
went up-stairs on the walls there were
printed plans of the floor there were only
numbers on them but one or two had been
written across in red ink captain of
guard and so on on the top floor i
round chief physician marked on one
  i opened the door and staggered in
mr raynor was big and heavy and i am
only small i was so exhausted that i fell
and then i heard a voice-a kind voice that
did not frighten me  ----- london
good girl
  water i begged water
i cant move my dear the voice said
 wiped my eyes and looked up and saw
a gentleman rather like my father bound to
a chair and i got up somehow and tried to
untie him
  youll never do it with those little fin-
gers he said theres a penknife in my
waistcoat pocket left hand my left the
lower one thats right
  i cut the knots and he got up and stag
gered about stamping and shaking bimscii
to get rid of his stiffness he asked if  had
read the history and i said yes and he
told me what had happened afterward
  mrs ashbury had gone to america will
a shipful of armed men to try to kill the
power of the world but he had been pre-
pared and had taken them by surprise as
they were landing and defeated them
  so she and those who were left had come
back in another ship she had broken away
from the other governments and those in
england who did not agree with her had fled
abroad or had been killed unless it was
a party in lancashire led by a suffragette
lady who had been one of the powers
under mrs ashbury but would never agree
to harming the sleeper he did not know
her fate mrs ashbury and her followers
meant to wake only enough of the sleepers
to fight the wolves-and perhaps a few
women and children later-and to kill the
rest he had refused to help in the slaugh-

adventure
ter and they had to get another doctor to
help them so they threatened to kill him
with the first batch that very night
   im afraid they will little one he said
and you too we might possibly get
away by ourselves but not with-our
burden he shook his head at mr ray-
nor whom i had lifted on a couch i
dont suggest your going alone he added
because-
   because if i would im not worth sav-
ingi said no of course i wouldnt leave
him and you wouldnt because-he trusted
you and i do but cant you wake him
no not till the three days are up we
must try to save him till then
  he considered for a long while with his
chin on his hand
i can think of only one way he told
me at last and i fear it requires courage
beyond your power my brave little lady
if there is only one way i said of
course i must try what is it 
  he did not answer my question at once
but thought again staring at me as if he
did not see mei
ibp i want you to understand the
spf situation he said it is fairer
      and besides you may see some
better plan it would be possible to get
out of this building there are guards at
the doors but we could get through a
window on the ground floor there are
thousands of empty houses where we
could hide if we once got away and if we
escaped the wolves-and the human wolves
the followers of the chief power if you
and i were alone there would be a chance
a poor one but i think our best with our
friend here to carry there would be no
chance at all of escaping so a howling
rose in the distance and he took me to the
window looking down whitehall to big
ben lookl he said and i looked and
clung to him
  a large party of armed men-about two
hundred-were coming from parliament
street in our direction innumerable wolves
-dogs of all kinds and sizes and yet
changed from dogs-were following some-
times they approached so near that the men
faced round with fixed bayonets or axes
sometimes a few ran by the side of the party
and snapped at men till they were stabbed
and then the other wolves rushed upon
them and devoured them
    they go in flocks he told me  but they
rush down all the streets in turn and with
our friend to carry we could never get away
from them or from the patrols no we
cant escape that way
  what is your plan i asked
  we might hide in chimneys or under
the floors but they would be sure to trace
us its a poor plan
  yes i agreed what zs your plan
he looked at me again for a long while
then he told me
  that you should go back to your places
he said and let them think that they
kill you they propose to do it by injecting
poison if they have not changed its pre-
scription-you must risk that-i can inocu-
late you with an antidote it will take
away all power to move and a good deal of
your sensibility not all you will suffer-
suffer in body and in mind my poor child
but you will live in a day or so you and
he will wake you are both young and
active and he is bold and resourceful
they will probably give up watching the
dead you may escape then-escape i
hope to a long and happy life together
    and you  i asked  you dear friend 
oh well he said i had to die any-
how
   i will take no chance of safety that you
do not share  i declared he would not
if he were alive-awake i mean i answer
for his honor and he shall not wake to find
that i deserted you
  i shall go out and chance escaping the
wolves he stated you see it would be
no use inoculating myself when they
found me unbound and yet unconscious
they might suspect my plan and-and
make sure of me probably of you and of
him too
  they shall not find you unbound 
said i will bind you as i found you and
inoculate you then i will inoculate him
and then myself and when i wake-if 
wake-i will come to you
  ah my dear he said you are
brave but are you brave enough
  i have to be i said
  we ate and drank then we carried
mr raynor back to his place and the
chief physician inoculated him showing me
how to do it he marked the place on his
own flesh and mine when we went to his
room he kissed my forehead the
good god strengthen you he prayed
the awakening

then he sat in his chair and  bound him
if we live i will be a daughter to you
i promised and he will be a son then
i inoculated him he went quickly into
a stupor
  hide-the syringe-before you-go-
too-numb he gasped faintly then he
said no more even his eyes did not move
but they were open and i believed that he
could still see and hear
  i shall be brave i told him do not
doubt me
  i kissed his forehead and went out into
the deathly stillness of the empty corridors
and back to my place i must have
screamed if i had not bitten my lips
 the good god must have given me
strength as the chief physician said for
i never faltered in my resolution i wrote
on the history what had happened so that
mr raynor might go and rescue the chief
physician if he woke and i did not after
that  sat by him for a few moments with
my arm round his neck and my face
against his
  i hardly know you i said but you
love me and i love you god help us
dear
  then i lay down covered myself with the
rug dug the syringe into my flesh and
pumped in the antidote i -only just suc-
ceeded in removing it the numbness came
on so quickly then i lay waiting mo-
tionless unable to stir an eyelid or make
 soiufd and yet dimly conscious of every-
thing round me-more than dimly conscious
of fear the light grew dimmer and dim-
mer i heard the wolves howl four times
before i became unable to distinguish mr
raynors iacc once more and then it was
quite dark i heard them howl three times
more and then the death-dealers came
talking to one another unconcernedly as if
they went about some routine task
  there were eight of them two women
and a man carried lanterns three men had
large syringes a lad carried a pail of fluid
from which they replenished them the
rcd-faced man watched they went along
the room in pairs one holding the lantern
while the other knelt by the sleeper and
made the injection-two strokes of the
piston with a pause between one pair
came to mr raynor and another to me at
the same time  was too numb to feel
pain when the great syringe dug deeply into
my flesh but it was well for me that i could
not scream as it was i made a faint
sound
  must have been near waking the in-
jector said putting the rug over my shoul-
ders again well shes safe for another
four months evidently he had not been
told that he was administering anything but
the usual sleeping-injection to the credit
of my countrymen and countrywomen i
would record that it is now clear that mrs
ashbury deceived them about her inten-
tions and that very few of them realized
that she intended to kill the sleeping world
  make him quite safe the red-haired
man commanded nodding toward mr ray-
nor hes a dangerous man
  hes had the usual dose the operator
answered the chief physician always
said that more ras dangerous
  the red-faced man made no comment
and they passed on finished their work and
went out the wolves howled right under
the window just then soon afterward i
went to sleep i felt as if a weight were
crushing me and i thought that perhaps the
antidote had failed i did not seem to care
about myself-it would be good to be at
rest i thought-only about mr raynor and
the chief physician
ill
in the early light i woke in great
pain i remembered that the chief
physician had said that i should
suffer i was glad that mr raynor was
unconscious i thought that if i woke fully
i should wake mad presently some men
came in and i feared that i should go mad
in my stupor
  they dad not look at mr raynor or me
some one called out  and -
s and they carried off two sleepers both
big men i suppose they were selected to
wake and fight the wolves
  you can leave the doors open the
voice called the wolves wont matter
now
  then i think i did go mad for a time
i seemed to be struggling with a tempest of
pain and fright till i became unconscious
once more
  i woke still racked by sharp pains to find
the gray-haired woman kneeling beside
ijr raynor she was crying i tried to
call to beg her to keep out the wolves but no
sound would come when she went how-

adventure
ever she closed the door i forgot my
pains in my thankfulness that we were safe
from the wolves and slipped back into
sleep sometimes i roused a jit tie at a pang
of pain or rather after it for i knew that
i had been hurt rather than felt it some-
times i dreamed of green fields and brooks
and music sometimes i dreamed that
stones were being heaped and heaped on me
  the dawn of another day was beginning
when i became fully conscious again the
pains - were not so violent and presently
they left me almost entirely i could not
hear mr raynor breathe but i thought
that he did the others were still-quite
still i could not speak but i could move
my eyelids i blinked and blinked pres-
ently i could move a little finger then all
my fingers gradually the use of my limbs
returned and i sat up aching all over-not
violently but with a kind of cramp and
feeling as if i had just come to from  gas  at
the dentists
  mr raynor was still sleeping and the
chief physician had said that he would not
wake until some time after us so i was
not worried on his account after i had
ascertained that he really breathed-which
was the first thing i did i was too weak to
lift him and i thought that probably the
guards below were gone and the wolves
so i decided to go up-stairs alone and untie
our kind friend if he still lived in case i
should never return i wrote on the cover of
the history and put it beside mr raynor
  i have gone for the chief physician if i do not
return i shall have died if we live i will do what
you wish god bless you  london
                          elsie anderson
  the corridors were empty but i felt sure
that i heard wolves upon the floors below
so i ran as fast as my shaking legs would
carry me i found the chief physician
alive and evidently coming to but not able
to speak i unbound him and rubbed his
hands and bathed his face in about half
an hour he could just stand then i heard
a sound in the corridor pit-pat pit-patt
i shut the door and the wolf came and
scratched at it and whined and barked it
went away and came again at last the
chief physician stumbled to a cupboard
and got two axes and two revolvers
  take some for him i proposed for of
course i knew that we should go down to
air raynor at all risks
  he wont wake yet our friend assured
me its no use burdening ourselves
we shall have to fight our way i expect
he seemed quite cheerful at the prospect of
the struggle use the ax when you can
and take the revolver in your left hand
well settle this one first ill jam his head
in the door get ready
  he opened the door a little the wolf-
it had been a big bull terrier-forced its
head through the opening and i brought
the ax down
  thats one said the chief physician
come on and we went out strange
to say i had no fear i felt like a machine
  there were no other wolves on the two
upper floors but some were coming up the
stairs from the second floor where mr ray-
nor was they retreated before us growl-
ing and snarling about twenty waited at
the foot of the stairs we had to reach
a door some twenty yardsalong the corridor
we shot three of the beasts and the others
fell upon them then we made a rush and
reached the room one wolf tore my dress
but the chief physician killed him an-
other got half through the door after us and
caught the chief physicians boot but i
blew out its brains
  mr raynor was breathing very faintly
the chief physician listened to his heart
and felt his pulse he shook his head sev-
eral times and i gasped for breath
  i do not know the exact effect of the
poison and the antidote on a sleeper he
said at last i hope he will wake but-
i do not know i have done my best
elsie
   you have done your best i said  your
very best dear friend but if he does not
live i do not want to is there nothing you
can do nothing
  if i could get a stimulant from my
room he said it might help him there
is nothing really wrong it is a question
whether his heart is strong enough to out-
last the struggle between the poison and the
antidote the heart beats more feebly in
the sleep you see arc you brave enough
to be left 
  i am brave enough not to let you go
alone i answered
  we went to the door and peeped out
the wolves had gone so we decided to
take mr raynor up-stairs again carrying
him between us
  we were half-way up the first stairs when
the awakening

we heard a terrific howling overhead and the
shouts of men and a few women the
wolves had evidently gone up above and
the  wakers had gone by another way and
were pursuing them in force the fight for
which the chief power had awakened some
of the slumberers was beginning shots
were fired and we heard the blows of axes
the wolves seemed to be running along the
corridor to the stairs
  back to the rooml the chief physician
cried but as we reached the corridor the
voice of the chief power rose above the
others and with one accord we fled down
the next staircase for we thought that she
might come in the room to look again at
mr raynor we feared her more than all
the wolves
  we reached the main hall breathless and
staggering with our burden and then the
wolves overtook us they were too terri-
fied to do any harm but swept on like a
sea knocking us down on the slippery tiled
floor and running over us the pursuers
followed in the rear smiting with their axes
till the wolves were killed or had got
through the doorway running over one an-
other three four five high then we sat
up and the guards formed between us and
the doorway waiting for orders from the
gray-haired woman
  she stood at the foot of the white marble
stairs with little streams of red blood run-
ning down them and faced us she was
motionless like the statue of some evil
deity mr raynor opened his eyes and
moved his lips the chief physician and i
knelt holding him between us he smiled
faintly at me and i smiled at him putting
my arm round him and drawing him against
me
  we live for a moment together i whis-
pered and perhaps-afterward for
i saw in her eyes that she would kill us
  there was a long silencc and all waited
with their eyes on her
  she moved her lips silently before she
spoke she addressed the chief physician
   traitor  she said in a clear stem voice
traitor to us all  she turned to the rest
he cabled to abrahams she told them
and there was a fierce murmur
  yes the chief physician told her i
cabled to the power of the world-your
master and mine it is you who are the
traitor-traitor and murderess
  your power of the world has not come
she taunted him he does not govern
england and you are a traitor to your
country
  you are  traitor to mankind he
answered  he mil come and then he will
kill you
  and now she said very quietly i will
kill you
   i expected nothing else be said  but
if there is a spark of womanhood or human-
ity in you- he was going to ask her
to spare us but she cut him short
  there is none she said for traitors
kill them
  the crowd advanced upon us but she
made a quick motion with her hand take
them outside she commanded passing her
hands over her eyes she sank on the mar-
ble steps with her dress dabbling in the
blood and the men seized us and dragged
us through the doors our arms were
round one another and they did not sepa-
rate us
  all in vain the chief physician mut-
tered your courage and yours
  and yours said mr raynor old
friend
  no i said not in vain not in vain
my dears there will be an awakening
and i kissed my lover and my friend and
they kissed me
iv
and then we passed through die
doorway and the wolves rushed
upon us like a stormy sea there
were thousands of them-tens and tens of
thousands wolves that had once been dogs
all kinds all sizes they covered the wide
road and more for they ran on top of one an-
other they came from both directions
and from each way a great army of men and
women pursued them in serried ranks axes
in hand-axes dripping red
  the guards dropped us and ran within the
doors the wolves knocked us down as
before and swarmed over us swarmed in
heaps that crushed us and almost stifled us
rose like a great wave to the top of the door-
way and fell in one wave after another
  i caught a glimpse of the marble stairway
and wolves were pouring down that spring-
ing at the throa ts of those who tried to pass
up it i saw the gray-haired woman fall
with a dozen holding her shrieks and
shrieks and shrieks came from inside

adventure
  outside the men and women coming
both from charing cross and from west-
minster slew and slew every now and
then a rush of the wolves-those that were
not driven into the building or killed-swept
them off their legs the men and women
closed up again and still slaughtered i can
see one little fair-haired woman now smit-
ing and smiting and smiting she was a
mistress from my old school and she had
always been such a gentle little thing but
the wolves had killed her child
  they killed the heap on top of us throw-
ing them aside as they slew them and smit-
ing the next we rose red with the slaugh-
ter and a man also red held out his hand
to the chief physician-a stout panting
disheveled old jew man who seemed to be
directing everybody
  you are the chief physician he said
 arent you they showed me your photo
i am abrahams i came at your call
  they stood there forgetting every one but
themselves and talked while the others
went into the war office to finish the last of
the wolves they would have slain the
human wolves too i think if any had
been -left but there were none they
knew the chief power only by her dress
  the power of the world told how he had
come with a handful of men at the chief
physicians summons if england did not
rise to support him he must die he knew
 we run that risk every day he said and
i believed in england his belief had
been justified the people had gone over to
him everywhere as soon as they knew what
mrs ashbury intended and though hun-
dreds of thousands of sleepers had been
poisoned under her orders-her tools mostly
believing that they were merely using the
sleeping injection-he had been in time to
stop most of the slaughter
  about thirty thousand of the first batch
of sleepers had already roused and joined
him he was clearing away the wolves and
seeking mrs ashbury and the remains of
her government-who it seemed had not
heard of his arrival-to clear them away
too but their fellow-wolves had done it
for him
  we are saved he declared if we can
get through the next few days we have
to draft the people to their homes without
losing trace of them and to get the food sup-
plies distributed to them we must work
work work nothing like work said the
stout disheveled big old jew man who
looked like a butcher i had expected
a noble patriarch and i felt disappointed in
him-then now i know that he is greater
than all the rest
  mr raynor and i had said little all the
time only held hands tightly and looked
into each others eyes
  you are mine he said dear-i dc
not know your name but you are mine
  it is elsie i told him yes i am
yours
  and then the chief physician touched tbe
arm of the power of the world
  here are two of our best he said
they will work
  the power of the world held out his
hands to us and smiled and then he seemed
no longer an old jew and something more
than a man
  you are doing the best work in the
world he told us just loving never
leave off my dears
  that was his text and the battle-cry that
led us through the struggle of the next fort-
night for the love of those who sleep
he urged when some grumbled at our priva-
tions  for the love of those who suffered
to save you he told those who woke when
their weakened bodies halted at their labors
-for we worked till we dropped in those
days for the love of your old leader
he pleaded when even we who were round
him thought his counsels too hard
  his last words as power of the world- i
the speech by which he restored the old
rulers and resigned all power and place-
were the same
  the best work in the world be said
 is the work thatall can do-just to love one
another i have done only that but if you
think you owe anything to me who owe
everything to my faithful followers if you
think that the waking of the world is due in
any part to my efforts make it a world of
love and good-fellowship-a world that was
worth making
  and so because ail the world loved him
every country all over the earth passed one

mr ashton
       he dull october afternoon was
rapidly drawing to a dose as i
passed through the village of
pinhoe and set my steps rather
wearily toward exeter i had conceived
the idea some time before of walking from
london to torquay and my chief concern
at the moment was to decide whether or not
i could cover the intervening five miles and
reach the half moon hotel in high street
before the impending storm broke
  i had left pinhoe perhaps half a mile to
the rear when the strong southwest gale
whipped into my face some drops of cold
stinging rain as i hesitated uncertain
whether to go forward in the face of the
gale or to beat a hasty retreat to the vil-
lage i heard behind me the sound of an
approaching automobile
  it slowed up and a voice inquired whether
i could point out the way to major tem-
ples place i glanced up and saw a tall
heavily built man of perhaps some forty
years of age bronzed and rugged with the
mark of the traveler upon him and al-
though his face at first impressed me un-
pleasantly the impression was dispelled in
part at least by his peculiarly attractive
smile i informed him that i was myself a
comparative stranger to that part of eng-
land he then asked if i were going toward
exeter and on my affirmative reply at
once invited me to get into the car as he
could carry me at least the major part of
my way
  he was a good looking fellow of a sort
with a somewhat sensuous face and i fell
certain that his short stubby black mus-
tache concealed a rather cruel mouth evi-
dently a man to gain his ends i thought
without being over nice about the means he
employed


adventure
  presently he turned to me i under-
stand he said  that major temples place
is upon the main road about half a mile
this side of exeter there is a gray stone
gateway and a lodge i shall try the first
entrance answering that description
  i suggested that i should leave the car as
toon as we reached the gateway in question
and continue upon foot the balance of my
way my companion nodded and we rode
in silence for a few moments suddenly
with a great swirl of dead leaves and a
squall of cold rain the storm broke upon us
and a moment later we turned without
stopping into a handsome gray stone gate-
way and up a long straight gravel road
bordered on each side by a row of beautiful
oaks i glanced up in some surprise but he
only smiled and nodded so i said no more
realizing that be could hardly set me down
in the face of such a storm
  a quarter of a mile through a fine park
and a swift turn brought us up under the
porte-cochrc of a large gray stone house of
 peculiar and to me somewhat gloomy and
unattractive appearance the rain and
wind were now so bad that i saw it would
be useless to attempt to proceed against it
and after a short wait the door was thrown
open bv a servant and we hurriedly entered
we found ourselves in a large
dimly lighted hallway i in-
spected with considerable curios-
ity the man who had admitted us not only
because of his oriental appearance-he was a
chinaman of the better sort-but also be-
cause he was dressed in his native garb he
upon his part showed not the slightest in-
terest in our coming as he inspected us with
his childlike sleepy eyes
  tell major temple said my friend
that mr robert ashton is here and-
he turned to me with a questioning glance-
owen morgan i replied wondering if
he would know me by name if he did he
showed no sign
  just so-mr owen morgan he con-
tinued then strode toward a log fire which
crackled and sputtered cheerily upon the
hearth of a huge stone fire-place
  im afraid im rather presuming upon
the situation i suggested when i had
joined him but perhaps the storm will
slacken up presently
major temple will be glad to see you
im sure rejoined mr ashton uncon-
cernedly you cant possibly go on you
know
  im afraid not i answered a bit un-
graciously
  the major is a queer oid character
mr ashton remarked great traveler
and collector im here on a matter of busi-
ness myself-partly at least hell be
glad to meet you i fancy hes a bit lonely
with nobody to keep him company but his
daughter here he comes now
  he turned toward a tall spare man with
gray hair and drooping gray mustaches
his face like ashtons had the dull bumt-
in tone of brown which is acquired only by
long exposure to the sun and which usually
marks its possessor as a traveler in the hot
countries
  ah ashton exclaimed the major
dropping his monocle delighted to sec
you you arrived yesterday
  late yesterday you see i lost no time
in coming to report the result of my quest
  and you were successful demanded
the older man excitedly
  entirely so replied ashton with a
smile of satisfaction
  good good the major rubbed his
hands and smiled then apparently ob-
serving me for the first time glanced at
mr ashton with a slight frown and an in-
terrogative expression
   mr owen morgan said ashton iightly
on his way to exeter with me i took
the liberty of bringing him in on aceouni
of the storm
  i am ready to go on at once i inter-
jected stiffly as soon as the rain lets up
a bit
  nonsense nonsenses the majors
voice was somewhat testy you cant
possibly proceed on a night like this
make yourself at home sir any friend of
mr ashtons is welcome here he turned
to one of the servants who had entered the
roomto turn on the lights show mr
ashton and mr morgan to their rooms
gibson youll be wanting to fix up a bit
before dinner he announced
  which rooms sir shall i show the gen-
tlemen to asked the man a trifle un-
easily i thought
  the major looked at ashton and laughed
ashton be said you know i took this
place only a short time ago on my return
from my last trip to the east and as we do
not have many visitors its a bit musty and
the emerald buddha

out of shape queer old house i fancy
supposed to be haunted or something of the
sort i imagine it wont worry you much
hardly replied my companion ive
outgrown ghosts lead on to the haunted
chamber
  the major turned to the servant  show
the gentlemen to the two rooms in the west
wing gibson-the green room will suit
mr ashton i fancy and perhaps mr
morgan will find the white-and-gold room
across the hall comfortable for the night
i found my room a large and fairly com-
fortable one and busied myself in making
such preparations for dinner as i could
with the few requisites my small knapsack
contained
after a considerable time i heard
the musical notes of a chinese gong
and making my way to the stair-
case i saw ashton just joining a strikingly
beautiful and distinguished looking girl of
perhaps twenty-two or -three dressed in an
evening gown of white the very simplicity
of which only served to accentuate the
splendid lines of her figure with her
splendid eyes and wide brow crowned with
a mass of bronze-colored hair i felt that
even my critical artistic taste could with
difficulty find a flaw it was evident that
she and mr ashton knew each other well
yet it seemed to me that miss temple did
not respond with much cordiality to his
ffysive greeting
  as i joined them major temple pre-
sented me as a friend of mr ashtons
which it appeared to me did not predispose
that young lady particularly in my favor
chapter h
an appeal for help
during dinner the two men talked
continually of china and referred fre-
quently to it and to the stone i at-
tempted to carry on a conversation with
miss temple but she seemed laboring under
intense excitement and unable to give my
efforts any real attention as near as i
could gather ashton had set out from hong
kong some months before on a search for
a certain stone or jewel which major temple
desired for his collection and after an adven-
turous trip during which he had been forced
at the risk of his life to remain disguised as
a coolie for some weeks had finally escaped
and returned to england
  there was also some talk of a reward
which seemed to give mr ashton great sat-
isfaction and to cause major temple much
uneasiness for i saw him glance frequently
at the blanched face of his daughter
   as mr ashton brought his thrilling story
to a conclusion he drew from his waistcoat
pocket a small green leather case evi-
dently of chinese workmanship and turned
out upon the white cloth a miniature repre-
sentation of the god buddha above an inch
and a half in height and wonderfully cut
from a single flawless emerald
   as the wonderful sparkling gem flashed
across the white cloth in the direction of
miss temple an expression of intense horror
passed over her face as she caught the burn-
ing eyes of mr ashton fixed upon hers
she returned his gaze defiantly for a mo-
ment then lowered her eyes and composed
her features behind the cold and impassive
mask she had worn throughout the evening
   ashton flushed a sullen red then picked
up the jewel and set it carelessly upon the
top of a cut-glass salt-cellar and i was
startled to see the wooden impassive face of
the chinese servant light up with a glare of
sudden anger and alarm as he caught sight
of the jewel major temple observing
him at the same moment quickly covered
the figure with his hand and the chinaman
resuming almost instantly his customary
look of childlike unconcern proceeded to
offer us cigars and cigarettes as miss temple
rose and left the table i excused myself
feeling superfluous and strolled into the
great hall where i stood with my back to the
welcome fire listening to the howling of the
storm withbut
   perhaps fifteen minutes later miss tem-
ple came quickly into the hall the beauty of
her delicate mobile face marred by evident
mental suffering
   you are a friend of mr ashtons she
said as she came up to me have you
known him long 
   miss temple i am afraid i can hardly
claim to be a friend of mr ashtons
i never met him before this afternoon
  but i thought you came with him
she said
   i explained my presence and mentioned
my work
  then you are owen morgan the illus-
trator she cried i know your work

adventure
very well and i am delighted tq meet-you
i was afraid you too were in the conspir-
acy her face darkened again
  the conspiracy i asked much mysti-
fied
  miss temple looked apprehensively to-
ward the door then her eyes sought mine
i am all alone here mr morgan she
said at last and  need a friend very
badly i wonder if i can depend upon you
-trust you 
  i was surprised but assured her i should
be only too happy to serve her in any
way
  but what is it that you fear i in-
quired
  my father she said hurriedly at
the same time lowering her voice is a
madman on the subject of jewels he
would give anything-anything to pos-
sess some curio upon which he had set his
desires last year in china he saw by
accident the emerald you have just seen
it was the sacred rehc of a buddhist temple
in ping yang and is said to have come from
the holy city of lhasa in thibet his offers
to purchase it were laughed at and when he
persisted he was forced to leave the city to
avoid trouble
  in hong kong he made the acquaint-
ance of this man ashton a sort of agent and
collector mr ashton persecuted me with
his attentions in spite of my repeated re-
fusals to marry him imagine my amaze-
ment then when my father on our arrival
in englaixd told me that he had commis-
sioned mr ashton to obtain the emerald
buddha for him and had agreed in the
event of his success to give him my hand in
marriage
  my prayers my appeals were all
equally useless he informed me that mr
ashton was a gentleman-that he had given
him his word and could not break it i was
forced into a semi-acquiescence to the ar-
rangement believing that mr ashton could
never succeed in his mad attempt when
suddenly my father received word that
mr ashton had arrived at southampton
yesterday i shall never marry robert
ashton-never i do not know what my
father will ask of me but if he asks that
i shall leave this house to-morrow and i beg
that you will take me with you until i can
find some occupation that will enable me tc
support myself
  her story filled me with the deepest
astonishment  thrust out jny hand and
grasped hers you can depend upon me
absolutely i exclaimed my mother is
at torquay she will be glad to welcome
you miss temple
  thank you thank you she cried in her
deep earnest voice  do not leave in the
morning until i have seen you good-
night
  at the stairway she threw back a smile of
such sweet gratitude and relief that i felt
amply repaid for my promise
suddenly my attention was at-
tracted by the sound of loud voices
coming from the direction of the
dining-room as though major temple and
his guest were engaged in a violent quarrel
then mr ashton burst into the hall fol-
lowed by major temple both of them ex-
cited and angry
  i hold you to your contract the
former shouted by-- youll live up
to it or ill know the reason why
  ill pay-it ill pay cried major
temple angrily but not a penny to
boot
  ashton turned and faced him dont
you realize that that emerald is worth a
hundred thousand pounds you promised
me your daughter but youve got to pay
me for the stone in addition 
  not a penny cried major tempie
  then ill take it to london and let
crothers have it 
   come now ashton what did the stone
cost you merely the cost of the trip
wasnt it ill pay that if you like
  and i risked my life a dozen times to
get you the jewel you must be mad
fifty thousand pounds and not a penny
less
  its mine- told you of it without
my help you could have done nothing
i demand it it is my property you were
acting only as my agent give it to me
major temple was beside himself with ex-
citement
  ill see you- first cried ashton
now thoroughly angry
  the major glared at him pale with fur
ill never let you leave the house with
it he cried
  by this time my repeated coughing and
shuffling of my feet had attracted their at-
tention and they both hastened to conceal
their anger
the emerald buddha

chapter iii
a cry in the morning
it seemed to me that i was disturbed
during the night by the sound of voices
without my door and the movements of
people in the hallway but i presume it
was merely a dream just before day-
break however i got up to close one of
the windows when i heard from the room
across the hall the one occupied by mr
ashton a sudden and terrible cry as of
some one in mortal agony followed by the
sound of a heavy body falling upon the
floor i also fancied i heard the quick
closing of a door or window but of this i
could not be sure
  i hastily threw on some clothes and ran
into the hall calling loudly for help op-
posite me was the door of mr ashtons
room i found it locked presently major
temple came running through the hallway
followed by his daughter and several of the
servants miss temple had thrown on a
long silk chinese wrapper and i could not
help observing the ghastly pallor of her
face
 whats wrong here cried major
temple excitedly
  i do not know sir i replied i
heard a cry from mr ashtons room but
i find his door locked
break it ini cried major temple
  atier several attempts the fastening gave
way and we were precipitated headlong
into the room the gruesome sight before
us caused both major temple and myself
to recoil sharply toward the doorway
upon the floor lay robert ashton in his
night-clothes his head in a pool of blood
his hands outstretched before him his face
ghastly with terror
  the major at once ordered the servants
to keep out of the room then turned to his
daughter and in a low voice requested her
to retire she did so at once in a state of
terrible excitement he then closed the
door behind us lighting the gas and we
proceeded to examine the body ashton
was dead although death had apparently
occurred but a short time before in the
top of his head we found a deep circular
wound apparently made by some heavy
sharp-pointed instrument but there were
no other marks of violence i examined
the wound in the head carefully but could
not imagine any weapon which would
have left such a mark
  and then the wonder of the situation
began to dawn upon me all three win-
dows were securely fastened with heavy
bolts on the inside there was absolutely
no other means of entrance except the door
and a rapid examination of its broken fasten-
ings showed it had been bolted upon the
inside major temple was engaged in
searching mr ashtons gladstone bag
heedless of the grim and silent figure upon
the floor beside him and when he had con-
cluded bent over the prostrate form of the
dead man and began a hurried search of his
person and the surrounding floor the
police must never find it i heard him
mutter then with a sudden cry he dashed
at a table on which lay the small green
leather case from which ashton had pro-
duced the emerald at dinner the night before
the case was empty  its gone  he fairly
screamed my- its gone
  impossible i said no one could
have entered or left this room since mr
ashton came into it
  nonsense major temple snorted ang-
rily do you suppose ashton smashed in
his own skull by way of amusement  he
turned to the bed and began to search it
closely removing the pillows feeling beneath
the mattresses even taking the candle and
examining the floor foot by foot once
more he went over the contents of the port-
manteau then again examined the clothing
of the dead man but all to no purpose the
emerald buddha was as clearly and evi-
dently gone as though it had vanished into
the surrounding ether
there was clearly no possibility
that ashton had inflicted this wound
upon himself yet the supposition
that some one had entered the room from
without seemed nullified by the bolted door
and windows
  the body lay its head toward the win-
dow in the west wall of the room and some
six or eight feet away and an even greater
distance from the walls on either side
there was no piece of furniture no heavy
object anywhere near at hand i looked
again at the queer round conical hole in the
top of the dead mans head it had evi-
dently been delivered from above i glanced
up and saw only the dim unbroken expanse
of the ceiling above me papered in white i

adventure
turned to major temple who stood staring
with protruding eyes at something upon the
floor near one of the windows what do
you make of that he asked in a startled
voice handing me what appeared to be a
small piece of tough chinese paper upon
it was inscribed in black a single chinese
letter
  it is the symbol of the god he said
 the buddha the same sign was engraved
upon the base of the emerald figure and i
saw it in the temple at ping yang what is
it doing here  then his face lit up with a
sudden idea he rushed to the door and
opened it  gibson  he called to his man
without find li min and bring him
here at once dont let him out of your
sight for a moment
  the man was gone ten minutes or more
during which time major temple walked
excitedly up and down the room muttering
continually something about the police
they must be notified i said at last he
turned to me with a queer half frightened
look they can do no good no good
whatever he cried this is the work of
one of ihe chinese secret societies they
are the cleverest criminals in the world i
have lived among them and i know
   even the cleverest criminals in the world
couldnt bolt a door or window from the out-
side i said
  do not be too sure of that i have
known them to do things equally strange
this fellow li min  brought from china
with me-one of the most faithful servants
i have ever known he is not of the peas-
ant or coolie class he represented to me
that he was suspected of belonging to the
reform association and was obliged to
leave the country to save his head  do
not know-i do not know-possibly he may
have been sent to watch-they knew in
ping yang that i was after the emerald
buddha who knows they are an amaz-
ing people an amazing people did you
bear any footsteps or other noises in the
hallway during the night
  i told him i could not be sure at this
moment gibson returned with a scared look
on his face li min had disappeared no
one had seen him since the night before
his room had apparently been occupied but
the chinaman was nowhere to be found
  the police must be notified at once
i urged
  i will attend to it said the major
first we must have tome coffee he
closed the door of the room carefully and
taking the key from the lock-it had evi-
dently not been used by mr ashton the
night before-locked the door from the out-
side and ordered gibson to remain in the
hallway without and allow ao one to
approach
  we finished dressing and then had a hur-
ried breakfast i suggested that i drive into
exeter with one of his men notify the police
and at the same time get my luggage the
murder and the necessity of my appearing
as a witness at the inquest nadeit impera-
tive that i remain upon the scene untu the
police were satisfied at my mentian of the
police the major showed great uneasiness
as before you need not say anything
about the-the emerald he said slowly
it will only create unnecessary talk and
trouble
  im afraid i must i replied it is
evidently the sole motive for the murder
  he shook his head slowly what
a pity he remarked -jtiat a pity if
the stone is ever found now the authorities
will hold it as the property of the dead man
or his relations if indeed he has any and
it would have been the crowning glory of
my collection but they will never find it
never he concluded with a cunning smile
  i wondered whether major temple knew
more than appeared on the surface but
recollected his excited search of the dead
mans belongings
however during my short drive
to exeter the thought came to me
that if major temple could in any
way have caused the death of robert ash-
ron from without the room his first act aftej
sntering it would naturally have been to
search for the emerald i regretted that
i had not examined the floor of the attic
above to determine whether any carefully
fitted trap-door or hidden chimney or other
opening to the interior of the room below-
existed also the walls and the ground out-
side
  at police headquarters i explained the
case hurriedly omitting all details except
lhose pertaining directly to mr ashtons
death the chief constable sent one of his
men into an inner room who returned in
a moment with a small keen-looking ferret-
aced man of some forty-eight or fifty years
with gray hair sharp gray eyes and a
the emerald buddha

smooth-shaveii face he introduced him to
me as sergeant mcquade of scotland yard
who it seems happened to be in the city
upon some counterfeiting case or other and
suggested that he accompany me back to
the house
  we had scarcely left the limits of the
town behind us when i noticed a figure in
blue plodding slowly along the muddy road
ahead of us in the same direction as our-
selves and jones the groom said as we drew
alongside that it was li min whose sudden
disappearance had caused so much excite-
ment the chinaman looked at us with a
blandly innocent face and nodding pleas-
antly bade us good morning i stopped
the cart and ordered jones to get down
and accompany him back to the house and
on nq account to let him out of his sight
 as we drove on i explained all the circum-
stances of the case in detail to sergeant mc-
quade in some excitement he requested
me to returp with him to exeter at once i
did hot inquire into his reasons for this step
but complied the sergeant meanwhile ply-
ing me with questions i decided he had
concluded that li min had committed the
murder and hurried off to place the emerald
buddha in the hands of some of his country-
men in the town and arrange an alibi this
he admitted it is absolutely necessary
that we prevent any chinaman from leaving
the town until this matter is cleared up and
there is a train to london at eight it is
now ten minutes of nine i am sorry you
did not notify the police at once
  i made no reply not wishing to prejudice
him against major temple
  at exeter we got little satisfaction
two of them went up on the eight oclock
train the detective growled one of
them keeps a laundry in frog street the
other was a stranger they took tickets for
london third class
  when we arrived at the oaks as major
temples place was called jones and li min
had arrived and the major had subjected
the latter he informed us to a severe cross-
examination the chinaman had denied
all knowledge of mr ashtons death and
explained his own absence by saying that he
had gone into town to see his brother re-
cently arrived from china and knowing the
habit of the temples to breakfast very late
had supposed his return at nine oclock
would pass unnoticed i made major
temple acquainted with sergeant mcquade
and we proceeded at once to the room where
lay all that now remained of the unfortunate
robert ashton
chapter iv
a queer discovery
we found gibson guarding the door
where we had left him miss temple
was nowhere to be seen major temple
took the key from his pocket and throwing
open the room allowed mcquade and my-
self to enter he following us and closing the
door behind him
  mcquade examined everything carefully
-key lock bolt socket wound windows
outside view then he stooped suddenly
picked up a small white object a bit of lac 
i thought and handed it to major temple
what do you make of that he asked
  major temple took the thing and spread
it out it was a womans handkerchief he
became deathly pale and his hand shook
violently i saw the initials m t in one
corner and noticed a strong and most pecu-
liar odor of perfume some curious oriental
scent that rose from the handkerchief
mcquade gazed at us curiously intent
do you recognize it he inquired
  yes said major temple recovering
himself with an effort it is my daugh-
ters
  how do you explain its presence here 
asked the detective
  i do not attempt to do so any more than
i can undertake to explain any of the other
strange events connected with this horrible
affair said the major pathetically he
seemed to me to have aged perceptibly since
the evening before-he looked broken old
  mcquade took the handkerchief and con-
tinued his examination of the room i felt
ready to swear that the handkerchief had
not been upon the floor during my previous
examination of the room yet how could its
presence there now be explained with the
door locked the key in major temples
pocket and gibson on guard in the hall 
i thought of muriel temple young beau-
tiful innocent in every outward appearance
yet remembered her aversion for ashton
and her determination never to marry him
under any circumstances believing thor-
oughly in the innocence of miss temple
i resolved to do all in my power to sift the
affair to the bottom

adventure
  my thoughts were interrupted by sergeant
mcquade who having brought his exami-
nation to a sudden dose announced to
major temple that the police and the divi-
sional surgeon would arrive shortly and that
meanwhile he would have a look at the
grounds beneath the windows of the room
i decided to accompany him but suggested
to the major that it might be well to show
sergeant mcquade the scrap of paper con-
taining the single chinese character which
we had found upon the floor major temple
took it from his pocket and handed it to the
detective without a word i could see that
the latter was puzzled what does it
mean he inquired do you know
lie turned to major temple
    only that it is a religious symbol used by
the buddhist priests in china said the
latter it is found in their temples and is
supposed to ward off evil influences
  is there any reason to suppose that it
belonged to li min or any of his country-
men might it not have belonged to the
dead man himself-a copy perhaps a
curiosity which he might have desired to
preserve
  i had told him nothing of the relations
between miss temple and ashton but it
was evident that the finding of her handker-
chief in the murdered mans room had
started him off on another tack
   none whatever the major responded
yet the recovery of the jewel was beyond
question the reason for the murder and but
four persons knew of the presence of the
jewel in this house-my daughter mr mor-
gan li min and myself
   how did li min come to know of it 
he saw us examining itat dinner last
night while waiting on the table
  was the stone of such value that its re-
covery would have been sought at so great
a cost
  intrinsically it was worth perhaps
a hundred thousand pounds as a curio or
as an object of religious veneration among
the buddhist priests and their followers it
was priceless
  a hundred thousand pounds ex-
claimed mcquade and you intended to
buy it from mr ashton
  yes themajor stammered yesidid
at what price  came the question cold
and incisive
  i-i-mr ashton secured the jewel
for me as my agent
  but surely you were to give him some
commission some reward what was that
reward major temple
  i had promised him the hand of my
daughter in marriage
  and was he satisfied with that settle-
ment continued the detective ruthlessly
  we had a slight disagreement-he-he
wanted a cash payment in addition
which you refused
  the matter had not been settled
and how did your daughter regard the
bargain asked mcquade coldly
  major temple drew himself up stiffly
i fail to see the purpose of these ques-
tions he said with some heat my
daughter was ready to meet my wishes
sergeant mcquade mr ashton was a
gentleman and was much attached to her
as we passed out the detective ordered
the door locked and put the key in his
pocket i asked to accompany him in his
explorations outside to which he readily
assented and with a parting injunction that
li min be not allowed to leave the house
we passed out into the garden
the storm had stopped some time
during the night and as the tragedy
had occurred later and not long be-
fore daybreak there was every reason to be-
lieve that traces of any one approaching the
windows of mr ashtons room would be
dearly visible and that any traces made
before or during the rain must have been
completely obliterated there were no evi-
dences of any ones having walked upon the
pathway since the rain nor was it apparent
that any one could have gained access to
the windows without the aid of a ladder
which must have left its tell-tale marks
behind
  at the end of the wing conditions were
more favorable a covered porch encircled
the end of the building and extended along
its front there were three windows in the
west face of the wing-one in the room which
i had occupied one in the end of the hall-
way and one in mr ashtons room the
roof of the porch was directly beneath them
any one inside the house could have reached
the porch roof from the window at the end of
the hall and gained the window of mr ash-
tons room i thought of the handkerchief
of the footsteps i fanded i had heard during
the night and shuddered
  presently the sergeant stepped toward
the emeraldbuddha

the front of the house there in the soft
gravel were the prints of a womans feet
leading from the corner of the path to the
front entrance i bent down and examined
them with curious eyes then recoiled with
a cry of dismay the footprints lead in one
direction only and that was toward the
front door
  in a flash i realized what theory mcquade
would at once construct in his mind the
murderer reaching the porch roof from the
hallway and obtaining access to the mur-
dered mans room through the window
would upon escaping from the room to the
roof be unable to enter the house again
from the roof because of my presence in the
hall and that of the others who had ap-
peared in answer to my cries what more
natural than to descend from the porch by
means of the heavy vines at the corner
walk quickly along the path a few steps re-
enter the house through the front door and
appear almost at once among the others
i femembered that miss temple had ap-
peared in a loose dressing-gown would she
then have had time to throw off her dress so
quickly wet and muddy as it must have
been and to change her shoes for slippers
where were these shoes would their con-
dition prove that she had been out of the
house during the night
  i saw mcquade examining the heavy mass
of ivy at the comer of the porch the vine
was not broken or torn in any way as would
inevitably have been the case had any one
used it as a means of descent but i ob-
served though i felt sure mcquade did not
a lightning-rod from the roof of the wing
down to the porch roof across it and thence
to the ground had any one descended in
this way he would have walked along the
border between the porch and the path to
he corner here he would have been
obliged to step on to the gravel footsteps
upon the grass would have left no mark
i did not call mcquades attention
to this at the time he strode along
the path to the steps leading to the
large front porch tracing the muddy foot-
prints to the porch and upon its floor where
they became no longer perceptible he then
entered the house and at once made for the
upper hall in the west wing his first
move was to examine the window at the end
of the hall which i was not surprised to find
was unfastened his second was to step out
upon the roof no sooner had i joined him
here then he crossed to the window of the
green room and peered in the interior of
the room was clearly visible but the win-
dow was tightly bolted within
  the sergeant looked distinctly disap-
pointed then with a low whistle he
pointed to a mark upon the white window-
sill which had escaped both his and my atten-
tion it was the faint print of a hand-a
bloody hand-small and delicate in struc-
ture yet it pointed not outward from the
room as though made by some one leaving
it but inward as by a person standing on
the roof and resting his or her hand upon the
window-sill while attempting to open the
window
  what do you make of that sir in-
quired the detective
   no one would get out of a window that
way
  except a woman said mcquade dryly
a man would swing his legs over the sill
and drop to the roof its barely three feet
but a woman would sit upon the sill turn
on her stomach rest her hands on the sill
with her fingers pointing toward the room
and slide gently down until her feet touched
the roof beneath
  the whole thing is impossible i re-
torted with some heat  theres no sense
in talking about how any one may or may
not have got out of the room when the
bolted window proves that np one got either
in or out at all
  perhaps you think that poor devil in
there killed himself said the detective
grimly  the window was bolted after the
murder
  by the murdered man i suppose i re-
torted ironically
  not necessarily he replied coldly but
possibly by some one who desired to shield
the murderer he looked at me squarely
but i was able to meet his gaze without any
misgivings
  i was the first person who entered the
room i said earnestly and i am pre-
pared to make oath that the window was
bolted when i entered
  was the room dark he inquired
  it was i answered not perceiving the
drift of his remarks
   did you examine the windows at once 
  no
   what did you do 
  i knelt down and examined the body

adventure
  what was major temple doing
  i-i did not notice i think he began
to examine the things in mr ashtons port-
manteau
  then mr morgan if occupied as you
were you did not notice major temples
movements i fail to see how you can swear
as to the window at the time you entered the
room
  your suggestion is impossible sergeant
mcquade had major temple bolted the
window i should certainly have noticed it
the sergeant smiled slightly
chapter v
a woman in the net
jtte descended to the library where
w major temple sat waiting well
mr morgan he inquired excitedly
  mr mcquade can perhaps tell you
i replied
i can tell you more major temple
said the detective gravely  if you will first
let me have a few words with miss temple
with my daughter exclaimed the
major evidently much surprised
  yes and  you do not mind major
temple i should much prefer to have you
send one of the servants for her i have
a particular reason for desiring you to re-
main here
  i thought at first that major temple was
going to resent this but although he flushed
hotly he strode to a call-bell and pressed it
then
  i think you would do better to question
li min
  i do not intend to omit doing that re-
plied mcquade
  we remained in uneasy silence until the
maid returned with miss temple who dis-
missing her at the door faced us with a look
upon her face of unfeigned surprise pale and
greatly agitated i felt that she had not
slept and the dark circles under her eyes
confirmed my belief you sent for me
father she inquired nervously
   sergeant mcquade here-he indicated
the detective whom miss temple recognized
by a slight inclination of her head-wishes
to ask you a few questions
  me her voice had in it a note of
alarm which was not lost upon the man from
scotland yard
  i think you may be able to clear up a
few points that at present i can not quite
understand
  im afraid i can not help you much she
said gravely
  possibly more than you think miss
i understand your father had promised your
hand in marriage to mr ashton
  miss temple favored me with a quick and
bitter glance i knew that she felt this in-
formation had come from me
  yes she replied that is true
  did you desire to marry him
  the girl looked at her father in evident
uncertainty
  i-i-why should i answer such a ques-
tion she turned to the detective with
scornful eyes it is purely my own affair
and of no consequence-now
  that is true miss replied the sergeant
with deeper gravity still i do not see
that the truth can do any one any harm
miss temple flushed and hesitated a mo-
ment then i would rather have died than
have married him
  mcquade had made her lose her temper
for which i inwardly hated him his next
question left her cold with fear
  when did you last see mr ashton
alive  he demanded
  the girl hesitated turned suddenly pale
then threw back her head with a look of
proud determination  i refuse to answer
that question she said defiantly
  her father had been regarding her with
amazed surprise muriel he said in
a trembling voice what do you mean
you left mr ashton and myself in the din-
ing-room at a little after nine
  she made no reply
sergeant mcquade slowly took from his
pocket the handkerchief he had found in
mr ashtons room is this yours miss 
miss temple took it mechanically
yes she said
  it was found beside the murdered mans
body said the detective
  for a moment i thought miss temple
was going to faint and i instinctively
moved toward her she recovered herself
at once is it possible you suppose i had
anything to do with mr ashtons death
i have not said so miss this handker-
chief was found in mr ashtons room it
is possible that he had it himself as a souve-
nir of some former meeting although in that
case it would hardly have retained this
strong scent of perfume but you might
t
the emerald buddha

have dropped it at table-he may have
picked it up that very night i desire only
the truth miss temple tell us if you can
how the handkerchief came in mr ashtons
room
  i saw miss temples face change i
waited anxiously for the next words
  i last saw mr ashton she answered
with a faint blush last night about
midnight
       her answer was as much of a sur-
dfra prise to me as it evidently was
to both major temple and the
detective
  muriel cried the former
  i went to his room immediately after he
retired continued miss temple with evi-
dent effort i wished to tell him some-
thing-something important before the
morning when it might have been too late
i was afraid to stand in the hallway and talk
to him through the open door for fear
i should be seen i went inside i must
have dropped the handkerchief at that
time
   will you tell us what you wished to say
to mr ashton that you regarded as so im-
portant as to take you to his room at mid-
night 
  again miss temple hesitated then evi-
dently decided to tell all i went to tell
him she said gravely that no matter
what my father might promise him i would
ibuse to marry him under any circumstances
i told him that if he turned over the emer-
ald to my father under any such promise he
would do so at his own risk i begged him
to release me from the engagement which
my father had made and to give me back
a letter in which at my fathers demand
i had in a moment of weakness consented
to it
  and he refused asked the detective
  he refused miss temple bowed her
head and i saw from the tears in her eyes
that her endurance and spirit under this
cross-questioning were fast deserting her
  then what did you do
  i went back to my room
  did you retire
  no
  did you remove your clothing
  i did not i threw myself upon the bed
until- she hesitated and i suddenly
saw the snare into which she had been
led
  until what he asked bluntly
  until-this morning she concluded
and i instinctively felt that she was not tell-
ing the truth
  until you heard the commotion in the
hall inquired mcquade insinuatingly
  yes she answered
  then miss temple how do you explain
the fact that you appeared immediately in
the hall as soon as the house was aroused
in your slippers and a dressing-gown
  she saw that she had been trapped i
had begun to change she said nervously
  were you out of the house this morning
miss temple at or about the time of the
murder were you at the corner of the
porch under mr ashtons room  the de-
tectives manner was brutal in its crue
insistence
  miss temple gasped faintly i-i re-
fuse to answer any more questions she
cried and sobbing violently turned and
left the room
  mcquade strode quickly toward major
temple who had observed the scene in
amazed and horrified silence major
temple he said sternly i must ask to go
at once to miss temples room
  to her room sir thundered the
major do you mean to imply that my
daughter had any hand in this business
by-sir i warn you- he towered
over the detective his face flushed his
clenched fist raised in anger
  mcquade held up his hand major
temple the truth can harm no one who is
innocent miss temple has not been en-
tirely frank i must search her room at
once with a growl of suppressed rage the
girls father led the way to her room the
detective went to a large closet between the
dressing-room and bedroom threw it open
and drew forth a pair of boots damp and
covered with mud and a brown tweed
walking-skirt the lower edge of which was
still damp and mud-stained  major tem-
ple he said your daughter left the house
in these shoes and this slurt some time close
to daybreak the murder occurred about
that time if you will induce her to tell
why she did so and why she seems so anxi-
ous to conceal the fact it will naturally
assist us in aiming at the truth
  as he concluded sounds below announced
the arrival of the police and the divisional
surgeon and with a curt nod he left us and
descended to the hall

adventure
 chapter vi
i advise miss temple
as i did not suppose that i should be
wanted i left the house and started out
across the beautiful lawns i met miss tem-
ple coming along the porch evidently pre-
pared for a walk so i suggested rather
awkwardly remembering her look of an-
noyance during the examination that i
should be happy to accompany her some-
what to my surprise she accepted my offer
at once and we started briskly off
  she was silent all the way down to the
entrance to the grounds but as we set out
along the main road she said with surprising
suddenness do you believe mr morgan
that i had any part in this terrible affair
certainly not i said and if you will
permit me to say so miss temple i think
you would have been wiser had you been
entirely frank with him
  what do you mean she asked in-
dignantly
  i felt disappointed somehow at her man-
ner miss temple i said gently i am
sorry you were not frank about your leaving
the house as he believes you did early this
morning
  why does he believe that she asked
spiritedly
  because he found the footprints of a
womans shoe in the gravel walk from the
west corner of the porch to the main en-
trance they lead only one way he
found the skirt and shoes you wore wet and
covered with mud the footprints were
made after the rain or they would have been
washed away and obliterated by it
  the brute said miss temple in-
dignantly to enter my rooms but
suppose i did go outside at that time-
suppose i had decided to run away from the
wretched conspiracy against my happiness
i came back did i not 
   why i inquired  did you come back 
she glanced quickly at me with a look of
fear i-i-that i refuse to explain to
any one
  you will remember miss temple that
the footprints lead in one direction only and
that was toward the house mr mcquade
does not believe you left the house in the
same way you returned to it
  what on earth does he believe llisa
she inquired with a slight laugh which was
the first sign of brightness i had seen in her
since the night before i could not help
admiring her beautiful mouth and her white
even teeth as she turned inquiringly to me
yet my answer was such as to drive that
smile from her face for a long time to come
  that whoever committed the murder
reached the porch roof by means of the win-
dow at the end of the upper hall and after
entering and leaving mr ashtons room
descended in some way from the porch to
the pathway and reentered the house by
the main entrance your footsteps are the
only ones so far that fit in with this theory
it is absurd said my com-
panion with a look of terror  how
could the window have been re-
bolted why should the murderer not have
reentered the house in the same way he left
it how does he know that there was any
one upon the roof at all
  he claims that some one interested in
the murderers welfare might have rebolted
the window upon entering the room that
would mean either your father or myself
whoever committed the crime feared to
enter the hall by the window after the house
had been aroused there is positive evi-
dence of some ones having been upon the
roof
  what evidence her clenched hands
and rapid breathing indicated some intense
inward emotion
  the faint print of a hand-in biccd
upon the window-sill miss temple you
will im sure see the advisability of ex-
plaining fully in order that the investiga-
tions may be turned in other directions
where the guilt lies instead of in yours
where i am sure it does not
  she seemed suddenly stricken with terror
i can say nothing nothing whatever she
answered pathetically her face a picture of
anguish
  i felt alarmed and indeed greatly dis-
appointed at her manner limiting the
crime to three people one of whom must
have been upon the porch roof a little before
daybreak i saw at once that suspicion must
inevitably fall upon either miss temple or
her father yet there remained one other
possibility-the chinaman li min his
hands small and delicate might possibly
have made the tell-tale print upon the
window-sill but in that event why should
miss temple hesitate to tell of it had she
the emerald buddha

seen mm the only possible solution filled
me with horror-that miss temple and li
min were acting together-that her father
too was in the plot as he must have been if
he rebolted the window the thing was
dearly impossible yet otherwise the china-
man was dearly innocent for i believed
without question that had he entered the
room and committed the murder he could
in no possible way have bolted the window
himself from without yet as i looked at
the strong beautiful face of the girl beside
me i could not think that whatever she
might be led to do for the sake of some one
else she could never have committed such
a crime herself
  i also remembered suddenly major tem-
ples angry remark made to robert ashton
the night before that he would never allow
ashton to leave the house with the emerald
in his possession was she shielding her
father was it he then that she had seen
upon the roof
chapter vii
the eron poker
as i went to my room i met sergeant
mcquade in the hall the divisional
surgeon had returned to the town the body
had been removed to a large unused billiard-
room on the ground floor and the inquest
was set for the following morning at eleven
alsc the two chinamen who had left
exeter on the morning train had been ap-
prehended in london and were being held
there he proposed to run up to town as
soon as the inquest was over a careful and
detailed search of mr ashtons room and
belongings had failed to reveal any further
light upon the murder or any traces of the
missing emerald buddha
  after luncheon sergeant mcquade asked
major temple to meet him in the library
accompanied by li min and at the majors
request i joined them the chinaman was
stolidly indifferent and perfectly collected
and calm his right hand was bound up
with a strip of white cloth he spoke eng-
lish brokenly but seemed to understand
quite well all that was said to him
  li min said major temple address-
ing the man this gentleman washes to ask
you some questions
  all light the chinaman faced mc-
quade with a look of bland inquiry
  where did you spend last night
  me spend turn with blother at exeter
  what time did you leave there
  piaps leven oclock sometime
  was it raining
  yes velly much lain
  you did not go to bed then
  no no go to bed go exeter
  the sergeant looked at him sternly
your bed was not made this morning
you are lying to me
  no no lie bed not made flom day
before i make him myself
  the detective turned to major temple
is this fellow telling the truthhe asked
does he make his own bed
  yes replied the major the other
servants refused to have anything to do
with him they are afraid to enter his
room
  what did you do in exeter asked
mcquade
  plaps talkee some smokee some eatee
some-play fan-tan-bimeby sleep
whats the matter with your hand
me cuttee hand bloken bottle-exe-
ter
  what kind of a bottle
whisky-bottle answered li min with
a childlike smile
  mcquade turned away with a gesture of
impatience he knows a great deal more
than he lets on but theres no way to get
it out of him do any of the other servants
sleep near him 
  he sleeps in a small room on the third
floor of the east wing which has a back
stairway to the ground floor said the
major the other house servants sleep
on the second floor of the rear extension
over the kitchen and pantries my daugh-
ter generally sees to the locking up of the
house
  did she do so last night
  no i locked the rear entrance before
i retired shortly before midnight
  after mr ashton had left you
  immediately after
then if li min had left the house by
that time you would not have known it 
no i sat up with mr ashton until
quite late-perhaps for two hours or more
after dinner
  did you have any quarrel with mr
ashton before he left you
  major temple glanced at me with a
slight frown we had some words he

adventure
said hesitating slightly but they were
not of any serious consequence we had a
slight disagreement about the price he was
to be paid for his services in addition to the
other arrangement we agreed to leave it
until the morning
  you quarreled violently
  i-we did not agree stammered the
major
  did mr ashton threaten to take the
stone elsewhere 
  he mentioned something of the sort i
believe
  to which you objected strongly
  i protested most certainly i regarded
the stone as my property he acted as my
agent only
  mcquade remained silent for some mo-
ments then
  major temple i shall leave one of my
men on the premises when i return this
evening i should like to hear the complete
history of this jewel so that we may the
better understand how far the former owners
would go in their efforts to recover it
after mcquade had gone i sug-
gested to major temple that i
might remove myself and my be-
longings to exeter but he would not hear
of it i strolled into the town however
and dispatched a telegram to my mother
in torquay advising her that i would be
delayed in joining her on my way back
just after sunset as i emerged from the
wood near a hedge which separated it from
the kitchen-gardens of the oaks i ob-
served two figures standing near a gateway
n the hedge talking together earnestly
just then they separated and one of them
disappeared swiftly into the wood the
other advanced rapidly toward the house
and i saw that it was li min the circum-
stance filled me with vague suspicions
  instinctively i turned toward the west
wing and as i reached the rear comer of the
building stepped back on the grass beyond
the gravel walk to obtain a view of the
windows above suddenly i tripped over
an object in the grass and nearly fell it
was a short thick iron poker with a heavy
octagonal brass knob at one end as i
held it in my hand i realized at once that
with such a weapon as this the strange
wound in ashtons head could really have
been made but beyond being somewhat
stained from lying in the wet grass it
showed no marks of the gruesome use to
which i instinctively felt it had been put
  wrapping it carefully in my handker-
chief  carried it to my room and took the
precaution to lock it safely in one of the
drawers of the dresser pending an oppor-
tunity to show it privately to sergeant mc-
quade upon his return from exeter
chapter viii
major temples story
in the dimly bghted library after
dinner the major proceeded to tell
mcquade and myself his experiences and
those of robert ashton in the pursuit of
the emerald buddha he seemed anxious
to do this and showed no feeling of ani-
mosity toward the man from scotland yard
  i spent almost all of last year said the
major in the interior of china my
daughter and i arrived at pekin early last
spring and about a month afterward we
began an extensive trip toward the west
we paid good prices for what we bought
had no religious views to promulgate and
by minding our own business strictly we
had no trouble with the natives of any
serious moment i had managed to pick
up a few samples of old porcelain and one
or two excellent ivories of great age and
beauty but beyond these the trip had not
yielded much in the way of curios for my
collection when in june we reached tilt
city of ping yang
  we found this place peculiarly interest-
ing to us with a population noticeably
different from the inhabitants of the sea-
port towns and we remained there perhaps
a month i spent a good deal of time wan-
dering about the town looking at such ex-
amples of old bronzes embroideries curious
bits of jewelry and so forth as i could
find in the shops and bazaars and i fre-
quently had occasion to pass a small budd-
hl-t temple in one of the lower quarters of
the town it was a small one but notable
because a portion of the bone of the little
finger of buddha was said to be preserved
among the relics of the shrine i had fre-
quently observed the priest sunning him-
self outside its doorway and on several oc-
casions i had dropped some coins into his
hand with a salutation which would be
equivalent to our english good luck
one day when i was passing i remarked
the emerald buddha

to one of my servants who understood
english fairly well that i was curious to see
the interior of the shrine and he after a
conversation with the temple priest in-
formed me that there would be no ob-
jection to my doing so
  after the priest had shown me every-
thing in the room with much pride-he
seemed a simple and earnest old fellow-i
made ready to depart and drew from my
pocket a handful of brass coins and thrust
them into his outstretched hands he
seemed deeply grateful and said a few
words in his native tongue to my servant
who turned to me with the information
that the priest was about to accord me an
expecial honor by showing me the sacred
relic of the buddha
  he approached the altar and taking a
key from his girdle opened a small gold
box covered with wonderful repousse work
resting upon the knees of the god upon
opening this box he drew forth a small
ivory shrine also elaborately carved which
he set upon the top of the first box and ar-
ranged so that the light from the candles
fell upon it he then opened the ivory box
with a small gold key and i looked in
the relic of the buddha a small and insig-
nificant looking piece of dirty brown bone
i paid slight attention to for in that box
glistening and glowing with the most won-
derful color in the light of the candles stood
the emerald buddha
  u inquired as to the gems history and
was informed that it had been brought to
ping yang many centuries before by the
priest who brought the relic from thibet
and founded the temple neither the fact
of its enormous size and value as a jewel
nor its priceless beauty as an example of
most exquisite workmanship seemed to
appeal to him to him its value was
solely of a religious nature an image
always venerated next to the relic as
the most precious of all the temples
possessions
  i told my servant to ask the priest if
they would sell it but he seemed disin-
clined to make the request until i repeated
my injunction rather sharply when the
message had been repeated to the old man
he scowled darkly and hastily locking his
treasures in their double box he turned
without making any reply and began to
usher us from the room i repeated the
request this time using my own store of
chinese and drew forth a large roil of gold
but the priest waved me aside with an
angry word which sounded like a curse
and pointed to the door there was nothing
left but to go and i did so though with the
bitterest regret
in the course of the next week i
several times attempted to repeat
my offer but he invariably drew
back with a look of intense hatred and re-
fused to listen to me upon my fourth or
fifth attempt i found him in company with
several other chinamen who regarded me
with dark looks and muttered impreca-
tions andthe next time i appeared in the
street i found myself surrounded by quite
a mob of excited chinamen who assailed
me with fierce curses and cries and even
made as though to offer me personal vio-
lence
  after that i felt that it would be unsafe
for me to venture into that quarter of the
town again and a few days later finding
that even in other sections of the city i was
regarded with evident suspicion and dislike
i decided to leave the place and return to
pekin and hong kong
  it was in the latter city that i met
robert ashton who like myself was col-
lecting in china and who i soon found pos-
sessed an extraordinary knowledge of the
subject this formed a bond of sympathy
between us during our stay there we saw
a great deal of mr ashton and he soon be-
came very attentive to my daughter she
seemed rather to welcome mr ashtons
attentions and i was gratified to think that
in him i might find a son-in-law who would
appreciate the collection which has been
my life-work
  he informed me that although he had
been in ping yang he had never heard of
the emerald buddha and proposed to me
that he should attempt to secure the jewel
for me i made light of this but when he
said in all seriousness one night that he
would obtain it for me provided i would
consent to his marriage to my daughter i
agreed both because i felt his quest was
absolutely hopeless and because i saw no
objections to him as a son-in-law in any
event i did not mention my agreement
to my daughter not wishing her to think
 was bartering her in return for a mere
jewel and i felt certain she would welcome
mr ashtons advances a few days later

adventure
he departed for pekin and we started home
by way of india and suez
   upon my return i questioned my daugh-
ter and was amazed and horrified to learn
that she bore toward mr ashton a feeling
almost of aversion i explained to her about
the promise and at my earnest request and
almost at my command she wrote to mr
ashton agreeing to abide by my wishes in
the matter that was six or eight months
ago and i heard nothing from him until two
days ago when he telegraphed that he had
arrived in england and would come to see
me at once
his story as he related it to me
last night was like an adventure
from the arabian nights he
arrived in ping yang one evening at dusk
disguised as a buddhist pilgrim monk with
shaved head and staff in hand and at once
proceeded to the temple with an offering of
flowers and prostrated himself before the
shrine in prayer
  ashton continued in his place muttering
his prayers and pretending to be in great
agony of spirit until one by one the wor-
shippers departed he pretended to be
suffering from some sudden illness and lay
upon the floor moaning pitifully as the old
priest bent over him in inquiry ashton sud-
denly seized him by the throat and with his
powerful hands choked him into silence he
then gagged him and taking the keys of the
small shrine proceeded to abstract the
coveted emerald buddha
  by the next morning ashton with his
servant was miles away journeying peace-
ably toward pekin as an english traveler
his escape however was not to be so easily
effected after progressing toward pekin
for two days they became aware that they
were being followed by a numerous party of
chinese upon horseback armed with pikes
bows and arrows and some muskets
swerving from the main road they aban-
doned their horses and while ashton hid in
the underbrush his servant procured at
a near village a set of chinese clothing
which ashton donned from here on his
adventures were exciting and varied but
they at last succeeded in reaching the
coast
  the rest of the story you know god
knows what influences have been at work in
his taking off as for me i know no more
about it than you do
     as major temple concluded
his story he gazed at sergeant
mcquade and myself in turn then
passed his hand nervously over his fore-
head as though the strain of the tragedy
had begun to tell upon him severely bid-
ing him good-night mcquade and i left
the room leaving him sitting dejectedly in
his easy chair patting the head of his great
mastiff boris
chapter ix
the oriental perfume
rthe inquest held the following day in tfie
a biuiard-room was a brief affair the
surgeon testified to a simple fracture of the
skull not necessarily sufficient to produce
death although capable of doing so when
combined with nervous shock or a weakened
condition of the heart that one or both of
the latter agencies had combined with the
result of the blow was evidenced by ash-
tons almost instantaneous death and the
look of horror which was upon his face
there was nothing for the jury to do but
render a verdict stating that robert ashton
had come to his death through a blow upon
the head delivered with some sharp instru-
ment by a person or persons unknown
  i spoke a few words to sergeant mcquade
at the close of the inquest and he informed
me that he intended going up to london
early that afternoon to interrogate the tvm
chinamen detained there since the preced-
ing day and upon my volunteering to ac-
company him he seemed rather to welcome
my suggestion i knew perfectly well that
until the mystery was solved not only my-
self but major and miss temple and li
min as well as the other servants in the
house would all be more or less under police
surveillance and i wanted if possible to stay
with this case to the end-a feeling that
became intensified whenever i thought of
muriel temple if i could do anything to
help her i would cost what it might
  i hastened to my room therefore and for
a time busied myself in arranging my lug-
gage as i did so i thought i heard a slight
sound in the green room across the hall the
one in which the tragedy had occurred and
glancing into the mirror of my dresser i saw
li min he was evidently searching for
something now if he or any of his con-
federates had killed ashton they certainly
the emerald buddha

must have secured the emerald buddha
and taken it with them the empty case i
remembered lay upon the table what
then could this chinaman be searching for
with such evident eagerness and anxiety
  with a few rapid steps i crossed the in-
tervening hall and appeared in the doorway
he at once appeared confused and made a
quick pretense of being busily occupied in
the business of setting the room to rights
then i became aware of a curiously pungent
et sweet aromatic odor which had some-
thing vaguely familiar about it and sud-
denly it flashed into my mind that this was
the curious scent i had noticed upon miss
temples handkerchief-the one dropped by
her in ashtons room
  after some careful experimenting i found
that it came from a small cake of soap of a
dull green color which lay upon the wash-
stand where it had evidently been left by
ashton i picked it up observing its per-
fume closely then noticing that the china-
man was regarding me with a particularly
malevolent gaze i retired to my room
taking the soap with me i had no definite
purpose in this except to keep it in order to
identify the perfume i threw it into my
satchel and completed the arrangements for
my departure
mm i was soon ready to go and after
bnu leaving my bag with one of mc-
quades men who was to accompany
us to the railway station i sought miss
temple in the hope of saying good-by to her
before my departure i was lucky enough
to find her in the library sewing and looking
unusually pale and distressed she greeted
me with rising color and i confess that i
too felt a trifle of embarrassment but the
beauty of her face the clear honest expres-
sion of her eyes once more convinced me
that whatever were her reasons for silence
they did not in any way implicate her in this
tangled affair
  i have come to say good-by i said
  oh are you going-i did not know-
she half rose her face filled with lively
concern
  im afraid ive already overstayed my
time i replied after all miss temple
i came as a stranger and must thank you
and your father for making me as welcome
as you have under the existing painful cir-
cumstances
  i have not thought of you as a stranger
mr morgan she answered simply you
have been a great help during this trying
ordeal and i am sorry that you must go-
very sorry there was a ring of sincerity
in her voice that thrilled me my heart
gave a leap and as i met her eyes i realized
all of a sudden that go where i might i could
not go very far away from muriel temple
i do not go because i desire it i replied
in a voice from which i could not eliminate
the depth and intensity of my feelings but
if it lies in my power i intend to find the
solution of this terrible affair my reward
if i can do so will be the knowledge that
i have served you
  you are very good mr morgan i
shall never forget it-never   she rose and
placed her hand in mine and allowed it to
remain there for a monent-a moment which
seemed far too short to me aad when
you have good news you will come to the
oaks and tell us about it will you not  she
concluded with a smile that went to my
heart
  indeed i shall miss temple-you may
be sure of that and i hope it may be
soon
  so do i she said and i turned to leave
her then i suddenly bethought myself of
the strange oriental perfume miss tem-
ple i said with some hesitation-you
will pardon me i know but you may re-
member that the handkerchief which was
found in mr ashtons room was strongly
scented with a powerful oriental perfume
may i ask what that perfume is and where
you procured it 
  perfume she ejaculated iu surprise
why mr morgan i never use any-
never
  you never use any i stammered
but it was upon your handkerchief-i
thought that perhaps you might have got it
during your travels in china
  the handkerchief was mine mr mor-
gan-that is true but of the perfume i know
absolutely nothing why do you ask
  i hardly knew what reply to make the
identity of the perfume of the soap and
the handkerchief meant nothing-pointed
to nothing and yet i could not shake off the
idea that there was some intimate connec-
tion between them which would go far
toward solving the mystery of robert ash-
tons death i bade her good-by with some
simple explanation of my question and hur-
ried out to find mcquade

adventure
i found him with one of his men
dimjj upon the porch roof busily engaged
in making photographs of the bloody
hand-print upon the window-sill of the
green room
  is it not a curious fact mr morgan he
remarked as he reached the foot of the short
ladder he had used to ascend to the roof
that although li min had not only the
motive for the murder namely the securing
of the emerald buddha but also the oppor-
tunity and while the hand-print which i
have been photographing is small and deli-
cate like that of a woman or of li min yet
i can see no possible way in which the
windows and doors of that room could have
been bolted after the crime was committed
neither major temple or yourself having
any reason to do it were li min the guilty
person i have been prepared to believe all
along that li min was on this roof at or near
daybreak yesterday morning and i do not
mind telling you i have discovered certain
evidence which had before escaped me yet
how could he have entered that room mur-
dered mr ashton secured the jewel
climbed out of the window and shut and
bolted it behind him on the inside is beyond
my comprehension
  have you searched the attic above the
room  i asked
  thoroughly he replied the lath
and plaster of the ceiling are absolutely un-
broken the four walls offer equal impossi-
bilities
  then it would seem that we have ex-
hausted all possible clews i observed
i did not think it worth while to take him
into my confidence regarding li min or the
perfumed soap and the brass-headed poker
which i had placed in the drawer in my
room i had for the moment completely for-
gotten
  so it seems he remarked thoughtfully
this is by long odds the strangest case
i have ever worked on
  as we rounded the comer of the house we
suddenly saw li min dart out of the main
entrance closely pursued by the officer to
whom i had entrusted my luggage the
chinaman carried in his hand my gladstone
bag and was running with incredible swift-
ness toward the road before i had time to
make a move mcquade darted forward and
intercepted him knocking from his hand
with lightning-like quickness a long knife
which he drew from his blouse the two of
them tumbled over upon the turf mcquade
rising first with my satchel in his hand he
looked at it and seeing my name upon it
handed it to me with a grim smile you
must have a valuable kit here sir he said
or else this fellow has taken leave of his
senses
  he nodded to his assistant who promptly
stepped forward and snapped a pair of
handcuffs upon the sullen looking oriental
the whole outfit isnt worth five pounds
i said laughing and picked up the satchel
as i did so the catch came open and my
small collection of flannel shirts toilet arti-
cles sketching materials and so forth tum-
bled upon the grass mcquade joined in
my laugh and assisted me in replacing
my effects nothing much here sir he
said but i did not fail to notice that he ob-
served each article closely as we repacked
the satchel
we drove to town in the high
cart and after depositing the china-
man at the jail took a hurried
lunch at the half moon and left for london 
on the early afternoon express arriving at
waterloo station about dusk i gave mc-
quade the address of my lodgings and
studio in tottenham court road and i
left him with the understanding that if
anything significant developed he would call
upon me if i could assist him in any way
  it was past eight when i arrived at my
studio i must have been unusually tired
for i dozed in my chair and was not
aroused until after eleven when i heard a
loud knock at the studio door i sprang
up somewhat confused and opening the
door found under it a note from mcquade
requesting me to meet him at once at num-
ber  kingsgatc street i threw on a
warm coat and soft hat and summoned a
cab the driver looked a bit surprised at
the address and asked me to repeat it
  i rejoiced in the hope that the examina-
tion of the two exeter chinamen had re-
sulted in the discovery of both the missing
jewel and the murderer and thought with
pleasure of the happy tidings i should bring
to muriel it was while occupied in these
dreams that i felt my cab draw up along-
side the curb just as the hour of midnight
was striking from old st pauls
  the house was an old one and its exterior
was gloomy and forbidding the whole
atmosphere of the place was depressing in
the emerald buddha

the extreme and i pulled the bell with feel-
ings of inward trepidation so long an
interval elapsed before any response came
that i was on the point of ringing it again
when i suddenly heard soft footsteps in the
hallway and the door was silently opened
i stepped within mechanically unable to
observe the person who had admitted me
  i had taken but a single step into the
passage when the door was swiftly closed
behind me and at the same instant a bag
of heavy cloth was thrust over my head
and my arms were pinioned from behind
in a vice-like grip the bag was drawn
closely about my throat by a noose in the
edge of it and before i knew it i felt my-
self being slowly but surely strangled
chapter x
in the temple of buddha
was lifted bodily by two or three
silent figures and carried a consider-
able distance part of the way down a steep
flight of stairs and through what might
have been a tunnel or cellar presently i
heard the opening of a heavy door and in a
moment i was thrown roughly upon a
bench and my pockets systematically
searched my captors evidently were not
looking for money for the only thing they
took from me were my keys after this
they left me huddled up in a comer of the
bendif afraid to cry out or make a move
in any direction
  the room in which i now found myself
was as silent as the tomb and yet i felt
that it was lighted brightly and that there
were others in it besides myself i could
feel that it was warm and through the
folds of the bag about my head came the
acrid half-sweet smell of opium or chinese
incense or both i realized at once that i
was in the hands of some of li mins
friends and no doubt the note which pur-
ported to come from mcquade had been
merely a decoy i recollected now with
vividness the interview i had witnessed the
afternoon before between li min and some
fellow countryman of his at the gateway
in the hedge back of the oaks no doubt
the crafty oriental had kept his confed-
erates in london fully posted as to both
my movements and those of sergeant mc-
quade what on earth they could want
with me i was unable to imagine
  i reached out softly with my right hand-
i had not been bound-and touched a wall
hung with heavy embroidered satin the
bench upon which i sat was of hard pol-
ished wood i reached up quickly loosed
the cord which held the bag tightly about
my neck and with a swift motion lifted
it from my head the sight i beheld as-
tounded me
  i was in a long low room the bench upon
which i sat being at the extreme end of it
the walls were hung from end to end with
bright colored satin wonderfully embroid-
ered with birds flowers dragons and
strange chinese characters the floor
was of wood dark and polished with the
walking of countless softly-shod feet fac-
ing me at the far end of the room was a
great red and gold wooden screen carved
and lacquered and representing some
mysterious chinese figures whether gods
or demons i could not tell in the center
of this screen was an opening a sort of
altar brightly lighted by a large number
of wax candles within which hung a repre-
sentation of the god buddha marvelously
embroidered upon dull red satin with gold
and silver threads behind the candles
stood a small gold casket or shrine the door
of which was standing open disclosing an
empty interior the altar in front of the
candles was covered with a profusion of
dishes containing flowers rice and other
foods
  before the altar knelt a tall gaunt figure
his back turned toward me bowed in
prayer he wore a long dark brown robe
girdled loosely about the waist with a
leather belt and his gray hair was con-
fined in a long queue which hung below
his waist he took no notice whatever of
my movements and remained in silent con-
templation of the picture of the god before
him a number of sticks of incense were
burning in a brass jar upon the altar and
the room was filled with a thin waving
blue haze which circled softly around the
great painted silk lanterns hung from the
ceiling
  i felt as though i had been suddenly and
mysteriously transported from a dark and
gloomy london street to some wonderful
temple in the far off city of pekin i rubbed
my eyes and moved uneasily upon my
hard bench but no movement upon the
part of the silent worshipper indicated that
he so much as knew of my presence

adventure
suddenly a door at my left was
opened and i observed two dark
and forbidding-looking chinamen
enter carrying between them a limp and
apparently lifeless figure which they placed
upon the bench beside me the figure was
not blindfolded as i had been and i re-
coiled sick and trembling it was ser-
geant mcquade
  the chinamen paid no attention to me
and quietly withdrew i placed my hand
upon the detectives heart and was over-
joyed to find that it still beat in a few
moments i saw his eyes slowly open and he
clutched feebly at his throat i followed
his movements and found a heavy cord
about his neck so tightly drawn as almost
to prevent his breathing this i quickly
removed and in a few moments he was able
to speak his first words after a glance
of intense surprise at our surroundings
were to ask me why i had sent for him i
told him i had not done so
  but you asked me to come to this
address at once-that you had important
news i have two men outside but these
devils got me before i could blow my whis-
tle not much use to try it now he ob-
served looking about grimly
  i sent you no note i replied on
the contrary i got one from you that is
why i am here
  we are both nicely trapped it seems
he growled what have you learned-
anything 
  nothing they took my bunch of keys
and left me here
  your keys he muttered softly your
keys what could they have wanted with
them he seemed lost in thought
  further conversation was interrupted by
the sudden opening of the door on our left
some score or more of chinamen crowded
in and were at once joined by the figure
of the priest who rose to his feet and ad-
vanced toward the center of the room he
was a terrible looking old man his face
drawn and leathery his eyes like burning
coals his mouth cruel and thin-lipped all
the others seemed to pay him deep respect
one of their number advanced and handed
him a large object which he eagerly grasped
it was my gladstone bag mcquade and i
glanced at each other in sudden compre-
hension
  the old priest placed the bag upon the
floor and proceeded to ransack it with
eager trembling hands the others
crowded about every face tense and full
of expectation presently his eye fell upon
the small green cake of soap which i had
thrown loosely into the bag upon my de-
parture from the oaks he seized it with
a cry of triumph and taking a knife from
his girdle proceeded with extreme care to
cut the cake of soap in two the crowding
figures about him hung upon his move-
ments with intense anxiety the room was
as silent as death suddenly with a loud
cry the priest broke the cake of soap in
two and there within it in a cavity about
two inches long lay the lost emerald budd-
ha its wonderful color flashing and glowing
in the light from the lantern above
  i was absolutely dumb with amazement
undeniably there before me lay the cause
of mr ashtons death yet how it came to
be hi that cake of soap and what light its
presence there threw upon the manner of
his sudden and tragic end was beyond my
comprehension that it might cause sus-
picion to point in my direction did not for
the moment occur to me
the kneeling priest rose to his
feet with a glad cry and holding
the image reverently in the hollow
of his two hands advanced toward the
altar the others crowding closely about
him arrived at the shrine he placed the
figure carefully upon its pedestal within
the golden casket and as the light of many
candles fell full upon it the whole crowd
knelt down and began a weird sing-song
prayer that must have been a chant of joy
or some service of purification now that
their long lost deity had been returned to
them presently the strange sounds died
away and the various chinamen placed
offerings of fruit flowers and food upon the
altar the priest rose and faced us i
had a feeling that our turn was now to come
  the tall gaunt figure came close to us and
examined both our faces minutely i fancy
he was the same priest that ashton had all
but done for in ping yang and from his look
of intense hatred and ferocity i feel sure
that had he recognized mcquade or myself
as either his assailant or major temple our
moments in this life would have been num-
bered in answer apparently to thq ques-
tions of his followers he shook his head
vigorously
  then ensued a heated altercation be-
the emerald buddha

tween himself and part of the chinamen on
the one hand and the remainder of the crowd
on the other the subject of which i could
plainly see was the fate of the detective and
myself at last they all turned back to the
altar and the priest took from it two pieces
of wood slightly curved some four or five
inches long and shaped not unlike the half
of a banana if it were cut in two lengthwise
i saw that they were the chinese luck-
sticks which the petitioner casts before the
altar wishing as he does so for that prayer
which he desires the god to grant him if
the sticks fall with the flat sides of both up-
ward he is lucky--his prayer is granted if
with the flat sides of both downward his
prayer is refused if one stick falls each
way there is no decision and the trial is
made again
  as the priest took up these sticks from the
altar a gleam of comprehension passed over
the faces of the crowd about him several
of their number sprang forward and dragged
us before the altar it was evidently their
intention to leave the matter of our fate in
the hands of the buddha and as i glanced
at the peaceful and beneficent face of the
image before me i wondered whether he or
blind luck would control our destinies
  mcquade they took first he was led
directly in front of the altar and the two
sticks placed with the flat sides together
were put into his hands he was then di-
rected by signs and a few muttered english
wordsy-t-i cast them upon the slab and in a
moment the hardwood sticks clattered be-
fore the altar i leaned forward anxiously
and looked at them the flat sides of both
were upward mcquade was safe 
the chinamen thrust him aside
angrily and bent upon me their
angry glances i was pushed for-
ward by many hands and the luck-sticks
forced into my unwilling fingers i had
never thought much about death and now
it approached me in all its grisly terrors
mcquade had been spared my agony for i
felt sure he did not know the meaning of the
ceremony through which he had just passed
he had thrown dice with death and won
and yet he did not know it but to me the
trial came in all its horrible reality i knew
that upon the fall of those bits of wood de-
pended my life-that within a few seconds
of time i should either be free or condemned
to die by one of those unspeakably horrible
means that only the chinese understand and
delight in their deity had been profaned
and they wanted a victim and if his down-
turned thumb claimed me as a sacrifice i
knew that no power on earth could save me
  i shook with nervous dread not so much
through fear of death itself as of the manner
of dying my hands trembled-i could
scarcely keep the sticks from falling to the
floor presently i pulled myself together
and determined to put a brave face upon the
matter the chinamen about me were
enjoying my sufferings keenly as i could
see from the diabolic grins upon their dark
faces
  i threw the sticks from me with a quick
nervous movement and then almost feared
to look upon them at last i did so and
what i saw was almost as bad as what i
feared to see instead of the two flat sides
of the sticks being uppermost they lay one
each way and i was forced to throw again
the chinese were evidently delighted any
method of torture which is prolonged seems
to please them beyond measure i have
heard that one of the most terrible they
have invented is that of keeping a prisoner
awake for days and days sleep is pre-
vented and the victim ultimately goes rav-
ing mad
  my nerves were too much shaken to pro-
long the agony i cast the sticks again upon
the altar-slab and bent over them with a
prayer to god one stick fell at once with
its flat side uppermost the other rolled
over and over until it rested almost at
the buddhas feet at last it trembled
half turned over then stopped it like
the other gave the favorable sign i was
saved
  in the sudden relief from the nervous ten-
sion i almost fell but the chinamen cheated
of their revenge gave me no time for any
such exhibitions of emotion mcquade and
i were seized and in a few moments our arms
were tightly bound behind us and heavy
bags placed over our heads we were then
roughly hurried through a series of rooms
once crossing what seemed to be a brick-
paved court undoubtedly in the open air
then for an interminable distance through
what seemed to be dark narrow lanes and
muddy streets until at last our hoods were
removed our feet bound and we were thrown
into a narrow area-way some cotton-waste
being jammed into our mouths to prevent
our making any outcry

adventure
isa here we were discovered at day-
break some four or five hours later
nearly frozen to death by a watch-
man who released us from our bonds and
upon hearing from sergeant mcquade who
he was hastened to find us a cab
  the detective drove at once to number
 kingsgate street and finding his two
men still on duty ordered them to enter the
house the bell giving no response mc-
quade and his men burst in the door the
house was completely unfurnished we
descended into the cellar but found no signs
of occupancy anywhere evidently there
was a tunnel somewhere leading from this
house to some other in the neighborhood or
else the chioamen had boldly carried us out
through the backyard and into some house
adjoining the sergeant ordered his men
to return to scotland yard obtain a relief
and investigate every house in the block and
even those on the opposite side of the street
i felt no great interest in the capture of the
chinamen they had the emerald buddha
with a better right to it than ever ashton
had and it seemed useless to bring trouble
upon any relatives of his by placing in their
hands so dangerous an article i was in-
finitely more concerned in determining who
was responsible for robert ashtons death
  i left mcquade and returned to my stu-
dio agreeing to meet him there at three the
same afternoon and return to the oaks
with him why he wished to go i did not
then see but i was only too glad of an op-
portunity to see miss temple again in
reply to my questions as to the two china-
men from exeter he informed me that
they knew nothing of the matter and had
been discharged
chapter xi
inspector burns conclusions
i was awaiting mcquades arrival when
a messenger boy dashed up to my door
and handed me a telegram
  police have discovered weapon in your room
wrapped in your handkerchief
muriel temple
  so strong is the consciousness of innocence
that even after reading this telegram i had
no thought of what this new discovery
might portend for me it was strange i
thought that i had forgotten the thing
i laid it open upon the table thinking that
if the scotland yard man did not already
know of the discovery i would be able to
inform him of it on his arrival
  he came on the stroke of three and with
him a burly deep-chested ruddy-faced
man with twinkling eyes and iron-gray
whiskers whom he introduced to me as
inspector bums of scotland yard
  i have brought inspector burns with
me mcquade said slowly he wants to
ask you a few questions
  i turned to the inspector and smiled
mr morgan he began about that
cake of soap which contained the missing
jewel-will you be so good as to tell ser-
geant mcquade and myself how it hap-
pened to be in your possession 
certainly i replied without hesita-
tion and outlined the facts
  mr morgan inquired inspector
burns when i had finished  why since you
were pretending to assist sergeant mcquade
by every means in your power did you fail
to disclose to him the facts you have just
related did you have any reason to sus-
pect that the jewel was hidden in the cake
of soap 
  none whatever i did not mention the
matter to the sergeant because it seemed
too vague and unimportant
  the inspector frowned you com-
mitted a grave error i dislike to imply
that it might have been anything worse
i began to feel indignant at the tone and
manner in which he was conducting his
cross-questioning
  is it not true mr morgan he asked
suddenly that miss temple was violently
opposed to any marriage with mr ashton
and that either his death or the abstracting
of the jewel which was to have been the
price paid by him for her hand would have
been of great benefit to her 
  i suppose they would i answered
sulkily if you put it that way
   did not miss temple ask you to assist
her in preventing this marriage mr mor-
gan and did you not promise to help her in
every way in your power
  this is absurd i cried you will be
accusing me of murdering mr ashton
next
  we only know so far that the jewel for
which mr ashton was murdered has been
found in your possession
  the significant way in which he uttered
the emerald buddha

these words thrilled me with a vague sense
of alarm there upon the table before
sergeant mcquade lay miss temples tele-
gram it was open and i felt sure he had
already read it my mind seemed con-
fused my brain on fire the inspector
turned to mcquade sergeant he said
you have the handkerchief in question
with you i believe
  mcquade drew from his pocket the folded
handkerchief and requested me to examine
its surface with a magnifying-glass i did
so and observed that it was covered with
minute particles of some green substance
  do you see anything asked the in-
spector
  yes i replied the handkerchief is
fullof fine green specks but i can not
imagine what they are
  they are bits of soap mr morgan
  soap
  exactly the inspector looked at me
keenly  has it not occurred to you mr
morgan that it was first necessary to cut it
in two and hollow out a space in the inte-
rior is it not also quite evident that bits of
soap must have been carefully collected
upon some object this handkerchief for
instance and subsequently thrown away
leaving the minute particles that you see
still clinging to its surface
  yes i replied dazed but who
      that mr morgan is just what
slip  we are trying to find out it hardly
seems likely that mr ashton would
have gone to all this trouble although it is
possible since he had reason after his quar-
rel with major temple to fear an attempt
to gain possession of the jewel if he did
how does it happen that he used miss tem-
ples handkerchief for the purpose he
may have found it upon the floor and so
utilized it but it seems unlikely
  what then seems more likely i asked
hotly would the murderer have gone to
all that trouble to get the stone and then
have left it behind 
possibly mr morgan to have been
recovered at leisure-as you indeed hap-
pened to recover it such a jewel would
not be a good thing to have in ones posses-
tunediately after the murder
t it would have taken fifteen or
minutes i objected  and we burst
door within less than ten minutes
 time mr ashtons cry was heard
  the alarm was given by you mr mor-
gan you alone heard mr ashtons cry
whether you heard it at six oclock or five
or four rests upon your word alone we do
not accuse you remember-we are trying to
arrive at the truth the facts we have just
stated coupled with miss temples refusal
to explain her early expedition from the
house that morning all point to something
we do not yet understand we are con-
vinced of one thing that the chinaman did
not commit the murder for he would have
taken the stone along with him
  i do not agree with you there i said
mr ashton may have hidden the jewel
himself and then the chinaman after com-
mitting the murder may have been unable
to find it that would account for li
mins subsequent search of the room and
his confederates actions when they began
to suspect that the emerald was hidden
within it
  you are right in what you say mr
morgan if mr ashton hid the jewel him-
self but the subsequent actions of li
min and lus confederates are equally ex-
plainable upon the theory that they had
nothing to do with the murder whatever and
were merely attempting to steal the jewel
at the first opportunity
  i made no reply they seemed to be
weaving a net of circumstantial evidence
about me that try as i would i did not
seem able to break through
  we now come to another curious fact
continued the inspector the weapon
with which this murder was apparently
committed was found this morning locked
in a drawer in the room you occupied at
major temples house it was wrapped
in a handkerchief marked with your initials
can you tell us how it came to be there
i turned to the inspector with a bitter
laugh i can tell you i replied but i
presume you will not believe me i put the
weapon which was a brass-headed poker
there myself i found it on the lawn out-
side of mr ashtons window the day before
yesterday
   why did you also conceal this important
piece of evidence from sergeant mcquade 
demanded the inspector in a stern voice
  i felt like a fool and looked like one as
well i fear i forgot it i mumbled in
confusion
  you forgot it can you expect a sane
man to believe any such folly as that 

adventure
    folly or not i replied it is the truth
i intended to show it privately to sergeant
mcquade he was in exeter at the time
and i placed it in the drawer for safe keep-
ing when he returned that evening it was
just in time to listen to major temples
story of his experiences in china and when
he had finished it was close to midnight and
the matter had completely slipped my mind
the inquest the following morning took my
entire attention and after that the sudden
arrest of li min and our departure for
london you know what has occurred
since i had forgotten the matter com-
pletely until i received this telegram from
miss temple not half an hour before you
came i took the dispatch from the table
and handed it to the inspector who read it
with interest
  why did miss temple send you this
he inquired suddenly
  i do not know-i suppose she thought
it would be of interest to me
  did it not occur to you that it might be
in the nature of a warning
  again i saw a chasm yawning before me
miss temple has no reason to suspect
me of any part in the matter i replied
 do you think it likely that if i had com-
mitted the murder i could have left such
damning evidence where the police would
have been certain to discover it and wrapped
in my own handkerchief i am as innocent
of any complicity in mr ashtons murder
as you are
i have no objection mr mor-
gan to outlining a theory of the
murder which seems to fit the facts
as we know them miss temple desperate
and detesting ashton retired to her room
but could not sleep at some hour later she
went to ashtons room he refused to give
up her letter they quarreled and in her rage
she grasped the poker and struck him with
it believing him only stunned she se-
cured the jewel but fearing to take it from
the room and wishing only to prevent mr
ashton from using it she hid it in the cake
of soap the pieces collected upon her
handkerchief were thrown out of the win-
dow but on feeling ashtons heart she
found it very weak and to destroy the evi-
dence she threw the poker out of the win-
dow and hurriedly left the room forgetting
the handkerchief in her agitation
  toward morning she decided to flee and
changed her clothes and shoes but once
more went to ashtons room to assure her-
self that he no longer lived in doing this
she awoke you by accident or design she
threw herself upon your mercy and you
agreed to stand by her advised against
running away but suggested that she go
down and get the poker so that it might be
replaced or otherwise disposed of you
meanwhile entered the room bolted the
door on the inside and left by the window
it is probable that you examined the body
your hand became stained with blood and
you rested it upon the sill while closing the
window you then reentered by the hall
window meeting miss temple and taking
the poker from her
  you placed it in your room meanwhile
urging her to change her dress and shoes a
little later you aroused the house and re-
bolted the window while major temple was
not observing you you later secured the
soap containing the jewel you no doubt
intended to replace the poker but no oppor-
tunity occurred
  he glanced at me triumphantly i
laughed though with little mirth why
dont you simply say i killed ashton and
put the weapon in my dresser and leave
miss temple out of it entirely i said
its equally plausible
  possibly so though that would account
for neither the handkerchief nor miss tem-
ples leaving the house that morning
  she has already accounted for t one
she can readily do so for the other i re-
plied
  that we shall see said the inspector
rising from his chair  we will go to exe-
ter at once and question miss temple
chapter xn
a disappearance
inspector burns and his companion
had left me to myself on the trip
down and i turned over in my mind the
curious events of the past forty-eight hours
my conversation with-miss temple on the
night of the murder had i presumed been
overheard by one of tie servants frop-
whom it had been wormed by mcqi
men during my absence but the tl
that muriel temple could be guil
preposterous i knew that i was
diced in her favor that i had come
the emerald buddha	
her that nothing could ever change it but
only two real bits of evidence connected
her with ashtons death-one the presence
of her handkerchief in the room and the
curious use to which it had been put the
other her early morning expedition from
the house and her sudden return if she
would but explain the latter i felt sure
inspector burns theory would fall to the
ground like a house of cards why she
refused to do so i could not imagine-
that she had some strong compelling reason
i felt sure what was she shielding her
father i could not believe that even for
her fathers sake she would allow an inno-
cent person to be accused
  on arriving at the oaks inspector burns
asked to see the scene of the murder and to
interview miss temple my daughter has
retired i fancy the major said i have
not seen her since dinner but i will send
her word he led the way his mastiff
boris bringing up the rear we first en-
tered the room i had occupied the drawer
was soon unlocked and there lay the
wretched poker wrapped in my handker-
chief just as i had left it inspector burns
took it up hardly heavy enough to
fracture a mans skull he muttered
what do you know about this thing he
inquired of major temple
  the major looked puzzled he had not
seen the weapon before i wondered how
miss temple came to know of it in order
to notify me
   it is half of an old poker he replied
that i gave to the gardener for a stake in
laying out his flower-beds it had been
roughly ground to a point as you see so
that it might be readily thrust into the
earth the last time i saw it he was using
it upon the pathways about the house
  then it was not in the green room
asked the inspector
  never to my knowledge said major
temple there is no fireplace in that
room
  the inspector closed the drawer with a
slam then if this was the weappn the
murderer used he -said rather lamely
he must havetaken it along with him
      we all adjourned to the green
      room which the inspector went over
      vithout discovering anything new
       seemed strangely oppressed by
      undings but after sniffing about
nervously with a low whine crawled under
the bed and lay quiet we were on the
point of leaving when the maid rushed in
and calling major temple aside handed
him a sealed envelope the major passed
his hand nervously over his forehead and
turned to us gentlemen he said in a
frightened voice  miss temple can not be
found
  we all turned toward him in intense sur-
prise what does this mean asked the
inspector where is she
  this note addressed to me was lying
upon her writing-desk replied the major
in a daze
  read it commanded the inspector
as we all hastily adjourned to the library
  major temple opened the letter with
trembling fingers then read aloud
  my dear father i am going to london to see
mr morgan they suspect him of the murder j
overheard the police talking about it this morning
i do not know what to do i can not let an inno-
cent person suffer it may be better for me to
remain away altogether if i must speak i can only
ask for forgiveness
muriel
  if the earth had opened up and engulfed
me i could not have been more astounded
i glanced at her father-he seemed shrunken
and old his head bowed upon his breast
could he-i refused to think-yet he
feared either for himself or god help me
for her no consideration for any one else
could have so terribly affected him i
looked at the cold accusing faces of the two
scotland yard men and groaned inwardly
in a moment the inspector spoke have
you a telephone in the house major tem-
ple  he asked
  yes answered the major rousing him-
self from his lethargy in the hall near
the foot of the staircase
  the inspector nodded to mcquade who
arose without a word and left the room
the net was fast closing about some one
but about whom i could not yet see
   mr morgan have you anything to say
in explanation of this letter i heard
major temple asking me
  miss temple writes as though she be-
lieved you would understand what she
means i replied  certainly do not
  i cried the major its absolute
nonsense to me he threw up his hands
in absolute dismay if this were acting i
thought it could not be better done
    
	adventure-
  you have heard my theory of the mur-
der mr morgan said the inspector
coldly the note is plain enough she
wail confess before she will allow you to bear
the penalty of her crime
   her crime  major temple was on his
feet in an instant his eyes blazing your
words are ill chosen sir poor man he
did not know of the damning circumstances
the inspector had so cleverly woven into
his accusing theory
  not at all major temple replied the
imperturbable inspector sergeant mc-
quade is at present ordering the arrest of
your daughter she will be apprehended
as soon as she arrives in london and we
will hear her story at the magistrates hear-
ing to-morrow
  but i cried in consternation this
is ridiculous dont you see that-
   mr morgan the time has come for the
truth it is my painful duty to place you
under arrest
  on what charge i demanded hotly
for complicity in robert ashtons mur-
der he replied and placed his hand upon
my shoulder
i spent a dreary enough night in
the library sometimes talking with
mcquade who dozed upon a couch
but for the most part engaged on the mad-
dening problem of robert ashtons death
  i fell into a doze toward morning and
awoke trembling and listened far off i
heard the mournful howling of a dog a
series of low unearthly howls that would
die slowly away only to be once more re-
peated it seemed like the moaning of an
animal in great pain presently as i lis-
tened there came a great yelp and there-
after silence the matter had passed from
my mind by the time our coffee was brought
to us and a little later we set out for the
town
  on arrival i made my first acquaintance
with the interior of a cell mcquade in-
formed me i would be taken before the
magistrate for a hearing at ten oclock 
asked whether he had received any word
regarding miss temple and he told me she
would arrive during the forenoon major
temple and the servants were to come in
to the hearing at which they would be
wanted as witnesses i secured a morning
paper and resigned myself to a tedious wait
of somewhat over two hours i was
strangely calm and self-possessed the
ordeal through which i was about to pass
seemed to give me slight concern but for
miss temple i feared greatly
chapter xiii
the trial
txheni was led forth and placed in the
v	v dock i gazed at the crowded benches
before me with a dull sense of annoyance
i looked up at the magistrate and found him
to be a little red-faced man with a stern but
not unkind expression the finding of the
coroners inquest was first read and then
major temple was placed upon the witness
stand the old gentleman looked more
shrunken and old than ever-his face was
yellow his eyes hollow and heavy from want
of sleep his hands trembling with excite-
ment i could well understand his agita-
tion with his daughter under arrest and
hurrying to exeter to undergo that most
terrible of all ordeals a hearing on a charge
of murder the magistrate began his ex-
amination with characteristic incisiveness
  major temple he said you are here
as a witness in the case of mr owen morgan
charged with complicity in the murder of
robert ashton
  the major bowed but remained silent
then followed some preliminary questions
establishing the facts that i had been a
stranger to all of them that i had seen and
knew the value of the emerald buddha and
that the major had insisted against his
daughters will upon carrying out the mar-
riage agreement with ashton
  the securing of the jewel then from mr
ashton would have released her from the
arrangement 
  if mr ashton had not had it he could
not have carried out his agreement of
course
  at what time did you retire on the night
of the murder 
  shortly before midnight
  further questioning brought out the
events of that night as the reader already
knows them up to our finding ashton on
the floor dead	itt
  could mr morgan have fasteji
window without your knowing it
  i suppose he could-i paid littl
tion to him	
   what happened then 
k
the emerald buddha	
  after our examination of the room we
closed and locked the door we then had
some coffee after which mr morgan went
into exeter and notified the police
major temple there is a window at the
end of the hallway in the west wing which
opens on to the roof over the porch is this
window usually bolted
  always i generally see to it myself i
have a valuable collection and am afraid of
thieves
  did you do so that night
  i did i saw that it was bolted after
seeing mr ashton to his room and before
retiring to my own
  this comprised the bulk of major tem-
ples testimony he was followed by gib-
son who corroborated all that his master
had said and similar testimony was given
by the maid there was a feature of the
latters testimony however which bore
more directly upon the case she had been
it seems on the landing of the main stair-
way after dinner waiting for miss temple
to come up-stairs it was her habit to sit
there she said while waiting for miss
temple in this position she was almost
directly above the latter and myself during
the conversation we had had immediately
after dinner on the night of the tragedy
she testified that she had heard miss tem-
ple say in a loud and agitated voice that she
would never marry robert ash ton never
and asked me to help her and that i had
replied that she could depend upon me abso-
lutely immediately after this her mistress
had come up-stairs and gone to her room
   did you accompany her to her room 
asked the magistrate
  no sir she told me as how she in-
tended to read until quite late sir and that
i could go to bed at once as she would not
require my assistance
  was this unusual
   it was a bit sir i most always helped
her to undress sir
  and you went to your room at once
  yes sir i did sir and to sleep sir
   how were you awakened 
   i heard some one crying  help help 
        threw on some clothes as quick as i could
        ran out into the hall then i seen
       ter run into the hallway of the west
       id gibson after him and i follows
       vfter that sir i was sent for a
timony of the other servants was
similar to that of gibson and the maid
they had heard some one crying for help
and had rushed into the hall
sergeant mcquades testi-
mony was in some ways the most
interesting of all i began to see
that this astute gentleman had by no means
been as frank with me as i had been
with him he testified to finding miss
temples handkerchief in mr ashtons
room and to finding the window at the end
of the hallway unbolted he produced pho-
tographs and measurements of the bloody
hand-print found upon mr ashtons window-
sill and compared them with measurements
made of my hands earlier in the day
  it appeared that while the hand-print
was small and too smeared for abso-
lute identification it could readily have
been made by my hand which is rather be-
low medium size he testified that he
found similar marks upon the sill of the hall
window pointing inward also scratches in
the paint evidently made by some one
climbing through the window from without
and foot-prints in the thin wet mold on the
porch roof made by some one either wear-
ing soft slippers or in his stocking feet he
found traces of this mold on the white sill of
the hall window and traced prints of it upon
the polished wooden floor of the hallway
from the window as far as the doorway of
my room
  he could not find any prints of this
nature within my room nor could he say
that the person making them did not gc
beyond my room but only that the foot-
prints could not be traced beyond my door
the walking of many feet in the hallway
between mr ashtons door and mine had
obliterated the marks and prevented his
tracing them beyond that point if they had
gone beyond they were small foot-prints
and somewhat indistinct yet showing
clearly as faint dull patches upon the pol-
ished floor-clearly a mans foot-prints
though smaller than the average meas-
urements proved conclusively that they
could readily have been made by me i sat
in the dock amazed-wondering if by any
chance i had suddenly developed somnam-
bulistic tendencies and had performed these
various acts while walking in my sleep i
felt that both the magistrate and the crowd
in the court-room were coming to regard
me as an extremely dangerous character

adventure
  the sergeant showed conclusively that no
one had descended from the porch roof and
spoke of the womans foot-prints in the
gravel path from the corner of the porch to
the main entrance he then took up our
trip to london explaining that the china-
men had no doubt been uncertain whether
i had the stone or had turned it over to him
and to avoid taking chances had decoyed us
both he referred to my offers of assistance
in unraveling the case and my failure to
mention to him my suspicions regarding the
oriental perfume or my taking of the cake
of soap from the green room he de-
scribed li mins attempt to steal my satchel
finally he spoke of the finding of the emer-
ald in the cake of soap in my satchel and the
weapon in the drawer of the dresser in my
room
  i arose to be examined with a sinking
heart i knew that before now in the his-
tory of criminal trials many an innocent
man had gone protesting to the gallows and
already i felt sure that unless miss temples
testimony was decidedly convincing i was
certain of being held for trial as either an
accomplice or the principal in robert ash-
tons murder
  i told my story without any hitch or hesi-
tation if my reasons for taking the cake
of soap from ashtons room seemed weak
i could only inform the magistrate that they
were nevertheless the ones which had actu-
ated me if my failure to speak of the mat-
ter to mcquade seemed suspicious i could
only say in reply that i had not thought it
of sufficient importance to mention to him
i testified that i had lasfe seen miss temple
on that fatal night when she bade me good-
night in the lower hall and that i did not
see her again until the next morning when
she came into the hall in answer to my
cries i felt i had made a favorable im-
pression but i realized that the stem facts
brought out by mcquade would need more
than a favorable impression to overcome
them
  at the conclusion of my testimony i re-
quested that li min be called to corroborate
my testimony as to the removal of the cake
of soap from the green room the china-
man was already in the witness-room but
when brought into court maintained a stolid
silence and even the most strenuous efforts
of an interpreter failed to elicit from him
a single syllable it was at this point that
the court adjourned for luncheon
chapter xiv
miss temples testimony
 realized fully that the testimony of
the morning had been heavily against
me but i would have gladly endured that
and much more could i have spared muriel
the coming ordeal that she had evidence
of importance to put before the court i well
knew yet whom could it possibly involve
but herself the chinaman she could bav e
no possible motive for screening and her
father clearly could not have committed the
murder the more i thought the more
i realized that logic pointed its inexorable
finger at her and the more strongly did the
love i felt for her tell me the impossibility
of such a conclusion
  i can not express the tenderness the love
with which this girl in our few brief meet-
ings had inspired me-i longed to take her
into my arms and comfort her and tell her
that the whole thing was but a wretched
miserable dream yet it needed but a
glance at the stone walls about me the steel
grating of my door and the untasted food
which stood upon the cot at my side to as-
sure me that this was indeed no dream but
a very cold and stern reality
  it was close on to two oclock when i was
once more taken back to the court-room
miss temple was nowhere to be seen
major temple sat in his former seat pale
and still presently there was a stir in the
room and i saw muriel entering with ser-
geant mcquade at her side and inspector
bums following them my heart sank as i
saw how terribly pale and distressed she
looked and with what shrinking she met
the gaze of the many eyes now focused
upon her her own sought the face of her
father he half rose as though to speak
then sank back into his seat and covered
his eyes with his hand she did not see
me at all-probably because i was so close
to her
  the magistrate rapped upon the desk to
still the rising buzz of conversation among
the spectators and began his examination
quickly carrying it up through my convert
sation with miss temple the evening jr
the murder
  what did you do then
  iretired to myroom dismissed t
and threw myself fully dressed t
bed
the emerald buddha

  what time was it
  close to ten oclock i beard the hall
clock strike the hour shortly aftdri reached
my room
   did you go to sleep 
  no i thought and thought about the
terrible situation i was in at last i heard
my father and mr ashton come up-stairs
and shortly after heard my father retire to
his own room i made up my mind to make
a last appeal to mr ashton-to tell him
under no circumstances to deliver the jewel
to my father under the impression that i
would marry him-that i would refuse to
do so i wanted also to ask him to give me
back my letter and to release me from my
unwilling promise
  he opened his door to my knock and
fearing i might be seen or heard by some
one if i remained standing in the hall i
entered mr ashton had evidently been
examining the emerald for i saw it upon a
table he had a pen in his hand and was
making a copy upon a small piece of paper
of the curious symbol engraved on the base
of the image after stating my case in a
few words i demanded my letter he was
very angry and at first refused to believe
that i was in earnest then he became very
brutal and refused to release me he even
went so far as to attempt to embrace me
and only by threatening to rouse the house
with my screams did i succeed in making
him desist then i hurriedly left the room
did you drop your handkerchief
   must have done so the one found in
the room belonged to me
  did you by any chance observe whether
or not any of the windows in the room were
open
  i did they were all closed i noticed
it instinctively because when i first en-
tered the room i was conscious of the
heavy oppressive atmosphere of the place
and knowing the room had been long
closed wondered that mr ashton had not
opened the windows i suppose it was be-
cause his long stay in the east had rendered
him sensitive to our cold english weather
 after you left mr ashtons room what
did you do
    i retired to my own room partially un-
    -ed and again threw myself upon the
      d you sleep 
          i could not
          did you again leave your room 
  about five oclock i had been tliinking
all night about leaving the house i felt
that after the scene the night before with
mr ashton i could not endure another
meeting with him i got up put on a walk-
ing-suit and boots and throwing a few
things into a satchel stole quietly down-
stairs opened the front door and went out
where did you go
  i-i set out across the lawns taking a
short-cut to the main road to the town
a  observed that miss temple
imul was lowing a greater and greater
appearance of distress as the magis-
trate pursued inexorably the line of ques-
tioning which would lead her to the dis-
closures i knew she feared to make her
face white and drawn twitched pathetic-
ally under the stress of her emotions she
spoke in a low penetrating voice little more
than a whisper yet so silent was the court-
room that what she said was audible to its
furthermost corner as i gazed at her in
silent pity i heard the magistrate ask the
next question
   how far did you go 
  i went-i-i think it must have been
about thirty yards-as far as the corner of
the house
  the corner of the west wing
  yes her voice was growing more and
more faint
  why did you not go farther
   i-i saw somebody upon the roof of the
porch
  was it light
  there was a faint light in the sky i
walked over toward the path and looked up
at the porch roof
   what did you see 
  i saw some one get out of the window
from the hall on to the roof i-i-the
walked over to mr ashtons window and
seemed to be trying to open it-
  who was it the crucial question of
all that had been asked her came like the
snapping of a lash and as she compre-
hended it her face became flushed then
ghastly pale
  i-i-must i answer that question
  you must
   but-i-i can not- she burst into
sobs and buried her face in her hands
  the magistrate looked at her sternly
miss temple he said evidence has
been given here this morning which points

adventure
strongly toward a prisoner in this court as
the person guilty of mr ashtons death
your answer to my question may confirm or
disprove his guilt i direct you to answer
my question at once whom did you see
upon the porch roof 
  miss temple looked despairingly about
her rose with a ghastly look from her chair
and facing the magistrate said it-it-
oh my god-it was my father then
collapsed limply against the rail
  major temple rose from his seat and
stood white and trembling muriel he
cried in a voice filled with incredulous
amazement and horror which rang through-
out the whole room
  i sprang forward with outstretched arms
but inspector burns was before me he
placed miss temple tenderly in her chair
she was unconscious
chapter xv
the vengeance of buddha
t xhen miss temple launched her terri-
v	v ble and unwilling accusation against
her father and was carried unconscious
from the room i realized that i was to all
intents and purposes a free man miss
temple it is true had testified that the win-
dow was closed but she could not know
whether it was bolted or whether ashton
had opened it later to secure fresh air during
the night it seemed probable that he had
but how to account for its subsequent re-
bolting from the inside i could not imagine
unless major temple had done it unknown
to me when we first entered the room
  i looked to see all these matters cleared up
when he was placed upon the stand and i
was not surprised to see one of the officers
approach the figure sitting bowed and silent
among the buzzing spectators and laying
his hand upon liis shoulder bend down and
whisper a few low words into his ear he
arose and was about to accompany the offi-
ce- to the dock when there was a murmur of
voices about the door and i saw sergeant
mcquade enter with the gly figure of li
min beside him followed by the interpreter
while inspector bums stepped quickly to
the magistrates desk and said a few hur-
ried words to him in a low voice
  the magistrate apparently very much
surprised turned to the court-room rapped
loudly for order and motioned to the officer
in charge of major temple to release him
sergeant mcquade meanwhile with his
prisoner had advanced to the dock and
without further ceremony i saw the court
attendants administer the oath the import
of this being explained to the chinaman by
the interpreter
i learned afterward that li
min upon his first appearance as a
witness had been under the im-
pression that he was being tried for his
attempt to steal my satchel and as he did
not then know that his compatriots in lon-
don had secured the emerald feared to make
disclosures learning from the interpreter
during the noon-hour that the emerald
buddha had been secured by his friends in
london he was at last persuaded to tell his
story
  it seems that li min like many of his
countrymen was under suspicion through
association with the reform movement
and knowing the enmity of the dow-
ager empress and her advisors toward this
movement had come to hong kong with
the intention of leaving the country his
engagement as a servant by major temple
enabled him to leave china without being
under any suspicions as to his motives for
doing so it was during the voyage to eng-
land and his subsequent stay in major
temples service that he first learned the
story of the emerald buddha piece by
piece and of ashtons determination ir
secure the sacred relic his religious feelings-
were outraged and he promptly seijword
to the followers of buddha in ping yang
but when the word at last reached them
ashton had already escaped with the jewel
the priest set out at once for london with
two of his followers making such speed that
they arrived in london some weeks before
ashtons coming
  li min was to notify them as soon as
ashton arrived and it would then be li
mins part to admit his confederates to the
house and with their assistance steal the
jewel and make away with it his trip to
exeter had been for this purpose but owing
to the furious storm the night of ashtavr
arrival he decided to wait till morning 
had overheard the quarrel feared
ton might leave with the jewel and p
an uneasy night
  he arose about four oclock and
silently through the hallway to
th emerald buddha	
door hoping to find it unfastened upc
finding it bolted he had gone to the hall
window raised the sash and looked out
he made a quick decision to climb out
upon he roof enter ashtons room by
means of ifie window and secure the emer-
ald but fearing lest he might be recog-
nized by some chance early riser among
the stablemen or gardeners he descended
swiftly to the main hall threw on a long
tan raincoat and tweed cap belonging to
major itmple and so disguised returned
to the porch roof
  he was making his way quietly along to
the window of ashtons room when seen by
miss temple he found ashtons window
bolted on the inside but the increasing
light showed him dimly the interior of the
room with ashton asleep in the bed he
had cut his hand badly upon a projecting
nail or bit of glass and had rested his
bloody palm upon the sill his fingers point-
ing inward his efforts to open the window
awoke the sleeping man within what fol-
lowed i will try to tell in li mins own
words as rendered into english by the in-
terpreter
  i saw the man rolling about in his bed
he seemed to be suffering and i heard him
groan and once cry out in his sleep i
pushed the window again and it made a
loud noise the man jumped up quickly
and started toward the window his face
was white and terrible and as he jumped
from bed the hand of buddha the mighty
the wonderful one who knows all things
smote him like a flash of fire he fell upon
the floor uttering a loud cry
  i was frightened and ran along the
roof and climbed into the house through the
hall window i heard sounds in the room
of the young man mr morgan i closed
the window but forgot to bolt it i ran
quickly along the hall and went down the
stairs i put the coat and cap in the closet
in the hall where i had found them and
went out through the servants entrance
i walked into exeter and sent word to my
brothers in london that the sacred relic
had come then i had some breakfast and
-me back
   afterward i learned that the jewel was
   i did not know whether the great
   ia had taken it away or not at last
   ad man was taken away and i was
   - fix the room i searched every-
   i could not find the stone at
  at the young man came into the room
suddenly after a time he took the piece
of soap and went away i was a fool-i
had not thought of the soap which lay there
in front of my eyes it was the only thing
i had not searched i knew that if buddha
had not taken away the stone it must be
concealed there
  i watched the young man i saw him
put it in his bag i went down-stairs and
when the satchel was left unguarded for a
moment i took it the young man and the
officer were outside and stopped me when
i was taken into the jail at exeter my
friend chuen moy came to see me i told
him through the bars what had happened
i did not know whether the young man
would keep the stone or give it to the
officer i told chuen moy to go to london
and inform our brothers that they might
get the stone i have done nothing wrong
the man who died had offended the great
buddha he committed a sacrilege and he
deserved to die the mighty hand of the
all-powerful one was stretched out and he
fell dead i myself have seen the miracle
it is the vengeance of buddha 
i do not know what the efiect
of this weird story was upon the
others in the court-room but to me
it rang with all the accents of sincerity and
truth not that i believed in the vengeance
of buddha although even this i was not
prepared to deny but his story explained
everything-and nothing my heart gave
a great leap of joy for i knew that this
terrible thing about muriels father which
she so firmly believed must have almost
broken her heart yet for me she had told
the terrible truth as she believed it and to
save me she had gone all the way to lon-
don to ask my advice i began to hope
that she might have for me a feeling not dis-
similar to that which i so strongly felt for
her
  major temple was put upon the stand
again but there was no evidence now to
connect either miss temple her father or
myself with the murder li min had
borne out my story regarding the taking
of the cake of soap in every particular i
was discharged along with major temple
and miss temple and only li min re-
mained in custody held upon the technical
charge of assaulting mcquade and threat-
ening him with a deadly weapon in
adventure

spectoi burns and sergeant mcquade bo
signified their intention of going to london
at once-the latter however to come down
to the oaks the following day for a final
examination into the mystery he did not
believe for a moment that part of li mins
story which referred to the sudden death of
mr ashton and still suspected the china-
man of the crime
  i was requested by major temple to
accompany him and his daughter back to
the oaks an invitation of which i was by
no means slow to avail myself the poor
girl was greatly upset and very much tired
out and we made haste to get her home as
quickly as possible
  i was given the same room i had pre-
viously occupied and we sat down to dinner
with some show of cheerfulness miss tem-
ple looking especially charming in a green
silk evening-gown which to my artists
eyes made her a picture i longed to put on
canvas i told her so and we were soon
discussing pictures and art generally at a
lively rate only the major seemed de-
pressed and i imagine this came from his
regret at the loss of the wonderful emerald
buddha what had become of the jewel
i did not know but i fancied that mc-
quades hurried trip to london had some-
thing to do with the search ms men were
making for the lost underground temple of
buddha
  after dinner major temple excused
himself upon the plea that he wanted to
write some letters while miss temple and
i sat down before the fire in the library for
our first real tste-a-tete it had begun to
rain heavily outside with a stiff breeze
blowing from the southwest and it seemed
wonderfully fine and warm and altogether
delightful sitting here in the firelight with
the woman i loved beside me
chapter xvi
i ask miss temple a question
 lvriss temple i said as wesatbe-
  --a side each other on the big leather-
covered settee facing the fire i want to
thank you with all my heart for going up to
london to see me i know why you went
and can never tell you how deeply i appre-
ciate it
  she looked at me with her bewitching
smile wmch somehow made me feel both
uelightfuily happy and yet vaguely- un-
certain of myself i had to come mr
morgan she said her voice trembling with
the agony of her former suspicions of her
father as soon as i knewthe police were
fastening their suspicions upon you i knew
i should be obliged to tell what i had seen
had i found you in london i should have
told you everything and been guided by
your advice
  i wish you had found me there i said
but as it is everything has turned out well
only i am sorry that you should have had
tc undergo such a terrible experience
  oh it wasnt so bad they gave me a
very comfortable room at the police station
in london and the matron was extremely
kind i might almost have enjoyed the
experience had i not been suffering so about
my father  her look of pain at the recollec-
tion made me change the subject and talk
of london and my friends among artists
and musicians
  its the life ive always dreamed of
she said her cheeks flushing with excite-
ment ive been to so many places rome
and paris and vienna and cairo and the
east you know but i really know very little
about them the outside i have seen of
course but the real life-that i have missed
and now wre are stuck down here where we
dont know anybody because father fancies
it is good for ms health i suppose it is but
it isnt real joyous living i hardly feel
alive
  but you go to london dont you
your father spoke of ms house then
  oh yes but fathers friends are mostly
professors of assyriology and egyptology
and people of that sort and they come and
stay for hours and talk about scarabs and
liieroglypmcs and mummies and all that sort
of thing sometimes i feel almost as though
i were about to become a mummy myself 
  she certainly did not look it with her
wonderful color and her large and brilliant
eyes i could not help lookingdeep into
them as i replied only half smiling
   we must prevent that at all costs let
me help in preventing it she laughed
nervously but did not seem displeased
my remark i think the experiences of
past week have caused us to know each o
very well i went on gravely and i
you may tmnk as much of the friei
wmch has come to us as i do
  are we then really friends
ddha

slowly  never had a man fid-no
very many of any sort i fear we have al-
ways moved about so much from place to
place
  perhaps not friends i said and as i
did so i placed my hand over hers which lay
beside me upon the leather seat of the settle
at least not friends only i have always
dreamed all my life of a woman like you
who would be dose beside me and share all
my hopes and dreams and be the cause of
them all as well and be glad of my suc-
cesses and not think the less of me because
of my failures but a woman to be all that
must be more than a mans friend miss
temple-she must be his wife
  the color flooded her cheeks as i said
this but she did not draw away her hand
a woman would have to be very greatly
loved by a man and love him very greatly
in return to be all that to him she said
   i can only speak for myself i said  i
love you very greatly-so much indeed that
i am telling you of it now-when i have the
opportunity-instead of waiting as no
doubt you think i should but we have
passed through much trouble you and i
and that has brought us close to each other
i want you i need you i love you and i
shall always love you i drew her to me
and when she put her head upon my breast
i knew that i had found my hearts desire
it must have been half -an hour
later when major temple burst into
the library in a great state of excite-
ment and asked if we had seen anything of
boris his favorite mastiff he had suddenly
realized a few moments ago that he had not
seen him since his return from exeter he
made inquiries but none of the servants had
seen the dog since the day before i remem-
bered at once the howling i had heard during
the night andspoke of it the major thought
for a moment then raised his head with a
suuden look of comprehension dont you
remember jr morgan that boris was with
us when we made ourexamination of the
green room last night i do not recollect
seeing him after that the poor fellow has
 wbt been locked in there ever since and
his howls that you heard
followed him to the green room and
temple tried several keys before
ne that could open it at last the
ed however and he attempted to
the door it refused to open
    leit he said as though some heavy
object had been placed against it by push-
ing with our united strength we forced the
door inward sufficiently to allow us to enter
the major took a candle from my room and
we squeezed our way into the place with
some difficulty muriel remaining outside
what was our astonishment to see lying
upon the floor his head close to the door as
though struck down in an effort to escape
the majors mastiff boris stone-dead his
eyes wide open and staring his mouth dis-
tended and still covered with foam his face
wearing an expression of intense fear
  it was a horrible sight and we looked at
each other in alarm
   my- said the major this room
is accursed let us go
chapter xvii
i sleep in the green room
txhat is the matter asked his
vv daughter as she saw our startled
faces isnt boris there
  the majors tone was grave and solemn
 he is there muriel and he is dead i do
not know what is the secret of that room
but i shall never enter it again  he turned
from us and led the way down the hall
when we reached the floor below the
major directed gibson and one of the other
servants to remove the dogs body from the
room and we retired to the library where
we discussed the matter for a long time
but in spite of our attempts to regard the
event in a common-sense light we could not
shake off a mysterious feeling of dread at
the thought of these two creatures a man
and a dog having so inexplicably come to
their ends in this room in ashtons case
there was tangible evidence of the cause of
death but on the dogs body there was no
wound or mark of any sort
  miss temple essayed a few airs upon the
piano but our thoughts were not attuned
to music and presently as it was close to
eleven oclock she said good-night to us
both and left us i seized the opportunity
to tell the major of my love for his daughter
and after his first gasp of surprise he heard
me out with remarkable calmness though
there was a frown upon his forehead
  at the mention of my profession and my
income i noticed that major temples frown
relaxed somewhat but when i mentioned
my fathers name and the fact of his ha
spent a part of his life in india he fairly
beamed
  are you really the son of edward mor-
gan he fried rising why my boy i
knew him well i was in the indian service
for fifteen years and who did not know him
who has spent much time in that benighted
country he was a fine man and if i
remember rightly he refused a knighthood
for his services he came up to me and
took my hand
  its all very sudden i must say but i
should be very glad to see muriel happily
married and if she believesyou to be the
right man i shall interpose no objections
hut i should advise you both wait a reason-
able time until you are certain that you
have not made any mistake as for me i
am an old man and i have traveled all over
the world but the only real happiness i have
ever found was in the love of my wife she
went out to india with me and she never
came back he turned and gazed into the
fire to hide his emotions
  i have become half mad over this busi-
ness of collecting antiquities and curios he
resumed presently but it isnt real-its
only an insane hobby after all and i have
only just realized how selfish it all is
as i stopped at my doorway i
noticed that the door of the green
room stood partly open and filled
with a curious fascination i once more
peered into its dark and silent interior 
ceuld see only the faint outlines of the tall
old-fashioned bed against the dim light of
the sky without the windows i stepped
inside acting upon the impulse of the mo-
mentand lit one of the gas-jets in the heavy
old-fashioned bronze chandelier
  the room seemed comfortable enough
though i felt that peculiar stifling sensation
i had noticed upon my first entering it i
wondered for the thousandth time what
strange secret lay concealed within its walls
-what mysterious influence existed which
was potent to strike down man or beast
alike without warning as though by the
hand of death itself i longed to penetrate
to the heart of this mystery-to satisfy my-
self that what had occurred herein had not
been supernatural but merely some working
of well known natural laws
  suddenly i was seized with an idea why
should i not spend the night here and possi-
    tuus  ermine thegrin secret the
idea grew upon me ssrtrongly that i at once
returned to my own room unreaid ptit
on my pajamas and taking a small pocket
revolver crossed the hall to the room
opposite carrying with me some extra
coverings for my bed
  i did not feel at all sleepy so after closing
the door and climbing into the high poster
bed i lay back comfortably upon the pillows
and proceeded to occupy myself in read-
ing a magazine
chapter xvih
a night of horror
hphe night was in many ways like the
- one robert ashton spent there a
heavy rain had set in and the wind from
the southwest was driving it against the
windows of the room just as it had done
that other night i had attempted to raise
one of the windows before turning infibut
it was impossible to keep it open for any
length of time as the rain drove in fiercely
and threatened to flood the room i began
to reconstruct in my mind the scene that
had been enacted in this room but a few
nights before-the stormy interview jdth
muriel the hiding of the jewel in the soap
and the use of her forgotten handkerchief
for catching the flakes dug out by his pen-
knife
  then i thought what next no doubt
ashton had turned off the gas and climbed
into bed i say climbed advisedly for- the
bed one of those old-fashioned four-posters
with a feather mattress under the hair one
was far higher from the floor than are our
modern beds and to facilitate getting into
it there stood beside it a little low wooden
stool by which one ascended to its snowy
heights
  presently over my imaginings  felt my-
self growing unaccountably sleepy and
tired i realized that the strain of the long
day had been a heavy one and could see
no reason for going without a good nights
rest there was no priceless jewel con-
cealed upon the premises to bring d
upon me either the vengeance of bu-
or the murderous attacks of my fellow
i laughed a little at my earlier fear
rose in bed reached over to the cha
and turned out the light
  i must have slept for several he
