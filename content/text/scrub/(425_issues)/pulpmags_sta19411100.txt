why trained accountants command

 high salaries

  -and how ambitious men are qualifying
  by the la salle problem method

jet this straight

  by accountancy we do not mean bookkeep-
ing for accountancy begins where bookkeeping
leaves off

  the skilled accountant takes the figures handed
him by the bookkeeper and analyzes and interprets
them

  he knows how much the costs in the various
departments should amount to how they may
be lowered

  he knows what profits should be expected from
a eiven enterprise how they may be increased

  he knows in a given business what per cent of
ones working capital can safely be tied up in mer-
chandise on hand what per cent is safe and ade-
quate for sales promotion and these by the way
are but two of scores of percentage-figures where-
with he points the way to successful operation

  he knows the intricacies of govern-
ment taxation

  he knows how to survey the trans- busin
actions of a business over a given cntrl
period how to show in cold hard
figures the progress it has made and
where it is going he knows how to
use these findings as a basis for con-
jtructive policies

  in short the trained accountant is
the controlling engineer of business-
one man business cannot do without

  small wonder that he commands a
salary two to ten times as great as
that of the book-
keeper indeed as an
independent operator
head of his own ac-
counting firm he may
earn as much as the
president of the big
and influential bank
in his community or
the operating man-
ager of a great rail-
road

 some examples

small wonder that ac-
countancy offers the
trained man such fine
opportunities-op-
portunities well illus-
trated by the success
of thousands of

 lasalle accountancy students for example-one
 man was a plumber  years old with only an
 eleventh grade education he became auditor for

rocks from the sky

the rocks had been hurtling
toward earth for more than a
week silent and invisible in the
black airless void of space there was
something dogged in the way the eleven
dark chunks of stone clustered together
neither drawing apart nor touching
maintaining always that odd arrow-
head formation as the tens of
of trackless miles whipped by

  and there was something vaguely
sinister in their majestic progress mov-
ing an unvarying nineteen miles
second ignoring the billions of
ments of meteoric dust that fled
them at vastly greater speeds
were somehow like messenge

patched upon some dark mission their
progress timed to carry them to an in-
finitely distant rendezvous at exactly
the appointed time

  the rocks were very close to earth
an amazing
complete
book-length
novel

 before temple could move rubbery
 tentacles pinioned his arms chapter xv

curt temple pits his slim
earth knowledge against the
most perfect intelligence in
the cosmos to save the world
-and the woman he loves


doom stalks the earth when xacrn the

still invisible but feeling the first gentle
tug of earths gravitation when gus
solle finished his nights chores he
stripped the last ounce of milk into the
brimming pail hung the milk-stool on a
peg and got down the oil lantern from
its hook above the cow stalls

  at the barn door he paused waiting
for two other flickering lanterns to join
him

  young gus his twenty-year-old son
came striding from the dark shadows of
the horse barn at the rear slapping
loose straw from his overalls arnie
cole the hired man pumped a last
groaning gush of water into the stock
tank picked up his own lantern and
joined them as they moved toward the
house

  suppers ready the gaunt figure
of martha solle appeared in the door-
way of the house to make the announce-
ment her big frame silhouetted by the
kerosene lamp on a table at her back

  set the milk in the shanty and sep-
arate it afterwards itll keep but sup-
per wont

  gus solle grunted acknowledgment
as the three moved up the barren
ground toward the frame house

  if you figure on workin old mag
tomorrow pa young gus remarked
you better throw a pad under her col-
lar shes got a bad gall from the hame
strap

  aint much sense in working any of
the horses arnie cole growled un-
less we get some rain purty soon the
more i see of kansas the more i wish
id never left iowa

  we could use a drop or two gus
solle admitted dont seem to be a
cloud in sight neither i like the stars
but im getting mighty sick of seein
em night after night when the lands
burning up for a good rain

he squinted up at the unbelievably
brilliant panorama of the cloud-
less night sky with anger in his mild
face unconsciously the other two
turned their faces up toward the
heavens to follow his gaze and his wife
waiting in the doorway looked up to
see what the men-folk were staring at

  thus it happened that four pairs of

eyes saw the rocks at the precise instant
when some eighty-seven miles up into
the night they first flamed to brilliance
in the clutch of tenuous atmosphere

  look martha solle cried shoot-
in stars-a whole tribe of em looks
like

  meteors ma young gus corrected
with the superiority of one who had
been to school in town a meteor
swarm

  there was no more time for speech
what had been only a leisurely glide
through outer space became in relation
to earth speeds a screaming flight in
two seconds the eleven separate bodies
of rock could be plainly resolved by the
naked eye and the thin scream of their
coming had reached ahead to torment
the ears

  in three seconds the eleven rocks
had leaped beyond the apparent size of
baseballs and their brilliance was in-
credibly dazzling now the scream had
deepened to a rushing roar interspersed
by thunderous explosions as two of the
eleven rocks succumbed to the titanic
forces of kinetic energy and burst apart
in midair

  in four seconds the sound of their
passage was beyond description the
solles and arnie cole stood frozen as
nine flaming rocks now bigger than
basketballs seemed to hurtle straight
toward their defenseless house all
saw the largest rock in front with the
eight others arrowed out in two streams
behind sweeping down in a vast arc

  then miraculously the rocks were
overhead passing above them and
above the low house sweeping on in
a screaming thunder of awful sound
to plunge into the dusty wheat field
beyond air searing hot and violently
churning smote their upturned faces
scorching the breath from their lungs

  the nine rocks struck and vanished
in a welter of flame and mushrooming
dust the sound became something too
terrible for human ears to measure
the ground underfoot rocked to the
impact and a fresh wave of super-heated
air surged out from the point of contact
and swept the four stunned humans
from their feet

  then silence fell a silence that was
ninth planet seeks to enslave humanity

finitesimal particles of exploded rocks

recover his senses and clamber onto
shaky legs martha are you all
right

  they all moved then climbing daz-
edly to their feet mumbling assurances

  come on young gus cried shrilly
his own voice sounding faint against
shattered eardrums they landed right
there on the edge of the north forty
im going over there

startling stories

  wait be careful martha solle
warned one of them things might
explode i wouldnt go near if i was
you

  heck with that noise young gus
cried excitedly im gonna find em
and dig em all out them things
are worth money pete halvorsen
found just a little chunk of an old
meteor on his place a couple years ago
and some guys from washington give
him fifty dollars for it i bet theres
a couple hundred dollars worth at
least right there waiting for us come
on

  they all went then running and
stumbling across the parched earth
toward the fresh scars that lay plain
under the starlight the thought of
money drove all fear from their minds

  in the wheat field the things lay
quietly in their shallow pits-waiting

        chapter ii
        lost expedition

the spring sunlight lay warm on
the fresh green of culwain univer-
sity campus curtis temple felt the
tingle of it through the narrow bandage
on the back of his head and made a
mental note to spend as much time as
possible with his head exposed to that
radiance it would speed the healing
of his wound

  he went across the campus a tall
well-knit young man in rough tweeds
with a pleasantly-angular face and
level gray eyes there was still a glow
of deep bronze on his skin despite the
traces of hospital pallor and his rangy
stride was definitely a product of open
spaces it was hard to believe that
this athlete could be curtis temple
phd professor of astrophysics at
culwain and rated among the tops in
that vast new field of scientific adven-
ture

  it was adventure that had drawn
temple to this phase of universal re-
search the thrill of searching unknown
spaces of charting the uncharted see-
ing the unseen fitting the complexities
of the infinite into a laboratory pattern

and it was love of adventure that had
sent him soaring skyward in a free bal-
loon on the ill-fated cosmic ray search
that had nearly cost him his life

  the failure of the balloon had left
him with a shattered skull that confined
him to the hospital for weary months
it was only now that thanks to med-
ical genius he was out and able to walk
and work and feel the warmth of the
sunlight on his bared head

  he went into the shadowy interior
of the astronomical observatory
crouching under its silvery dome on a
comer of the campus and entered the
laboratory mullane the weazened
little gnome of an astronomer was in
there absorbed in a delicate radiation
experiment he was unaware of tem-
ples entrance until the needle on a
dial before him began to dip and flicker
madly

  mullane laid down his pencil with a
mock sigh of despair and snapped off
the switch

  dont look now he whispered
loudly addressing the bare wall but
that mans here again-the one with
the tin head

  temple chuckled and strolled over
to kibitz at mullanes notes the two
were old friends and associates

  its lucky for you id just finished
mullane growled grinning with his
eyes every time that silvery skull
of yours gets near the coils my indica-
tors run wild

  i think i ought to tell the fbi
about it how is your head and how
much longer do you have to wear that
silver plate screwed to your skull bone
curt 

  not long and it really isnt a plate
its a sort of fine-mesh silver screen
that doc put in to hold the broken
pieces of my skull in place until they
knit

  im actually as good as new right
now but doc wants to leave the silver
in for another few weeks i dont mind
the scar is almost healed and i never
feel the screen anymore

  too bad you werent able to go with
the field group the university sent
down to kansas to study that meteor-
ite swarm meteors are your specialty
curt and it isnt once in a century that
a big fall like that occurs before wit-
the gods hate kansas



nesses so it can be located and studied
while still fresh even if nebulae are
my specialty id like to have gone
there myself

temples face clouded momentarily
missing that did hurt he admitted
but somebody had to carry on the
classes here and im still technically a
cripple

  i cant really kick though im get-
ting photos samples and complete re-
ports every day and its my own line of
study the group is following after all
lee is there-and shes my eyes and
ears on the expedition

  mullane grinned and winked broadly
and your heart too he asked sly-
ly-

  temple reddened and then laughed
okay granny snoop my heart too
so what with all the prying you do
into my affairs its a wonder you ever
get a moment off to look through your
telescope

  i dont mullane admitted placidly
i leave that job to the camera and keep
my eyes on you tch tch how
scandalous

  seriously though curt lee mason
is every bit as intelligent as she is beau-
tiful-and thats going some why
that masters thesis she did on the oscil-
latory determinative of extra-galactic
cathodic emissions was a wonder

  but im warning you if you marry
her you lose the finest assistant any re-
search man ever had why that girl-
he broke off as the telephone
whirred answered the call and then
handed over the instrument

  for you curt our prexie himself
calling no less

 wondering temple accepted the
phone the usually precise accents of
mccabe culwain us president were
ragged

  professor temple i-i think youd
better get over to my office right away
something has occurred-something
that-well it concerns our kansas ex-
pedition

  the cold fingers of a nameless fear
tightened suddenly around curtis tem-
ples heart

  our field group what about them
whats hap-

 the field group mccabe said
thickly has disappeared-vanished

with all their luggage and equipment
disappeared lee-miss mason-
what about her

  mccabes answer was like a phono-
graph with its needle stuck in one
groove

  the field group even his tone was
the same has disappeared-vanished
with all their luggage-

president mccabes face was
as white as his beard his eyes red-
veined and dazed when temple burst
into his office five minutes later

 what do you mean - disap-
peared temple shouted before the
other could speak people dont just
disappear off the face of the earth
what happened to them where did
they go are you hiding someth-
mccabe waved a trembling hand to-
ward a chair and hunched over the
desk gnawing at his beard

  of course people dont disappear
he said finally but they did-nine
persons five heavy trucks tons of in-
struments and supplies tools and
equipment and the six portable shacks

  last night when i talked to them
by phone everything was going per-
fectly when i called back this morn-
ing to give them some data they re-
quested there was nothing left but the
marks where camp had been-and the
meteors

 the meteors temple gasped
you mean they went off and left the-
the very object of their trip

  they left several tons of distinctly
unportable rock mccabe admitted
but im afraid they didnt just go
off and leave them in the sense you
mean

  the sheriff and fifty deputies have
been scouring the country since morn-
ing without finding a wheel track or a
trace of them nor have they found
anyone who saw or heard the caravan
pass in the night though every road
out of camp led through towns

 but-but they must have gone
somewhere

  obviously mccabe agreed dryly
the puzzle is where and how and
i might add a third element of mys-
tery-why

  curtis temple stared feeling the
blood drain out of his face he was


startling stories

just beginning fully to realize the sheer
impossibility of what had been told
him

  he knew the layout of the meteor
camp as well as he knew the paths
across culwain campus for most of it
was of his own design five of the
shacks were small square sheet iron
affairs sleeping quarters for the force
lee mason occupied one alone

  the eight men shared the other four
the sixth shack was really two shacks
built together housing the photo-
graphic darkroom the chemistry lab
the instruments for physical analysis
and cubbyholes in which the research-
ers performed their calculations

  these shacks and all they contained
were built to be carried on four trucks
the fifth truck bore the portable gen-
erating unit for camp light and power
the kitchen equipment and rough tools
usually a day and a half were required
to break camp and pack for moving

hile it was conceivable that
the nine members could com-
pletely dismantle and pack the camp
overnight it would take some inhuman
driving urge to make the miracle pos-
sible curtis temples imagination
tried to supply a suggestion of what
such driving urge might be and failed
utterly to conjure up anything but a
black cloud of unnameable terror

  the-the neighbors he gasped at
last someone must have seen or
heard something someone must
have

  maybe someone did the only ones
closer than the town of bomer two
miles away were those farmers who
saw the meteors fall and reported to
us there was a man and his wife
their grown son and a hired man

  our camp was on their land about
a hundred yards from their house right
on the site of the meteor pits the two
solles and their hired man were help-
ing the field crew on heavy work and
mrs solle was cooking for the camp

  they must know what happened
temple said eagerly

  perhaps they do mccabe whis-
pered without looking up undoubt-
edly they do but theyve vanished
too-all four of them-the same time
the same way

 temple closed his eyes seeing a
vision of lee masons lovely face
with its frame of wheat-gold hair hear-
ing again the gay tinkle of her ready
laughter and the soft music of her
voice the vision was like a knife turn-
ing around and around in his heart

  either mccabe gritted tightening
his fists its a gigantic hoax of some
kind or-

  or temple finished flatly the
gods still hate kansas

eh mccabe stared blankly
youve heard my remark that the
gods must hate kansas because they
throw so many stones at it you were
in class the day i used that expression

  maybe it sounded facetious but it
wasnt meant to be because behind it
lies a mystery that has puzzled me and
every other astronomer for years-a
mystery that rivals any puzzle science
ever unearthed

  i-i dont think i follow you sir
look temple leaned forward ear-
nestly you know there are roughly
two kinds of meteorites-stone and
iron some twenty million of them
enter the earths atmosphere every
twenty-four hours although few of
them reach the earth without being
consumed by friction with air

 we think we know what meteors
are-cosmic dust the wreckage of shat-
tered planets or comets burst apart in
space we think space is full of these
fragments that were constantly meet-
ing them burning them up in our up-
per atmosphere or letting an occasional
large one get through to earth

  that sounds logical but is it if
that were the true answer then by all
the laws of probability the meteors
that do fall should be pretty evenly
distributed over the face of the earth
shouldnt they

  of course mccabe admitted daz-
edly but i dont see-

  they should be temple drilled
on but they arent the united
states is struck by almost as many
meteorites as all the rest of the world
put together but the real mystery
lies in stoney meteorites like the
swarm that just struck in kansas
why did they land in kansas

 why-why i suppose they just
happened to
the gods hate kansas



  did they listen kansas isnt a
very big state but a third of all stone
meteorites ever known to strike in
north america landed in little kansas
one-sixth of all the stones recorded on
earth struck kansas

  more stone meteorites land in kan-
sas than in any other state in the union
-more than in any other two states
west of the mississippi the largest
stone meteorite ever known landed
there the largest of the rare pallasite
stones as well struck kansas

  but that isnt all scott county
kansas is the only place on earth
where meteors ever struck twice in the
same place more meteoric falls have
been actually witnessed in kansas than
anywhere else on earth two of the
thirteen rarest meteor types known in
north america were found within the
borders of kansas

 why mccabe gasped feebly
thats utterly fantastic

  you bet it is-but its brutal fact
ask mullane dawson any astronomer
or read niningers book on meteorites
for a complete dated record of known
falls

  its fantastic but its been happen-
ing for centuries and there must be a
reason the disappearance of the me-
teor expedition is fantastic too but
again theres got to be a reason

 the landing of nine huge stony
meteorites travelling in a perfect v-
formation is fantastic and that isnt
all the expedition has been measur-
ing the impact pits scurrying around
to cross-examine witnesses to the fall
getting a complete picture of the di-
rection and velocity of the swarm ive
just finished assembling their data and
the results are even more fantastic
mccabe wet his lips and blinked
dazedly

  temple hurriedly strode across and
pounded a hard fist onto the presidents
desk

 do you know what those figures
revealed that meteor swarm was
travelling somewhere between seven-
teen and twenty miles a second-far
slower than the average meteor veloc-
ity and unless the figures are wrong
-they came from the moon

 the moon mccabe parroted
feebly but i dont see the connection

between that and our lost group

  i dont either temple barked
but im leaving for kansas tonight
and if there is a connection ill find it
if i have to tear the whole universe
apart

        chapter iii
        bhazh the great

five days earlier the meteor ex-
pedition had arrived at the loca-
tion of the fall with high hopes and
intense enthusiasm there was a world
of bitter back-breaking work to be
done but none of the nine persons in
the group had any thought for the
labor involved

  for the first time a sizable meteoric
fall had occurred before witnesses in
the midst of habitable country for
the first time some of the age-old cos-
mic secrets might be revealed before
relentless time had hidden them from
the searching eyes of curious man

  first of all there was the camp itself
to be set up the solles and their hired
man were employed on the spot to help
with the manual labor of the job

  the shacks were ranged in two fac-
ing rows alternating with the parked
trucks to form a short street at the
north end of this street the laboratory
shack was erected this was actually
two of the smaller shacks built together
to house the instruments equipment
and benches

  beside the laboratory was the focus
of interest and activity the great roped-
off area of impact craters where the
nine closely-bunched aerolites had bur-
rowed into the earth beyond casting
longing wistful eyes at the craters no
one touched the sacred section until
the last shack was up and in place the
last instrument set the last wire and
tube connected and ready for the vital
task ahead

  although the meteorites themselves
lay only a few feet below the surface
it was five days before any attempt
was made to uncover or lift them from
their graves a dozen vital tasks many
of them suggested by curtis temple in
-

startling stories

planning the expedition must come

first

  there was the problem of learning
from what part of space the visitors
had come that involved interviewing
everyone who had glimpsed the fierce
flame of the rocks before impact sift-
ing a welter of faulty memories optical
errors and vague guesses to ferret out
the fragments of fact

  farmer olson had seen the fireballs
over his cowbarn roof banker simms
through his bedroom window a young
country school teacher ten miles west
was sure they came from right up
there

  the solles could not agree on which
of three widely separated constella-
tions overhead had seemed to frame
the first faint sparks

  no matter how insignificant each
fact was weighed and judged and fitted
at last into the growing composite
picture of the great swarms path
through the atmosphere from its radi-
ant point when the path was finally
charted and found to coincide with the
angle of impact suggested by the cra-
ters there was rejoicing in the camp
and the mathematicians went to work

 jphere was work for all sciences

    chemistry attacked the rims of the
craters analyzing the soil content and
composition estimating the amount of
heat generated by impact and from
that the possible velocity of the rocks

  bacteriology probed the scorched
earth in fruitless search for signs of
living organisms sloughed off during
passage physics ranged the wheat
field striking the baked prairie with
carefully-measured blows to compute
its surface resistance to impact

  pop-eyed visitors came from coun-
ties around to gape at the spectacle
bored reporters drifted in snapped
dull shots and went away still bored

  the evening of the fifth day every-
one stood in the circle of light from
portable floods and watched the first
and largest of the nine aerolites glide
up over the rim of its pit drawn by
windlass on the power truck

  arnie cole and the solles father and
son guided the cables and steadied the
wood beams that served as track for
the heavy rock dr eno rocossen

chief astronomer and head of the group
supervised the job hovering over the
dingy chunk of cosmic debris as so-
licitously as a mother hen over her
chick

  there was a concerted rush to ex-
amine the basketball sized alien as it
came to rest beside the lab shack lee
mason on her knees beside jacobs the
chemist fingered the fused surface of
the aerolite in frowning bewilderment

  ive examined a lot of siderites
siderolites and aerolites she said
finally but never one quite like this
it obviously isnt an iron or an iron-
stone yet it seems to lack the chon-
dritic structure of a true stone

  and ive never seen anything like
that hard pitchy coating over one be-
fore jake when are you going to start
an analysis test  i have a feeling youll
run into a completely unique chemical
constitution i wish curt could have
been here to see this

  jacobs grinned and reached for a
geologists hammer

  we all miss curt-but not for the
same reason lonely heart here lets
crack off a few chips and run a test on
them right now im as curious as you
are well try some simple ones to-
night and then start a test for occluded
gases first thing in the morning

  wait lee masons hand on the
chemists arm halted the first hammer
blow when your arm threw a shad-
ow just then-jake switch off the
lights a moment

  as swift darkness followed the click
of the switch a concerted gasp rose

  radioactive lee exclaimed i
thought i saw a faint greenish glow
in the shadow can you beat that
our meteorite is unique other stoneys
have only been about a fourth as ra-
dioactive as ordinary terrestrial gran-
ite which isnt very much

  looks like we found something all
right jacobs assented excitedly lift-
ing the hammer well here goes for
a sample ill chip off some for your
spectroscope tests too why whats
wrong with you lee

  on her knees lee mason was sway-
ing dizzily her lovely face drawn into
a tight startled frown she shook her
head dazedly after a moment and her
face cleared
the gods hate kansas



  i dont know nothing i guess
jake just for a moment i had the
oddest sensation-a sort of cold dread
at the thought of chipping the covering
on the stone but im all right now
go ahead and crack our egg

  jacobs touched her pale forehead
without feeling the glow of fever
frowned shrugged and turned back to
his task

  sumpn you et most likely he said
lightly watch where the chips fly
lee we cant afford to waste a single
grain

an hour later the entire expedi-
tion crowded into the small lab-
oratory for the first rough analysis
tests scientific curiosity ran at too
high a pitch for anyone to think of sleep

could dodge a ghostly beam car-
pistoning legs chapter viii

that night fragments chipped from
the stones waited in nine labelled en-
velopes to tell their hidden stories to
the ears of science

  dr eno rocossen finished polishing
his spectacles and took out the contents
of the first envelope

  jameson you go ahead with a mi-
cro examination of both sheath and
matrix using this little chip here kin-
sell you help jacobs on the-

  he stopped speaking blinked daz-
edly and passed a trembling hand
across his forehead the precious bits
of aerolite dribbled out of his lax palm
unheeded he gripped the lab bench
hard leaning on it as though for sup-
port


startling stories

  doctor lee cried in sudden alarm
starting forward are you ill

  he straightened waving her back
his ascetic face regained its composure
only his eyes seemed different-flat
and empty

  no he said in an oddly changed
voice no im quite all right ive
made the connection now its-its
a bit confusing for a few moments but
that passes almost immediately you
may all take hold

  through a moment of dead silence
all eyes stared incredulously wonder-
ingly there was no sense in the words
but there was something vaguely men-
acing in their hidden import lee ma-
son gaped in horror wondering if the
great man had suddenly gone mad

  then a disturbance across the room
caught her gaze the chubby physicist
lansdon was stumbling toward rocos-
sen a strange expression on his moon
face

  he halted and his hands moved
feebly in a vague salute

  yes he said oddly it is dizzying
at first you-youre bhazh arent
you im tas ii

  beside lee the gaunt sardonic ja-
cobs whose name ranked second to
none in knowledge of star chemistry
bowed low

  and here is gniz oh mighty
bhazh

  lee mason gaped in bewilderment
and sank down weakly on the nearest
bench

  it couldnt be that everybody here
has gone crazy except me she said to
herself it must be that theyre all
sane and ive gone crazy so the sane
things they say and do sound like crazy
things to my crazy mind it must be
that oh lord i wonder if curtll
come and visit me in the asylum

  she stiffened abruptly and a sharp
gasp burst from her lips like a dash
of ice water something infinitely cold
touched and clung to the base of her
skull she slapped at it tried to brush
it away but her hand met nothing ex-
cept the soft cloud of her hair

  lee tried to rise and her strength
refused the task the thing on her
neck was burrowing digging incred-
ibly icy tentacles through flesh and
skull bone and deep into the matter

of her brain she tried to scream and
no sound would come

  then the icy finger touched some
unknown sensitive spot deep in her
brain and a swift stab of utter agony
lanced through every nerve in her body
it was like a dentists drill touching
the raw nerve of a tooth only worse-
a hundred times worse the agony
died and with it her senses

  a moment later lee mason rose
stiffly turned and bowed low toward
dr eno rocossen her voice came
stiffly woodenly

  vrag is connected great bhazh
you have succeeded in all things be-
yond the greatest vision of our mas-
ter

  dr eno rocossen whose prim figure
was familiar to every astronomical
group and conference and society in
the world grinned like a satyr and
pounded his breast

 of course he acknowledged did
i not promise that it would come to
pass and am i not bhazh-bhazh

chapter iv
the mystery deepens

darkness had fallen by the
time curtis temple finished
packing his suitcase he hoisted the
heavy grip to a chair stared out of the
window seeing lee masons face
against the curtain of the night

  at midnight he would take the plane
to wichita and change to a train for
the remainder of the journey to bomer
and the site of the vanished encamp-
ment but even the start of that jour-
ney was four hours into the future
now there was nothing but the inter-
minable agony of waiting the bitter
helplessness of his position in the face
of the mystery

  he turned from the window and
paced the floor driving a clenched fist
into his open palm gritting his teeth
against the onslaught of vague form-
less terrors that chilled his blood if
only someone had seen the expedition
breaking camp had heard the thunder
the gods hate kansas



of the caravans passage in the night
had even found evidence of violence at
the camp-site-

  it would give the mystery a founda-
tion of reality give him something to
get his teeth into this horrible blank-
ness dug into his nerves he had the
weird feeling of standing on the brink
of some vast unknown of being about
to blunder awkwardly into conflict with
some cosmic influence beyond human
comprehension or resistance

  he swore at the thought and tried
to reason his jangled nerves back to
calmness what had actually hap-
pened a group of sane intelligent
people had seen fit to abandon a site
and a project perhaps for some greater
research that unexpectedly beckoned

  no one had happened to notice their
departure and they consumed with the
wonder of some new discovery had
forgotten to communicate with their
sponsors there was nothing too un-
usual in that temple himself had on
occasion become so engrossed in re-
search that he had forgotten to eat or
sleep or report himself for days on end

  his eyes lighted with the impact of
a new thought it was so beautifully
simple and logical that only his dis-
turbed mental state could have caused
him to overlook it before what had
happened was obvious

  another meteorite had fallen per-
haps it was one of the same swarm that
had been detached from the group and
hurled to earth some distance away
the expedition seeing or hearing of
this new mass had simply moved camp
to the new site

  they had not as yet had time to re-
establish communication with the uni-
versity or even the nearby town of
course that was what had happened
it had to be that way

  curtis temple laughed shakily and
turned to the telephone beside his bed
he would phone mccabe and set the
prexies mind at rest with that explana-
tion

  he was bending over the instrument
smiling a little at his own earlier panic
when the window behind him slammed
to the top of its frame and a harsh voice
cried

  stand right still there young man
put that there telephone down quiet

and dont reach out for nothing
temple whirled around toward the
sound of the voice and his eyes
snapped wide he stood there for a
moment rigid with shocked incredu-
lity

the intruder was a woman but
that fact temple could have taken
in his stride it was her incredible ap-
pearance that made him reel and doubt
his own sanity

  she was a woman of perhaps fifty-
five tall and gaunt with black hair
stringy around her wrinkled face her
skin was rough and reddened from
wind and sun and the old gingham
dress she wore was faded from innu-
merable washings as temple stared
dazedly she climbed in through the
open window and menaced him with
the weapon clutched in her knobby
toil-worn hands-a pitchfork

  the woman held the sharp tines of
the pitchfork close to curtis temples
chest and stared at him for a long mo-
ment with faded eyes that were as
blank and lifeless as the windows of
an empty house finally she jerked
her head

  that your belongins-all packed
nice in that there grip

  y-yes temple managed swal-
lowing hard who are you what on
earth-

  dont matter the woman snapped
git your grip and come along nice
you had it ready saves waitin around
fer you to pack

  temple took a deep steadying breath
and let his hands drop to his sides
the woman was obviously an escaped
maniac a dangerous one with that
crude weapon and the thing to do was
humor her he managed a sickly im-
itation of a placating smile

  now ill be glad to go with you
just tell me where you intend taking
me and-

  a spark glowed for a moment in the
depths of the blank eyes the pitchfork
lifted moved and one of the sharp
tines raked painfully across curtis
temples cheek drawing blood

  if you aim to get the best o me
dont try just get that grip and git
goin youll know where soon
enough


startling stories

  the stinging of the scratch on his
cheek decided temple against resist-
ance still more than half convinced
he was somehow dreaming all this he
hoisted his packed bag and slid obedi-
ently out onto the dark lawn

  the pitchfork shifted and prodded
him ungently between the shoulder
blades under its compelling urge he
moved out across the lawn to the dark
street in front there only the con-
stant pricking of the sharp tines kept
him from halting in fresh amazement

  a car waited at the curb-an ancient
relic of a ford touring car with cracked
windshield and a tattered fabric top
held down by straps and ropes be-
hind the steering wheel sat a gaunt
weather-beaten man in faded overalls
there was a second figure in the back
seat concealed by the darkness tem-
ple stiffened as light from a distant
street lamp showed a muddy kansas
license plate on the back of the ford

  i got him gus temples captor
cried as they neared the car he was
all packed fer travelin so we didnt
need to wait around

  thats good martha the gaunt
man approved put him in here by
me an you-

  temple was close enough to see the
figure in the back more clearly he
stopped short ignoring the jabbing
tines and a low harsh sound rose in
his throat

  the man in the back seat was mul-
lane the astronomer

  good evening curtis mullane
spoke then in an odd voice that some-
how held a quality of unhumanness
step right in i know you must won-
der what all this is about curt but i
assure you its all for a purpose-a
great purpose-and presently you will
understand

  i hope so temple growled relief
bringing a surge of boiling anger
mully if this is one of your
gags 

he stopped short one foot on the
running board his hand in the
act of swinging open the car door for
just an instant he had felt a queer diz-
zying sensation like the touch of small
cold fingers wriggling momentarily in
his hair the subtle impact made him

gasp like a swimmer plunging into icy
water

  then mullane and the gaunt man
were both leaning forward staring at
him with a queer feverish intensity
there was something about them tem-
ple could see then that was not quite
right it seemed to be their eyes   

  not this one the gaunt man said
suddenly sharply not this one at
all

  go back to your room curt mul-
lane said then like a parent instructing
a child this was all a mistake you
go inside again and forget all about
what-

  ill be blasted if i will temple
roared in a sudden burst of rage
somethings wrong about all this-
plenty wrong i dont know what it
is but the answers down in kansas
these two came from kansas and
theyre snatching you mully ill stop
it-and ill get to the bottom of whats
going on

  he surged forward swung a fist at
the gaunt man his arm hit one of the
straps holding the top down and the
blow missed its target still roaring
temple lunged over the side of the car
hands clutching at the mans gaunt
throat

  he forgot the woman behind him
until unbelievably powerful hands
clawed into his shoulders and jerked
him back from the car he spun help-
lessly saw the pitchfork swing up re-
versed caught a glimpse of mullanes
weazened face watching him with de-
tached sad-eyed interest

  then the handle of the pitchfork
slammed along the side of his jaw with
desperate fury curtis temple had
time for an instant of thankfulness
that it had not struck the back of his
head to undo all the doctors fine work
then the blackness of oblivion caught
him up and swept his senses away

chapter v
word from the missing

oblivious to both heat and
dust curtis temple rocked on his
heels under the afternoon sun and
the gods hate kansas



stared with dull eyes at the nine dark
chunks of stone-all that remained of
the meteor camp there was nothing
else save the nine raw scars from
which the meteorites had been dug

  fifty deputies scoured the surround-
ing plains for signs of the missing ex-
pedition two fbi men systematically
took the sdlle farm apart in search of
clues others ranged the countryside
questioning endlessly and fruitlessly

  in the eighteen hours that had passed
since the abduction of mullane the as-
tronomer and the weird attack on
temple nothing had happened to
lighten the mystery rather it had
been deepened

  the blow to the jaw had stunned
curtis temple for no more than a doz-
en minutes immediately thereafter
his breathless report had police comb-
ing the streets throwing an airtight
cordon around the city but to no
avail the kansas ford with its kid-
nappers and mullane their victim had
vanished completely

  before temple boarded his plane at
midnight two more of the nations
leading scientists had disappeared
seized by weatherbeaten men in over-
alls armed with farm implements as
weapons it might have been a bur-
lesque of crime except for the steadily-
deepening under-current of nameless
horror

  stillwell the fbi man met temple
when he arrived at the camp-site the
next afternoon from fingerprints and
the descriptions of eye-witnesses the
fbi had identified the kidnappers

  martha and gus solle had abducted
mullane and attacked curtis temple
young gus solle junior had seized dr
rayfield the authority on atomic
power amie cole the hired man had
abducted lanelle inventor of the new
oxylium explosive

  beyond that knowledge the fbi was
as stumped as everyone else four
simple farmers twelve of the best
minds of science and some eighty-
thousand dollars worth of instruments
and equipment had apparently vanished
from the face of the earth there was
no conceivable reason though the
newspapers screamed fifth column
and crackpots besieged the dies com-
mittee headquarters

  nor was there any apparent infor-
mation to be gained from the meteo-
rites themselves

  to temples trained eye they were
obviously unlike the recorded types of
stony aerolites

  but this was apparently no more
than a matter of physical composition
and so little was yet known about me-
teorites that this meant nothing be-
yond the discovery of a new rare type
yet his mind persisted in linking them
with the mystery why he could not
tell

perhaps it was because he could
not forget the older mystery of
why kansas had been singled out for
the grim bombardment from the skies
according to scientific calculation tak-
ing all types of meteorites together the
rate of fall should average something
like one to a square mile every million
years

  or maybe it was because the face of
lee mason seemed to look out at him
from every stone a dark unfathomable
pleading in her blue eyes

  he turned away from the nine grim
secrets in stone and went back to the
solle farmhouse stillwell the fbi
man met him on the porch

  any news temple asked for the
tenth time

  stillwell mopped his streaming fore-
head and swore

  yes and no nothing about your
girl but the solles turned up walked
into the police station in cincinnati an
hour ago and asked for help to get back
here

  then they can explain whats hap-
pened theyll know where the
other-

  stillwell shook his head

  but they dont our field man in
cincy is with them now and getting no
place fast they claim the last thing
they remember is standing around
camp that night watching the meteors
cracked open the next thing they
knew they were all waking up in their
old ford on this edge of the pennsyl-
vania hills

  they cant remember a thing in be-
tween and didnt know how they got
there they pooled what money they
had and started home but it gave out
startling stories

along with their gas out on reading
road in cincinnati

  theyre lying temple cried
hoarsely they must be people dont
drive in their sleep half-way across the
continent and start kidnapping-
people dont just vanish into thin
air either stillwell interposed dryly
but some did i know how you feel
temple but it looks like were facing
the impossible on this case

  our men have given the solles asso-
ciation tests and every known type of
mental and physical exam-and were
not exactly amateurs either weve
faced phony amnesia alibis before but
this time im afraid theyre telling the
truth

  the ringing of the old-fashioned tele-
phone inside the house interrupted
them stillwell went in and leaned
against the wall beside the big box-like
instrument through the door tem-
ple could see the federal man stiffen and
bend down closer to the long arm of
the mouthpiece he started into the
house feeling the sudden urge and
pound of blood in his eardrums

  stillwell said something explosive
into the phone and pronged the receiver
with a violent crash he whirled
around and stared at curtis temple

  a heck of a note he said flatly an-
grily one heck of a fine note are
all scientists nuts or do they just act
that way to be different

  what do you mean temple de-
manded staring

  stillwells voice was bitter

  we were looking for em the cops
and the county sheriffs and the state
police and all their relatives and friends
were looking for em to say nothing of
every half-witted amateur detective and
newspaper reporter the whole damn
nation was looking for em and they
were never lost

 what what do you-

  stillwell kicked a chair in an excess
of baffled rage

  i wish id stuck to accounting the
whole meteor crowd just got in touch
with culwain and culwain notified
washington they havent been lost
at all they simply packed up night
before last and moved to a new spot
two miles east of vingrove arizona
we couldnt trail them because they

didnt follow the roads out of here
they cut across the prairie and the
wind blew their tracks away theyre
there now and your pal mullane and
the other missing scientists are with
them

  theyve leased a camp-site out in
the desert ordered a trainload of sup-
plies and materials and have a hundred
workmen hired from all over that end
of the state putting up a regular tar-
paper city

  dont ask me why or anything
about it i wouldnt know im just a
poor simple-hey if youre going to
put in a long distance call to arizona
youd better let me place it for you i
know how to handle that kind of phone
and the kind of operator theyve got in
bomer

half an hour later curtis temple
stood at the high wall phone
with the old-fashioned tubular receiver
trembling against his ear and heard the
voice that had haunted his dreams he
had not fully realized how frightened
he had been for her safety until now
lee darling are you all right
of course im all right it was her
voice yet not her voice lacking all the
silvery overtones that gave it life and
melody but im terribly busy cur-
tis you wont mind if i-

  i do mind temple snapped the
whole country has been upset and ive
been half out of my mind since you van-
ished you cant just dismiss every-
thing like that

  why did you leave the meteors and
slip away like that why couldnt you
have notified me lee this isnt like
you at all whats going on that i cant
know about what is this important
work that  

  im sorry curtis she cut in flatly
but explanations will have to wait in
good time you will understand the proj-
ect differently

  is it-has it something to do with
the meteors

  temple heard the sharp hiss of a
startled indrawn breath when she
spoke again her voice was wary

  no-well yes indirectly its
something too vast and too vital to be
delayed i must go now goodb-
wait he fairly shouted the word
the gods hate kansas



lee ive got to see you i still think
somethings terribly wrong im going
to arizona ill be there tomorrow-
no she sounded suddenly pan-
icky you must not come here i
forbid you to come here i will not-
he hung up cutting off her protesta-
tions

 when he whirled from the phone
stillwell was leaning against the wall
close by eyeing him queerly an un-
lighted cigaret dangled from his lip
the fbi man had overheard part of the
conversation and sensed the trend of
the remainder

  so thats that he said shrugging
theres a train out of bomer in about
twenty minutes thatll take you back
home or i would drive you over to
rockton the line to phoenix runs
through there whichll you take tem-
ple

  dont be an idiot temple roared
get me to rockton as fast as you can
this isnt cleared up by any means
somethings wrong with lee mason
and im going to find out what
good boy stillwell hurled away
his unlighted cigaret and reached for
his hat somethings wrong with the
whole setup but my hands are tied
now if those men werent kidnapped
then the fbis out of the case

  from here on its your headache
boy and ive got a feeling all hades is
about due to break loose somewhere
if you need any personal help call on
me temple

 neither of them could know how
right stillwell was nor that he would
be dead within forty-eight hours-the
first victim of the terrible inferno that
he had predicted

 long island city n y bottled locally by authorized bottlers

chapter vi
the crimson plague

the spring blooming of cactus
made the desert a carpet of breath-
taking beauty under the morning sun
but temple forcing his rented car at
top speed over the rutty trail from vin-
grove had no eyes for the beauty
around him

  his attention was focussed on the
huddle of dark buildings rising out of
the desert floor ahead even at that
distance he recognized the familiar
black shacks and the row of university
trucks and the sight brought a lump
into his throat

  but the swift stab of nostalgia was
swept away in sheer wonderment at
the changes wrought the original six
shacks were dwarfed by a vaster camp
mushrooming above and around them

  in the center of the area a towering
windowless building large enough to
contain the original camp twice over
loomed skyward radiating from this
central structure were wide streets
lined with additional shacks in various
stages of construction

  it was unbelievable impossible-yet
there it was in town temple had been
told that the camp settled on a barren
spot in the desert now forty-eight
hours later a miniature city was racing
skyward

  some of the incredible speed of prog-
ress was accounted for by the flimsy
frame and tar paper construction of all
the buildings more was due to the

turn page


startling stories

vast hordes of workmen who swarmed
like flies raising an infernal din of saw-
ing and hammering

  but manpower alone could not ac-
count for the miracle behind it must
lie that same mysterious inhuman driv-
ing stimulus that had accomplished
the impossible in moving the first camp
overnight what that relentless urge
was temple grimly determined to find
out

  the speeding car topped a small rise
and ground to a sudden skidding halt
ahead the trail was barred by a mas-
sive steel gate from either side of
which a high steel-mesh fence ran out
to encircle the entire camp signs con-
spicuously posted on gate and fence
read

danger-charged fence

 volts

  temples eyes became glittering slits
in the taut gray mask of his face he
got out of the car and strode purpose-
fully toward the gate fists swinging
free

  beyond the barricade a chunky man
in shirt sleeves and stained straw hat
burst out of a tiny guardhouse a heavy
revolver bumping on one thigh the
chunky man waved his hands

  keep back bud this heres private
property and theres enough hot juice
in that gate to kill an elephant no-
body gets in so dont argue just beat
it fast

 take it easy temple snapped
coldly i want to talk to miss mason
tell her its curtis temple shell see
me

  the chunky man gave the revolver
a hitch and spat on the hot sand

  i doubt it bud this crowd dont
exactly go in for social contacts but
ill try anyhow

  he vanished into the guardhouse and
returned presently shaking his head

  miss mason says she aint got time
to chin she says beat it home and
shell get in touch with you later

  then let me talk to mullane or ro-
cossen or-

  the chunky man tightened his lips
and shook his head

  nope she said for you not to pes-
ter nobody else neither sorry bud

you run along now like a good guy
temple controlled himself with an ef-
fort and swung on his heel force
would gain him nothing against that
deadly charged barrier he paused sud-
denly

  whats going on in there anyhow
what are the build-

  i wouldnt know bud i just watch
the gate the chunky man shrugged
and spat again for the dough they
pay i wouldnt even know if this was
arizona or iceland

temples jaw tightened he
whirled back to the car threw it
into low gear and stepped out on the
running board as it lurched ahead

  hey he stopped the retreating
guard with a shout youd better step
back a little there may be some sparks
flying when my car goes through your
gate fellow

  the gateman stared swore and wind-
milled his arms

  dont hey stop that crate waitll
i phone the office again judas priest

i	only work here bud

  waiting only long enough to see
temple slide in and stop the rolling car
he plunged back into his booth a mo-
ment later he came back into sight
mopping his forehead

  sit tight you crazy idjit he panted
shes cornin out dont do nothing
screwy till she comes for gosh sakes
temple saw her then hurrying
across the hard-packed sand at the same
accelerated tempo that seemed to mark
everything about the camp and his
breath caught in his throat it was
lee mason with all the loveliness he
knew so well

  yet something was lacking sorrfe-
thing that defied analysis the perfec-
tion of line and color was there but the
innate personality was gone she was
like a beautiful wax doll a perfect
image in everything but the vital spark
of animation

  she ignored the guard and came to
the gate staring through with no
warmth in her flawless face to meet
temples smile

  why are you making this disturb-
ance annoying me and interrupting my
work i told you not to come here
curtis
the gods hate kansas



  her sharp rebuke was a knife stab in
his heart

  i had to come lee to find out what
happened to you what changed you
from a human being into a-

 sentiment she spat and for an
instant some faint spark flamed in her
eyes i wont have it my work here
is too big and too vital to be disturbed
by silly emotional crisis there is no
room for personal feelings in-

  temples lips peeled back from his
teeth

  why were mullane and those others
kidnapped he interrupted sharply
watching her face

 kidnapped she echoed coldly
they came willingly in response to an
appeal the solles carried for us-

 i dont believe you temple
snapped solles old ford could never
have made that trip in so short a time
and you cant explain why mullane and
the others didnt leave word for their
families if they came willingly or why
solles have lost their memories or-
solles mental condition is of no in-
terest to me lee cut in coldly the
men came secretly to avoid delay

  as to the trip the ford was carried
east in the back of a fast truck on
the return trip solles decided to stop
over in the east so they and their car
were dropped off in pennsylvania
temples jaw set grimly that ex-
plained how the ford and its passen-
gers eluded the police cordon hidden
inside a closed truck it was a cever
dodge-too clever to have originated in
the minds of simple farmers the ex-
planation only intensified temples
nebulous suspicions

 you dont expect me to swallow
that lee he said flatly you arent
talking or acting this way of your own
free will im convinced of that

  ill go now but im coming back
and im going to get to the root of this
mystery if youre hypnotized lee
or held by some threat-

  she whirled away and faced the wait-
ing guard nearby

 if you see that man sneaking
around she ordered coldly pointing
at temple or trying to get through
the fence use your revolver those
are orders this is private property
and we have a legal right to defend our

privacy with weapons is that under-
stood guard

 lee-

  the cold inhuman words were ham-
mer blows that smashed into temples
reeling brain exploded sharp agony
in his heart and sent him reeling back
on trembling limbs he lifted a hand
toward her and then dropped it to his
side

  he turned away then his eyes dull
and his face rigid inflexible

  this was not lee mason not the
laughing girl who had worked with
him in the lab and walked hand in hand
with him under the stars on culwain
campus that was an alien creature
a lovely shell from which all humanity
had been drained

  why or how he could not guess but
his fists suddenly ached with tension
and his lips moved in a silent bow
somehow he would bring the vital
spark back to her eyes the warmth
into her lovely face once more

  meanwhile he faced a superhuman
task he was a blind man groping
in the darkness he must steel him-
self against heartache put aside every
emotion become as ruthless and cold as
she

  without looking back he got into his
car and returned to his hotel in vin-
grove to lay plans

  that afternoon the crimson plague
made its horrible debut in bomer
kansas

  stillwell the fbi man was its first
victim

stillwell and his aides their
reports finished had checked out
of their hotel for the return to the
wichita field office they were leav-
ing the hotel approaching their car
at the curb when it happened a dozen
passers-by saw the tragedy

  without warning stillwells voice
broke in the midst of a remark he stif-
fened his lean body rocking up onto its
toes with every joint locked in intol-
erable tension an expression of ter-
rible agony framed a cry that was never
uttered

  to the onlookers it seemed that
some terrible internal pressure literally
blasted every drop of blood in his body
out to the surface turning the puffed


startling stories

flesh a hideous crimson dotting it with
tiny droplets of exuded blood

  for an instant stillwell poised on his
toes then plunged forward into the
arms of a companion when a doctor
who had stopped in passing reached
the victims side all signs of life had
vanished

  no one thought of contagion the
doctor saw only a rare and exciting
case of organic malfunction the
onlookers pressing close saw only a
morbidly-fascinating form of violent
death willing hands carried the hide-
ous travesty of a human form across
the street to the funeral establishment

  it beats me the doctor told the
gaping crowd when he completed a
sketchy examination im going to
report this to the state association right
now

  he reached for the phone stiffened
and collapsed with the same horrible
suffusion of blood masking his flesh
the crowd fled in a panic one of those
who had borne stillwells body was
struck down in the doorway to the
funeral home another in the street out-
side

  queerly neither of stillwells fellow
fbi men were stricken they risked
death a hundred times through the
night to cheat the crimson killer
whipping the crowds into a semblance
of sanity carrying the bodies of vic-
tims to an unused shed far out on the
edge of town

  no more victims fell that night or
the next morning an army of medi-
cal warriors arrived in the night and
went to work analysing and testing
the bodies the soil water air and food
of the town but results were nega-
tive no unfamiliar germs were found
no organic reason for the seizures
medical science stood baffled and help-
less

  doctors equipped with every mod-
ern defense against contagion buried
the victims far from town two hours
later three doctors a nurse the sexton
who had volunteered to fill the graves
and an innocent farmer two miles from
the scene of burial succumbed to a re-
turn of the plague

  by nightfall a circle of armed
guardsmen surrounded bomer to pre-
vent the flight of refugees who might

spread what the newspapers now called
the crimson plague

 that night a mob of grim-faced
townsmen threw gasoline and flaming
torches at the shed where plague vic-
tims lay a roaring flame sprang up to
consume shed and bodies within a space
of minutes and the mob turned away
its task completed

  a sudden shift of wind suddenly
whipped a shower of ashes from the
ruins out into the crowd instantly
two men dropped with the terrible
mask of the plague on their faces the
survivors fled half insane with terror

  at midnight the nations leading
medical man faced a group of col-
leagues in secret meeting

  ill tell you he said grimly
though i wont tell the country at large
until i have to were stumped the
plague cant be anticipated checked
nor barred by anything we know nei-
ther burial nor cremation seem to ef-
fect its spread we dont know what it
is where it came from or how to stop it

 gentlemen unless some way is
found to utterly isolate the body of
every crimson plague victim beyond
any possibility of contact with human
beings the plague may sweep the
earth

chapter vii
blue thunder rising

temple pacing the floor of his
hotel room in vingrove heard the
radio reports of the crimson plague
and groaned aloud

  the gods must hate kansas

  the meteorites had fallen on kansas
the weird change in the personalities
of the scientists occurred there and
now the crimson plague had burst
forth from the same deadly focal point
it was too much to blame on
casual coincidence behind the linking
mysteries must lie a dark sinister pat-
tern of some kind a pattern that mad-
dened temple because it eluded him

  why hadnt he caught the plague if
it was a virulent contagious disease
he had been in close contact with still-
the gods hate kansas

io

well a few short hours before his at-
tack and had moved through the same
atmosphere

  were the deadly unseen organisms
of the disease lurking even now in his
system waiting their time to strike
was the crimson plague somehow be-
hind the unnatural actions of lee
mason and her associates

 the endless chain of unanswered
questions blurred inside his aching
head there was only one way to learn
those answers and that was to pene-
trate the guarded camp and ferret out
its hidden secrets there must be some
way into camp

  temple paced the streets asking end-
less questions of store-keepers and any-
one else having contact with the camp
making and discarding a hundred wild
schemes he watched the familiar
culwain trucks disgorge loads of work-
men from the day shift and pick up
new workers for the night

  his hope of slipping into the group
disguised as a carpenter were dashed
when he saw that each man bore an
identification disc riveted to his wrist
with numbers carefully checked against
a register

 he got his car and drove out to
camp slipping off the road some dis-
tance from the gate to circle the fence
on foot inside the workmen tore
through their tasks under the beating
glare of powerful floods putting finish-
ing touches on the last of the new struc-
tures from the towering central build-
ing came the flame and sputter of
electric arcs

  temple circled warily keeping out-
side the backwash of lights without
seeing a single guard patroling the
fence maybe he could insulate him-
self in some way and climb over the
barricade while attention centered on
the work inside

  fate interferred to keep him from a
fatal blunder her instrument was a
stray steer from some nearby range
that chose that moment to wander out
of a dark arroyo temple saw the ani-
mal a moment before it poked an inqui-
sitive nose against the wide mesh of
the fence

 he saw the steer and then he was
half-blinded by the sudden blaze of
greenish flame from shorted high ten-

sion current that blazed around the
stiffening body as the steer went
down bells jangled wamingly from the
heart of camp a knot of men raced
into sight carrying rifles and shotguns
dashing toward the shorted section of
fence

  temple faded back into the dark-
ness returned to his car and drove to
town his eyes were twin flames in
the gray granite mask of his face and
a white-knuckled fist pounded at the
steering wheel in helpless agony

  somehow the electrocution of the
wandering steer filled him with a
deeper horror than anything else that
had occurred it drove home with ter-
rible emphasis the change that had
taken place in lee and his friends the
careless indifference to human lives evi-
denced by that crouching death trap
clawed at his raw nerves

  he spent the remainder of the night
in his room pacing the floor driving
his numbed brain to contrive new the-
ories to explain the mystery and new
plans for penetrating it

  and during the night the crimson
plague circled out from bomer kan-
sas striking in a score of towns within
a radius of fifty miles of its starting
point

itext morning the streets of vin-
i grove were jammed with men
during the night construction work
had been completed at camp the men
paid off and discharged

  temple wasted most of the day hunt-
ing out these workmen and badgering
them with fruitless questions they
knew nothing beyond the fact that they
had built and wired frame shacks to a
plain specification what those shacks
were to be used for no one knew or
cared no they had seen nothing sus-
picious unless driving and double
wages could be called suspicious

  only a few men chiefly welders and
riveters seemed evasive and sullen
temple learned nothing from them but
he gave up convinced that these men
were simply bewildered because they
could not remember exactly what their
work had been he was positive that
like the solles they had somehow lost
all memories of their activities inside
the camp
startling stories

  get inside the camp get inside
the camp

  the words became a refrain that
hammered temples frozen brain with
the monotonous agony of an endless
drum-beat he paced the streets and
the desert sands to their aching rhythm
timed his prayers and his curses to their
endless repetition ate little and slept
less because the insistent clamor of
their command would not give him any
peace

  what was lee doing in there what
were they doing to her was she sick
or well was there any spark of feel-
ing for him still hidden somewhere in
her heart

  get into the camp the endless re-
frain cried get into the camp and find
out

  days of agony passed for temple
he spent long hours on a nearby hill-
top watching the camp through strong
glasses he saw lee and the others
frequently rushing on mysterious fev-
erish errands that centered inside the
big central building a half-dozen sul-
len-faced guards had been hired and
they spent much of their days hauling
steel sheets and beams from dwindling
piles outside into the main structure

  nights temple battered his bloody
head against the impregnable defenses
of the camp he was caught twice
stowed away in the back of incoming
trucks

  he hurled chains to short circuit
the fence but was driven off when the
alarm bells brought armed guards

  he tried ramming the fence with his
car and was stopped by stakes set deep
in the sand a tunnel under the barri-
cade met steel posts sank deep in the
ground twice he was shot at by
guards and narrowly escaped death
still the unremitting refrain get into
the camp drove him on

 meanwhile the crimson plague
leaped out from bomer kansas in
ever-widening circles it broke all the
known laws of contagion skipping ob-
vious victims and ignoring the feeble
defenses raised against it when the
plague chose to strike it struck with-
out regard for sciences punny barriers
doctors risked their lives to autopsy
victims and found nothing to indicate
either a cause or a cure

  only one thing was certain unless
mankind found some remote corner of
the universe in which to entomb the
bodies of plague victims the spread
could never be checked most of the
cases apparently rose from contact with
plague bodies no matter what efforts
were made at disinfection nor how re-
mote that contact might be

the thirteenth day after his last
talk with lee temple saw a fresh
burst of activity sieze the camp all
day the group hauled bundles into the
main building with frantic haste when
nightfall brought no cessation of the
mysterious activity temple stayed at
his hilltop post watching through his
nightglasses

  he saw figures moving on the roof
of the big structure and presently the
roof itself seemed to split apart and
open a gaping chasm through its cen-
ter in that chasm temple could faint-
ly see a round blunt-nosed cylinder
poked upward but the resolving power
of his glasses was too weak to make out
details

  whatever was happening he felt
marked the culmination of the mysteri-
ous project the thought doubled his
determination to penetrate the camp
that night regardless of cost he left
his post then and drove down the
winding trail toward the darkened
camp

  he was half a mile from his goal in
the lee of a high hill when the thing
happened

  he first became aware of it as a dis-
tant muttering rumble more vibration
than soffnd the earth shook to its
thunder sand billowed from the shift-
ing dunes and the steering wheel wob-
bled in his grasp with the thought
of an earthquake uppermost in his
mind temple braked the car and
kicked open the door

  at that instant the thunder suddenly
swelled rising to an unbearable pres-
sure against his eardrums at the same
time a weird bluish light sprang up
from some hidden point beyond the
hills illuminating the desert landscape
with unbearable brilliance

  then light and thunder whipped
away dwindling to a whisper that lin-
gered an instant after the darkness had
the gods hate kansas



once more closed in by the time tem-
ple got out of the car and looked up-
ward there was nothing   

  nothing but a tiny speck of flame
that burst up through the vast pan-
orama of the constellations and was
gone

chapter viii
into the camp

curtis temple was an experi-
enced meteor-hunter his eyes
and muscles had been trained to that
superb coordination that is essential in
capturing the secrets of elusive fleet-
ing meteor trails

  it was second nature for his eyes to
chart the fragmentary course of that
vanishing spark through the fixed
stars and reflex action for his fingers
to clock its speed across a familiar as-
terism on the specially built timer in
his wrist watch when the spark final-
ly disappeared he glanced down at the
dial and a sharp gasp broke through
his lips

  he sprang into the car and snapped
on the dome light for half an hour he
sat tensely a pad of paper propped
against the steering wheel his pencil
racing furiously recording endless cal-
culations and computations

  when at last he had finished curtis
temple sat back and drew a deep in-
credulous breath he had spent two
feverish weeks attempting to fathom
the activity within the camp and here
lay the answer on his pad-supplied by
a dying spark a stopwatch and math-
ematics

  by the motion of the spark across a
constellation whose apparent diameter
he knew he had obtained rough esti-
mates of its speed away from earth by
his knowledge of the position of stars
it occulted in its flight he had arrived
at a close approximation of its angle
of departure by projecting these fig-
ures he had reached both a beginning
and an end to the phenomena

  it was incredible impossible yet the
object could have been nothing but a
rocket-propelled space ship leaping up

from the heart of the meteor camp at a
speed that approached fifty miles a sec-
ond workable rocket ships were still
a dream of the future so far as science
knew yet nothing but a man-made and
man-propelled object could shatter the
shackles of gravity at such a speed

  and unless his hasty projection of
its tangent was far in error it could
have hurtled up into space toward only
one possible objective-to intersect
the orbit of the moon

  the nine black meteorites on the
kansas prairie had apparently come
from the moon and a rocket ship was
apparently flying to the moon

  so many things became clear to him
as he reluctantly accepted the evidence
of his figures the huge central build-
ing had housed the ship and its roof
had opened to permit its departure the
tons of metal must have gone into con-
struction of the craft

  rayfield and lanelle authorities on
atomic and explosive power had obvi-
ously solved the problem of propulsion
while mullane supplied a keen knowl-
edge of lunar topography

  but why the solution of one mys-
tery only intensified the greater one
why keep such an accomplishment se-
cret had the meteorites revealed the
presence on the moon of some treasure
hoard so vast that last for it turned
human beings into mad machines 

anew thougfit struck temple
and whitened his cheeks had
they all boarded that ship and left earth
forever perhaps deserting a world they
foresaw was doomed by the spreading
plague in the same breath he dis-
carded the idea

  he had glimpsed enough of the ship
to estimate its size it could never
transport twelve persons even if they
had accomplished miracles in solving
the problem of air supply and fuel stor-
age temple knew enough of the theo-
retical problems of astrogation to esti-
mate a maximum carrying capacity of
not over three or four persons

  then the others were still in camp
and with them lay the solution to the
deepening mystery temple kicked the
motor to life and sent the car rocketing
along the rutty trail without lights
steering by the faint radiance of the
sfc

startling stories

stars as he drove a desperate plan
was forming in his mind

  he left the road and circled around
behind the camp it lay in darkness to-
night except for a scattering of lighted
windows but the full radiance of the
floods was essential to his desperate
plan

  parking he got an iron jack handle
and a - rifle from the car the rifle
he had bought a week before on the off-
chance that it might serve a future pur-
pose tonight it was vital to his
scheme

  moving swiftly he ran through the
darkness and hurled the jack handle
against the fence crackling flame
leaped up at the impact and the shrill
clangor of alarm bells burst out from
camp instantly the floods came on
turning the night to day revealing the
knot of armed guards racing his way

  temple stood for a moment fixing
the location of his target in his mind
and then ran back to the car hunch-
ing up on the fender he rested the rifle
across the hood and centered its sights
above the running men on the tiny
black bulk of the transformer over the
generator truck nerve center of the
deadly charged fence

  it was a desperate gamble for the
guards hearing the whistle of slugs
over their heads would think them-
selves attacked and direct a withering
return fire tempjes eyes were narrow
and cold with grim purpose as he
squeezed the trigger

  the rifle spanged and bucked against
his shoulder from camp came the
shrill scream of a ricochet as the slug
glanced from the rounded transformer
shell the guards halted for a startled
moment and then began firing lead
whistled around temples head and
clanged into the body of the car

  he ignored the hail of death concen-
trating on bettering his aim the
guards were only a hundred yards
away yelling and shooting when he
fired again

  this time a burst of purple flame
ripped up from his target and every
light in camp whipped out the sud-
den darkness was blinding and the
guards halted with yells of alarm

  instantly temple slipped from the
car and raced down the fence away

from the milling guards who scattered
to find flashlights more startled cries
came from the camp

  temple ignored the sounds until they
faded behind him then he stopped and
threw the rifle against the fence there
was no answering crackle of shorted
current the barrier was at least mo-
mentarily robbed of its deadliness at
any moment some emergency circuit
might be cut in restoring its murderous
potentialities but he brushed that
thought aside

  toes and fingers dug into the wide
mesh and fairly hurled his lean bulk up
to the top of the barricade he poised
there for a moment then leaped out
into the darkness

  he landed on all fours ignored the
vicious stab of cactus needles against
his palms and plunged forward toward
the dark camp he had to get in and
find concealment before the lights came
back on or the demoralized group or-
ganized their defenses

  flashlights weaved in and out among
the shacks ahead and centered on the
generator truck temple pounded on
and burst into the darker canyon of the
camp street at a dead run ahead
loomed the vast bulk of the rocket han-
gar and he headed toward it as the
heart of the mystery he hoped to pen-
etrate

suddenly a dark bulk sprang at
him out of the shadows of parked
trucks and starlight glittered on the
metal tube of a flashlight or a gun
temples ears caught the sharp inhala-
tion of breath that preceeded a bellow
of alarm there was no time to identi-
fy the instrument or discover when the
figure was that of a guard or one of his
former friends

  temple hurled himself at the dark
figure and his fists lashed out the im-
pact of his knuckles against jaw bone
sent a sharp tingle of pain up his arm
then the figure was crumpling sound-
lessly temples exploring fingers felt
the cool bulk of a flashlight and he
snatched it before racing on

  he was almost to the hangar when
a puddle of yellow light from a flash
swept out from between two shacks
temple darted into the shadows and
froze a moment before the light and
the gods hate kansas

its bearer came into the street he held
his breath and saw the thin ascetic face
of spirovic professor of wave mechan-
ics behind the flashlights glow

physicists thin face was wolfish preda-
tory as he snatched at a small black
case that looked like a candid camera
hung at his side

  temple did not wait to learn how spi-
rovic could have sensed his presence or
what the case contained he exploded
into action leaping straight at the glar-
ing light

  his shoulder knocked the case from
spirovics hands and sent his slight fig-
ure reeling temple kneed him down
and burst down the street at a furious
sprint behind him the physicists
shrill voice rose in a shout of alarm that
was echoed by other throats from all
sides

  temple glanced back and saw spiro-
vic on his feet levelling the black case
suddenly a ghostly bluish beam shot
from the case before temple could

the screen showed a luminescent ball clinging
to the nape of the physicists neck chapter x

  spirovic halted while his light probed
under the nearer parked trucks miracu-
lously missing the figure temple had
downed a moment before then the
light swung away and temple drew a
breath of relief he was starting to
creep on when the physicist suddenly
halted gasped and whirled back

 the flashlights beam swept out un-
erringly and pinned temples crouch-
ing figure in its glare behind it the

 
dodge it caressed one of his pistoning
legs

  the contact was a searing flame of
agony his leg went numb and crum-
pled throwing him forward onto hands
and knees the beam winked out and
spirovic raced forward bawling in a
startling stories

triumphant voice tugging a flashlight
out of his pocket

  for a moment temple lay in dark-
ness his right leg was a dead useless
thing without life or feeling he dug
elbows and clawed hands into the hard-
packed sand and dragged himself away
from the street toward the dark
space between two shacks flashlights
sprang up around him reaching out
with hungry fingers temple blinked
cold perspiration from his eyes and
crawled on his breath a wheezing an-
guish in his throat

the touch of the blue ray what-
ever it was had been no more than
a light caress and life began to tingle
back into temples leg he lurched to
his feet and plunged into a grim trav-
esty of a run lurching and stumbling
for a moment the flashlights lost him
then they picked up his trail in the
sand

 temple pounded on with blind
dogged determination until the tower-
ing walls of the central structure
loomed up overhead he stumbled
against a small lean-to structure that
leaned against the bigger building and
his fumbling hands touched a heavy
door handle

  the door fell away with weighty pon-
derousness throwing him forward off
balance into the inky interior a blast
of chill air struck his face this must
be a refrigerated storehouse for per-
ishable supplies

  it was at least a temporary hiding
place regardless of its purpose he
eased the door shut and stumbled for-
ward into the enveloping blackness

  his unsteady feet tangled with some
yielding object he teetered clawed at
the empty darkness and went down
with a clatter across the thing that had
tripped him for a moment he lay still
fighting down the furious panting of
his lungs listening to the faint sounds
of the search outside

  after a time he sat up got out the
captured flashlight and snapped it on
under his coat the circle of filtered
radiance seeped through the cloth and
spread out over the thing beneath him

  it was the fully clothed body of a
man

  temples breath made a sharp wheez-

ing sound in his nostrils he scrambled
to his knees and a human face showed
in the glow of the light then the
sound of his breathing stopped and the
body slipped back into the concealing
shadows

  he had seen the face of the chunky
gateman suffused with the unmistak-
able spotted crimson of the plague

  then the outer door crashed open
and a lance of the bluish light sharper
and stronger now swept in to engulf
him

  he knew a single stab of utter agony
then darkness

chapter ix
flight from vengeance

temple opened his eyes in shad-
owy gloom and stared dully at his
surroundings he was lying on an iron
cot in a tiny windowless room of un-
painted planking with only a solid door
of heavy timbers to relieve the blank-
ness of the walls

  overhead through a low ceiling of
heavy steel mesh he saw a high-vaulted
roof with daylight filtering through
cracks and chinks one crack wider
than the others seemed to split the en-
tire sweep of the roof into two massive
sections

  that did it sight of the oddly-split
roof broke the numbness in his brain
he sprang to his feet as the memories
flooded back

  he had penetrated the camp fallen
on a plague victim and been struck
down by the mysterious paralyzing
force of the blue beam now he was
prisoner in a tiny cell inside the tower-
ing rocket hangar the split roof was
evidence of that

 memory of the plague victim
brought a stab of terror to his heart
the crimson plague had struck the
camp were there any other vittims
of its inexorable fury was lee
doomed to fall before it why had
they left the body of that guard so open
and unguarded why didnt they
flee

  in a fury of desperation he lunged at
the gods hate kansas



the door and the walls of his prison
he had to get out get lee away from
the plague area at once the danger
of his own exposure to the dread epi-
demic was swept away in his fears for
her safety

  small as his cell was it was rock-
solid temple gave up his efforts to
batter down the door at last and a
measure of sanity came back to his
brain he looked around and the low-
meshed ceiling caught his eye he
sprang up hooked his fingers into the
screen and pulled himself up against it

 his eyes snapped wide as the new
position widened his angle of vision

the rocket ship was back it lay
in its massive cradle pointing al-
most vertically upward so close to his
prison that it was barely beyond his
angle of vision from the floor his eyes
sifted the gloom and made out a laby-
rinth of gears and pulleys that opened
the split roof and tilted the cradle

  the ship itself was larger than he had
at first thought-a good fifty feet in
length of tear-drop shape with a max-
imum diameter of perhaps twenty feet
the nose rounded sharply to a tubular
point and a few feet behind it the hull
was encircled by what appeared to be a
fluted metal collar

  then he saw that the collar was actu-
ally a coweling that streamlined a ring
of backward-pointing tubes projesting
from the hull he guessed these to be
some sort of steering jets further
back the smooth metal was broken by
stubby retractable wings

  the entire hull was of dull seamless
metal unbroken by any ports or doors
entrance must be affected he guessed
down close to the tail which was below
his line of vision

 temples muscles weakened then
and he dropped to the floor again his
mind seething with new questions and
problems to all of them there seemed
but one source from which to get an
answer-the group themselves

  he threw back his head filled his
lungs and shouted

  hey he roared whats the idea
of locking me in here let me out

  the shout boomed up to the vaulted
roof and whispered away into silence
temple waited then shouted again

  this time he got results a door
creaked somewhere outside and foot-
steps clattered briskly

  a lock clicked outside his door and
a small peep-panel swung outward to
frame the cold expressionless face of
mullane

  stop creating a disturbance curtis
mullane snapped sharply you were
confined here to prevent further in-
terruptions to our work please be sen-
sible about it and remain quiet you
will be fed at regular intervals

  the words and the tone fanned the
spark of temples suppressed anger
into raging flame

  go to blazes he shouted furiously
if im such a pest why keep me
around why dont you knock me in
the head and shove me into cold storage
with that other poor devil

  we considered that mullane said
coldly and decided this way was bet-
ter and less annoying please dont
make us change our minds curtis
why you- concern for lees
safety suddenly dissolved his anger
mully for gods sake why did you
leave that body lying out there has
anyone else been stricken with the
plague how is lee she cant stay
here and risk-

calm yourself mullane said curtly
miss mason is in no danger her
knowledge is too valuable to be risked
he started to close the small panel
wait temple cried when did
the rocket ship come back or is this
a different one i saw one take off-
the same one mullane answered
coldly it returned the night after its
departure promptly on schedule
hey how long have i been out
mullanes voice was patient

  two days temple now please
dont make it necessary for us to ap-
ply the beam again in order to avoid-
cut it temple shouted furiously
whats this all about  what are you
using that ship for where did it go
the rocket was flown to the moon by
dr rocossen mullane answered after
a momentary hesitation it carried a
pre-fabricated launching cradle for the
return journey and an air-tight land-
ing depot hack be ginning tomorrow
the ship will operate on a regular sched-
ule leaving here every fifth day

startling stories

  temple gaped in sheer amazement

  why what is there on the moon
you certainly arent doing all this just
to start sight-seeing tours

  to transport the bodies of crimson
plague victims to the moon for dis-
posal

  plague victims

  exactly there is apparently no
place on the earth or in the earth where
the bodies may be placed beyond
danger of the infections spreading and
as long as the plague spreads medical
science cant stop to dig into history
for the plagues origin or take the
time to develop suitable combative
measures

  but if the spread could be at least
checked science feels that it could de-
velop an antidote we have found a
way to check it-by transporting the
bodies of plague victims to the moon
immediately before they contaminate
others

  there insulated from earth by the
airless miles of space they are no longer
a menace and the panic already grow-
ing in areas yet unattached will abate

jwo days ago we communi-
m cated our offer to the govern-
ment yesterday it was accepted we
have present facilities for transporting
twenty-five bodies at a time and con-
struction is started on a larger rocket
with a capacity of two hundred within
two months the plague should be
halted

  temples head was swimming he
caught his breath with an effort

 you mean you discovered the
plague before it started and moved
here to work out this cemetery on the
moon idea whos going to handle the
victims 

  how do you keep from catching
the crimson plague yourselves if
youve worked out a safeguard against
it why havent you given that to the
country

  we are all immune naturally im-
mune we are therefore taking turns
collecting the bodies in our own trucks
that was a part of our generous of-
fer

  where did the crimson plague
come from mully there is no pre-
vious record of it in medical history

  it is a new and alien menace to
earth curtis from somewhere in outer
space brought by those meteors

  temples eyes flamed dangerously in
the drawn grayness of his face

  so thats it he said sofely the
culwain expedition cracked open a
meteor and saw the plague inside
they realized instantly what it would
do to the world and that they them-
selves out of a few billion people were
selected by fate to be naturally im-
mune

  so they rushed here called in
other scientists to join their unselfish
sacrifice and built a rocket ship-a
flying hearse to their cemetery in the
sky is that correct

  mullanes answer sounded like a
metallic purr

  exactly curtis that is exactly
the way it occurred

  temples lips curled away from his
teeth he leaned forward and barked
one word

  nuts

  mullanes face was a blaze of cold
fury he started to wheel away

  what do you take me for temple
roared a dope how could you see
microorganisms the best medical equip-
ment in the world cant isolate how
could you know what theyd be or that
you would be immune

  and why treat me like a poor rela-
tion so ill run away and escape the
plague thats what im supposed to
believe isnt it well ive been ex-
posed twice and im still here either
im immune too or your crimson
plague is as phony as your alibi

  maybe thats it maybe the crim-
son plague isnt bacterial at all are
the bodies of earlier victims waiting
around for weeks to be buried is there
some secret action of the plague that
inhibits decay go ahead mully lets
hear you explain that in your inimitable
manner

  mullane started to swing the peep-
hole shut

  when no more than a slit remained
open he said coldly

  our first decision regarding your
disposal was a mistake i realize that
clearly now however a prolonged
application of the blue beam will rec-
tify that error perfectly
the gods hate kansas



 the panel slammed shut mullanes
angry footsteps drummed away and
out of the building there was no
doubt that he was coming back with
one of those paralyzing beam projectors
almost immediately

  temple must have hit too close to the
truth-so close that his continued ex-
istence was a menace to the group nor
did temple have any illusions of again
being permitted to recover from the
ray

 its touch now meant his finish and
the end of resistance to the groups
mysterious purpose

 he had to escape-but how the
iron cot the only movable object in
the room offered a crude weapon
temple demolished it with a kick and
wrenched off an iron leg

 not that he actually expected a
chance to use a club mullane needed
only to open the panel and send the
beam in through it for that matter
it might penetrate the walls them-
selves clothing had offered no bar to
its paralyzing touch

 the heap of blankets from the cot
met temples eye and a vague hope
stirred with desperate haste he ripped
them into strips and knotted together
a crude rope with a slip noose held
open by a piece of spring wire from the
cot then using the cot frame for a
ladder he climbed up and poked the
noose through the wire mesh ceiling
above the door

 it was such a slender gamble so
many things could go wrong and
failure signed his death warrant

 mullanes footsteps hammered back
and halted outside there was no
sound of the panel being unlocked this
time and temples heart sank he
had to make mullane open that

 mully he called hold on a min-
ute maybe youre right and im
wrong maybe i have been interfer-
ing with the one thing that can save
civilization

 temples breath hissed out as the
panel opened

 dont be childish mullane
snapped bending close to lift the black
projector case you are only trying
to stall me to save your own valueless
life it will not work

 sweat came out on temples fore-

head his right hand beyond mul-
lanes line of vision was desperately
working the free end of his makeshift
rope in the opening above the as-
tronomers unsuspecting head the
crude noose dangled too far forward
to center above its objective he had
to make mullane bend forward

  temple deliberately stepped back
out of sight

  you cant escape curtis mullane
cried and bent forward shoving the
projector into the opening

  the heck i cant temple barked
and snapped his hand up watch me

  the noose dropped over mulanes
head the dislodged strip of spring
dropped free and a jerk pulled the loop
tight at the same instant mullanes
hand pressed the projector knob

  the blue beam missed temples head
by inches and then winked out as mul-
lane dropped the projector to claw at
the strangling line praying that the
flimsy fabric would stand the strain
temple wrapped the line around his
fists and tugged

  he did not relinquish his hold until
mullanes struggles ceased and his
hands fell away from his purpling
throat then holding his victim erect
by the taut rope temple reached out
through the narrow panel located the
keys and let himself out

  lowering mullanes body he tore
away the strangling noose and felt
for a heartbeat it was there faint
but steady

  youll be okay he grunted and
some day youll thank me for this
mully

he locked the limp figure in his own
former prison and then retrieved
the fallen projector if he survived to
escape the camp science would want
to know the secret of that strange
paralysing blue beam

  right now escape was farthest from
his thoughts he had penetrated the
camp but not the mysteries until
lee mason was freed of the mysterious
influence that had so changed her na-
ture he would not leave but he had
to find a hiding place until nightfall if
he was to move about with any degree
of freedom he looked around the great
hangar


startling stories

  the rocket loomed above him its
cluster of giant stem jets deep in a
metal-lined pit in the floor to confine
the fierce heat of take-off blasts stubby
elevator fins at each side rested on
banks of rollers and a gangplank led
up to a round closed port in the ships
belly

  temple reluctantly tore his interest
away from the big ship and sought
a haven his eyes fell on the closed
outer door of the hangar and he crossed
to it holding his breath he eased it
open and peered out for an in-
stant the sight that met his gaze froze
him to immobility

  night was falling and the street out-
side was heavy with shadows through
those shadows came the whole expedi-
tion group running in a grim bunch
clutching a variety of weapons they
were heading with ominous purposeful-
ness straight at the hangar door

 lee mason led them one of the
deadly projectors in her slender hands
there was no question but that by some
mysterious means they knew of
temples escape and were rushing to
block his purpose

chapter x
kidnaper

temple whirled and raced around
the looming rocket toward another
door that showed faintly in the far
wall he went through it as his pur-
suers burst in the hangar behind he
found himself in a narrow corridor
lined with small laboratory cubicles and
leading to an outside door at the end
apparently each scientist had his own
research room close to the rocket

  head down temple raced for the
distant exit he was almost to his
goal when feet scraped outside and the
knob turned someone was coming in
blocking his escape that way he
turned and darted into the nearest lab-
oratory

  from the maze of optical equipment
thib room must belong to lansdon
the chubby physicist temples eye
wa caught by an odd instrument like

a grotesque stereoptican sitting on the
desk

  it bore the familiar double view-
ing apparatus except that one lens was
clear glass and the other completely
opaque the converging screen at the
back was a film of some richly violet
metal that temple guessed might be
caesium

  but there was no time to indulge sci-
entific curiosity by probing further
the footsteps were approaching the
door and the laboratory room bore no
windows or other means of exit

  temple took the only possible hid-
ing place the space below the labora-
tory bench a moment later the steps
entered the room

  he heard them advance a few paces
and then stop the sound of tense
breathing reached his ears and the
muted rustle of clothing nerves
crawled along his spine there was
something ominous in the deadly
quiet then lansdons voice spoke

  come out temple come out from
behind my bench i know youre there
and i have a gun trained on your heart

  temples breath hissed out he
touched the projector under his coat
and then his hand dropped he could
not turn it on men who had been his
friends and associates for all he knew
this on might be set to kill at a touch
of the blue beam he sighed and
climbed out

  the movement brought his eyes in
line with the screen of the odd appara-
tus on the desk and for an instant he
saw lansdowns head and shoulders
through that instrument the sight
froze him in gaping amazement

  the screen showed something alien
and incredible-a ball of glowing violet
luminescence clinging to the base of the
physicists brain tight against the nape
of his neck it was like nothing tem-
ple had ever seen before simply a glo-
bule of pure radiance without form
shell or nucleus

  he looked around the screen and the
thing was invisible he looked back
through the screen and it was still
there pulsing quietly in hideous simu-
lacre of life invisible and unsuspected
without the detector temple straight-
ened and met lansdons furious eyes

  you have seen too much the chub-
the gods hate kansas



by man whispered now you must be
destroyed at once

  the revolver in his hand lifted and
flamed a blasting thunder in the tiny
room

  but temple forewarned by lans-
dons whitening trigger finger was al-
ready plunging aside and away the
slug touched liquid fire to his ribs be-
low his left arm for an instant he
stumbled gasping

  then he had his breath again and
the terrible urgency of his purpose
poured fire into veins and muscles
there was only the single door and
lansdon with his deadly pistol blocked
that temple whirled and came up off
his knees with his sound right shoulder
up and his head down

he struck the wall behind the desk
with the force of a battering ram
thin plywood and tarpaper gave way
before his smashing impact he
plunged out into cool darkness rolled
over felt the lash of sand particles in
his face driven by a pistol slug that
missed him by inches

  then he was up running desperately
feeling the sting of fire in his shallow
wound behind him lansdon shouted
wildly directing the others to race out
and cut off the fugitives flight ahead
lay the road to the outer gate and free-
dom   

  temple ran a dozen steps down this
road then swerved back toward the
hangar it was a crazy suicidal move
but now that he knew so much of the
terrible truth his mind was fixed on
one grim desperate purpose near the
hangar door he froze into deep shad-
ows and watched pursuit stream out to

cut off his path to the outer fence

  his eyes grew colder as lee mason
raced out clutching the projector and
a flashlight like a grim ghost tem-
ple drifted through the shadows in pur-
suit as she marched down one of the
streets whipping the light from side to
side

  gradually as they drew near the edge
of the camp some of the tension went
out of his nerves apparently what-
ever word power had revealed his pres-
ence before was now inactive for she
gave no sign of sensing pursuit

  at the end of the street she stopped
and flashed the light out toward the
fence when she turned back at last
temple was waiting with arms out-
spread he pounced like grim light-
ning

  one hand muffled her cry of warning
while the other batted down the flash-
light and projector for a few mo-
ments she fought with the lithe
strength of a panther almost breaking
the clutch of his weakened left arm a
dozen times he knew that he was
doomed if she succeeded in raising one
shout of alarm there was only one
alternative

  temples right fist came up and ex-
ploded against the slender jaw she
gasped and went limp in his arms his
face cold and emotionless temple
scooped up the projector slung her
slender figure onto his shoulder and
looked around he was by no means
free as long as that circle of deadly
fence hemmed him in

  his eyes fell on the dark bulk of the
parked university trucks he ran to
the first one and saw that the key was
in the ignition lock a moment later

startling stories

he was in the truck with lees limp
form beside him rocketing toward the
gate

  the roar of the truck motor warned
the rest of his intention they must
have telephoned ahead for the gate-
man opened fire with a pistol when the
truck was still some distance away
lead spanged on the body and blasted
glittering diamonds from a corner of
the windshield whipping dangerously
close to lee masons silent form

  temple his eyes cold held the throt-
tle down and drew out the captured
projector he leaned out the open win-
dow and thumbed the knob blue light
beamed out shifted and engulfed the
guard he crumpled to the ground

  a moment later temple was out
throwing the master switch that opened
the big gate a touch told him the
gateman was only paralyzed then the
big truck was roaring out through the
gate into the night away from the yells
and the shots and the licking tongues
of blue flame that receeded in hopeless
pursuit

  at the edge of vingrove temple
stopped long enough to find strong cord
and tie lees ankles and wrists se-
curely then he swung away from the
town onto the highway that led north-
ward and pushed the throttle to the
floor

w etting the endless desert miles
slip past his mind probed at the
new problems arising from his desper-
ate gamble he had lee mason and
he knew vaguely what was responsible
for the change of personality but he
had no idea how to bring her back to
normal yet until he could accomplish
that restoration she would be his bitter
enemy

  worse he had no place to go in the
eyes of the law he was now a kidnapper
and a car thief and lee would be the
first to condemn him if he were cap-
tured if he tried to face the law with
the incredible truth as he now knew it
he would be rushed to the nearest in-
sane asylum

  beside him lee stirred and moaned
faintly temple instantly drew off the
highway cut the motor and bent over
her his fingers probing the soft cloud
of her hair experienced the faintest of

  tingling sensations and he knew then
that the thing he suspected was there

  presently her eyes opened dazedly
she tugged at her bonds then spat at
him with an animal snarl of rage

  take it easy temple advised
quietly i know what im up against
now and i tied those ropes to stay
theyll stay until ive learned exactly
what you are and how you can be de-
stroyed im not speaking to lee ma-
son now im talking to you-the
thing that has burrowed into her brain
and enslaved her body to use as its
active vehicle

  i know youre there i saw one of
you or a piece of you on lansdons
skull tonight through his sub-visible
detector i know the glowing thing i
saw changed him from a human being
to a flesh and blood robot and the same
happened to lee and the other scien-
tists

  youre insane lee hissed furi-
ously writhing and fighting the con-
fining ropes i dont know what youre
talking about in case youve forgot-
ten curtis temple the penalty for kid-
naping is the electric chair

  temples eyes were terrible in their
coldness

  in case youve forgotten he re-
torted through set teeth the penalty
is no worse for murder lee mason
means more than life to me and always
will but if i see that im going to be
captured and my purpose blocked-ill
destroy this lovely shell of her before
ill see it go on to a lifetime of horrible
slavery

  think that over before you try call-
ing for help when we pass through
some of these towns

       chapter xi
       science at war

at four oclock in the morning
temple parked on a dark residen-
tial street in phoenix opposite an im-
posing house he knew that house
well its owner was an old friend and
former classmate allen farge now
professor of physics at mountain tech

  temple hated to draw anyone else in
the gods hate kansas



on his problem but he had to have
refuge and a modem laboratory in
which to work out the solution

  he shut off the motor and turned to
lee mason

  im leaving you alone for ten min-
utes he said youre plotting ways
to defeat me of course and you may
succeed apparently youre possessed
of satans own science but remember
this before you try anything you tried
to get into my brain the night mullane
was kidnapped and you failed

 you cant control me you know
im a deadly menace to you but you
cant read my mind to tell what im
going to do or just how dangerous i
really am

 your only chance to smash me is
to stay close and try to catch me nap-
ping that means controlling someone
close to me and no one will ever be
closer than lee mason remember
that when you think of harming her
or moving your control to someone
else

  he swung out of the cab steeling his
heart against the thought of leaving
her there bound and uncomfortable
his only solace was the realization
that lee masons own life and happi-
ness hung in the balance

  farges house was dark and silent
but persistent ringing of the bell
brought a blaze of lights an orna-
mental lantern above temples head
flashed on and the square homely face
of allen farge squinted out through
the door pane in sleepy irritation

  the irritation vanished at sight of
temple and the door whipped open

  holy boiled mackerel curt what
are you doing out in this country  out
here for your health he squinted
and made a face you look like a first
class wreck going some place to hap-
pen what you need is-

  temple grinned wearily

  what i need al is a stiff drink
about so-o-o high and fix yourself
one too youll need it when you hear
my story fellow

  farge grabbed his arm and pushed

  straight ahead to the kitchen boy
the stuff is there and ill mix it in a
washtub if you say the word

  they compromised on tall glasses
bickering amiably on measurements

and proportions but when the drinks
were mixed farge seated himself
across the porcelain table and the
laughter died out of his eyes

  all right curt he said quietly
lets have it you didnt come here
on any social call and theres a
shadow of plain horror in your eyes
whats up

temple told him beginning with
the mystery of meteorites bom-
barding kansas and covering every-
thing that had followed the disappear-
ance of the culwain expedition at
the mention of the crimson plague
farges lips thinned

  i saw the plague he said harshly
you think those things caused that
too

  im sure of it-and just as sure bac-
teriologists cant find plague germs be-
cause there arent any germs he
rushed on ignoring farges startled
grunt

  look they offer to transport vic-
tims to the moon ostensibly for burial
how do we know thats their purpose
suppose this is all a hellish pattern a
scheme to get human bodies to the
moon for some ghastly use can you
imagine a better way to accomplish
it

  farge set down his empty glass with
a shaking hand

  go on he said hoarsely im
crazy enough to keep on listening as
long as you make two and two equal
four

  he remained silent until temple had
finished examining the black projector
case without comment then he took
a deep breath

  count me in curt he said quietly
ill do anything for a chance to take
this thing apart and see what makes it
tick

  youll get that chance is your
school out for the summer ive lost
track of time these past weeks

  closed last week-and twenty miles
out of town ive got the finest private
lab in the country with everything in
it but a rhumbatron curt its all
yours but what can you hope to ac-
complish

  weve got to duplicate lansdons
detector that makes the entities visible


startling stories

until we can see them were helpless
we cant fight them cant analyze
them cant even perfect a weapon until
we get that detector

  sweet job farge growled you
dont know how its made and by all
the laws of physics it cant exist any-
how you ought to have one of those
entities as you call them for a guinea
pg

  i have temple said quietly and
described his kidnapping of lee mason

  farge leaped to his feet his chair
crashing backward

  my lord that poor girl tied up
out there all this-

  easy al that poor girl would slit
your throat and mine the moment she
got loose that isnt lee mason out
there its a hellish inhuman thing
thats usurped her body god only
knows if her real personality still ex-
ists

  maybe without the entity shed die
or-or have no mind left ive tried
not to think of that because weve got
to go on got to smash the plot behind
all this- his voice dropped regard-
less of cost

farge gripped his shoulder a mo-
ment in silent sympathy

  well fight he said at last but
what about us curt whats to pre-
vent an entitys seizing either of us
in your case nothing theyve tried
to get into my brain and failed to-
night i figured out why and tomorrow
ill try to equip you with the same de-
fense meanwhile until ive got it
ready i dont dare tell you what it is

  the big risk is that the entity will
leave lee and run away before we can
accomplish anything destroying her as
a revenge blow against me ive tried
to block that though my efforts are
horribly feeble al

  the main thing is speed and more
speed can you get ready to go to your
lab right away ive seen those poor
dupes at camp rushing their jobs and
i know what were up against in trying
to beat them

  ready in ten minutes curt my
familys out of town so i havent a sin-
gle tie to hold me

  an hour later they stood in the fin-
est private laboratory temple had

ever seen a spare storeroom hastily
supplied with bed and dresser became
a comfortable but reasonably escape-
proof prison for lee mason only a
bank of steel shelves on one wall both-
ered farge

  she could rip those down and make
a club of that metal edging curt
he protested

  well risk it im gambling that as
long as the entity thinks it has a chance
to smash us it will stay quiet to watch
our next moves im deadly afraid of
having it leave her now maybe de-
stroy her body in retaliation and take
up some new angle of attack we cant
guard against

  he drove a clenched fist into his
palm

  darn it its all guesswork al and
it scares me how do i know im
right i thought i saw a ball of light
on a mans head on that thin base
ive built up a whole beautiful theory
-that might be utterly cockeyed

  what is an entity what are its
powers ive pieced odds and ends of
evidence into a composite picture of
them but how do i know it isnt a
picture they deliberately created to fool
me

  maybe that thing in there is com-
municating with its companions right
now planning some terrible attack i
dont think it is- but i dont know
its all blind shooting in the dark

  weve shot in the dark all our lives
curt we never saw an atom yet
weve built up a workable blueprint of
its structure by which we can build
them or tear them down its just an-
other job of that kind lets sleep a
couple of hours and get at it

  farge went to his room but temple
stayed behind intent on some mysteri-
ous and urgent task of his own in the
dining room of farges living quarters
he found a set of sterling silver din-
nerware

  this he melted down in the electric
furnace and moulded into a thin skull-
cap of pure silver he handed the
cap to farge when he came back to
the lab rubbing his eyes

  wear this every moment day or
night temple said unless my the-
ory is way off the entities cant get
hold of your brain through a silver
the gods hate kansas



screen ive got one holding the frac-
ture at the back of my skull and its
the only reason i can think of for my
immunity

  but why silver farge demanded
donning it gingerly

  i havent the slightest idea temple
admitted except that silver is opaque
to ultraviolet radiations beyond 
angstrom units maybe thats a clue
to their makeup

  its worth trying farge agreed
but how come if the entities are so
smart they dont know that

  i think they do they must but
the only chance they had to do any-
thing about it was the two days i was
a prisoner and during that time their
attention was pretty well taken up with
the return of the rocket and negotia-
tions for funeral flights besides theres
no surgeon in their group and only a
surgeon could remove my screen safe-
ly

  he handed over a rough sketch of
the entity detector as he remembered
it

  its a stereoscope he told farge
thats built to superimpose an invisible
image over the visible one to show
them both in correct physical relation-
ship im positive of that

  the clear glass lens on the visible
side wont give us any trouble the
black lens must have been of woods
nickel oxide glass thats a clue be-
cause we know woods glass will trans-
mit only ultraviolet light and filter out
the visible rays i have a feeling the
real problem lies in the violet film that
stood behind it

  farge pondered chewing his lip
well films of the alkali metals
transmit shortwave light below the vis-
ible spectrum but you say this film
had a violet hue which lets out lithium
sodium potassium and rubidium

  they block all visible light and are
therefore a dead black caesium the
heaviest of that group lets some visible
violet pass which gives it a violet color
but that sounds too easy curt

  its a starting point well try all
the alkali metals with every known
type of fluorescent screen al and see
where we get

  farge nodded eagerly

  if we can get something besides xs

to put in a formula ill solve it by
mathematics curt and while were
waiting for a woods lens and stock
of alkali films we can test for ultra-
violet radiation it may affect a pho-
tograph plate or emit measurable elec-
trons or react on fluorescent pigments
by direct bombardment

  they plunged enthusiastically into
the myriad tests farge was optimistic
but a worried frown creased temples
forehead

  have you noticed how quiet lee
has been he asked the second day-
after arrival at the laboratory shes
stopped snarling and fighting and just
sits there with a sort of sly smile on
her lips while we put her through those
tests its plain proof that were so
far from the right track that we arent
even worth worrying about

  ive noticed it farge growled
but one of these fine days well
change that smile

they plunged back into the end-
less quest temple said little but
always in the back of his mind was
the haunting fear that maybe the en-
tity had fled leaving only a graven
memory pattern on lees mind to di-
rect her actions or maybe it was in
touch with the camp directing a smash-
ing blow that might fall when they
least expected it

  the radio brought ominous reports
from the outside world apparently the
entities had met his challenge by re-
doubling their deadly activities

  the crimson plague struck out with
increased fury spreading in widening
circles to engulf major centers of popu-
lation with horrible results the toll
of victims skyrocketed

  the funerary moonflights became
daily affairs and work was rushed on
the second larger rocket new and
faster trucks ranged the devastated
areas loading victims like cordwood

  a vingrove woman was committed
to the state insane hospital for insist-
ing she had seen her husband one of
the earlier plague victims presumably
taken to the moon alive and working
at the camp

  farge and temple listened to the re-
ports without audible comment but the
lines deepened in their faces and some-


startling stories

how they managed to increase their
efforts another notch they cut sleep-
ing time to three hours out of the twen-
ty-four and ate only when weakness
reminded them of the need for fuel on
the fierce fire of their energy

  but at the end of the week they faced
the grim truth

  weve flopped farge said bitterly
a week of trying everything without
an inch of progress to show for it we
dont even know if the things still
there

  we cant see it cant get a flicker
of energy response on any indicator
were right back where we started
curt-nowhere

  temple reeling from weariness and
nerve strain stared at the floor in si-
lence abruptly he stiffened

  wait i described the entity in
terms of physical light and energy and
weve been sticking to that basis
what else could it be farge de-
manded dully

  mental energy biophysics has
proved that thoughts are electrical-
or at least produce measurable currents
the entity apparently merges itself
with brain activities so why couldnt it
be pure brain energy

  gracious farge looked startled
but biophysics has detected mental
and nervous currents we cant get a
response of any kind and mind energy
doesnt fall in the ultraviolet band any-
how it was a good theory though
a sound theory temple barked
electrified by his new line of thought
look a generator produces electricity
-but it isnt electrical itself maybe
the entity is the generator without it-
self being measurable radiation

  my theory would still hold then
and as to the ultraviolet range who
knows where mind energy does lie or
suppose thats part of a whole undis-
covered energy spectrum existing co-
incidentally with our familiar spectrum
and only touching in the ultraviolet
band thats fantastic of course but
im simply digging up theories that fit
what facts we do know-and that fits
but try and prove it-or use it-
with existing instruments or tools
temple was staring at the polished
base of a bench lamp he started ab-
ruptly

i just did prove it he barked
quick lock lee in her room and
get back here were on our way
farge trotted back a few moments
later his eyes shining with excitement

  you hit something curt what was
it

  the answer temple exulted i
was watching the reflection of lees
face when i suggested mental energy
and an undiscovered spectrum she
nearly screamed her expression
proves were on the right track at last
but thats an unknown science
curt we dont know its fundamentals
we havent any instruments-

  then well invent instruments
temple roared you didnt find any-
thing inside that projector except a
gold grid in a sliding frame and a slab
of some strange crystal-no batteries
or generators of any kind

  nevertheless the answers there i
dont think that machine generates en-
ergy at all i think its a sort of burn-
ing glass proposition that concentrates
natural energy from the atmosphere
into a beam well try doping it out
on that basis

  and theres one screen weve never
tried element eighty-seven-molda-
vium its one of the alkali metals but
its properties arent known because its
never been isolated maybe the en-
tities isolated it and if they have we
can order a stock right away in the
purest available form

  it was the following afternoon that
temple got his idea

  cosmic rays he suddenly roared
at farge in the midst of an experiment
what a dunce ive been thats the
radiation that kills the entities im
positive of it

  but i dont see    farge gaped
at him

  look stones have been falling on
kansas for centuries havent they with
a concentration too great to be acciden-
tal that implies intelligent bombard-
ment aimed there for a purpose the
obvious answer is-the entities but
no entities ever appeared before
why

  you mean farge exclaimed that
all the previous meteorites started out
with loads of entities too then
why-



startling stories

  because the entities couldnt sur-
vive the trip through space something
destroyed them-and the logical an-
swer is the direct unshielded impact
of cosmic rays

  this last swarm of stones were dif-
ferent from any that ever landed be-
fore they were coated with a strange
heavy radioactive coating suppose
that was some newly discovered shield
against cosmic rays that fits my the-
ory and accounts for the entities sur-
viving

  but curt what can we do with it
we cant generate artificial cosmic
rays their voltage is way too high
and we cant concentrate them except
with a couple of hundred tons of mag-
nets how can-

  that projector temple barked
if it can tap one range of free energy
maybe it can tap more youve got a
wilson cloud chamber with a geiger-
muller counter on it start shooting
blasts of the projector into it and pho-
tographing for explosion trails change
the setting of that sliding grid each
time and see if you get a measurable
response at any point

  as though temples ideas had sup-
plied a key the door suddenly swung
open for them

  two days later on a film of semi-
refined moldavium they saw a dull
violet glow that moved when lee ma-
son moved her head

  the entity

  the image was crude and it lacked
the stereoscopic effect but it gave them
all they asked for now they could
apply themselves to the discovery of a
weapon

  too tired to celebrate their first vic-
tory temple and farge hung the pho-
tographic negatives of their latest
cloud chamber shots up to dry and
tumbled into bed without undressing

  and that night the entity struck back

chapter xii
disaster

temple awoke some time during
the night bathed in cold perspira-
tion his lungs hammering for air and

his nostrils aflame with stinging tor-
ment he lay for a moment gasping
and blinking watching what looked
like an inexplicable parade of gray
ghosts across the faint light of the
window

  then his brain suddenly threw off
the dregs of sleep and filled with the
horror of what he saw he sprang out
of bed snatched open the hall door and
staggered back from a solid wall of
gray smoke that filled the corridor

  fire the place was on fire there
was not a sound to indicate whether or
not farge or lee were alive or con-
scious

  with cold terror plucking at his
nerves temple crooked his arm over
nose and mouth for partial protection
and fumbled his way down the hall to
farges bedroom a close-fitting door
had kept the smoke out of that room
and a gentle snore from the long cyl-
inder of covers on the bed brought
temple a surge of relief he sprang
across and clutched farges shoulder

  curt is that you farge sat up
blinking and coughing whats
hap-

  fire i dont know where it started
or how far its gotten im going to
get lee out you try to save the instru-
ments and negatives hurry

  wait farge stumbled to the bath-
room and came back with two dripping
towels thisll keep some of the
smoke out of your lungs come on

  with the wet towels plastered over
their faces they stumbled downstairs
through a solid tunnel of smoke there
were no sounds of fire no ominous
glow of flames

  with cold terror in his heart temple
stumbled to the storeroom door and
fumbled for the knob it turned under
his touch and slid away under his
touch the jamb felt jagged and rough
a grim suspicion flamed in his mind
then

  light filtered through the pall of
smoke as farge found the switch work-
ing by the glow temple saw the
prison was empty the door a wreck
where sharp pieces of the smashed steel
shelving had been used to gouge away
the lock lee had done this his mind
pounded dully she had smashed her
way out started the fire and fled
the gods hate kansas



  farge came stumbling through the
smoke a tangle of wreckage clutched
in his arms he was almost sobbing

  curt the detector and projector-
smashed into a million bits some-
body- he broke off staring at the
empty room

  come on temple plunged into the
smoke snatched a fire extinguisher and
raced for the basement stairs phone
the fire department maybe we can
hold it until-

  cant farge panted in his wake
she ripped out the telephone and
smashed it too were cut off

  they found the fire smouldering in
a pile of broken boxes heaped high
against the wood steps of the base-
ment twisted papers and shavings
had laid the foundation for an inferno
that would have been beyond control
in another twenty minutes

  temple took in the situation at a
glance and thrust the extinguisher into
farges arms

  take over this was started so re-
cently i may be able to catch her ive
got to-

  they both heard it then-the wail
of a car starter that broke abruptly into
the explosive bark of firing cylinders
it came from just outside the house

 the truck temple shouting
plunging up the stairs shes getting
away in the culwain truck i brought
from camp

he burst out into the graying dawn
to see lee mason in the trucks
cab racing the motor while she used
both hands to mesh the cold-stiffened
gears the lever ground into place
when he was still a hundred feet away
the truck lurched ahead

 temple redoubled his speed he
made a desperate flying leap and his
fingers caught at the edge of the win-
dow frame for a moment he clung
kicking for a foothold on the running
board buffeted by the jouncing of the
accelerating truck

  suddenly lee mason leaned out the
open window she was driving with
one hand and her other clutched a spark
plug wrench the wrench was small
and light but driven by desperation
its impact against his jaw was stun-
ning

  he reeled back felt his slender grip
tom loose then he fell to the ground
with breath-taking force dimly he
heard the roar of the speeding track
fade away into the distance and tried
to stumble to his rubbery legs to fol-
low

  farge racing out from the house
held him back

  easy curt he soothed you cant
catch her on foot and there isnt an-
other car within miles why didnt i
drive my car out instead of riding here
on the truck with you 

  he led temple into the laboratory
and went around opening windows to
clear the smoke then he vanished into
the dark room

  outside a bird burst into sudden
frantic song it shocked temple to
realize for the first time in weeks that
outside his tight little sphere of heart-
ache and struggle there was still a
world where birds could sing in the
dawn he dropped hia face into his
hands

  farge coming back put a hand to
his shoulder

  its losing lee that hurts temples
voice came muffled through his hands
losing my chance to save her now
when we were on the verge of success
now shes not only beyond reach but
she knows everything weve done and
planned so she can beat us with one
smashing blow

  i hate to tell you this now farge
said tightly but i just looked at the
last negatives and while i havent had
the time for johnson asymetry meas-
urements id say we had something
with an energy value well over five
billion volts that could only be cos-
mic rays curt we-we had it-and
now weve lost it forever there isnt
enough of that projector left  

  what temples head jerked up
and his red-veined eyes were aflame
allen ive got another projector one
i snatched that same night at camp
ive kept it hidden so the entity could
never learn i had it through reading
your mind quick find out what set-
ting you used and well start over
again

  whoopee farge yelled in a burst
of relief and curt i stuck a scrap of
surplus moldavium away in the safe


startling stories

last night its big enough for a very
small detector

  fine fix one i can wear on my
forehead like a visor so i can see
through it by simply tilting my head
that will leave my hands free to handle
the projector

  curt farges face was sober you
cant buck that crowd alone even with
the projector theyve got guns paral-
ysis beams and an absolute indiffer-
ence to human life you couldnt hope
to face them all

  ive got to temple said grimly
our last chance of getting any outside
help or confidence is gone you heard
the radio last night three outstanding
scientists publicly questioned the mo-
tives of the group in arizona

  and in each case the scientist is-
sued a retraction and apology within
twenty-four hours you know what
that means an entity seized each
man from now on that will happen
to anyone who stands in their way

  it would take us weeks to persuade
public figures to wear silver skull caps
and long before we succeeded the en-
tites would have struck a counter-blow

  no allen its on our shoulders com-
pletely whatever is behind this hor-
rible enfiltration of alien beings will
only be stopped if we stop it

  theyve got the public behind them
now by stopping the crimson plague
wherever their trucks pick up the
bodies the whole nation is convinced
that its future depends on the group at
camp weve got to strike first and jus-
tify ourselves afterward

they worked for a time in silence
from the radio came frequent an-
nouncements most of them dealing
with either the crimson plague or the
science group no other news seemed
of importance for where the group
trucks collected the bodies of victims
the plague died out beyond the
widening circle of their efforts how-
ever it raged unchecked

  whats behind it farge groaned
you think the entities cause the
plague-but how what do they want
with bodies

  im positive now that they cause
it temple answered grimly prob-
ably by some control of the victims

involuntary nervous system that in-
duces hyper blood pressure and cata-
lepsy

  at the start remember they seized
those farmers the solles and their hired
man to use as chauffeurs and kidnap-
pers when they were through with
their dupes they simply wiped out dan-
gerous memories and discarded them

  i think the crimson plague is a sim-
ilar and more hideous type of recruiting
which theyve developed in order to
supply themselves ordinary rough la-
bor i think its only on scientists
whose brains they need that they
bother with the type of mind-seizure
weve met on lee and the rest

  catalepsy farge gasped you
mean-

  i mean i dont believe crimson
plague victims are really dead i be-
lieve an entity swoops down on a
crowd selects its victims and leaves
them helpless to be hauled away as
slaves to more entities thats the only
way the pattern fits

  but curt all those poor devils who
were buried cremated autopsied
they were-

  murdered temple snarled mur-
dered while an entity hovered close
waiting to strike again to convince a
panic-stricken people that only trans-
portation to the moon could check the
plague

  and their fiendish plan has worked
like a dream the group has the public
so sold on them as public saviors now
that wed be thrown in an insane asy-
lum for suggesting the truth our only
hope now is to smash the entities get
lee and those others free of the con-
trol and then destroy the source of
them on the moon

  half an hour later as temple was
fitting the completed detector over his
head farge threw down his screw-
driver and drew a deep breath

  there it is curt identically the
same adjustment of grid and crystal as
i had in that other detector when i got
the cosmic ray path in the cloud cham-
ber it wont take long to verify the
physical accuracy his face clouded

  but curt have you thought of this
even if we get what looks on our plates
like cosmic rays how can we be sure
weve already uncovered new energy
the gods hate kansas



fields that we never knew existed

  how can we know this isnt some-
thing utterly different-something that
would instantly kill anyone it touched 
you wont dare use the projector on
lee or those others without some kind
of guinea pig test

  therell be a test temple said
tightly its my idea my theory from
the beginning ill be the guinea pig
if anything goes wrong youll have to
carry on alone thats all

  but curt you cant risk that an
energy bombardment of five to ten bil-
lion volts might smash the brain cells
kill you instantly or even destroy your
mind i wont let you risk that boy
well get some lab animals first
and-

  there isnt time temple inter-
rupted harshly tomorrow night their
big rocket starts hauling bodies at
any moment the entities may strike
back at us we cant waste days mak-
ing lab tests now

  the minute these plates are devel-
oped i make the test on myself and
thats final one life more or less
doesnt count for much now consid-
ering whats in the balance if it works
on me im leaving at once

 from behind them a quiet voice
said

 i wouldnt be in too much of a
hurry to leave if i were you

  temple and farge whirled simulta-
neously and gasped

just inside the laboratory door
stood two young men with grim
faces and sharp watchful eyes one of
them cradled the ominous bulk of a
submachine gun suggestively in his
arms the other held only a sheaf of
folded papers

  beside them stood lee mason an ex-
pression of grim triumph on her face
what-who- farge gasped
tillotson and rowe the man with
the papers introduced them of the
federal bureau of investigation we
have warrants here for your arrest on
charges of kidnapping and unlawful de-
tention of the person of one lee mason
who has sworn out warrants now being
served will you come along quietly
temple stood frozen feeling the
blood drain from his face lee had

done this-not lee but the entity who
controlled her she had rushed to town
after setting the fire and had organized
this crushing blow

  beside him farge suddenly straight-
ened and threw back his head his
eyes were cold

  this is either the beginning or the
end he said distinctly and theres
only one way to find out if this works
curt youll know how to carry on so
long

  before anyone could move to stop
him he lifted the untested projector
and snapped it full in his own face

  allen temple cried for gods
sake dont

  his voice broke as farge swayed and
crumpled to the floor the black case
tumbling from his limp hands ignor-
ing the menacing lift of the submachine
gun temple dropped to his knees and
lifted farges head he saw the blank
relaxed features through a mist of pain
and there was a dull roaring in his ears

  tilly he did the dutch right in front
of us cried rowe but for cripes
sake what with

       chapter xiii
       prisoners in space

lee mason broke the shocked
tension she screamed shrilly and
pointed a shaking hand

  get that thing grab it quickly
its a horrible deadly weapon theyve
been working on a death ray it can
kill

  the fbi men were dazed and uncer-
tain at the swift turn of events but lee
mason was the complainant who had
sought their aid at her frantic cry
they both surged forward intent on
grabbing the mysterious case at tem-
ples side

  at that instant farge stirred his
eyes opened and his lips twisted into
a smile

  success he murmured softly

  the one word drove a blaze of new
strength into temples numbed mus-
cles farge was alive the mysterious
emanation of the projector whether
cosmic ray or not whether destructive


startling stories

to the entities or not was at least not
fatal

  still on his knees temple whirled
and snatched the projector from the
clutching fingers of the two fbi men
his swift movement caught them flat-
footed with tillotson still empty-
handed and the submachine gun point-
ing at the floor before they could rec-
tify the error temple tilted up the case
and pressed the button

  there was no visible beam no sound
of unleashed power but the two leap-
ing figures stopped as though halted by
a stone wall and tumbled into limp
heaps lee mason screamed in sudden
terror and whirled toward the door

  cold-eyed and tight-lipped temple
levelled the projector again and
snapped the catch she fell in the door-
way crumpling without a sound

  and in the violet screen of the detec-
tor still dangling over temples eyes
a glowing ball of violet light suddenly
flared up and vanished in a single burst
of intolerable radiance

  curt farge bawled scrambling to
his feet you killed it you destroyed
it i saw it for an instant with my
naked eye-like a little cloud of glow-
ing mist that whipped away curt it
works weve won

  weve lost temple barked if we
dont get out of here before these fed-
eral men wake up theyd haul us in
and keep us all locked up for weeks try-
ing to get this thing straightened out
come on they must have a car

  he stooped threw lee masons limp
figure over his shoulder and raced out
with farge at his heels outside a
powerful sedan stood in the driveway
with motor purring softly

  temple dropped lee to the front seat
cushions beside farge and climbed un-
der the wheel an instant later the big
car was roaring away from the labora-
tory at reckless speed

  where can you go farge panted
twisting around to stare out the back
window theyll be up and organizing
a state-wide hunt within a matter of
minutes theyll block every highway

    

  theres only one place to go tem-
ple said through set teeth straight to
camp weve got the detector and the
weapon and temporary freedom

  it will take these two at least half
an hour to reach a telephone that works
by that time we can be past phoenix
and well on the way south toward vin-
grove theres no time to waste now

between them lee mason
stirred and her eyes opened-eyes
that were clear and bright and alive
with the vivid spark of her personality

  curt she clutched at his arm with
a little cry of happiness curt you
freed me from that horrible slavery oh
curt you dont know how i watched
you fight and prayed that youd win
even though i couldnt do a thing to
help you but the ghastly things it
made me do to you while i was help-
less

  she broke off with a sob at the an-
guished memories temple grinned
happily patting her hand he had been
horribly afraid of this moment of
awakening afraid that the entity would
take a last revenge by wiping out lees
mind or memory

  but apparently destruction had come
so swiftly and unexpectedly that the
entity had had no time for venegance
her mind seemed completely free and
clear

  forget it all honey forget the
whole thing its over now and before
morning well have the others free as
well wear this cap every moment day
and night and they can never seize your
mind again he handed over a dupli-
cate of the silver cap he had made for
farge ive carried this a long time
waiting for a chance to use it now
meet the bravest and swellest friend
who was ever put on this earth

  lee turned and laid a hand over far-
ges

  i know she said softly i watched
you too what you did back there risk-
ing your life or more to try that un-
tested projector

  farge reddened uncomfortably and
interrupted the praise with a sudden fit
of coughing temple grinned and re-
scued him

  lee tell me about the entities-
everything you can that will help us de-
feat them where did they come from
what are-

  but curt i cant thats the hor-
rible part of it i never did know what
the gods hate kansas



was really happening that night at
camp i felt something icey digging into
my brain then everything went black
and when i awoke i felt normal again
except that i couldnt command my
own body any more

  i could think something i wanted to
say but i couldnt say it i could plan
places to go and things to do but i
couldnt do anything nor could i stop
myself from doing the things i did do
then you couldnt feel the entity as
-as a personality temple demanded
his eyes showing his disappointment
you had no sudden rush of additional
knowledge or

  not a thing curt i made one of
those projectors-as we all did-but my
brain simply couldnt figure out what
my own hands were fashioning nor
why the only time i really felt the
things presence was a time or two
when problems had to be worked out
mentally

  then i started thinking about the
problem in response to some command
i couldnt analyze or resist and sudden-
ly a whole flood of energy would pour
into my brain my thought-processes
would speed up until i actually couldnt
keep up with them-and then suddenly
out of the spinning jumble would come
the answer

 i thought so temple muttered
pure mental energy allen as we fig-
ured but lee when you talk to one
another about the affairs of the entities
is your conversation simply-
exactly the same she interrupted
words flash into my mind and i speak
them without knowing why or often
what they mean but i think the enti-
ties also converse with one another by
some psychic means too

  often a group of us would stand to-
gether for hours without moving or
speaking a word but id get a feeling
of thoughts fairly flying through the air
around us and suddenly everyone
would rush off on some new project
then farge demanded you
havent any idea what their purpose is
you dont know why they invaded the
earth

  i havent any idea but she shiv-
ered uncontrollably i have a feeling
its horrible ghastly

  it was not until late afternoon that

they ran into the grim manhunt or-
ganized by the fbi a few miles
north of vingrove they raced over a
hill and faced a trap a state police
coupe was parked on the pavement nar-
rowing it to one lane and two uni-
formed patrolmen flanked a huge port-
able stop sign that blocked the rest of
the highway

  duck low was all temple said
we cant be stopped now

  he slowed deceptively then jammed
the throttle to the floor the heavy
sedan leaped ahead like a living thing
in a roaring surge of unleashed power
there were startled yells a splintering
crash the grinding impact of steel on
steel

then they went through racing
down the highway with one fender
flapping and the speedometer needle
near the hundred mark as lead thudded
futilely into the back of the sedan be-
hind them a wrecked barricade an
overturned police coupe and two khaki-
uniformed wild men vanished into dis-
tance

  they wheeled into the road to camp
shortly after dusk and joined a proces-
sion of vehicles of all kinds jamming
the trail temple pulled up beside a
man changing a tire and leaned out

 wheres everybody going he
asked

  gonna watch the new rocket take
off at nine oclock his informant
grunted they set the first trip ahead
a day and everybodys out to see it from
the hills

  come on temple sent the sedan
leaping ahead bouncing over the hard-
packed sand to avoid the traffic on the
trail there isnt a moment to lose if
we want to save some two hundred
poor plague victims from slavery

  a short distance from the gate he
stopped the car and he and farge
climbed into the back crouching on the
floor while lee slid under the wheel
temple held the projector ready

  its up to you he whispered grim-
ly try to make the gateman shut off
the current and open the gate for you
if we can get in without raising an
alarm our chances of success are in-
finitely better than if we have to crash
the gate and face a pitched battle


startling stories

  he adjusted the angle of the detector
on his forehead and patted the flat case
of the projector

  if an entity comes to investigate ill
handle it

  i should be able to put it over lee
said tightly lord knows ive had
enough practise

  she stopped the sedan close to the
gate and leaned out as a surly beetle-
browed guard appeared

  jonas she snapped coldly imperi-
ous the gate at once i have just es-
caped my captors and have important
news

  in the rear temple and farge held
their breaths as only silence answered

  curt lee whispered suddenly her
voice ragged whats wrong all he
does is stand and stare without moving
did-

  temple raised up for a quick glance
and his breath caught

 easy sweet there are two free
entities floating this way to investigate
his own is still in his brain waiting for
their report ill have to shoot

  he lifted the projector and they all
saw the twin wraiths of glowing mist
that suddenly appeared and then
whipped away as the terrible bombard-
ment destroyed their alien atoms

  simultaneously the gateman yelled
and whirled toward the camp phone in-
side the guard booth he had almost
reached his goal when a blast from the
projector destroyed the guiding entity
and sent him sprawling

 that means open war temple
snapped everybody out

  as they leaped from the car he slid
under the wheel and sent the heavy
sedan lurching back when he judged
he had sufficient run he slammed it for-
ward and jerked the dash throttle wide
open the big limousine thundered
across the sand bearing down irresist-
ably on the steel mesh gate

  twenty feet from the gate temple
jumped he struck the sand and rolled
over and over arms shielding his face
an instant later the sedan smashed
headlong into the barrier

  there was a blaze of searing roar-
ing high tension flame that momenta-
rily engulfed the car then the flame
died the gate went down with a crash
and alarm bells burst out from the heart

of camp temple sprang to his feet as
lee and fargo raced up

  stay here you two he snapped
you wouldnt stand a chance in there
without a weapon ill handle things
nuts to you lee panted cheer-
fully allen has his tools and he says
he can convert any paralysis gun into
an entity-destroyer now in five min-
utes get going its almost eight-
thirty right now

there was no time to argue tem-
ple fought down the quick stab of
fear for her safety and hurdled the
wrecked gate behind him farge
snatched a paralysis projector from the
sprawled gateman and dug at it with
eager fingers as he ran

  ahead a knot of men burst from the
camp and raced toward them down the
road a gun slammed and lead whis-
tled over their heads temple tried a
blast of the projector but the distance
was still too great more shot came
uncomfortably close

  stay here he pleaded between
panting breaths they havent any
compunction about shooting to kill
their answer was an added burst of
speed that carried them dodging and
twisting straight into the hail of lead
from the advancing guards temple
groaned and tried the projector again
without any great hope the range was
still extreme

  but miraculously this time there
were bursts of violet and the figures
pitched to the sand and lay sprawled
and still it was grotesque a slaughter
without bloodshed a mock carnage
temple hurdled the still forms with lee
at his heels farge stopped for a quick
search of the bodies then caught up
with them panting

  no paralysis projectors he gasped
seems odd

  i know why lee panted the infor-
mation they only had-five crystals
curt-stole two projectors-that night
only three-left

  temples eyes were on the looming
bulk of the new rocket hangar dwarfing
the old structure poking the silvery
snout of its monstrous burden toward
the waiting sky to him it was a sym-
bol-the symbol of countless thousands
of plague victims living dead who

 scimitar of the flames up into the stars
 then it was gone and the three of them
 stod gasping stunned

   after a moment they broke the spell
 and raced on they burst into the main
 camp street and a blue beam licked at
 them from the shadows temple fired
 a burst from the projector and an en-
 tity flamed to death in the darkness
 farge snatched another paralysis pro-
 jector from the sprawled figure as they
 ran past

  suddenly dr eno rocossen burst
from a shack ahead of them and ran
madly toward the smaller rocket han-
gar he carried a projector but made
no effort to use it all his energies con-
centrated on flight

  stop him temple roared if he
gets the small rocket away were licked
they can stay on the moon beyond our

they raced across the crater floor using light
lunar gravitation to increase their speed chap-

would be doomed to lifetimes of slavery
if he failed he must not fail

  suddenly his eyes widened and his
steps faltered the silvery nose of the
projecting rocket was reddening glow-
ing with reflected flames and the still
night air was carrying a faint mutter of
distant thunder to his ears he choked

  the rocket he groaned its tak-
ing off

  his words were drowned in the ti-
tantic thunder his eyes dazzeld by the
incredible brilliance of the great ships
take-off he saw it riding the curving


startling stories

reach and whip those hundreds of
plague victims into an army for some
new invasion

  staggering gasping every breath a
flaming agony they pounded doggedly
on cutting down the distance temple
lifted his projector and then let it fall
he couldnt risk blasting rocossens en-
tity destroying the knowledge of how
to operate and guide the rocket

suddenly their way was blocked
by a knot of figures plunging into
the street ahead of them cuting them
off from their quarry there was ja-
cobs pistol in hand mullane davoe
meeker lansdon raising a paralysis
projector

 temple rayed down lansdon and
jacobs in two bursts then the others
were on them swinging clubs and fists
in wild fury

  theyre trying to cut us off farge
howled slugging toe to toe with meek-
er well hold them curt get
through and stop rocossen

  temple drilled in sent davoe reeling
and flashed down the stret rocossen
was just vanishing into the smaller
hangar

  desperately temple increased his
speed it was obvious the rest had
fled to the moon on the big rocket

  if rocossen got away all hope of con-
tact would be cut off human brains
could never hope to duplicate the moon
fights in time to smash another inva-
sion attempt

  temple burst into the hangar and
saw rocossen darting up the gangplank
toward the open port of the waiting
craft he roared a command to halt
rocossen faltered at the sound and swi-
velled a contorted face to glare at his
pursuer the paralysis gun leaped up
and flamed

  temple tried to dodge slipped and
felt the beams searing touch against his
left arm and side he stumbled
plunged forward onto the foot of the
gangplank and heard his projector clat-
ter from numbed fingers into the depths
of the rocket pit

  weaponless his left side numb and
useless temple sprawled precariously
on the narrow gangplank as rocossen
vanished into the ship a moment later
hydraulic pistons gurgled to the rising

whine of machinery from somewhere
inside

  under temple the gangplank shifted
and swayed pistons were inexorably
drawing the great port lock into its
seat dislodging the gangplank in a
moment plank and its living burden
would slip free to plunge to the pit be-
low-into a hell of seething flames
when the take-off rockets blasted

  with sweat pouring down his face
temple clawed his right hand into the
iron gangplank and inched himself
ahead toward the narrowing port he
had to get inside had to stop rocossen
before the rockets fired the closing
port was still six feet away

  a scant inch still held the gangplank
in place

  behind him farge and lee burst into
the hangar with the three scientists
fighting and clawing to hold them back
they took in the situation at a glance
farge swung around blocking the
doorway battling desperately to hold
his ground as lee broke free and raced
toward the rocket

  on the gangplank temple saw the
last half-inch of overlap between gang-
plank and rising lock narrow inexor-
ably he clenched his teeth dragging
his helpless body another six inches
behind him someone flashed up the
teetering plank caught at his shoulders
and literally hurled him across the re-
maining gap and through the closing
port to the rockets floor he saw lee
mason panting grining at him through
bruised lips as she rested on hands and
knees from her last desperate dash

  then the gangplank crashed away
outside the pistons wheezed sharply
and the great lock chugged into its seat
simultaneously deafening thunder
burst around them and the floor be-
neath them quivered in a burst of
frantic horror temple struggled to his
knees he had to get forward stop that
take-off

  the rockets roar deepened under
him the floor leaped violently and some
titanic irresistable force plucked them
up and hurled them back along a shad-
owy coridor temple knew one instant
of blinding agony then a terrific impact
smashed the breath from his lungs and
the consciousness of failure from his
brain

      chapter xiv
      master of the moon

temple awoke sharply with the
salt taste of blod in his throat a
numbing agony through his bruised
body and a cold terror in his heart lee
-lee mason she had rushed in to
help him the terrible acceleration of
the take-off had hurled them toward the
rockets tail with unbearable force
enough force ot smash a human body
to pulp

  his eyes opened dully widened in-
credulously at what they saw the en-
tire rear bulkhead of the rocket was
covered by a great thick mat of some
resilient material bolstered by heavy
coil springs and it was against this
life-saving cushion that they had been
driven

  he saw lees slender figure beside
him still pressed tight against the pad-
ding her lashes fluttering against
waxen cheeks as consciousness re-
turned

  with a prayer of thankfulness tem-
ple pushed himself erect to reach her
side the slight effort he exerted shot
him up like a jack-in-the-box and left
his bruised body floating gently in mid-
air temples breath caught

 they were already beyond earths
gravity field blasting through outer
space behind and around him the
steady thunder of the rockets was driv-
ing them further and further from
earth-further from hope

  curt it was lee her eyes wide and
startled what-how-oh were out-
side gravity she pushed herself out
into the air beside him laughing shak-
ily

  what a funny feeling not to weigh
anything

  temple caught her hand with a groan
of anguish

 lee lee why did you jump in-
side you should have pushed me in
and run back there was time-

  huh she snorted crinkling her
nose in a grin and lose you just
when i got you back dont be silly
besides how do i know but what some
moon hussy might not vamp you

  it was a full moon i remember that
got you to propose to me that night
her face sobered but it was a dirty
trick to leave allen to fight those three
alone

  dont worry about him temple
said grimly he was amateur boxing
champ at college for two years be-
sides he had his projector almost set
for cosmic ray emission if you-
he broke off as the thunder of rockets
suddenly died away from the stem
then a shudder rippled through the
craft as new explosions blasted more
faintly from the bow

  lee clutched at his arm she was
frightened

  curt whats happening

  were getting close to the moon
he answered soberly it sounds as if
were turning a somersault in space
the rocket is built to land stern-first
so it has to be turned around for the
blasts to work as brakes i think those
are steering jets we hear now-which
means in a few minutes well be half-
crushed by deceleration

  but what can we do

  not much he said you stay
here tight against the cushion im
going forward and see whats what

  as he spoke the thunder of rockets
burst from the stem again and invisible
force drove them back against the big
pad smaller shocks from the sides in-
dicated that the dropping craft was be-
ing jocked toward landing position a
sense of awe filled temple at the in-
credible ingenuity that had created this
controllable monster in so short a space
of time

  fighting the drag of deceleration
feeling the first faint pull of lunar grav-
ity temple fought his way along the
dimly lighted corridor toward the bow
he could tell now that the rocket was
dropping stem first at an acute angle
eventually the ship would swing to full
vertical for the final drop and the check-
blasts would in those final minutes be
as terrible as the take-off unless he
were braced and cushioned he would be
smashed to pulp against the metal bulk-
heads

  the corridor was narrow and low
lined with countless small sliding doors
and roofed with an odd tarry substance
that glowed with faint radioactivity in


startling stories

the dim light this was probably the
same material that had coated the me-
teorites a shield against cosmic rays

  dragging himself forward by the
hand-rail temple reached an open door
at the corridors end and peered into the
small control room his eyes widened
in amazement

rocossen was strapped in a
great webbed seat thickly pad-
ded and suspended from heavy coil
springs in front of the control panel
his slender hands rested on a small
bank of levers like the throtles on an
air transport with which he was deli-
cately directing the steering and brak-
ing blasts temple watched tensely
noting which levers were moved and
listening to the location and intensity
of the resulting blasts gradually the
picture of the rockets control was form-
ing in his mind

  in front of the astrogator a large
television screen flashed a swelling
image of the pitted moon while a
smaller screen beside it showed the red-
haloed globe of the dwindling earth
a lump rose into temples throat at
the bight

  rocossen jockeyed the steering blasts
until the massive crater of plato lay
squarely under cross-hairs on the
screen temple stared at the airless
alien world seeing the nearby pits of
eudoxis and cassini the mighty cau-
casus carpathian and teneriffe ranges
jutting like monstrous teeth around
mare imbrium

  southward the peaks of the dorfel
and leibnitz mountains broke the hori-
zon how often he had studied the
dead panorama through the telescope
but this was different there were the
weird colors in platos depths colors
that had mystified astronomers for
years and a queer diffusion of the sharp
sunlight as though air were present

  suddenly the thunder of stem tubes
and the terrible force deceleration
awoke temple to his own danger he
glanced around and saw the rear wall
of the control room padded and cush-
ioned as the stern had been appar-
ently this was extra safeguard in case
of emergency temple slid to the cush-
ion and clung there

  the stem tubes were firing steadily

now and the deceleration hammered
his body against the bulkhead with
crushing fupr blood misted his vision
hammered in his ears and rose saltily
in his throat lifting his diaphragm
for each gasping breath was a titanc
effort only constant frantic swallow-
ing kept his eardrums intact against the
crushing pressure

  on the vision screen the crater
swelled to fill the plate and a black dot
in its center became a squat domed han-
gar with gaping roof waiting to receive
them

  then miraculously the slowing fall
was easing the pressure and temple
could see and breathe again the maw
of the hangar filled the screen and in-
side it a tangle of framework showed
faintly the framework leaped upward
and became a funneling arrangement of
beams that guided the projectile to its
cradle

  metal grated suddenly against the
hull the rockets spurted and die giv-
ing way to the sobbing wheeze of hy-
draulic cushions easing the great shell
into its pit

  in the thundering silence that fol-
lowed dr eno rocossen snapped the
last switch and leaned back his fin-
gers opened the catches of the great
webbed safety belt that held him in the
navigators seat

  they had landed on the moon

wrrith that knowledge flaming in
w w his brain temple staggered
erect reeling dizzily his body throb-
bing with dull pain he wanted noth-
ing so much as to lie down on the metal
floor and close his eyes but a numb des-
peration kept him erect

  rocossen clambering to the floor
saw him then and his expression
whipped from incredulity to blazing tri-
umph he snatched at a paralysis pro-
jector sheathed beside the seat

  i thought you were finished he
snarled but this is better now monj
himself can enjoy your conversion to
our project march back to the port
temple

  he centered the projector menac-
ingly with one hand while the other
reached toward the plunger that oper-
ated the lock pistons his lips curled
in a mocking smile
the gods hate kansas



  temple hesitated swaying there
was an elusive thought scurrying
through his numbed mind something
he ought to remember-something that
might mean his salvation and lees
he groped for it desperately as rocos-
sens thumb tightened on the paralysis
trigger

 suddenly the elusive memory
smashed into his brain with an impact
that drove away the numbing clouds
he straightened smiled grimly-and
walked toward rocossen

  go ahead and blast me rocky he
invited tightly but where will your
little plaything get its power not
from the free energy radiations outside
because your ship is insulated against
those rays-

  with a snarl of baffled fury rocossen
hurled the useless projector at tem-
ples head and whirled to tug at the lock
control dodging the missile temple
lunged forward dragging rocossens
hands from the lever they went down
squirming and fighting

  hold him curt lee darted in
waving a silver liquor flask that was
battered almost beyond recognition
one good sock with this should take
the fight out of him she grinned at
temples surprise

  i peeked in one of those doors and
there was a plague victim strapped in
a padded hammock and this smashed
against the wall it was all i could find
for a club so i grabbed it

 wait temple pinned rocossen
with his knees and stretched a hand
is there anything in it

  sure lee sniffed the cap whis-
key but this is no time-

  give temples eyes blazed al-
cohol affects the brain and it might
make the job of controlling tough for
an entity as i remember it rockeys
system never could stand much liquor
he forced gulps of the amber liquid
between rocossens set teeth and forced
him to swallow by pinching his nose
the astronomer strangled shrieked and
suddenly went limp

temple jerked down the battered
remnants of the detector still
straped to his forehead in the bent
screen he saw the entity jerk free and
dart erratically away down the corridor

rocossen suddenly groaned and tried
to sit up

  curtis miss mason youve freed
me at last from that terrible power oh
to think that i a doctor of philosophy
and fellow of the-

  forget it temple soothed helping
the shaken astronomer to his feet you
had illustrious company in your shame
but right now weve got bigger wor-
ries youve made this trip often can
you remember what well be facing out-
side when that port is opened

 rocossen groaned and his face
blanched

  slaves-hundreds of poor helpless
devils like myself huge glowing cav-
erns horrible monsters from another
world and the feeling of thousands of
malignant beings filling the air intelli-
gent yet invisible

  nice picture of our future temple
grimaced he squared his shoulders
well-

  curtis rocossen clutched his arm
youre not going out there-not plan-
ning to face them-

  temples face was cold

  well have to face them sooner or
later-here or after they seize the
earth we cant run away now be-
fore we could get back home persuade
people we werent crazy and organize
an attack they could overwhelm the
country with the big rocket

  they might shoot thousands of en-
tity-laden rocks at kansas send hun-
dreds of human slaves in the other ship
destroy this base so we couldnt ever
land on the moon again to fight them
i see rocossen stiffened grimly
we shall do what we can as long as
we can lead on professor temple
bravo temple handed the nearly
empty flask to lee pour it down
sweet-every last drop

 me she gaped at him why
should i

  because he expalined patiently
the first thing theyd do would be to
yank off your silver cap and seize your
brain again im banking that as long
as alcohol fumes are rising youll both
be given a wide berth by the entities
as she coughed down the fiery liquor
temple jerked the wood railing from
the wall and broke off three sturdy
clubs then he pulled the piston con-


startling stories

trol lever to its farthest limit

  the pistons gurgled softly and fell
into a steady rhythmic chugging the
great round lock crept out of its seal
to reveal a short section of tunnel lead-
ing off to a lighted area

  then as the gap widened he saw
that the tunnel was actually a telescop-
ing metal tube that met the rocket hull
in an air-tight seal forming a passage
through the roofless airless hangar to
the main depot it was he realized
an ingenious device for eliminating in-
tricate airlocks or space suits

  temple peered down the passage-
way he could see no living beings
at the far end but the screen of his de-
tector was afire with the glow of count-
less drifting entities hovering wait-
ing his nerves felt cold

  rocossen suddenly slapped him on
the back

  that whiskey was excellent stock
curt old boy i feel exhilarated-defi-
nitely exhilarated ha

  lee mason giggled and a burst of
crazy laughter welled up in temples
throat rocossen was getting more
than protection from his enforced
drinks fortunately there had not been
enough left to effect lees cortex

  bring on your ol enities rocossen
hiccuped shaking his club les go
se ol monj himself ol boy ol boy

  monj temple gaped at him
who is monj

  rocossen leered owlishly

monj hesh the big cheese mashter
of the moon but i cn lick him
cmon

  before either temple or lee could
stop him he bounded into the tunnel
and swaggered toward the distant light

chapter xv
the doom of perfection

temple groaned and leaped in
pursuit with lee at his heels
ahead rocossen reeled out of the tube
into the brighter light and stopped
short the club dropping from his hands
temple and lee burst out beside him
a moment later and skidded to a startled
halt gasping stunned

  they were inside a low sprawling
dome lined with the same obsidian-
black radioactive substance that had
coated the meteorites and shielded the
rockets interior to their right pur-
ring machinery bulked huge behind
metal screens to their left a huge
archway revealed a cyclopean glow-
ing passage that slanted down out of
sight into the very bowels of the moon

  overhead glowing rods like fluo-
rescent light tubes supplemented the
greenish radiance of the shimmering
walls far to the side temple saw
the outline of a heavy door with the
bulbous shapes of six metallic space
suits suspended from the curving wall
beside it

  all this background temple saw in
a single sweeping glance before his
stricken gaze riveted on the weird
actors who occupied this nightmare
stage ranged around half the wall
before them stood row on row of human
beings incredibly stiff and motionless
staring at them with dead blank eyes

  before this army of the living dead
stood three men the center one a tall
gaunt man whose brain bore the most
gigantic entity temples detector had
ever revealed he did not need rocos-
sens awed whisper to know that he
was face to face with the leader of the
entities - monj the master of the
moon

  but what brought the startled breath
to temples lips was the circle of mon-
strous shapes that came slithering out
of the shadows from both sides to sur-
round them for a moment he was too
stunned to breathe lee masons fin-
gers tensed biting into the corded
muscles of his arm

  the vards rocossen murmured
shrinking back the vards

  there were seven of the creatures
like seven grotesque sea monsters out
of their native element leathery bul-
bous bodies that were both head and
trunk sprouted ten sinuous writhing
tentacles four of the tentacles thicker
than the rest terminated in round
sucker-discs that gripped the floor as
legs the remaining six tentacles were
spaced around the body as arms

  with an eerie gliding shuffle the
seven creatures drew together sur-
rounding the three humans in a wide
the gods hate kansas



circle arm tentacles writhed out and
gripped one another forming a network
of interlocking living bars around them

  temple gasped aloud not at the
weird creatures or their action but at
the definite impression of intelligence
that lurked in their huge saucer eyes
alien the creatures might be in form
but there was thinking reasoning in-
telligence in their luminous eyes

  his guess was confirmed by the pres-
ence of a glowing entity on the back of
each bulbous head-body he felt cer-
tain the entities could not utilize hosts
without intelligence since their power
seemed to lie in intensifying knowledge
already present in a controlled brain
rather than by implanting new knowl-
edge

  the fact that the entities sought out
trained scientific minds on earth indi-
cated their need for at least a founda-
tion of established thought patterns
he thought it probable that the entities
by supplying the brain with a limitless
flow of pure mind energy could stimu-
late its activity to supernormal heights
along already established channels

the presence of the weird creatures
cleared up another question in
temples mind it explained how
vaporous beings lacking physical
bodies could have constructed the
crude stone space ships and hurled
them at the earth

  lee pressed close to him shuddering

  curt what are they do you sup-
pose theyre the native inhabitants of
the moon enslaved by the entities

  i doubt it these vards as rocos-
sen called them dont appear to be
physically adapted to lunar extremes of
heat and cold and theyre obviously
oxygen-breathers but well probably
find that and a lot of other unpleasant
things out soon enough stick close
to me every moment

  his detector screen showed the vast
dome of the building packed with
countless multitudes of the entities
hovering watchfully others were
ranged along the wall while still others
poured into the tube behind them ob-
viously to revive the new victims
brought by the small rocket

  temple groaned aloud how could
they ever hope to smash a menace

whose vast forces were invisible omni-
potent and well-nigh unconquerable

  as if in response to a silent com-
mand the circle of vards suddenly
moved ahead forcing their encircled
captives closer to the figure of monj
and his companions rocossen shud-
dured and swung a white strained face
toward lee and temple

  oh lord he whispered tightly
to think i trafficked with these mon-
strosities only a short time ago i re-
membered all this vaguely but they
look hideously different now that im
back in my right mind

  the figure of monj stirred

  silence it thundered slaves do
not whisper in the presence of the mas-
ter

  anger blazed in temples eyes he
took a quick step forward gripping his
makeshift club

  just a minute he snarled we
arent your slaves and we dont intend
to be you made a pretty good start
toward invading and ruling the world
but right now mister youre facing
three people you cant invade and rule

  monj stiffened and the vards shifted
warily staring for an instant temple
sensed a network of flying thoughts
weaving in the air about him then
monj spoke his voice puzzled

  invade and rule your world why
should we try to do that we dont
want your poor sterile globe with its
alien life-forms what glory could
we find in ruling races who beside our
science are little more than savages

  it was temples turn to stare open-
mouthed

  i dont believe you he snapped
then you certainly went through all
the motions of invasion and our poor
savage races seem to have done fairly
well in supplying you with brain-power

  personally i think youre some
feeble outcasts from some other world
who hope to run a bluff and get your-
selves set in a new easy life where you
can stead true ability and claim it for
your own

he deliberately loaded his voice
with sarcasm the figure of monj
was already trembling with raging fury
and temple was cooly fanning that
rage if he could goad monj into blow-
startling stories

ing up completely the entity might un-
intentionally reveal a clue to the
mystery fantastic as it seemed
temple actually believed that invasion
and conquest was not the true purpose
of the entities

  there was another crackling silence
then the anger went out of monjs
face replaced by calm deliberation
after a moment he nodded

  very well you shall know the
truth perhaps the reactions of your
race to our problem may yield us an un-
pected clue

  relax and let your mind receive
thought-pictures of the story that will
be projected by our greater energy onto
the curtains of your minds do not be
afraid you are quite safe from seizure
until the story is told

  then he began to speak softly and
vibrantly while temples stunned mind
carried him up among distant stars and
showed him weird incredible scenes
with a vividness that touched every
emotional chord in his being he saw
by the expressions on the faces of lee
and rocossen that they too were shar-
ing his visions

  our home lies eons away in space on
xacrn ninth planet in the solar system
of the faint star you call seventeen
leporis monj began and temples
mind flamed through the awful vast-
nesses of space to an alien incredible
world of indescribable life-forms and
unnameable colors

  we are xacrns the ultimate evolu-
tionary form of the highest life order
in the cosmos once millions of gen-
erations ago we possessed physical
body-forms infinitely more useful and
adaptable than yours  

temple gasped as his thought-
visions brought him pictures of
monstrous vards tilling alien soils fa-
bricating strange instruments and tools
with their marvelously prehensile ten-
tacle-tips building and dwelling to-
gether in vast cities were the entities
and the vards divergent offspring of a
common root

  inevitably there were some of us
more interested in the development of
the mind than of the body more hungry
for knowledge than for material pos-
sessions it is always thus with every

race on every world even on your
earth in your own country you see
each passing year widening the gap
between the farmer and the pure
scholar

    with us as the ages passed our
separate interests gradually evolved
two separate races the vards re-
mained essentially in their original
form content to blend craftsmanship
and labor with thought

  we who neglected our bodies to
build our minds found those unused
body-forms wasting away being dis-
carded by the forward surge of inex-
orable evolution until at last we
reached a stage where our minds ex-
isted without any physical body what-
ever

  awed temple watched the mighty
pageant of evolution unfold on his
mind-screen he saw certain of the
vards withdraw to barren cells to con-
centrate on thought while their unused
tentacles and finally their bulging
bodies withered and died

  take heed earth people monj
thundered a million years hence
your evolution will have swept you on
to the same ultimate state-and to the
same inescapable doom you know i
am right

  already in the past hundred years
that are no more than a second in eter-
nal time you have seen your human
bodies grow frailer while your minds
sharpened and gained new strength
it will go on until you are like us

 the visions became nightmares
showing temple the final dissolution of
the vard bodies the growing hordes of
bodiless dissociated entities that re-
placed them and always the scenes
flashed back to those other vards who
toiled on without the all-consuming
ambition who prospered and were
happy content to let mind and body
develop together

  with growing horror temple saw
the logic of monjs prophecy was this
to be the future of the human race to
become darting clouds of pure energy
doomed to an intangible eternity

  but we were proud of our accom-
plishment monj continued we
drove on and on until we could find no
more problems to be solved no more
secrets to unlock in all the cosmos
the gods hate kansas

t

  it became convenient for us to em-
ploy physical bodies to perform the
tasks our super-minds conceived we
made the common vards our vehicles
thus we had all the advantages of cor-
porel bodies with none of the discom-
forts or obligations it was a most
happy combination

  ill bet the vards were overjoyed
temple growled

 they were favored monj said
stiffly they gained all our vast
knowledge without sacrificing their
own bodies

fection we had overlooked one thing
evolution may be slowed or speeded
or diverted into strange bypaths as
your earth scientists have done with
radiation bombardments to the genera-
tions of drosophila-but it cannot be
halted evolution must go inexorably
on

  we have evolved into an ultimate
energy form-only to discover that it
was not the ultimate after all ahead
lay another step-the mergence of our
separate energies into the one great all-
pervading universal energy

a gripping book-length
novel of the future

   by mnillv ixjrde uellmril

             its a real baffler

                  coming next issue

  temples lips thinned as he saw a
vision of the humble vards torn from
home and homely occupations to toil
in shops and laboratories each driven
to do his task by the glowing entity
on its brain

  he saw them building space ships of
fantastic form that flashed among the
stars and planets until in all the galaxy
there were no riddles left unsolved
the immensity of their accomplish-
ments left him weak breathless and
trembling

  too late we learned of our doom
monjs voice sank the doom of per-

  to us that meant oblivion the de-
struction of all our separate personali-
ties and what lay beyond that we
could not even guess we only knew
that in a few hundred generations our
race would cease to exist

  the visions changed filling temple
with a great sadness and a great pity
he saw rocossens lips droop saw tears
well in lees eyes as they shared the
despair of a dying race

  we saw our doom but we refused
to accept it somewhere in the uni-
verse there must be salvation for our
race we felt sure i was commissioned


startling stories

to find that unknown factor

  on the screen of his mind temple
saw the great space ship driven
by entity-controlled vards flash out
through the universe from planet to
planet it went searching ever search-
ing reaching familiar systems flashing
past the sun to curve toward earth he
felt the terrible impact of the wander-
ing meteor that smashed the controls
sent it crashing instead on the dead
moon in the heart of plato crater

  for centuries we lived in the ruined
ship monj went on while the vards
who survived the crash worked desper-
ately to affect our rescue ships were
constructed of the crude natural min-
erals of your moon and hurled toward
earth bearing xacrns in search of aid
but the centuries passed and no aid
came

  finally we concluded that some in-
imical radiation outside must be de-
stroying them and proved its presence
until then we shielded by the natural
material of our own ship were unaware
of its existence

  meanwhile a new distaster faced
us our vards being mortal were
growing old dying with none to take
their places we faced the eventuality
of being stranded helpless

  with their last strength the surviv-
ing vards built eleven ships insulated
them with shells of our native metal
and sent them out this time the ex-
pedition reached its goal constructed
the crude repulsion ships and estab-
lished contact the rest you know

the visions suddenly vanished
from temples mind leaving him
awed gasping

 but what are you seeking he
cried what discovery can save your
dying race why aim all your stones
at kansas

  you have seen enough monj said
coldly the rest will be answered
when you have joined our project

  were not joining temple roared
snapped back to reality by the words
were not substituting for your
vards

  monjs face darkened he gestured
coldly and the living barrier of vards
broke before temple could move
coils of rubbery tentacles whipped

around him pinioning his arms he
saw that lee and rocossen were sim-
ilarly held

  take those two into the depths
monj indicated lee and the astronomer
remove the silver caps and wait until
the vapors have evaporated from their
brains then seize them

  he turned toward temple and his
eyes narrowed

  this one is to be prepared at once
for the operation

  operation a cold chill touched
temples nerves

  the figure that was monj spread slen-
der hands

  this body and brain was the prop-
erty of a skilled surgeon that skill
will serve us well in a few moments
when a simple operation removes that
silver plate from your head so that i
myself may enter and take full posses-
sion of your splendid brain take them
away

chapter xvi

desolate sanctuary

temple was stunned frozen at the
thought of losing the silver screen
that had been his defense it would be
so simple to remove and once it was
gone his brain would be com-
pletely unguarded the thought of
becoming a slave to the entities of tak-
ing part in their still mysterious proj-
ect against the human race filled him
with agony the thought of lee and
rocossen returned to that slavery was
a knife-thrust in his heart

  summon me when temple is ready
for the operation monj instructed the
vards

  the largest of the grotesque vards
bobbed its hulking body in an obei-
sance a triangular mouth opened be-
low the saucer eyes and unbelievable
impossible sounds came forth

  it shall be done the vard said in
perfect english

  temple gaped in stunned amazement
he saw lee blink dazedly the idea
of human speech issuing from those
alien mouths was indescribably shock-
ing
the gods hate kansas	

  the pressure of the clutching tenta-
cles moving them irresistably toward
the mouth of the sloping passageway
broke the paralysis that clutched tem-
ples mind desperation spurred him
whipping his mind to furious activity
his eyes fell on the outline of the dis-
tant closed door with the space suits
hanging beside it

  some instinctive blaze of revolt made
him brace his feet against the forward
pressure and fight to break the clutch-
ing grip of the tentacles his muscles
swelled corded and perspiration
streamed down his face it was blind
hopeless resistance yet-

  abruptly a gripping tentacle slipped
under the bulging pressure and a
sucker disc broke loose with a sharp
pop it was mad impossible but he
was matching his strength against that
of the great decapods-and winning

  fight he panted at lee and rocos-
sen monj told us the vards were old
almost too far gone to finish the last
space ships fight them break their
holds

  he pressed out against their clutches
until his eyes misted and blood roared
in his ears dimly he knew that some-
where near the voice of monj was roar-
ing insanely and that the massed fig-
ures of human slaves were rushing to
aid the vards with superhuman des-
perate strength he tore away the last
clinging coil and sent the aged crea-
tures reeling back

  rocossen and lee following his ex-
ample were fighting desperately
against their own captors temple
rushed in clawing and tearing at the
encircling arms suddenly they were
free facing the massed fury of the on-
rushing human slaves

  over here temple bellowed and
raced for the door dragging lee and
rocossen with him our only hope
is to get outside where they cant fol-
low us ill fight back the mob while
you two get into suits then you hold
them while i dress   

  no rocossen panted grab suits
-and run-out theres some thin air
outside-not too cold

hope blazed in temples heart he
knew that pickering and many
other astronomers believed there was

still some atmosphere on the moon
pools of it trapped in the depths of
giant craters like plato

  if there was enough to temper the in-
tense cold they could get beyond reach
of the entities and pause long enough
to don space suits without shielded
armor the entities would instantly per-
ish under the direct cosmic radia-
tions   

  an idea flamed in temples brain
in mid-stride he swerved and caught
the limp tentacles of the vard leader
who had slumped to the floor ex-
hausted without pausing he raced on
dragging the helpless creature after
him inches beyond the clutching hands
of their pursuers

  ahead rocossen was tearing at the
door catch as lee jerked down the
bulky suits still dragging his feebly-
resisting captive temple snatched a
suit with one hand and pounded
through after them into a narrow air-
lock

  rocossen slammed the inner door in
the face of their pursuers holding it
against their weight while lee tugged
open the outer lock a blast of intense
cold struck them like a tangible wall
driving knives of agony through their
chests

  not daring to speak holding their
breaths against the rarified air they
raced across brittle lava to a jumbled
heap of gray rock high overhead sun-
light threw a knife-edged lance of un-
bearable illumination against the crater
wall but down here in the shadows it
was almost totally dark only the ten-
uous wisps of dying atmosphere held a
faint gray radiance that made the dark-
ness a lighter dusk

  still holding their breaths they clam-
bered into the bulky unfamiliar suits
clamping bulbous helmets into place
opening valves that flooded the suits
with invigorating air at their feet the
captive vard stirred feebly

  lee pressed her helmet against tem-
ples

  curt that poor creature will die
without protection thats cruel-

  i dont think so temple answered
as rocossen bent forward to share the
conversation there werent any suits
for them yet they must have worked
outside a great deal


startling stories

  i wanted to get him out here where
the radiations would destroy his entity
if he suffers of course well send him
back

  the vard rose shakily and laid a ten-
tacle tip against temples helmet

  thank you for my freedom it said
it is the first i have ever experienced
it is a strange lonely feeling-but i
like it do not worry about me

  my immense lungs find plenty of
oxygen in this thin air and i do not
even feel what you call cold it is only
outside the depths of this crater where
there is no air at all that i would per-
ish

  a gusty sigh drifted faintly to tem-
ples ears from the direction of rocos-
sens helmet

  amazing temple incredible i
commend you on your ingenuity you
have rescued us from the enemy and
we are safe

  safe temple said grimly except
for the minor matter of food and water
and oxygen renewal that will probably
become a little bit annoying in time

  what do we do now curt lee
asked

  to be absolutely truthful darned if
i know the idea of losing my screen
and seeing us all made into entity
slaves just didnt appeal so i organized
a revolt beyond that i havent had
time to think

  but wed better be good and quick
these suits dont seem any too well in-
sulated and i cant find any trace of a
heating unit that cold is penetrating

  y-yyour t-telling m-me lee inter-
rupted my t-teeth are ch-chattering
already

  in spite of the air rocossen re-
marked it must be well over a hun-
dred degrees below zero down here
we shall freeze

  cheer up temple grinned wryly
pointing upward that sunline is
practically racing down the crater wall
toward us when it reaches here the
temperature will go up to better than
two hundred above if there was only
some way- he whirled toward the
vard

  you whatever your name is do
you know of any way we might stay
alive out here

  my name is decex vard the crea-

ture answered solemnly which means
i am the member of the vard race
whose identification number is ten
thousand we are all designated by
number

  i know of no haven for you unless
we might find a cave whose rocks both
store and keep out the coming heat
there are a few such in the crater wall
i shall seek one

he shuffled off probing the eerie
writhing tentacles into masses of
debris temple was staring around
him fascinated and awed by the weird
nightmare landscape of the great crater
when lees helmet clicked against his

  whatever we do wed better do fast
curt about a dozen men in space suits
just came tumbling out of the lock
theyre carrying funny-looking guns
and i think in about a minute well be
able to keep warm just by running
temple whirled and groaned faint
light from the open port gleamed on sil-
very space suits massed in front of the
dome they must be special suits in-
sulated against cosmic rays to protect
the entities from destruction ordi-
narily he guessed they did not go out
but merely implanted lasting thought
patterns on the minds of those slaves
who were sent beyond the lock

  decex vard came lumbering back
frantically waving a tangle of arms to-
ward the dome

  they come he shrilled slaves
of your race guided by the strongest
mind-forces and armed with the terrible
weapon of atomic blast you must flee
there is no deep cave near

  where can we go rocossen cried
in a few minutes this whole crater will
be in direct sunlight theres enough
air down here to diffuse the light too
so the shadows of rocks wont be deep
enough to hide us completely

  up the crater wall is our only
chance temple barked we can keep
hidden as long as we stay beyond the
line of sunilght come on

  they raced across the crater floor in
grotesque leaps utilizing the lighter
lunar gravitation to increase the speed
of their flight the weaker muscles of
the aged vard proved unequal to their
terrestrial strength and they slowed
somewhat to drag him between them
the gods hate kansas



  i dont see any pursuit yet temple
panted finally so they evidently didnt
see us lets dig into that mountain of
broken rock over there against the
crater wall and rest a bit

  they flung themselves down in the
blackness panting and trembling from
exertion temples eyes were sultry

  we shouldnt get out of breath so
fast he gasped im afraid this means
our oxygen supply is low those tanks
seemed terribly small

  decex vard waved his tentacles
around them for contact

  the suits are equipped for only an
hour at lowest metabolism he stated
that is so there could be no danger of
a slave breaking the mind-shackles and
attempting flight

  what temple gasped can such
a thing happen do any of them ever
throw off the entitys control

  occasionally only humans do it
and apparently only those who saw and
fought against seizure if the entity
catches a mind completely unawares
and unsuspecting its domination is
complete

  whew lee whistled will i ever
give them a battle next time

  decex vard temple asked what
are the entities looking for why are
they so anxious to seize control of
earth i dont see how conquering the
human race will save them from ulti-
mate evolution that they fear so great-
ly

  oh but my masters are not trying
to conquer earth the vard answered
quickly except for the failure of our
poor bodies they would never have
touched earth at all

  but in order to return to xacrn it
was necessary to secure metals and
other vital products not found on the
moon as well as skilled hands to fabri-
cate those products into the necessary
vessel to do all that swiftly and accu-
rately required the work of hundreds

  so those xacrns who set out for
earth were instructed to concentrate on
opening regular communication be-
tween earth and moon with that
done and all xacrns equipped with
skilled bodies they could move earth
build the great ship and go home
you mean lee gasped that all
this-this reign of terror was for no

other purpose than to give you man-
power and metal so you could go
home

  of course while my masters had
not solved the secret of perpetuation of
the race time was growing short and
they desired to end their days on their
native planet

for petes sake temple barked
the dopes why didnt they come
down and ask for what they wanted
the great saucer eyes stared blank-

jy-

  you mean-you mean that in your
civilization individuals ask for what
they desire instead of merely taking
it his tentacles waved dazedly
truly your race is a strange one

urtis rocossen gasped can
you imagine that but it
stands to reason that a race concen-
trating on super-evolution would un-
derstand no law but the evolutionary
code of might-survival of the fittest
and destruction to the weak

  temple was shaking his head in
dazed incredulity

  what a colossal misunderstanding
he whispered a mighty cosmic joke
on everybody if wed known that
maybe we could have reached an un-
derstanding instead of fighting

  maybe we can still bring our alien
ideas into harmony i feel sorry for
the poor fools now that i know their
history and aims and bad as theyve
acted do you realize that they them-
selves havent taken a single human
life that we know of

  i was under the impression ro-
cossen said drily that they tried hard
enough in our case i dislike giving
them all the credit for our prowess
but by their standards temple
insisted frowning any resistance to
us was in the nature of self defense
no rocky ive quit hating the entities
suddenly and started wishing i could
help them i believe all this can be
mediated

  lee came tumbling down from a
quick peep over the parapet of rock that
hid them behind the faceplate of the
helmet her hair was a golden cloud
over her eyes

  you can start mediating anytime
curt she panted six of those pa-


startling stories

thetic creatures are headed this way
following our tracks in the lava dust
and from the way theyre holding their
guns they mean business

  temple sprang up his face paling
start climbing higher he barked
we have the advantage of rocks that
wont show tracks from here up come
on decax well haul you up as high
as your lungs can stand the rarity and
dont worry we wont let you be
taken back to slavery as long as one of
us is left to fight

  decex vards tentacles quivered fran-
tically whipped out and drew the hel-
mets against his leathery bulk

  but i want to go back he pro-
tested already i feel lost without the
great vrif who has been a part of my
life for these many centuries

  i only wanted to see what freedom
was like as a brief adventure you are
kind-but none of us want to lose our
masters we suffer and tire but we
would not change

  lee mason collapsed on a rock gasp-
ing

  well ill-be-darned she whis-
pered in most unlady-like amazement

       chapter xvii
       flight and capture

temples jaw dropped and his
eyes bulged what he roared
at the quivering vard we risk our
idiotic necks to rescue you and you
dont want to be rescued

  he got a swift impression that if the
writhing creature had possessed a head
it would now be hanging that head in
embarrassment somehow deprived of
its entity-master the vard was singu-
larly childish for all its amazing knowl-
edge and abilities

  forgive me most kind of friends
our worlds are so far apart that even
our affections are alien but what i
said is true those others are our peo-
ple our guides and leaders and we
would be savages without them

  they make us work until we fall
from exhaustion and they drive us into
pain and suffering not because they
hate us but because their energy-minds

feel no such thing as emotion love
hate fear pain-the entities as you call
them recognize those states only as
words

  we understand that and are not re-
sentful we do our best accept the

  before they could move he was up
loping down the slope like a great
many-legged dog to face the oncom-
ing men

  poor simple-minded dupe lee
whispered he would actually be lone-
some without pain and oppression
and-

  that poor simple-minded dupe
temple interrupted harshly has just
showed those hunters down there
exactly where were hiding by barging
out that way get down theyre rais-
ing those odd guns to their shoulders

  an instant later there was a blinding
soundless flash above their heads and a
huge pinnacle of rock burst into drift-
ing dust another eery burst of light
shattered a boulder to their right and
fragments rattled sharply against their
suits

 whew what energy temple
gasped weve got to get out of here
in a hurry before those blasts eat away
every rock in this heap-and us with
them

  they scrambled back an instant be-
fore the very rock on which they had
been standing was shatteredby the
weird soundless flash of energy

  we dont dare try to climb tem-
pel said as they fled from the bombard-
ment theyre near enough now to
see us against the cliff as our suits re-
flect star-shine stick behind these
boulders and maybe we can break back
into the plain far enough away to get
clear

  they raced over scattered debris
from the towering wall overhead pain-
fully conscious of the dwindilng oxygen
supply that would soon make all their
efforts futile rocossen staggered close
to touch temples helmet as they ran

  what-did you-say he gasped
about - sparing - human lives - in
their-activities 
the gods hate kansas



  temple swore at him and pounded
on head down flaming agony biting
into his lungs with every breath

  they reached the end of their rocky
screen and halted

 which way now curt we cant
last much longer-and there comes the
sunlight line to burn us up in another
five or ten minutes

 to the dome our only hope is
the rocket hangar behind there may
be a store of oxygen there or some way
of getting into one of the rockets

 they bounded out onto the inky
floor of the crater and plowed to a halt
ahead something was moving through
the darkness an occasional faint glint
of reflected starlight revealing its pres-
ence

  one of the hunters temple whis-
pered squinting but i can only see
one person and he seems to have his
back to us come on lets slip closer
and try to get that gun away and pin
him down he may be carrying extra
oxygen tanks

they stole forward scarcely
breathing and neared the dim
figure

  it was one man carrying one of
the rifles that fired the devastating
atomic blasts and he was studying
the plains for signs of his quarry

  the three pounced together metal
clanged against metal and the enemy
was down writhing helplessly inside
his clumsy armor temple hurled the
atomic rifle out of sight among the
overhanging rocks

  he could never use a deadly weapon
as long as he knew that his adversaries
were helpless entity-driven dupes who
might yet be restored to normal

  there were two spare oxygen tanks
strapped to his belt

  you and rocky take these temple
ordered brusquely ill combine the
oxygen thats left in your two tanks
and have nearly as much we may be
able to grab another hunter soon

  despite their protestations he ex-
changed the fresh oxygen tanks for the
depleted ones which he slung on his
own belt and motioned them on they
left the entity slave struggling to his
feet

 he cant do much without a

weapon temple told the others and
the chances are hell head back for more
oxygen his first tank must be low
too now were good for another hour
and a lot can happen in an hour we
might even figure out a way to save
the xacm race and exchange that
knowledge for our freedom

  you cant stop evolution rocossen
shouted

  im not too sure temple denied
shaking his head besides its the
only possible way i can see to stop all
the horrors like the crimson plague
that will go on as long as the entities
need bodies

  he plodded on absorbed in thought

  without any warning the lava dust
in front of his feet exploded in a burst
of livid flame and a mighty invisible
force hurled him off his feet he
landed on his back bruised and breath-
less from contact with the hard shell
of the suit and saw rocossen and lee
stumbling toward him with other
bursts of atomic fury pursuing them

  temple got to his feet groggily and
lurched into a run waving them to fol-
low an erratic course that would make
aiming difficult the gunner was hid-
den somewhere in the darkness and
with no tell-tale muzzle flash to betray
his presence there was no way of know-
ing for sure which way led to safety

  the three raced on weaving and
dodging and for a moment there were
no more explosions temple began to
breathe again as the menace seemed to
have passed

  then abruptly a new burst came al-
most underfoot and another in midair
between their tumbling bodies temple
realized then that they must have
been running straight at the unseen
marksman

  scrambling up they pounded away
to the side changed directions and
hammered on while the deadly bursts
fell away behind them and finally quit
completely they slowed to a stagger-
ing walk and drew together

  that was close lee gasped

  too close rocossen agreed al-
together-too-close

  his bulky figure suddenly reeled and
went down heavily to lie motionless
in the lava dust with a pang in his
heart temple dropped down beside the

astronomer and saw the slender lips
moving behind the faceplate he
touched his helmet to the others

  carry on you two rocossen whis-
pered coughing dont fuss over me
until you get caught

rocky what is it temple bent
closer and saw the long ragged gash
through the metal breast plate of
rocossens suit are you badly hurt
not hurt-at all rocossen grinned
just-out of breath i cut off-my
oxygen you take it theres no-way
to patch-a suit out here good luck
lee temple whirled toward her
get going head back for the crater
wall stay out of the sunlight when it
gets there and watch for help dont
try to get into the hangar now
curt what do you mean what
are you-

  im taking rocky in to the dome
temple snapped he cant lie there
and strangle and theres no way to
patch the suit with his oxygen turned
on full he can get enough to breathe
until we make the dome its the only
way im still safe from seizure by the
entities so theres a fighting chance
hurry

ithout another word he gath-
ered the protesting figure in his
arms and lurched to his feet

 go back to that rock heap where
they nearly caught us before and stay
close its the safest spot now that
theyve driven us away from it once
stay there and dont move except to
avoid being seen or caught by patrol-
ing hunters

  but curt what can i-

  ill show the entities that we arent
antagonistic to their purpose and be
back as fast as i can with a rescue
party my silver screen will keep
me free and safe until ive explained
ways in which we can help them and
after that everything will be all right

  just wait for me youve got oxy-
gen enough now for an hour to an hour
and a half and the cold cant get you
as long as you move around good
luck darling

  he touched her helmet briefly with
his own smiled into her anxious eyes
and was gone staggering off into the
darkness with his burden

  despite the fact that lunar gravita-
tion gave his burden a total weight of
less than fifty pounds temples arms
soon ached torturously still he
pounded on lungs straining for every
gulp of air sweat pouring down his
face legs pistoning numbly on by the
sheer driving effort of desperation

  he had to get rocossen into the
dome before the last trickle of com-
pressed oxygen had fled through that
gaping rent in his suit temple could
feel the hiss of escaping air against the
chest wall of his own suit and the
dwindling sound of it filled him with
despair

  he plodded doggedly on losing all
sense of space and time guided by the
stark blaze of advancing sunlight along
the crater wall to his right in his arms
the slender figure of rocossen had
given up its futile feeble efforts to pro-
tect and lay quietly conserving air

  where a few short minutes before it
had seemed that everywhere they
turned they ran into searching entity
slaves intent on their capture temple
now began to feel that he had plodded
on for hours in an absolutely unin-
habited land he would have welcomed
capture to be relieved of his burden to
see stronger hands bear rocossen to
safety he trudged on

  his reeling brain turned inevitably
to the entities and their fantastic doom
a race of super-intelligences hurtling
inexorably along the path of evolution
to oblivion a civilization wiped out
not by its shortcomings and evils but by
its very perfection

  why did his mind persist in gnawing
at their problem how could he hope
to find a key to their salvation where
their super-minds had sought it for cen-
turies without success compared to
their knowledge and their science the
greatest accomplishments of earth were
no more than the cloudy myths of a
savage tribe

tiemple tried to dismiss the
thoughts but they beat back into
his mind with relentless purpose
think temple study the problem
from new angles there is a salvation
for the xacms and the key to it lie
within your grasp you had the answer
in your hands once within the past hour
the gods hate kansas



and let it slip away unrecognized bring
it back think man think

  temple groaned aloud if he could
show the entities how to save them-
selves from extinction how to return to
xacrn with immortality for their race
his own personal problems and those of
earth would be automatically solved

  how long would it take the entities
to build their escape ship and leave
earth forever a month a year

  this would be no blast-driven rocket
capable of lumbering the few scant
miles from earth to moon and back
but some new marvel beyond human
comprehensible it would be an impos-
sible unthinkable mechanism capable
of flashing across inter-galactic space
where the very milestones were hun-
dreds thousands millions of light-
years apart

  such a craft might take years to
build ample time for resentful humans
and arrogant entities to lock in horrible
and profitless warfare temple shud-
dered at the vision such an even-
tuality could only be halted if he found
the elusive answer that hammered at
his brain

  without any warning at all temple
found himself plodding automatically
into the midst of space-suited figures
who closed in covering him and his
burden with the deadly atomic rifles
he stared at them dully for a moment
and then realization of what those fig-
ures meant brought a gasp of thankful-
ness to his lips

  dropping to his knees temple ges-
tured frantically at the gaping rent in
rocossens suit and ahead toward the
still-invisible dome where the life-giv-
ing air waited his urgent message

got across to them two figures bent
down staring then seized rocossens
figure between them and raced off into
the darkness

  the rest closed in prodded temple
to his reeling rubbery legs and drove
him ahead he went willingly his
mind absorbed in his coming meeting
with monj

  this time things would be different
when the entities saw that there was
hope of realizing their impossible goal
there would be cooperation and united
effort for all their alien form they
were thinking reasoning beings fight-
ing only for the perpetuation of their
race

  success was very near temple had
a clear positive impression that he was
on the verge of discovering or isolating
the key as soon as a rescue crew had
brought lee in from the airless wastes
he would have monj repeat the entire
story of xacrn history exactly as it had
been told before somewhere during
the past hours temple had seen or
heard something that was a vital clue
it must of necessity be hidden in the
xacrns own past history

  the great dome loomed out of the
darkness temple let himself be rushed
through the airlock and into the great
interior the first sight he saw was
rocossen sitting up unaided beside the
wrecked space suit looking pale and
shaken but unharmed

  then temple saw the waiting assem-
bly monj and his lieutenants at the
front vards ranged watchfully at each
side the rows of human slaves behind
as temples captors shoved him into
the room monj and his companions
hastened closer temple grinned at

him through the faceplate as he waited
for the helmet to be unscrewed and re-
moved

  one of temples captors stood back
of him while two others turned and
raised the bulbous helmet fresh
sweet air struck his face and he
breathed deeply

  he was still drawing in that first
long breath when the entity slave be-
hind him took a step forward and
slammed a padded club against the side
of his head with stunning force dimly
from a queer high vantage point he
seemed to see himself plunging forward
to his face seemed to hear monj say
coldly

  excellent div we can take no
chances on his getting away from us
again carry him into the chamber at
once ill operate and remove the silver
screen immediately while he is uncon-
scious from the blow

  temple tried to cry out to tell monj
that he had the key to their salvation
he tried to tell him that lee was out
there in the crater waiting her air sup-
ply dwindling by the minute until soon
there would not even be enough left to
carry her to the dome to surrender

  he was still trying to choke the
words out of his frozen throat when his
senses fled and darkness closed in

       chapter xviii
       impossible rescue

ith her heart pounding uncon-
trollably and cold fingers brush-
ing her nerves lee mason hurried
away from her farewell to temple back
toward the sheltering debris below the
crater wall alone for the first time
she began to realize just how far away
she was from the familiar landscape of
earth how helpless against the un-
known menace of this alien nightmare
land

  on earth she had thought nothing
of braving a hundred deaths in scien-
tific exploration among jagged moun-
tain peaks deep in subterranean cav-
erns up among the clouds in planes and
balloons ordinarily she was cold
calm nerveless

  but tonight a nameless terror filled
the weird darkness and drenched her
with cold perspiration it was not a fear
of the hunters nor of any unknown life
form that might conceivably inhabit the
eternal shadows it was simply the re-
action of over-taxed nerves to the added
menace of the unknown dark

  in the grip of that unreasoning panic
lees feet forced her from a walk to a
trot that swiftly grew into a run and
then wild flight she bounded fran-
tically toward the looming barrier of
the thousand-foot crater wall seeking
some cranny where she could squeeze
in and let the luxury of solid substance
against her back and sides calm the
trembling of her nerves behind her
the sharp incredible terminator bound-
ary between light and darkness raced
across the giant bowl in pursuit

  suddenly a low rim of rock loomed in
her path without slowing lee flexed
her firm earth muscles and leaped over
the barrier it was a tremendous leap
that swept her beyond the hurdle a
good sixty feet she came down mus-
cles set for the impact of landing and
there was none

  she came down into the shadow of
the ground and the shadow had no sub-
stance before she could gasp she was
falling endlessly down into the dead
crust of the moon down a slanting
shaft of absolute darkness lined with
jagged rocks that plucked metallically
at her bulging armor without slowing
her breathless fall

  it seemed that she had fallen for
hours into the bowels of the moon and
would go on falling for more hours
then suddenly she slammed down
among the upflung teeth of massive
rocks at the bottom of the shaft and
her head struck the faceplate of her hel-
met with a crushing force that brought
the blackness through into her brain

  she came back to consciousness with
a sharp wonder that she had survived
the fall and was still alive her body
was one mass of bruised agony from
banging against the poorly-padded in-
terior of the suit but as nearly as she
could tell the bruises were only super-
ficial

  the faceplate of her helmet was mi-
raculously intact and the suit retained
its air supply plainly she owed her
the gods hate kansas



life to the lesser lunar gravity that had
given her plunging body only one-sixth
its normal earth weight

  intense absolute darkness unre-
lieved by any shade or glow sur-
rounded her and completely concealed
her environment there was no way
of discovering the nature of the shaft
or her chances of climbing back to the
surface for she carried no flashlight
there were matches in her purse but
that was inside the suit strapped to her
belt

  the fall had jarred the panic from
her nerves and she managed a shaky
laugh as she sat up and started to climb
to her feet abruptly the laugh died
on her lips from the waist down her
suit was rigidly immovable she lay
back and tugged and kicked until her
lungs ached and perspiration rolled into
her eyes but the metal cylinders that
encased her legs were rock-solid

  genuinely alarmed lee sat up again
and fumbled with her steel-gauntleted
hands for the cause of the phenomenon
her hands encountered a massive block
of rough stone apparently dislodged by
her stumbling body that lay across her
knees

  try as she would she could not
budge it nor could she stretch far
enough to reach its boundaries for all
she could tell it might be the whole
crater wall pinning her down

  she shuddered at the realization that
only the metal legs of the suit had kept
her from being crushed to pulp under
that massive rock

  lee lay back fighting down a fresh
panic trying to reason sanely she
could not summon enough strength or
gain sufficient leverage to free her suit
that much was certain nor could she
hope that temple searching for her
would ever stumble onto this particular
shaft and discover her whereabouts at
the bottom

  she had no light to flash upward no
gun to shoot to attract attention and
in that rarified air she could not shout
until her lungs burst without ever a
whisper drifting to the surface an in-
calculable distance above realizing
these things she became suddenly
aware of a dull ache in her chest and
an abnormal hammering in her ears
that could mean only one thing her

air was running low thinning out to
extinction

  lee lay back against the cold rock
and blew away a drop of perspiration
that tickled the end of her nose

  well lee mason she whispered
it looks like the beginning of a very
nasty end she shivered but what
a cold lonely place to die in

late in the afternoon a group of
shaken men gathered in the gloom
of the smaller rocket hangar in the ari-
zona camp and stared wearily at one
another farge looking like the sur-
vivor of some gigantic explosion with
his black eyes battered face and tat-
tered clothing hugged the flat case of
a projector and stared gloomily up
through the open roof

  mullane and lansdon and jacobs and
the other scientists bearing lesser
bruises but dazed and shaken from
their recent experience faced him anx-
iously

  the camp guards restored to normal
but still sullen and frightened huddled
close by

  blast farge cried suddenly in
hoarse fury curt and lee are up
there facing god knows what horrors
and all we can do is stand around like
a bunch of bumps on a log we cant
lift a finger to help them dont even
know that theyre still alive for all
we know they may have been over-
come and forced to join that fiendish
crowd by this time

  take it easy mullane soothed
we know how you feel allen after
all none of us can forget that we were
forced to take a hand in getting them
up there he drew a shaking hand
across his ashen face

  lord i thought we were doomed
to that slavery for all eternity noth-
ing in the world ever felt so good as
the agony of that beam you managed
to turn on us finally

  farge straightened and managed a
wan smile

  forget it im sorry i get the jitters
but its this feeling of utter helplessness
now after having had such a big hand
in fighting the menace before

  he had told them of the weary weeks
of research and experiment that led to
perfection of the weapon and this in-


startling stories

vasion of the camp for a time after
the grim battle when the rocket had
blasted off with lee and temple and
rocossen and when farge had finally
battled his way clear long enough to
adjust his projector and destroy the re-
maining entities they had been too
weary and shaken to do more than talk

  later carrying lansdons bulky de-
tector instrument they had combed
the whole camp area destroying every
floating entity that blazed on the
screen

  you think wed better stay in camp
and keep quiet a while longer jacobs
the lanky chemist asked

  farge waved an expressive hand

  what else can we do this place
is our only thread of contact with the
moon now if a rocket returns its
got to come here and weve got to be
here to meet it

  besides if i stick my nose outside
about five hundred fbi men are going
to land on it with hobnailed shoes if
they guessed i was in here wed have
an invasion on our hands right now

  personally lansdon growled id
give anything to put a thousand miles
between me and this place but i see
your point and if we went out now
and tried to tell the truth wed prob-
ably land in a first class booby hatch
the very least wed get would be locked
up for a few weeks while a bunch of
fat-headed politicians investigated our
stories

  how can we ever face people any-
how meeker demanded after the
ghastly things those entities made us
do hey listen to that thunder
must be going to storm

  farge cocked his head listening
suddenly his eyes widened he leaped
toward the door

  thunder heck he bawled over his
shoulder thats a rocket coming
back maybe its curt with news of
victory

  and maybe its those fiends back
for more bodies mullane snarled
but how can they travel at any old
time of the day or night like this i
always thought a rocket had to be timed
exactly to the split second in order to
intersect the orbit of the body its aimed
at

  not this one davoe panted run-

ning beside him i made the trip with
eno once and saw how it worked
theyve got direct-vision screens of
some kind that show the moon all
they have to do is blast off at any time
turn until the moon shows on the screen
and then head for it by dead reckoning
aiming the ship like a gun

  of course they have to keep swing-
ing to compensate for the moons mo-
tion like guiding a telescope with a
manually-operated azimuth mounting

out in the bright sunlight they
stopped staring up at the vivid
blue of the sky trying to see the source
of the steadily-deepening thunder a
tense expectancy gripped them all
what would the rocket bring

  there it is farge cried suddenly
pointing

  they all saw it then a pinpoint of
black that swelled with incredible
speed painting a widening smoke path
across the blue screen of the heavens
as it screamed down the flat curve of
its trajectory

  dont we have to do something to
help it land farge demanded sud-
denly

  lord yes lansdon snapped his
fingers theres machinery that moves
the cradle up to meet it and then lowers
it to the pit on hydraulic cushions i
think i can remember how to operate
it my mind is hazy on most of what
i did during that time but that seems
clear enough come on

  moments later they stood in the han-
ger screened from the searing blasts
of the jets as the smaller rocket
dropped expertly into its waiting cradle
and was lowered to floor level

  oh-oh mullane muttered i dont
like that its handled too expertly for
an amateur that must mean-

  he left the rest unsaid a grim threat
hanging over them they hid behind
pillars near the foot of the gangplank
listening tensely to the sob of pumps
unlocking the sealed port jacobs held
the detector in readiness farges
hands were clammy as they gripped
the projector ready to blast if enemies
appeared

  the great lockplate dropped at last
and the slender figure of eno rocossen
appeared at the head of the gangplank
the gods hate kansas



staring warily around even before
they saw the violet blaze on the de-
tector screen it was apparent that his
brain was in the grip of an entity the
stiff coldness of his face and the flat-
ness of his eyes gave ample visual evi-
dence

  controlled jacobs barked that
means curt and lee are dead or their
slaves blast him

  rocossen saw them at the same in-
stant his hand came around from be-
hind him levelling a blue beam pro-
jector

  farges lips thinned and a hot flame
burst in his eyes he pressed the trig-
ger of his own weapon terrible un-
seen radiations flashed out soundlessly
and the entity on rocossens brain
evaporated

  mullane and lansdon sprang for-
ward to catch the astronomer as he
toppled but before they could reach
him he swayed back and plunged head-
long off the narrow gangplank into the
rocket pit below

  his plunging body struck the black-
ened concrete with a crunching thud
and lay still

 my god rocky

they clambered down the iron lad-
der and hauled him tenderly to the
surface

  he was conscious his face gray with
pain one arm dangled brokenly and
a gash on his head oozed crimson

  im okay he whispered as they
bent over him got to get back to
the moon theyve got curt op-
erating now-taking his silver screen
hurry lee lost in-crater curt
knows how-to stop entities rescue
him

  he closed his eyes

  what are you going to do davoe
cried

  im going after him farge gritted
clenching his fists

  heavens man lansdon objected
you dont know how to run the rocket
and eno may not recover in time
youd never be able to  

  ill never learn sitting in an arm-
chair farge snapped i can push
and pull levers until we either take
off or blow up ill figure the rest out
after that anybody going along 

chapter xix
slave of monj

after the first dull resignation to
an inexorable doom lee masons
mind began to function again it was
better to die fighting than to lie back
and wait for the end to come she
struggled upright again vitalized by a
return of her old fighting spirit

  it was only her suit that was trapped
if she could slip out of that she vould
be free but without the protection of
the suit and its dwindling air supply
she would die quickly from the intense
cold and rarified air

 or would she a new thought
smashed into her mind thin air lin-
gered in the great bowl of plato though
it was not sufficient to support human
life

  but if the air was at least tenuous
at the craters surface it should be still
more tangible in the bottom of this
deep pit while it might not be enough
it could be no less than her suit would
contain in a few more minutes and
a quick finish was preferable to a slow
lingering one

  with steady fingers lee began to
twist the bulbous helmet withdrawing
it from the air-seal at the throat sud-
denly it came loose and a rush of bitter
cold stung her face she drew a deep
racking breath that seemed to have no
soothing effect on the shriek of her
oxygen-starved cells

  she breathed more rapidly gulping
in sharp bursting breaths of the thin
atmosphere and suddenly it seemed
that the dizziness was lifting from her
brain it was true the air was dan-
gerously thin but with care it might
maintain her for a time

  relieved she unsnapped the seals
and drew herself gingerly out of che
trapped armor until she stood erect
and unprotected in the pitchy darkness
the cold lashed at her with a thousand
flaming knives and the darkness beat
down upon her in a stifling cloud but
she was free and still lived and cold
as it was the layers of rock above her
seemed to cut off the worst of it they
must gather and retain some heat from


startling stories

the periods of terrible sunshine

  she was free-but for what purpose 
even if she could clamber up the shaft
to the surface the rarer air and greater
cold would be fatal still she had to do
something keep moving to keep her
body from freezing and her brain from
succumbing to the numbing horror of
her predicament with outstretched
hands she began to stumble forward
groping her way over the jagged rock
floor

  she came to a hard cold vertical wall
presently and felt her way along its
rough surface suddenly the wall van-
ished from before her hands and she
stumbled forward onto a down-slanting
floor that seemed to indicate a cavern
or tunnel that branched off from the
pit

  in here the cold was less intense and
her sobbing breaths were more satisfy-
ing as though the air were heavier
pressing the side wall for support and
guidance she stumbled ahead the
floor levelled off after a time and grew
smoother so that she could make better
progress

  she lost all track of time and distance
until it seemed that her whole life had
been spent in plunging endlessly into
eternal night vaguely she knew that
she was somewhere deep in the unin-
habited lifeless bowels of the dead
moon drawing ever further from the
slender passage to the surface where
there were human beings and light and
air but the full meaning of that had
long since drifted from her reeling
mind she staggered on

lee saw the light ahead a long time
before its meaning penetrated her
brain at first it was only the faintest
imaginable lightening of the intense
gloom then it became a glow and at
last a circle of eerie radiance

  with a hoarse cry lee stumbled for-
ward and out into a low corridor whose
metallic walls were emitting a steady
phosphorescent radiance that was
somehow vaguely familiar

  but whatever it was that lighted
tunnel spelled the presence of life and
the nearness of rescue and warmth and
air she ran down the tunnel at full
speed her clicking heels raising tiny
clattering echoes that pursued her flit-

ting figure cackling eerily at her hope

  an eternity later the corridor turned
and opened out into a larger glowing
chamber from a long way off lee
saw that chamber filled with familiar
objects-chairs a table and incongru-
ously a white porcelain hospital cot
a human figure moved slowly among
these objects a figure that was ach-
ingly familiar

  lee raced into the chamber with a
great sob of thankfulness on her lips

  curt oh curt i dont know how
you got here or how i got here but
here we are

  temple turned and stared at her his
jaw dropping there was something
oddly different about his face a cold-
ness and stiffness his eyes too were
queer-flat and dull she stopped sud-
denly and shrank back

  curt what-whats wrong with
you

  he smiled stiffly and held out his
hand

  nothings wrong with me lee
not a thing i was only terribly sur-
prised to see you here come here lee
come to me

  hesitantly she moved forward like
a striking snake his hand shot out and
closed on her wrist and a grin of tri-
umph curved his taut lips it was only
then that she noticed for the first time
that the back of his scalp had been
shaved clean of hair and that a small
stained pad of dressing was taped in
the center of this space

temple had wondered many times
just what it felt like to be the slave
of one of the glowing brain parasites
now as he opened his eyes and sat
up stiffly on the hospital cot in the
great glowing chamber he knew and
tasted the horror of that knowledge

  he curtis temple still existed as
an ego but he had the eerie sensation
of smallness of being compressed to a
microscopic speck his whole person-
ality compacted into a single atom at
the top of his aching head

  below him stretched his own body
he could think about that body see
what it was doing hate it and fear it
and plan movements for it to make
but he could not control or affect it in
any way
the gods hate kansas



  he wanted to lie on the cot and
ease his weariness and his mind set
the proper nerve-mechanisms into mo-
tion to produce that desired effect but
his tired body continued to rise got
up off the cot and moved aboutthe
room with steady steps he realized
then that he was but a helpless voice-
less spectator relegated to the farthest
recesses of his own mind by the om-
nipotent force of the usurping entity

  and he could no more interfere with
or affect the activities of that conqueror
force than he could jar the earth from
its appointed orbit by kicking at a clod
in the field

  i am a slave he thought wildly
the entities took my silver screen and
seized my brain

  he heard no sound but instantly an
exultant answer graved itself across
the plastic thought-screen of his mind

  that is right you are now my
body my vehicle and a far more suit-
able one to my purposes than the slave
i occupied before now monj the an-
cient one is properly housed

  a swift blazing terror flashed
through the part of temples mind that
was still his he had held the lives
and futures of hundreds of innocent
persons in his hands and now that trust
had been violated

  but there was something else some
great discovery he had been on the
verge of making that would completely
change everything it was something
about the entities about a doom they
faced

  suddenly frantically he shut his
mind to the thoughts he had almost
had it and he knew that if the solution
reached the surface of his mind now
the terrible power of monj would dis-
cover and seize it

  and if that happened temple would
have lost all hope of bargaining for
freedom

  what was that the question
flashed sharply across his mind you
had a thought then-something about
solving the problems of the xacrns
future tell me what it was tell me
temple or i shall make your helpless
body inflict tortures

  desperately temple fought to sub-
merge the thought to hide it from the
deadly probing tentacles of the ruling

force for a moment his body reeled
and staggered from the fury of the ter-
rible psychic struggle in his brain

  decex vard had said that sometimes
an entitys hold could be broken-but
that was not reckoning with the greater
strength of the leader monj slowly
inexorably the secret was being probed
out of temples brain stolen despite
his every effort

the struggle ended abruptly there
was an unbelievable interruption
temple heard the glad accents of lee
masons voice and turned to face her
his mind uttered a wild cry of happi-
ness and raced across to take her in his
arms

  but his body in the hands of monj
stood motionless stretching a traitor-
ous hand gloating as the victim stepped
hesitantly forward to be seized tem-
ples consciousness writhed and strug-
gled and fought to break the deadly
hold to cry out a warning but he was
powerless

  he could only face the inevitable
conquest helpless as the brain-force of
monj swept out through the air sum-
moning a free entity to hasten and seize
her brain

  in a moment there would be no more
free minds no more resistance to the
entities-only helpless slaves forced
to compete obedience of every com-
mand

  his hand lashed out and seized lees
wrists drawing her forward despite her
sudden realization and desperate strug-
gle to break free his mind cried out
in agony while his lips laughed in tri-
umph

  then something happened it was
as though the contact of his hand with
lees sent a new stream of energy
through his nerve-paths to his mind
coupled with his own desperation it
exploded a new surge of strength

  he braced his mind against the solid
rock of her nearness and fought the
grasp of monj the conqueror with
every ounce of his will and determina-
tion he sought to drive the entity out

  snarling shrieking threatening in
soundless flashes of terrible thought
monj resisted temple and lee stood
close together their bodies frozen in
rigidity as the terrible struggle went on


startling stories

in temples brain lee sensing what
was happening poured the strength of
her own confidence into his and inten-
sified his efforts

  slowly they won slowly the entity
retreated losing grip after grip against
the advancing force of temples will
there was pain terrible blinding ag-
ony and the sickening sensation of
brain cells being torn from their rest-
ing places by clutching tentacles

  suddenly it was over with a last
flame of resistance monj gave way and
fled temples body was weak trem-
bling bathed in cold perspiration but
his mind was his own again and won-
derfully clear

  youve won lee gasped clinging
to him youve driven the entity
away

  but only for the moment temple
panted holding her weve got to do
something fast neither of us have
any protection now i wouldnt have
the strength to go through that strug-
gle a second time and therell be an-
other entity along in a moment to seize
your mind

      chapter xx
      a deal is made

uick lee cried tugging at
his arm i know a way we
can be safe for a little while long
enough to rest and make plans
hurry

  she dragged him back along the way
she had just come urging him to
greater speed as they raced down the
glowing passage

  the radioactive lining ends back
here a short distance she panted ex-
planation beyond that theres enough
air to keep us alive and it isnt too des-
perately cold if that stuff really is
their insulation against cosmic rays
then the entities wont dare follow us
beyond the shielded part of the tunnel

  they burst past the last radiance and
halted gasping the thin air into starved
lungs in the darkness beyond

  shouldnt we go further back lee
asked trembling

  i think this is far enough theyd

hardly dare risk even brief exposure to
radiation so destructive and so unpre-
dictable lets sit down a moment
while i try to think what we can do
tell me how you happened to show up
so unexpectedly sweet

  when she had finished he nodded
soberly

  fate was certainly on your side
lee this seems to be an artificial
passage probably at some time in the
past the vards tried mining operations
as far out as the crater wall it was
sheer luck that you dropped into their
shaft

  those poor vards lee whispered
i still feel a little ill when i think of
how placidly they submit to that cruel
slavery simply because they understand
that the entities cant feel

  lee the walls of the tunnel
echoed temples thunderous shout as
he sprang to his feet ive got it ive
got the clue i missed before the clue
that kept nagging at me all the time

  lee i know now how the xacrns
can be saved from their next step in
evolution quick start yelling for
monj hes probably gone back to his
first body and ive got to talk to him
i believe i can bargain us all out of
this mess

  their combined shouts echoed down
the corridor and were finally echoed by
the tramp of approaching feet a mo-
ment later the figure of monj and his
henchmen appeared flanked by vards
they hesitated suspiciously some dis-
tance back from the end of the glowing
shield

  will you to come back and submit
now monj demanded harshly or
do you prefer to stay where you are
until cold and hunger have given you
that freedom you defend so strongly
well come back temple answered
grimly on our own terms monj i
know how to save your race from doom
its the simplest possible solution but
one your science wouldnt discover in
a billion eons simply because it re-
quires certain properties you xacrns
dont possess yet your planet is rich
in them only waiting for you to help
yourself and find salvation

  i dont believe it monj snapped
its a trick to gain your freedom

  but he said it hesitantly and there
the gods hate kansas



was doubt showing on his face

  its no trick temple answered
you know it too because you caught
a flash of it in my mind and nearly
stole it from me then you know im
telling the truth

  if your race had only known or re-
alized that our civilization is based on
a different principle than the one of
grab-and-conquer-whether some of us
act like it or not-you could have had
the secret long ago

  if you had asked the whole world
would have pitched in willingly to help
supply what you needed construct your
ship and see you off for home with a
new lease on life human beings are
built that way theyll never be slaves
never learn the docile fatalism of your
native vards

  thats why you could bring the
whole xacrn race here and conquer
earth without ever actually conquering
the human race youve got to under-
stand that monj in order to under-
stand your own salvation in order to
properly use the tools i can place in
your hands

  what is the secret monj de-
manded tensely while his weird com-
panions swayed forward in breathless
eagerness how can the xacrn race
be prevented from evolving into obli-
vion

  uh-uh-uh temple relaxed grin-
ning and waving a reproving finger
no tickee-no washee boy we dont
give we trade

  when we landed here both miss
mason and rocossen had silver caps
the first thing youll have to do is get
those caps and toss them to us we
want to come out and talk this over
with you but not until were safe
against seizure

there was a long nerve-racking
silence then a vard suddenly
turned and shuffled back along the cor-
ridor temples breath went out gustily

  the tide turns he whispered and
squeezed lees hand

  do you really know the answer
she demanded

  i really know it sweet the
answer to everything

  in a moment the vard returned and
the two caps were tossed to them they

fitted them on with sighs of relief

 by the way temple demanded
what happened to rocossen

  he was sent back to earth in the
smaller rocket as soon as he recovered
thanks to your attack the base we had
established there seems too dangerous
to maintain until we see what the reac-
tion of your public may be

  rocossen was equipped with a wea-
pon and instructed to bring back our
most valuable instruments and plans
if necessary we can remain here for a
time until affairs are smoothed out he
will return soon

  you hope temple breathed

  they moved warily from their point
of safety but neither the vards nor the
human slaves made any move to at-
tack in silence they moved back to
the great domed hall with its rows of
motionless humans the detector was
gone now but temple could still see
in his minds eye the endless swarms
of hovering free entities a potential
menace to all humanity

  the secret monj cried hoarsely
give us the secret temple quickly
first how long will it take you to
build your ship and take off for xacrn
with the secret in our possession
monjs voice range with vibrant hope
no more than a week the larger
rocket was built to form the hull of
the new ship it needs only the re-
placement of the crude repulsion power
by our space-warp mechanism to make
the trip

 i dont understand it temple
shook his head your world lies in-
finite light-years away in space even
traveling at the speed of light which
we believe is impossible you would
never reach home before millions upon
millions of years had elapsed

 of course not monj said impa-
tiently xacrn is impossibly distant
in space and time but not in space-time
with our science we can so warp the
tapestry of space-time that our worlds
are no more than a leap apart

  we shall be home within days even
though as you say it is impossible for
material substance to exceed the speed
of light his hands extended plead-
ingly

  but the secret man the secret
  will you agree to immediately re-


startling stories

lease every human slave withdraw all
your fellow-xacms from wherever they
have been scattered over the earth and
restore all plague victims to normal
life

  we agree after all we have noth-
ing to gain by doing otherwise we
sought only to accomplish our ends in
a way that seemed necessary

  curt lee whispered how can
you be sure theyll keep any promises
they make after all-

  i think theyll keep them theres
nothing inherently bad or dishonest in
them they simply know nothing but
the achievement of a goal by any means
within their power with that goal
reached their own super-mentality
should show them the futility of doing
anything but going home

  he faced the thronged slaves and
invisible entities and his voice rang

  then i give you the salvation of
your race decex vard come up here
by me when the great vard had
lumbered to his side he threw an arm
across the leathery body when you
get home do honor to this vard for
it was from him i got the clue to your
future salvation

  you xacrns began as normal body-
mind combinations like this vard but
by forced evolution a part of your race
discarded physical bodies and became
only super-minds

  your doom lies in the fact that you
cant stop evolution from carrying your
super-minds on into eternal energy
your salvation lies in halting evolu-
tion retrogressing back to a point be-
low the danger line

s that all you offer monjs voice
a was harsh with disappointment
we have recognized that obvious fact
and tried for countless ages to accom-
plish the impossible it cannot be done
our minds will not retrogress under
any stimulus

  oh but they will temple re-
torted smiling you started existence
as a complex bundle of thoughts and
emotions your ideas and visions and
dreams were all inextricably wrapped
up in your emotions

  you started all this evolution in the
first place under the driving stimulus
of emotions-love and greed and am-

bition then as you went up the path
you discarded those emotional fibers
from your minds at the same time or
even before you discarded physical
bodies

  you dont know what feelings are
today you cant love or pity or ad-
mire you arent even actually afraid
of your own doom you simply see it
as an undesirable end to mental activ-
ity the only environment you know

  monj the key to your salvation lies
in recapturing the lost emotions you
seize bodies vard and human and con-
trol them to your wills but you have
never once reached down and actually
shared the emotions of that slave

  you never felt tired when he did
sick when he did you never knew a
surge of happiness when something
pleased him or a pang of sorrow when
he suffered

  certainly not monj interrupted
stiffly we are above those baser-
that is your answer temples
voice rang triumphantly of course
emotions are crude compared to men-
tal perfection but you could touch the
emotional centers of those captive
minds and feel with them if you de-
sired couldnt you

  of course but-

  then the moment you do-the mo-
ment you project baser impulses of raw
emotion into your mental plane-you
begin to retrogress dont you yet
you wont actually lose youll gain
youll merge closer and closer until you
and your vards are again one body-
mind and-

  it is the key-the answer monj
shouted suddenly his face alight
retrogression without loss no vard
will ever slip over the margin into in-
finite energy we shall became vards
again but wiser more capable vards
and the poor vards will no longer
suffer from their slavery lee cried
her eyes shining curt it means a new
order of life for them

  they never wanted to lose their
masters because the masters were a
part of them now blended as you
suggest theyll all know happiness
curt its wonderful i

  they stood in smiling silence for a
time knowing without being able to
actually see the ripple of excited
the gods hate kansas



thought-currents flashing among the
massed entities suddenly temple
frowned

  hey im a dope i forgot to add
the demand that we all be transported
back to earth again and if they leave
the small rocket behind our science
can use that as the basis for starting
interplanetary exploration

  you shall be returned to your
homes monj interrupted every
human safe and unharmed and the
rocket with its equipment is yours as
well we shall-

  he broke off reeling back as the
dome suddenly reverberated to a re-
sounding crash that rocked the walls
there were lighter crashes a dull thud
and then silence

  what on earth- temple began

uddenly the mouth of the tube
leading out into the rocket hangar
erupted figures grotesque nightmarish
forms that staggered and stumbled out
into the room

  temple gaped and then roared with
uncontrollable laughter

  the ragged tattered invaders were
his friends allen farge battered and
nearly unclothed ran in the lead with
a battered silver loving cup tied to his
head and a shotgun against his hip

  behind him reeled mullane his brain
shielded by a shapeless mass of ham-
mered metal from which protruded the
unmistakable tines of a silver fork and
part of the bowl of a spoon next
bruised and blackened was jacobs with
a jingling mat of silver coins bouncing
against his head and a gigantic stillson
wrench in his hand

  the last man to stagger in was ro-
cossen one arm in a crude sling and a
blood-stained bandage surmounting his
drawn face

  but he was still able to crinkle his
eyes in a grin at the sight of temple
and lee

  were here farge croaked wav-
ing the shotgun rocky blasted off
in the rocket and then passed out we
steered it by guess and by gosh and we
got lost in space and we finally landed
fifty feet away from the landing cradle
we were trying to hit-but by jumping
catfish we landed it and were here
bring on your entities

  the great rocket drummed steadily
on through space the green globe
of the moon dwindling in its smaller
vision screen as the red-haloed ball of
earth swelled in the larger the fury
of acceleration was past and its pas-
sengers could relax in weightless ease
and talk of what had happened

  farge twisted in the control seat to
grin back at temple and lee mason
floating close together

  you got a long way from your first
path curt as i remember it you told
me once you started out to discover
why the gods hated kansas and threw
so many stones at it i still dont get
the answer to that

  the stones were space ships fired
from that pit you showed me by some
kind of radiant energy we know noth-
ing about but why did they all hit kan-
sas its a nice state i grant you that
but why make it a target for a stone-
fight

  i took the time to get my first ques-
tion answered temple smiled back
and its such a silly simple answer
that i actually felt disappointed the
gun that fired those entity-laden rocks
at earth was set at an angle that would
bring its projectiles into the path of
earths orbit

  they used as you say a form of
propellant energy we cant comprehend
-but it took the full blaze of sunlight
to set off that energy

  the point where their launching
gun was built lay on the floor of plato
where the sun-line only reaches when
the moon is in a certain definite part
of its orbit

  it just happened that when the sun-
light fell so they could fire the gun
kansas happened to lie on that part of
the earth that was in the path of the
projectiles flight at that particular
juncture of time and space

  ill be darned farge gasped its
an anticlimax thats what it is

  naturally weve been bombarded by
other natural stony meteorites from the
beginning of time i imagine well find
their fall uniform enough to satisfy the
laws of chance it was only the addi-
tional bombardment of kansas that
threw us off but thats over now
thank heaven

  lee shuddered for a moment in his

arms and her eyes closed

they were entering the first reaches
of earths atmosphere now and sud-
denly the screen in front of farge
showed a whipping streak of fire that
flashed briefly and was gone

a meteorite perhaps no more than a

tiny grain of cosmic dust had flamed
and died in its path from the changeless
stars

the magical prism

it was the week of the county fair at stourbridge england in the year
 gay booths lined the streets and lanes colored tents housed cur-
iosities and freaks from all parts of the known world gaudy gypsy cara-
vans dotted the green bearded men from european hinterlands exhibited
dancing bears and trained wolves tumblers and wrestlers abounded there
were refreshments and confections and good old honest english ale to be
had for the tuppence

everywhere there was laughter and jollity lords and ladies and honest
townsmen mingled freely with travelers and simple country bumpkins all in-

  i say its high time you had a little
recreation isaac spoke his companion a
merry-eyed chap arent you glad i
brought you to the fair look yonder-
that troupe of austrian midgets isnt that
lively one in cap and bells a droll little
fellow

  bat isaac was not listening already his
eye had been attracted to the booth of a
swiss glass vender attracted by the
pretty glittering baubles he was drifting
toward the concession

  that oddly shaped pendant he said
to the hawker pointing at the object
what sort of a crystal is it

  that sir is a prism glass responded
the swiss with a heavy accent it is cut
to imprison all the pretty colors of the
rainbow in the emperors palace at
vienna there is a chandelier which has
thousands of glasses like this but i
have only this one it is very cheap-just
a shilling sir

  i will take it said isaac upon sudden
impulse

  what do you want with that cheap
piece of glass demanded his companion in
disgust why dont you buy a genuine
diamond

  isaac was turning the foolish knick-
knack over and over in his fingers gently
rubbing the polished facets of the crystal
who knows he replied perhaps the
secret of the diamond is locked in here
john

  john snorted and led the way to more
concrete pleasures isaac smiled toler-
antly put the prism into his pocket and
followed but his mind was already toying
with certain speculations



tent on seeking diversion entertainment
and excitement

  strolling through the merry throng stop-
ping now and then as an exhibit or a puppet
show took their fancy for the moment were
two young men from cambridge the
older of the pair isaac had just the pre-
vious year received his degree as bachelor
of the arts he was an earnest and studious

sir isaac newton

young man with lofty brow and deep-set
piercing eyes who although not yet twen-
ty-four years of age had already discov-
ered mathematical laws subsequently to
be called the binomial theorem and was
even now working on the elements of dif-
ferential calculus which he called fluxions
  what was it that ren descartes had
said about colors what was it johann
kepler had said in his diopterics about
passing a beam of light through a diffusing
medium what had this swiss hawker just
said about the imprisoned colors of the
rainbow

  that night isaac could not sleep for
thinking on the problem just what real
relation did light have to color how
could the colors of the rainbow be im-
prisoned in a bit of lifeless crystal even
a diamond did not shine in the dark it was
dull and lusterless until sunlight or candle-
light gave it life

 that was it sunlight the young
thinker fairly threw himself out of bed and
excitedly walked the floor as he waited for
day to break for centuries mankind had
been trying to comprehend the secret of
light of sunbeams and rays from the stars
since the dawn of intelligence man had
gazed upon the rainbow and marveled at
the colors without understanding them
and that swiss hawker had prated about
them being imprisoned in a soulless crystal

  why i myself know that light is energy
transmitted by wave motion through the
medium of ether which pervades space he
said aloud

  for days isaac wrestled with the prob-
lem going back over the theories of emi-
nent thinkers who had lived before his time
and still he reached no satisfactory con-
clusion

  and then came that epic day he re-
verted to the suggestion of kepler why
not try to pass a beam of sunlight through
this prism he had so idly bought at the
stourbridge fair and refract the diffused
ray for observation

  tossing his long curls impatiently out of
his way isaac quickly but deftly arranged
his study for the experiment he darkened
the room by closing the door and shutting
all the windows

  then he placed a small table before the
window through which the lowering sun
shone full at this time of the year upon

this table he lovingly placed the prism
then he carefully cut a hole in the lower
part of the blind to admit one beam of
sunlight

  trembling now not with anticipation of
the results of this simple experiment but
with the implications of the profound
thoughts and theories bubbling up in his
mathematical mind he carefully focused
the ray of light upon his prism much in
the manner of a burning glass and slowly
moved the crystal until the refracted rays
spread out fanlike across the carpet of the
room and impinged on the opposite wall
like a fairy polychromatic mist

  lo it was not a single beam of white
light that glowed upon the wall it was a
broad band of glowing colors shaking in
his excitement isaac stared in wonder
ranging in order from red on one side to
violet on the other he counted the seven
true colors of the spectrum-red orange
yellow green blue indigo and violet

  for a long moment he stared lost in ad-
miration then he tried reversing the
magic prism turning it over shifting its
position he tried the experiment another
day he used another prism which he
procured another room and the result
was unvarying the same the seven true
colors of the spectrum did not change

  he had proved conclusively that sunlight
was not a beam of white light but was
composed of seven true colors there was
no life in prisms or diamonds or rainbows
or soap bubbles-only the refracted life of
the incandescent sun

  in my judgment he murmured in awe
this is the oddest if not the most con-
siderable detection that has recently been
made in the operation of nature

  and he was right while the secret of
reading the stars and their mysterious light
by means of the spectroscope lay more than
one hundred and eighty years in the future
sir isaac newton had laid the groundwork
for the unveiling of the universe and had
become the father of the science of astro-
physics

into the stratosphere

circus day-about the turn of the century a sturdy lad of eleven years
stood at one side of the enclosure and watched with big eyes as a crew
of roustabouts busily stoked an outdoor oven with wood suspended
over the hot-air vent of the oven was the flapping mouth of a forty-foot bal-
loon

  already the huge bag was inflating gangs of men hung on the guy
ropes steadying and holding the tugging surging filling bag the good-
natured crowd thronged around some

laughing some gazing in awe but none
gazed with greater reverence and excite-
ment than the quiet little lad with the
bulging optics

  professor zanelli the great aerialist the
muscular man in tights and with a luxu-
riant pair of handle-bar mustaches was
going to make his great balloon ascension
perform on the trapeze in his death-defy-
ing feat and then descend to earth by
parachute

  at last the great bag was ready the
band struck up a martial air bowing
grandiosely to his audience the professor
wiped his hands on a white silk handker-
chief gripped the bar of his trapeze and
gave a signal to the boss of the ground
crew the lines were released and up into
the air shot the great bag carrying the
aerialist far into the heavens to the ac-
companiment of plaudits from the admir-
ing crowd

ss
  the little lad with the big eyes did not
applaud he was too busy watching the
ascent of the daring balloonist he
watched until his eyes ached in the warm
afternoon sun until a breeze finally carried
the professor gyrating and acting on his
trapeze out of sight

  and then perhaps a thousand feet in
the air after the balloon drifted back into
view beyond the trees there was a gasp
from the crowd as the doll-like little figure
fell from the hot-air bag and plummeted
toward the ground then as a woman
screamed a puff of white appeared magi-

cally above the free-falling trapeze and
professor zanelli drifted safely to earth

  the little lad blinked his eyes and swal-
lowed the lump of excitement in his
throat

  some day he vowed to himself im
going to do that some day im going to
go higher than professor zanelli

  time passed and came world war i in
 the lad now grown to vigorous man-
hood entered the army in  he was
commissioned a captain and assigned to
the air service he flew heavier-than-air
machines but he never forgot his first
love-the balloon

after the war he remained in the u s
army in the aeronautics department he

returned to his study of balloons becom-
ing proficient he represented the army in
the gordon bennett balloon races in 
winning second place

  but still he was not satisfied he still
cherished that burning ambition to ascend
higher than any other man and at last
on a cold and bleak day the second of
november  he made his third and
last attempt to break the existing altitude
record

  armed only with a few scientific in-
struments clad only in the warmest
clothes he could bundle in without too
greatly hampering his movements from
scott field at belleville  he ascended
-in an open basket

  alone and daring unprotected by the
elaborate safeguards and the air-tight gon-
dolas in use today he made his bid for
fame up up higher into the blue he
sailed dropping ballast valving his bal-
loon adjusting his few instruments striv-
ing to reach higher much as icarus sought
to fly to the sun higher than man had
ever risen before up until his nose and
ears and fingers froze until his heart
labored and his lungs panted for oxygen
he rose

  now he was seeing mother earth spread
out below him as no man had ever seen
her before and higher still he sent his
balloon until the bag reached the utmost
limit of its lifting power  feet his
instrument said a trifle more than eight
miles above sea level

  but he paid the ultimate price for his
temerity and daring his fearless heart
could not stand the strain his lungs could
not take in enough oxygen bleeding
severely at the nose turning blue from
suffocation he crumpled down after a
last look about him he had made good
his boyhood vow and he died with a slight
smile about his lips

  the wrecked balloon was recovered the
next day and the reading taken from his
instruments the man himself was no
more but captain hawthorn c gray
had earned his place among the immortals
by being the first man to ascend into the
stratosphere

scatteh-gun fou microbes

it was a day in early fall in baltimore in  and a fog from the bay
made the city dismal and gloomy in the research laboratory of the johns
hopkins medical school oblivious to the external gloom a young man
and a young woman stood at a table and surveyed four groups of very sick
white mice both of them were doctors but this was no professional call on
the sick that is in the accepted sense of the word for these mice had been
made ill at their specific orders

the laboratory assistant had some eight hours before infected the four
batches of rodents by shooting them in

the belly with four different types of the	from this sort of infection if treatment

deadly streptococcus family heretofore	was delayed more than four hours and

this had always been tantamount to a	even then the mortality rate was discour-

wholesale execution a purge such as would	aging

have given the crudest tyrant pause for	at least it was to dr perrin long and

nobody had even seen a mouse recover	dr eleanor bliss for they were experts


on the streptococcus and misanthropists on
the efficacy of anti-strep serums but
something new had come into their lives
in the summer they had attended the
microbiologists convention in london
where they had heard more of the flying
rumors about that new german drug called
prontosil

  a chance chat with the english biologist
ronald hare had brought to light the
fact that hare had been at deaths door
from a strep infection and had been saved
by prontosil long noted for his bound-
less enthusiasm was at once ready to
carry on his research along these new
lines he had dispatched cables and letters
home immediately and now armed with
the complex orange dye called prontosil
and a supply of the mother drug from
which the dye had been made-a coal-tar
product called para-amino-benzene-sulfon-
amide-he was ready to get down to busi-
ness with his co-worker

  how shall we begin doctor asked
dr bliss surveying the miniature battle-
field

  setting aside half of each batch for
controls replied long suppose we in-
ject half of the rest with prontosil and
treat the remaining half orally with the
mother- chemical

  promptly they set to work using all
possible precautions- for streptococcus
was a deadly foe to both mice and men
subcutaneously half of the selected sick
mice were shot with prontosil s the
other half were given the mother-com-
pound with the jaw-breaker name by way
of mouth then the rest was simple

  they had already tested the chemical
across the deadly microbe in the test tube
and found that it merely inhibited the
growth of the germs for about eighteen
hours-after which mr strep began to
multiply fruitfully by the millions jumping
this unsatisfactory negative test drs long
and bliss had proceeded to the use of
their own old living test tubes mice

  every hour they drew a drop of blood
swarming with streptococci from each
mouse to examine under the microscope
and possibly cast a short-term horoscope
for mr rodent and then suddenly the
miracle happened on that microscopic
battlefield there appeared - between
studies-an attacking wave of phagocytes
the bloods army of microbe-eating white
cells

  repelled up to now by something about
the ferocious streptococci the phagocytes
had recovered their fighting morale and
were devouring the malignant enemy left
and right

  what do you make of that murmured
dr bliss amazed

  long himself was somewhat perplexed
it seems that the chemical in itself not
deadly to strep must soften em up enough
and paralyze their output of poison so
that the phags will attack

  hour after hour the pair of intent
workers followed the progress of the rag-
ing battle their map a microscopic field
their artillery hypodermic syringes their
battleground tiny drops of mousey blood

never did any staff of generals check a
war more closely

  and then hours later the two inde-
fatigable researchers smiled wearily at
each other the battle had been won
eight out of every ten mice treated re-
covered all of the control mice died

  now at last dr long waxed enthusiastic

  doctor bliss he cried his eager eyes
shining at last we have the greatest drug
discovery since erhlichs magic bullet

  it was on the eighth of september that
this first experiment was completed upon
that day there came to the laboratory
a grave-faced physician he had heard
of the research work the two young scient-
ist doctors were following

  dr long he said anxiously i am a
baby doctor i have a little patient eight
years old she is dying of erysipelas i ve
tried everything-transfusions antitoxins
-all i can think of and she is going to
die will this prontosil stuff work

  the long family had always been long
on doctors without stopping to weigh
the consequences long let his medical
sympathies outrun his scientific caution

  he grabbed up a satchel full of supplies
and hurried with the doctor of pediatrics
to the hospital where the little patient lay
at the mercy of the deadly disease at
once he set work on this new battlefield
risking everything on what his common
sense told him dr long administered the
new-old drug

 trembling the two men watched
through the hours and having cast the
die administered prontosil every four
hours they were risking their reputa-
tions possibly their very futures on this
daring treatment

  then within eight hours the deadly
flame of erysipelas waned on that little
cheek phagocytes mobilizing watch the
temperature nurse was this new-old
chemical going to prove a shotgun for all
sorts of bacterial diseases

  thirty-six hours passed it was like a
lifetime and then-the miracle had hap-
pened again free from the terrible fever
the child began to mend rapidly she re-
covered to be the first human patient
treated with prontosil in the united states

  once more science had triumphed re-
search and hope and prayer had been re-
warded the way was yet long and ardu-
ous and the end was not yet

  dr long had many a weary hour to
spend in experiment and research and edu-
cation there were to be fatalities de-
tours medical objections but the way was
opening for the miracle treatment of strep-
tococcus infection arthritis childbed
fever staphylococci pneumonia meningi-
tis and others

  thank god dr long breathed the
baby doctor when the terrible vigil was
over lets go have a cup of coffee
what did you say was the name of the
mother-chemical 

  it is becoming generally known as sul-
fanilamide answered dr long simply
and i know now that several hundred
mice have served a good purpose by their
deaths

angus breen exiled martin vail to a death on a runaway
planet-but his ambitions ran away with him

by robert bloch

author of the man who walked through mirrors the curse of the house etc

angus breen choking with fear faced the bodiless head of martin vail

angus breen controller of
the cosmic research division
l of interplanetary colonies in-
corporated laughed pleasantly as he
brushed his hair why shouldnt he
laugh he was preparing to sit down
to a hearty breakfast but that wasnt
all today was the last possible day
in the time limit set that martin vail
could return from hystero to prevent
breens legal acquisition of his prop-
erties insurance and inventions

 of course breen had promptly
taken over things after vails depar-
ture everything belonging to his

brilliant subordinate was now in
breens control but today made pos-
session absolutely legal so angus
could well afford to smirk at his fat-
faced reflection in the mirror and
laugh out loud

  suddenly the laugh choked in his
throat the smirk froze on his features
in his ears there sounded an ear-split-
ting crash outside his window a crash
that jarred and shook every beam in
his ornate penthouse residence a
stratosphere liner or a small space
ship had landed in his backyard

  offhand this statement would seem


startling stories

silly not to controller angus breen
the pudgy little controllers back
yard was a mile-square area atop the
gigantic cosmic research plant and
the experimental space vessels return-
ing from the exploration of other
planets came to rest there regularly
but they didnt come down with a
crash-and they didnt appear un-
scheduled

  angus breen scowled and put down
his hairbrush if some drunken in-
truder had landed by mistake on the
scientific sanctuary of his roof-well
the interloper was slated to lose his
license that was all the controllers
pudgy face creased unpleasantly as he
strode toward the glass wall that was
his window he stared out at the
crumpled hulk lying on the sodded
roof yards away from the nearest land-
ing cradle

 well ill-ill be eternally
damned exclaimed mr breen his
fat features whitening

  a pretty accurate prediction at
that for controller breen was an
excellent candidate for damnation al-
though nobody on earth knew that
but right now he was a better can-
didate for stark amazement he was
looking at something he had never ex-
pected to see again

  martin vails space ship vail-the
scientific explorer he had sent to cer-
tain death vail who had been com-
missioned to land on hystero

hystero-aptly named because
it had appeared out of nowhere
to disrupt the pleiades whirling in a
gaseous orbit that betokened its ar-
rival as a strange cosmic intruder in
the galaxy

  breen had sent vail to explore hys-
tero knowing that he would die the
planet had never been observed let
alone studied its surface conditions
were unknown it appeared in immi-
nent danger of exploding this run-
away planet from another system
passing by the solar family like a ship
steaming past an island

  so breen had sent vail there for
the sake of science and after send-
ing him went home and appropriated
vails properties he knew that vail
would never come back

  yet here he was

  here was the ship a long silver
splinter resting on the roof a dagger
thrown from the sky a dented dag-
ger-for the sides of the vessel were
scarred and pitted by the meteoric
stones of space the entire surface
appeared to be crusted with a con-
gealed silvery fuzz attesting to the
heat and friction of the voyage

  controller angus breen didnt take
a second look he buzzed the obser-
vation tower to signal that he knew
of the vessels arrival and barked a
brief message dont send a crew up
ill take over myself

  no one else must witness this meet-
ing between himself and vail vail
had returned and if he should suspect
now why he had been sent-

  breen buckled on his drug-gun felt
for the clip of opium needles with
which it was loaded he might face
violence

  well lets get it over with the
fat controller muttered as he strode
out on the roof

  wind fluttering his white jacket he
waddled up to the ships side the
port was sealed there was a lever on
the side but breen impatient as he
was didnt pull it at once he knew
the heat generated by the friction of
speed through space could feel it ra-
diating yet from the ships silver sides
pulling out his gloves he let his
asbestos-clad fingers release the catch
and throw out the metal ladder lead-
ing up to the port he climbed pull-
ing out his master-key-for ordinarily
the ports of a spaceship can be opened
only from the inside safety measure

  only men like controller breen had
master keys only men like control-
ler breen could send others to their
death in space ships   

  but angus breen didnt want to
think about that he had supposed
vail dead and now he had come back
alive sometimes plans go wrong

  get it over with he muttered
again clutching his drug-gun then
he pulled the airlock door open and
hauled his heavy body up until he
could step inside

  a breath of synthetic air smote him
as his feet touched the floor of the
ships interior it was dark he
last laugh



snapped on the lights

  the long narrow cabin was immac-
ulate no signs of scarring no inner
damage no signs of life either at
one end of the little chamber was the
great silver control-board before it
was the piloting chair but where
was vail

  the cot was empty the bunks un-
tenanted had the ship returned
alone why wasnt vail at the door
to greet him after a months con-
finement in these steel prisons poised
in space men usually were clamoring
for release breen had seen them bab-
bling with ecstasy as they fought
their way out to solid earth

  but no vail only the empty cham-
ber the chair and the control-board

  angus breens eyes cut through the
glare and then he saw the back of
vails head over the top of the piloting
chair that faced the controls

  vail he barked

  the head didnt move

  was he unconscious was he-this
would be almost too much to hope for
-dead

 breen didnt know vail he
called again

  and then something rustled in the
shadows of a wall shelf angus breen
nearly jumped out of his skin-no
mean feat considering his weight

  then he relaxed vail sentimental-
ist had taken his cat comet on the
voyage comet jumped down from the
shelf and breen saw horror

  the cat the gray cat walking on
mincing feet across the floor had no
head

  it was a headless feline that blun-
dered over the surface of the cabin
and in a ghastly moment arched its
back and rubbed its living fur against
controller breens leg

  breen shuddered terribly forced
himself to look down at the appari-
tion he saw where the neck ended
in a little silver cap like the cover
of a tin can one or two wire ends
stuck up from the interior of the sil-
ver cap but the beast was headless
headless-yet alive

  it was to escape this monstrosity
that breen moved toward the controls
he wasnt thinking so vividly of vail
and he almost unconsciously put out

his hand to pat vail on the shoulder
over the back of the piloting chair

  his groping hand encountered-
nothing

  he felt again eyes still on that
headless horror of a cat again his
hands met empty air vails head did
not turn

  and angus breen choking with
startled fear moved around until he
faced the front of the piloting chair

  faced-the bodiless head of vail

  clamped with steel sutures against
the top of the chair fastened with a
system of cords and wires leading
from the severed neck throat studded
with glass and rubber tubing the head
of martin vail stared up at angus
breen with a glassy smile

  controller breen stared back stared
into open eyes open mouth stared
and stared and stared-

fflwow are you breen

  mm no that couldnt be the
lips moving and the metallic voice
that wasnt vails coming from vails
throat

  whats the matter breen sur-
prised

  y-yes- whispered breen

  never thought youd see my face
again eh well thats just about all
you are seeing at that

  vail-dont joke about this

  joke thats what it is isnt it
a joke the face smiled

  breen stared into the smiling visage
with a sick dread in his heart vails
expression had changed no his hair
hadnt turned white overnight and
there was no network of wrinkles
etched in agony the change was the
agony in the eyes and yet they were
laughing the fat man shivered

  he saw where the silver wires en-
tered the neck like shining strands of
veins and arteries saw that they ex-
tended down into the seat of the pilot-
ing chair which appeared to have been
scooped out and then re-covered after
the wires had been run through them

  the eyes of the head suspended in
space stared into his following his
glance

  clever isnt it looks crude-like
the early russian experiments we
used to read about in school they


startling stories

used a saline solution for dogs heads
or something of the sort didnt they
this is much better

  angus breen didnt look as though
he thought this was much better he
could only gaze in fear at the decapi-
tation that spoke

  it wasnt vails voice what does
speech sound like without lungs it
was a metallic burr that silver tub-
ing in the throat might account for it

  the nostrils didnt move no breath-
ing chemical life bloodstream fed
through wires and tubing a self-sus-
taining solution

  fragments of chemical biology fil-
tered through breens brain just
fragments filtering through the
greater bulk of the pure horror which
held it vail-what happened why-
this

 vail laughed the head on the
clamps atop the chair shuddered
sorry but it hurts to laugh i forget
that sometimes you understand
breen nodded understand-how
could he understand he wanted to
run wanted to tear his eyes away
from that living head and flee he had
made that head what it was by sending
vail on that perilous mission vails
eyes showed he knew that and while
the head couldnt harm him angus
breen was still afraid

 go on said controller angus
breen hoarsely go on

  i followed your orders and the
temporary charting droned the
metallic voice the voyage itself
doesnt matter oh i know youre in-
terested i thought it was important
myself at the time took it all down
in the chart-book so if you want de-
tails look there the whole of the
observations are recorded

  but theyre not important to me
any more and i doubt if theyll be
important to you after you hear the
rest of my story who wants to read
a roadmap that leads to hell

  that metallic whinny could only be
laughter breen knew it sickened
him

  i have something else to tell
you breen about hystero itself i
landed you know the surface is
solid enough and after a preliminary
observation i saw that oxygen masks

wouldnt be necessary thats how
comet happened to leave the ship and
come along with me

vails eyes indicated the cat

breen glanced down saw the
headless creature with the tin-can
over an empty throat a feeling of
being in a nightmare came over him
vail was buzzing on

  ill condense it hurts to talk and
nothings important except my mes-
sage hystero is inhabited by men
if you choose to call them that

 breen got excited men why
theres never been another body dis-
covered that has men on it vail-
do you realize what this discovery
may mean

 yes said the head but you
dont not yet there are some men
one doesnt bother too much nor
study i didnt think so at first i
thought id blundered into a higher
race they had cities you know and
a civilization they wore clothes
and talked and communicated in
other ways

  thats how they understood me
breen telepathic communication
their speech is too difficult to learn
other habits are difficult to under-
stand too-but it isnt important to
talk about them

  what do you mean it isnt im-
portant angus breen exploded al-
ready avarice was overcoming his ini-
tial fear why publicization of this
discovery would make him famous
why everything about this new
planet and race is important

  no said the head of vail only
one thing is important what they
did to me the drone in the voice
deepened so did the dreadful inten-
sity of vails stare it held breens
eyes riveted

  you see what they did to me vail
said do you know why

  no

  for a joke

  joke

 yes now do you understand
these are men but men far in advance
mentally of earthly beings minds
above so much that interests us and
our lesser intelligences for ex-
ample on hystero there is no music
last laugh



no art those beings read no books
their minds are beyond that they
find no stimulation in the synthetic

  they are no longer interested in
what we call civilization they dont
want to build higher buildings any
more or bigger factories or make
more money they are quite above
those qualities we call patriotism or
idealism or even love-though they
understand such mental attitudes per-
fectly

  what do they find interest in
breen asked

  jokes

  jokes breen echoed weakly

  yes and since there is cruelty in
humor and a certain reality they are
cruel as the ancient roman emperors
who had everything became cruel in
their humor like caligula they
have a sense of irony

  i found that out here was i a
stranger from another world did
they fear me no-for they were too
clever to know fear did they wor-
ship me like savages again no
their reactions were not our human
reactions at all nor did they study
me they werent even curious the
intricate science of their civilization
no longer exists as a means of learn-
ing they wanted to use it only to
play a joke

vail paused an instant as though
to draw breath-breath no longer
needed thats what they did to me
breen they played with me like a
child plays with its toys they took
comet here and examined her there
are no animals on hystero and they
began to experiment you see what
that experiment leads to dont you

  they wanted to keep this strange
living thing animate after removing
its brain a sort of puzzle for them
a game that kind of curiosity the
same curiosity which men used to
manifest centuries ago when they took
automobiles and radios apart tin-
kered with them and put them back
together again so they did that to
comet and they did this to me

  breen shivered as he saw the eyes
of the head saw them moisten with
ghastly tears

  vail went on with a terrible smile

  so youve had your way breen
havent you

  what-what do you mean

  you sent me out there knowing
id be killed didnt you

 no-no-

  oh why bother to lie i cant
harm you now can i

  breen couldnt check a grin that
broke through that was true he
fingered his drug-gun there was no
danger in vail any more there was
instead a definite value breen
thought of calling in the scientists
all his fellow-workers and superiors
exhibiting vails head telling the
story conducting a research of the
processes that kept him alive bodiless
perhaps mastering the technique him-
self it was all simple chemistry
biology and surgery

  why not and meanwhile vails
possessions were his

  there were just a few things he
wanted to find out first he might as
well admit it

  i guess youre too clever for me
vail he chuckled its true i
didnt think youd come back but
there was nothing underhanded in my
sending you-i swear it you were
the best the bravest you had the en-
durance and im glad you made it
glad even in spite of your-accident
it was no accident as you call it
the droning laugh was mirthless
any more than it was an accident
that i came back

  yes i meant to ask about that
why did they let you go why did
they send you back

  because of their sense of humor
said vail they sent me back to kill
you

 kill me why breen was
shocked trembling unaccountably

  i told them the story told them
you sent me how they laughed at
me they psycho-analyzed you -
through me turned you inside out
they proved to me that you never
expected me to return that your mo-
tive was to steal my parabola warp
and my property do you deny it

the fool he knew breens
pudgy fingers tightened on the
drug-gun then he smiled he re-


startling stories

alized he had nothing to fear from
a mere bodiless head clamped to a
metal chair so they let you go he
whispered like this

  yes when i got over the shock
and saw the humor of it i told them
what a fine situation it would be
what a glorious joke the idea you
see appealed to their prime instinct
-their sense of humor thats why
they let me come back to kill you
now breen knew vail was mad
those eyes proved it

  sense of humor see breen you
didnt expect me seeing me like this
would startle you then make you con-
fident i was out of the way and id
talk to you tell you what masters
of surgery and chemistry these crea-
tures were how they could control
the body how they could make a cat
live without a head how they could
make a head live without a body how
they could keep a heart beating or
a leg moving without any other con-
trol than the proper wires and tubes
and i knew youd listen would be-
lieve me without guessing what i was
driving at and that i could kill you

  thats what ive been thinking
about a month is a long time to go
on this way living as i have looking
out into space and watching the chart
as i came back knowing what i was
remembering my agony-only one
thing kept me going the thought of
killing you i have acquired some of
their sense of humor now you see the
time has come for me to laugh

  you- breen spluttered you
cant kill me you cant move

  how did you think i got the ship
back through space whispered vail

my head directed it yes but brains
with all the hysteroan surgical cun-
ning cant make a ship steer by
thought alone

  what steered your ship breen
whispered

 the answer loomed suddenly be-
hind him a horrible answer that
gripped breens throat and pressed
and choked his life away while he
had been talking with vails head
vails great body had come silently
forward from the after part of the
ship functioning precisely like the
body of the cat and had seized him
the horrified controller stared at the
ghastly monstrosity with a silver cap
instead of a head on the neck stump-
a thing animated by the diabolic sur-
gery of a strange and runaway planet
-a hulking horror that was strangling
him to death   

 breen was almost dead when
through the roaring in his ears he
heard the head of martin vail laugh
at the same moment he felt one grop-
ing paw of the headless monstrosity
release his throat and slide down to
grip his right hand and start jerking
it up and down

  yes cackled the head of vail
a marvelous sense of humor we all
have it you sent me to my death
they cut off my head so i told them
id come back to earth on one condi-
tion-that theyd fix it so i could
shake hands with you again

  the laughter rose madly long after
breens life had ebbed away and in
the darkening cabin of the space ship
the headless body continued auto-
matically to pump breens dead hand

chemurgy and hydroponics

 editor science question box

 just what is the difference between these two new branches of science-chemurgy and
 hydroponics-d b little rock ark

  briefly chemurgys basic purpose is to ad-
 vance the use of farm materials in industry
 through three mediums-new uses for current
 crops new markets for wastes and by-prod-
 ucts and new crops for new or already es-
 tablished uses chemurgy deals with a science
 of the soil

  hydroponics on the other hand is the
method of crop production through the use of
a liquid medium hence the name hydro from
water

  shallow trays are filled with water re-
enforced with the required various nutri-
ent salts and a seedbed of vegetable matter
sometimes even excelsior is prepared on a

 wire netting just above the chemicalized
 water great strides have been made in this
 soilless sort of agriculture since  the
 heinz company had a splendid exhibit at the
 new york worlds fair  and  a
 series of tanks grow certain vegetables on
 the otherwise unarable wake island for the
 pacific clipper ships and many private in-
 dividuals have their own hydroponlcal gar-
 dens on roof tops

   contrary to popular belief this science is
 not new nutrient solutions having been used
 extensively to grow plants in experimental
 studies for the greater part of the past sev-
 enty-five years

            nonazite

editor science question box

what is monazite and how is it used-w m tucson ariz

  monazite is an ore produced from brasil
the dutch east indies and india it was
formerly in demand as a source of thorium
for the old-style incandescent gas mantles
falling gradually into disuse due to the ad-
vent and growth of electric lighting it has of

late years become of increased importance
by the use of thorium in radio tubes the
greatest output comes from travancore india
the united states imports an average of bet-
ter than a million pounds per year of this
substance

the electronic microscope

editor science question box

  how does the electronic microscope work-j j raleigh n c

  in this instrument a beam of high speed
electrons is used instead of ordinary light
the electrons being focused in suitable mag-
netic fields instead of the usual lenses with-
out going into a complicated discussion on
the construction of the instrument briefly it
works thus

  the smallest object which can be seen
through an ordinary microscopc must have
a length or size comparable to the wave
length of the light used down in the small-

 ness beyond this point light simply fails to
 reach with ordinary light this limjt is about
 three or four hundred thousandths of an inch
 electron waves are so much shorter than
 light waves that magnifications of twenty
 thousand diameters are possible and probably
 more

  this instrument promises to be a wonder-
 ful boon in the future study of filterable
 viruses the structure of bacteria the com-
 position of metals etc

size of the earth

editor science question box

how did the ancients compute the size and weight of the earth-s j l peoria 

  there were doubtless several ingenious
 methods employed the ancients proving quite
 adroit without the use of the modern pre-
 cision scientific instruments one method em-
 ployed by an early greek philosopher was to
 start with the premise that earth was a
 sphere next he imagined a line girdling its
 surface on the order of our present equator
 save that it passed through two cities on the
 same meridian or whose latitudes and longi-
 tudes were known to him thanks to tax col-
 lectors who meticulously measured every mile

 ho knew the precise distance between the two
 towns computing the curvature of the earth
 for this distance y checking meridian shad-
 ows with the sun he had the scant arc of a
 section of his imaginary line by simple geo-
 metric formulae he computed the lino to be
 approximately twenty-five thousand miles
 long and thus worked out the volume of the
 sphere

  true he was wrong by miles and thousands
 of tons but it is remarkable how narrow was
 his margin of error

record of their departments for the past
month and the emperor praised them all
for what they had done especially did he
give credit to the royal mathematician the
royal engineer and the royal geographer
for these three men separately and in uni-
son presented the plans they had prepared
for the destruction of the land of mo that
great kingdom of the south which dared
to dispute with gobi the supremacy of the
world

the emperor of gobi had issued orders
that mo must not only be conquered but
actually destroyed and for months the
three wise men in charge of these depart-
ments of mathematics engineering and
geography had studied over the problem
now they had a plan-a good plan and at
the end of it mo would be no more

  there was one flaw in the beauty of the
plan namely the time needed to accom-
plish it tunnels had to be dug under the
sea and beneath the great gulfs of water
separation had to be made of mo from
gobi even though all of the slaves and all
the machinery and the great skill of gobi
were put to work many years would pass
before the desired end would be accom-
plished

  so the face of the emperor darkened
he was now passing his fifty-ninth birth-
day and he knew that ere thirty more years
faded away he and his seven wise men
and all who had helped him make gobi
great would be worm food and dust in their
golden coffins or else so old that their
greatest worry would be the dragging of
decrepit bodies through another day
of all his illustrious fathers but one thing
remained certain that was that they lived
a while and then died

  thinking thus his face grew hard and
sad and he chewed the end of his mus-
tache in such a way as to make the royal
barber tremble finally he cried

  all of your plans are folly and your
thoughts foolish vanity for who of us will
be here to see this ending of our enemy
thirty years from now what comfort
if a few of us live yet lack the mental
power to glory in our triumph give us
youth take away from us the weight of
the years gone by and there would be satis-
faction in the perfecting of your plans

  give me youth take from my shoul-
ders the weight of years from my head the
whitened hair from my face the little
wrinkles fateful handwriting of time the
conqueror then you can destroy mo
which of you seven wise men can make
a man young

  silent the seven looked at each other
fiddling their fingers and toying nervously
with the dragonian rings emblem of the
immortality that they believed in but

a turn of the screw would loosen the compressed air the pressure of which would raise the
map thirty feet into the air as the map would rise so would all of gobi

lacked the dragon swallowing his tail
in the never-ending ever-beginning symbol
of fadeless youth made the golden ring
sacred to the seven and to their emperor
who had a like ring-carved from a single
garnet while theirs were only gold

  then the ruler from his throne com-
manded that seven of his slaves be brought
in these he had his chief executioner
kill in seven various ways by the silken
cord decapitation the bleeding from the
wrists the pouring of molten lead in the
ear the golden needle stuck slowly past
the eyeball the placing of one drop of poi-
son on the tongue and finally the frightful
death by command wherein the mighty
ruler orders that the man die and he dies
from fear of being disobedient

 when the seven dead bodies of the
slaves lay stretched on the floor of the
palace the emperor rose and whispered

  i can give death but i cannot make
myself live on till i see the ending of
mo seven wise men am i ruler

  the seven bowed low before him

  then pay attention meet me in three
months and at that time tell me how to
prolong my life tenfold so i can glory
in the conquering of the country that i
hate so much do this or i shall kill the
seven wise men and other men will take
their dragonian rings and the manner of
your death shall not be as easy as was that
of these seven slaves you shall be weeks
in the ending of life and all that time
you shall have due cause to reflect over
your lack of intellect in that you could
not make me live on long enough to glory
in the fall of mo you are all wise men
and you have worked well for the land of
gobi but all of your wisdom will not
suffice unless you give this immortality to
me

bowing their heads they withdrew
from his presence stepping aside so
that their silken robes should not touch the
dead bodies of those who had died to teach

for scicntifactions hall of fame


them how they could go on living

  other slaves came and removed the car-
rion and the nobles left the great hall
at the last only the emperor sat there
he rang a gong and at that summons came
the high priest a man who knew all the
wisdom of the gods and what he did not
know he would not admit

  the emperor permitted him to sit near
him

  tell me again norazus the emperor
asked about the dragon whose ring i
wear

  this dragon lives far to the north of
gobi the high priest began he lives
perpetually with his tail in his mouth thus
never reaching either an ending or a begin-
ning but going in a circle which is an
emblem of eternity of immortal life yet
is he nothing like everlasting for every
seventh year he lays seven eggs in the sands
of the desert

  of these seven he selects one which he
swallows hatching it out in the heat of his
stomach when it ripens the new dragon
eats the old one and emerges from his in-
ner gut but his body is the soul of the old
dragon and in his head the wisdom of the
ages and thus is the life of the dragon
renewed every seven years by means of a
new body but the skin of the old dragon
lies dried and bloodless on the ever-shift-
ing sand

  a pretty tale norazus but is it true
the two men looked at each other then
the priest whispered

  what if i showed you eggs of the dra-
gon some of the six that he discards and
leaves to turn to stone

 eggs or stone what boots it how
can you tell the dragon egg from the giant
auk or the dodo or other birds that my
wise men prate of

  some things must be taken on faith
what is that a bubble for children
we are wise i wear this dragon ring be-
cause it is the emblem of power my father
and his before him wore this ring but we
must seek elsewhere for life everlasting
the dragon may know how to renew him-
self but we cannot use his power

  have you benefited from the daily blood
of a new-born child

  not much in fact i fear it has harmed
my appetite the meals are not as good as
they were before i took this tonic sev-
eral times i have belched making neces-
sary the death of my cook

  no norazus let us wait till the seven
wise men report on their method of pro-
longing life whatever they devise i will
share with you and with theq but we
shall never learn the secret of the drag-
on or of the salamander or of the phoenix
who buildeth a fire for a new life through
the burning of the old body not in such
forms must we seek added years and i
must live to see the ending of mo

  at that time there were three great em-
pires in the world atlantis occupied all
of the land west of ireland an island reach-
ing far west till from its furthermost
shores the coast of america showed as a
purple haze on the horizon from this
country went emigrants to egypt greece

and other lands of the barbarians border-
ing on the great sea

  the empire of mo filled in all the great
waste that is now covered by the waves
of the pacific to the west it was sep-
arated from asia by three hundred miles
of water but on its eastern borders it was
almost in touch with central america
it had colonies all through north and
south america the largest of these being
in central america some of these colo-
nies were commercial others were to
spread the service of the all-good-
god whom they worshiped diligently
and one in the valley of the colorado
river where arizona now stands was in-
tended for a city of refuge if at some
future time as the dismal priests believed
all of mo should be destroyed

  the third great empire was gobi this
kingdom occupied all of asia at that time
a low land covered with fertile plains and
dark forests there were little rolling hills
but the himalayas still slumbered unborn
in the womb of the earth

  of these three countries one gave before
its destruction of its learning to egypt
which in turn made the culture of greece
possible mo most brilliant of all three as
far as learning was concerned died so
quickly that nothing remained save a dim
memory in the places where once her people
had ruled in their might while gobi shat-
tered by a grim cataclysm managed to live
on in the cold country of thibet

 the three lands died together man
lived forced by circumstance to forget
all that these countries ever knew and
had to learn it all over again gradu-
ally humanity rose again in the scale of
civilization and by the time fourteen thou-
sand years had passed man had relearned
perhaps half of what he knew before he had
destroyed the three fairest empires the
world had ever seen

ii

at the end of three months the great
men of gobi met again but this time
no plenteous splendor marked their gath-
ering secretly they met by night in the
bowels of the earth many feet under the
palace in a room that only a few of each
generation knew of and which none ever
dared to name above a whisper it was a
room of black marble

  around the walls were nine dragons of
red stone and from their eyes came a glow
that lit the room in the belly of each
dragon was a seat thus there was a seat
for the emperor and one for each of the
seven wise men and one for the high
priest on the floor sat a blond man of
about thirty his eyes were blue his hair
flaxen and there was an unafraid look on
his face for on him there were neither
bonds nor fetters

 the chief of the navy of gobi began
the tale of the stranger

  ohf most illustrious emperor repre-
sentative of the dragon in human form and
wearer of the ring when you commanded
us to find for you the secret of longevity
if not that of immortality each of us went
his varied way to find the answer to your
command to me came the inspiration to
search the sea between our land and mo
in the hope that among the prisoners whom
i might capture there would be a man
learned in the art and sciences of the cursed
country of our enemies in order to ex-
amine those whom we captured i took in
our fleet one of our learned men and other
men skilled in obtaining the truth from
such persons no matter how unwilling
they are to disclose it

  we cruised for some weeks and took
several vessels which had sailed too far
from mo for their safety of those whom
we captured we killed the most either as
ignorant folk or else stubborn ones who
died when the tormentors began work on
them however we were fortunate in ob-
taining one of their physicians who when
he found what we wanted claimed the
power to lengthen life this man you
see here if his ability is equal to his
boasts can prolong the life of your high-
ness

  the emperor looked thoughtfully into
the face of the young man after a long
pause he asked

 have any of you seven wise men
questioned him to find wherein his power
to prolong life lies

  we have done so your highness re-
plied the royal physician he who knew
more about the healing arts than any
other man in the realm i talked over
the matter with him his method has all
the elements of philosophical truth in it
but will it really work to the lengthen-
ing of life

  that cannot be said without a trial

  again silence filled with suspense cov-
ered those in the mystic room the sacred
hall of the dragons and then the em-
peror asked the young man

  are you a man from the land of mo
  no i come from far away atlantis
  how came you in a ship of mo

  years ago as a child i was taken pris-
oner from my home since then i have
lived in mo they found in me astonish-
ing aptitude for drugs and magical heal-
ings so they taught me all they knew of
all the young men in their college of medi-
cine none learned more than i when
i was taken by your ship i was voyaging
to a far land to heal a mighty man of his
disease

  so you have no tie of love for mo

  why should i they killed my family
and took me from the home of my child-
hood

  would you stay with us

  one place now is as good as another
since i cannot be a free man

  suppose i make you free give you a
place at my right hand

  it would all depend on what was in
your right hand answered the young
physician sagely i have been in the pres-
ence of the king of mo and i have seen
mighty ones sit at his right hand and die
there from poisoned wine and the silken
cord around their neck

  the emperor frowned for even so did
great men die in gobi



  can you make me live beyond the age
of common men he finally asked in his
words a great longing for years sufficient
to see the ending of mo

  i can

 how

the young man eased himself on the
floor and then spoke his answer

  the life of the working bee is six
weeks it works that long and then it
dies mo is full of flowers and the bee is
there a sacred insect for centuries the
royal bee-keepers have studied the habits
and manners and diseases of these bees in
the royal hives so they know that the
working bees live six weeks but the
queen bee lives for five and sometimes
six years and all those years she is lively
and full of vigor and does her work in the
world of bees with a healthy constitution

  long years ago this difference was
seen in the relative age of these bees and
the men who worked with the bees tried
to lengthen the lives of the workers so that
more honey could be produced but no
one was able to tell why one bee lived six
weeks and another five years then i was
told of the question and how the wise
men had failed to solve it i worked on
the matter and now i know the queen
lives long as a result of the food she eats
from the time she first crawls from the
broken egg shell

  this feed the queen-jelly has in it the
element of immortality i think if she
were protected from the younger queens
she would never die but the time comes
when she is killed perhaps that is best
for the hive but at least she lives a life
nearly two and fifty times as long as the
existence of the working bee who eats
what he can and when he can and dies after
six weeks of toil

  would such food work on a man the
emperor of gobi demanded

  i think so

  but how could it be made in quantities
to keep a man alive we have no bees in
gobi and if we had it wokld take large
numbers of hives to make a meal for a
man

  when i studied this queen-jelly i made
thereof an analysis and learned its various
components their amounts and the formula
of the making i can take the blood of a
bull the fat of geese the oil of the turtle
and the flesh of certain fish and by a way
that i know of i can make a food in
abundance that will do even as the food
of the hive this food i have tried with
creeping things flying things and little
mice and all of them thrive t it and their
life appears to be greatly lengthened

  this i can make here in gobi if i have
a place to work and dishes of glass and of
gold and all the parts of the formula
brought to me i will make the food
some of it i will flavor and serve solid
others will seem like wine with the per-
fume of the vine and the poppy in every
way your thirst and your hunger shall
be satisfied but this food only shall you
eat and drink and nothing else

  you shall have what you need to work
with swore the emperor with a horrible
oath i shall eat and drink of the food and
so shall these seven wise men this high
priest and you we ten will eat and drink
of this food that we may live to see the end-
ing of mo and the destruction of our enemy
because of this thing you shall have great
honor and shall sit at my right hand where
all the people shall reverence you you
shall be the child of my old age and the
ten of us shall one day gather here in this
sacred place to hear of the ending of mo

  and now you seven wise men harken
unto me and do as i command for even
though your bellies are filled with this
bee food yet can your throats be cut as
easily as ever give this physicker all
he demands satisfy his every desire aid
him in every way do this first after
that use all your power for the hastening
of the destruction of mo for life will be
tiresome to me so long as they rule in
splendor over the south seas and deny
me the right to levy taxes and take tribute
from them

  the meeting came to an end and all of
the seven went and worshiped their spe-
cial gods because a way had been found
to prolong their lords life and thus permit
them to live longer with their sons and
their wives

neracles the wise young physician
from mo was given a place of his own
with special rooms to work in and others
to live in all the wealth and wisdom of
gobi went to aid him in his work as-
signed to help him were certain young men
who labored for him as he commanded
but the final preparation of the food was
done in secret

  at the ending of the third month the
first supply of the food was made and ready
to feed the ten who were appointed to eat
of it in every way it was delicate and de-
licious and dainty in its taste and smell
and in the pleasure that it gave to the
tongue and the palate the emperor was
pleased and sent a dozen dancing girls to
heracles as a present each girl bearing
on her body jewels that would have served
as a kings ransom heracles put the
jewels in a safe place and the girls in his
harem and promptly forgot about both
for he was engaged in a mighty work

  thenceforth the emperor and the seven
wise men and priest ate all their meals
together after he found that the food was
healthful and not in any way poison the
emperor would at times excuse the young
physician from attending at meat with the
others knowing how hard he was working
to prepare food for all of them

ill

meantime the wealth and manpower
of gobi was working as it had never
done before to the north and west lay
the kingdom of gobi while to the south
and east for more miles than man could
measure was the beautiful land of mo
sixty million men and women of power
lived in that land besides untold slaves
and common folk between the two lands

rolled three hundred miles of ocean

  neither country could transport armies
large enough to conquer the other hence
each grew in greatness and wealth and
hatred of its neighbor they knew of
atlantis the third kingdom but that land
gave neither of them concern for her
ways were peaceful and her ambitions more
in the conquest of art than of other na-
tions

  gobi determined to destroy mo

  mo brooded over the ending of gobi

  each used all the skill and energy and
determination it possessed toward the ac-
complishment of this purpose and while
each had a partial idea of the plans of the
other they both laughed at their own im-
pending danger because it seemed so fan-
tastic

  the plan that gobi was working out was
simple and yet gigantic in its scope it
was nothing more or less than to blow her
enemy to pieces tradition and the ancient
wise men whispered of large caverns under
the land of mo huge reservoirs ten miles
under the surface of the land that were
filled with explosive and inflammable gases

  it was believed that the entire land of
mo rested on a thin crust of earth beneath
which were vast caverns and tremendous
open spaces filled only with threats and
sullen murmurings from the hidden fires
that lived silently so many miles below mo
was existing on a living hell unconscious
of her danger she laughed and sang and
loved while beneath her a scarlet doom
waited with endless patience the signal for
its release

  this was the way the land of mo was
built and on this fact the seven wise men
of gobi formed all their hopes their plan
was to tunnel under the three hundred
miles of ocean and then from that tunnel
dig twenty-six side tunnels till the land of
mo was burrowed under even as a mole
works in a garden after worms

  at the tunnel ends deep shafts were to
be sunk until the heat of the pit made it
impossible to work longer and in these pits
powder was to be put not just pounds or
yet tons but all of each of the twenty-seven
vast pits were to be filled with explosive
and the lateral tunnels were also to be filled
and even part of the tunnel under the sea

  and this powder was not the mild kind
made of saltpeter but was of a power so
great in its might that even the men of gobi
dreaded it no greater punishment could be
given a criminal than to be sentenced to
work in the houses where it was made

  all the dirt from these tunnels had to be
carried back to the mouth of the tunnel in
the land of gobi and there it was piled in
long rows the mountains thus made are
still to be seen in parts of asia

  the finishing of this tunnel and the plac-
ing of the powder would take thirty years
but the actual exploding of the powder
would be but the time of the taking of a
deep breath though it would be a day be-
fore the most distant charges exploded
such was the great distance to the far parts
of the land

  only a part of the destruction would be
accomplished by the powders exploding
the flames from this would light the large
caverns of lethal gases and these would
explode and blast holes in the very pits of
bottomless despair and from these would
come the fire of hell and what that fire
would do to the hated land of mo could
hardly be guessed at

bart of this plan had reached mo
through its secret spy system but it was
so fantastic so peculiarly impossible in its
greatness that little attention was paid to
it besides the inhabitants knew that it
would take years for gobi to dig such tun-
nels under their land and reach the far
corners of their kingdom and before that
time had come they had a very pleasant
surprise to hand to gobi this would give
the wise men of that land plenty to worry
about besides spending an eternity of years
digging useless tunnels under the sea

  for there were also wise men in mo
perhaps their wise men were possessed of
more wisdom than the seven wise men of
gobi though at the present when fourteen
thousand years have passed since both
lands died and lost their wisdom it is hard
to evaluate so delicate a matter as the in-
telligence of a nation however what hap-
pened nearly confirmed the boast of mo
that they would win a victory over their
enemies before those enemies could come
to an end of their tunnel

  now it is an interesting fact that the
men of gobi knew of the plans of mo just
as the men of mo knew of the plans of gobi
each had a partial idea of how the enemy
was going to attack and each felt that the
schemes of the other were impracticable
and foolish the seven wise men made a
special report to the emperor of gobi that
mo would try to destroy them but that the
method was an impossible one and opposed
to all the known laws of nature

  to be brief mo intended to have the laws
of gravity set aside for a brief period over
the entire land of gobi with the result that
the land no longer held down by gravity or
the weight of the atmosphere would leap
into the air freezing the entire kingdom
miles above the ocean in an atmosphere of
bitter cold where pleasure would cease and
men would be so occupied with fighting the
winter that no time or energy would remain
for the pursuit of pleasure or the softer
recreations of life

  the people of gobi would then have
neither time nor energy for building tunnels
to destroy mo if they remained in their
own elevated land they would have to fight
the cold if they left it they would have to
fight the barbarians meantime the gentle-
folk of mo would continue to live in pleas-
ure and a warm place upder the tropical
sun

  thus each country lived in what proved
to be a fools paradise

  however the emperor of mo had built
in the far east a special retreat and a place
of refuge there he and his rich men and
their wives went for six months every year
when the summer sun was the warmest in
mo many centuries before it had been
foretold that when mo was destroyed it
would be during the period of intense heat

thus for several decades now the chosen
few protected themselves against such a
fate even though they laughingly told each
other that it was impossible

  the plans of the wise men of mo were
not as fantastic as might be imagined
even today in our dense ignorance there
are east indians who can suspend them-
selves in the air in absolute defiance of the
laws of gravitation if a man can do this
now in our dark ages why should not a
field or a forest be made to do the same at
that time when men knew many things of
which we are now ignorant

  heracles had come to gobi by no acci-
dent his capture was simply a part of
the plans of the conspirators of mo had
he not been captured on shipboard he would
have come to gobi anyway his ability
to make the life-prolonging bee jelly was
just a happy incident but at the same time
such was the wisdom of this young man that
had almost anything else been asked of
him he would have been able to give a
satisfactory answer

  he had come to gobi to lift that unhappy
country three miles or more into the air
his making of the bee food simply made it
easier for him to carry out his plans now
as the trusted friend of the emperor as
the man who was making his royal food
he had full access to every part of the
kingdom of gobi

how he obtained his results cannot even
be guessed at if any wise man of
today duplicated his experiment there
would be no similar result so it must be
true that this man of mo knew something
the scientists of today do not know all
that heracles did was to set aside a room
into which no one came but himself

  in that room he built with his own hands
a table on four squat legs the top of the
table near the floor the legs were tele-
scoped so that when air was released into
them from a pressure tank the table slowly
rose into the air till it came near the ceil-
ing of the high room

  on the top of this table heracles built
out of sand and stone and little painted
pieces of wood a scaled relief map of the
empire of gobi when the time came he
intended to raise the table and even as the
table rose in the air so would the entire
land of his enemies rise in proportion

  the plan was perfect and yet at the
very end a little thing destroyed the per-
fect consummation of it allowing matters
to end as they did

  to select this room secretly build the
table and the tank and the apparatus for
compressing the air and to make a per-
fect duplicate of the kingdom of gobi on
the top of the table took time even in
his moments of greatest fancied security
heracles could not relax his caution one
moment every piece of wood and metal
had to be carried into the room under his
flowing robes at the dead of night at
times a year passed without his being
able even to enter the room for often
the emperor insisted on trips of inspection
to the far corners of the kingdom on
these trips he was careful to see that the
seven wise men and the priest and the
physician accompanied him

  meantime the years passed the special
food the nourishment of queen bees that
was the only nutriment of the emperor and
the wise men was working admirably in
every way the emperor was not only
retaining his original age he seemed to be
growing younger it was rumored that the
high priest who had been nearly ninety
at the beginning of the experiment had
become a father through the aid of one of
the ladies of the temple there was no
doubt about the rejuvenating value of the
food

  thirty years passed

  these years had not been idle thou-
sands of men worked to destroy mo while
only one man patiently worked to destroy
gobi meantime the emperor of mo
spent more and more time in his special
retreat under the mountains of arizona

  in a royal trireme he would sail east
till he came to the mouth of a large river
the one that is now called the colorado
up this he would sail to a harbor from
which place the royal elephants would
carry him and his escorts to the mouth
of a tunnel there he changed to litters
carried on the shoulders of slaves and for
twenty-seven miles under the massive
mountains the slaves would walk on a pave-
ment of red sandstone through a tunnel illu-
mined by the torches of marble slaves who

atiently stood in almost endless rows
he light from their torches never varied
and was cold since then the secret of cold
light has never been re-discovered

  at the end of the twenty-seven miles
there came an end to the tunnel and there
in a natural crater was built the splendid
royal city it was a small place there
being room at most for a hundred of the
nobility and their servants but in that
little city was the wealth of the land of
mo for seven hundred years each em-
peror had carried there his finest treasures
and left them there such was the place
in which the great men of mo waited for
the prophecy to come true from there
after six months they returned to mo glad
that another year of safety had passed over
them

iv

yearly and half yearly heracles sent
messages to the kings councilors at
the capital of mo reporting his own prog-
ress and warning of the dangers that threat-
ened mo but to these warnings little at-
tention was given while the certainty of
the destruction of gobi was fully believed
and occasioned much joy

  finally at a meeting of the wise men
of gobi and the emperor the time for
finishing of the tunnels and the exploding
of the powder was determined and it was
announced that in one year this would take
place this announcement filled heracles
with boundless determination to finish his
work thus preventing destruction of mo
by first hoisting gobi into an eternity of
cold and snow of the work that he was
doing little now remained unfinished one

or two more nights would see an ending
of the preparation and then gobi would
be destroyed

  but not at once

  heracles was not content with simple
destruction the years of study and the
sacrifice of a lifetime among strangers had
filled him with the determination for a
deeper and more terrible venegance than
simply the freezing of his enemies for
thirty years he had plotted this vengeance
for all those years he had studied and
planned and experimented and now he
was prepared to begin a deed that would
strike terror to all the people in after
years when it became known it would
place the name of heracles the physician
of mo among the names of the great of
the whole earth

  during these thirty years he had con-
tinuously fed the emperor and his seven
wise men and the high priest years of
wonderful health boundless vitality and
splendid vigor gave these men the greatest
confidence in the honesty and integrity of
the man who fed them now heracles
with their fate in his hands prepared for
them a future so different from what they
had expected that not even their wildest
dreams could have anticipated it

  in preparation for this fate he held a
long secret converse with the emperor
warning him of the danger of the explo-
sions that they were going to make once
the bowels of the earth were teased till
they vomited fire it was hard to tell where
the trouble would end would it not be
best to prepare the hall of the dragons
with beds and food and all necessary lux-
uries and retire there with his wise men
before the electric spark was fired would
it not be wise to have the wires run into
the hall of the dragon so that the em-
peror himself could have the joy of per-
sonally pressing the golden button thus
all by himself have the satisfaction of
blowing the hell of the bottomless pits
into the faces of his enemies of mo

  the emperor was delighted with the
plan he agreed to all that was sug-
gested he even went further and ar-
ranged for a month of entertainment in the
hall of the dragon consisting of feasting
amusements and the delightful killing of
slaves in strange and unusual ways he
gave orders that for all that month he and
his seven wise men and the priest and a
few of the more select nobles should lie
on golden couches on pads of goose feath-
ers covered with fine velvets and silks
there they would drink the wine and eat
the bee-food that their friend heracles
prepared for them when the time came
the golden button would be pressed and
mo would be destroyed when it was safe
they would go to the seashore and sail over
the land of their enemies to see for them-
selves the deadly fate that their energy
and hatred had prepared for them

  now all was to the liking of heracles
a month of drunkenness during which he
would work out his final plans then on
the day before the pressing of the button
gobi would slowly move into the air-and
what cared heracles how long the em-
peror of gobi and his advisers liyed so
long as they lived the life that he prepared
for them

thus at the beginning of the debauch
heracles changed the food it tasted
and had the fragrance of the former food
and wine and it still contained large
amounts of the bee-jelly but in addition
there was opium to lull their senses and
allay their suspicion hyoscine to make
their dreams more pleasant and finally a
secret compound made from the internal
glands of actual men and women collected
carefully during all these years from the
bodies of slaves and criminals condemned
to death

  this medicine given in proper doses
melted the bones of those who took it so
that finally they became boneless bags of
skin and fat within which bags they lived
and thought but could not move simply
lying where they were placed till someone
placed them in a different shape

  men in their normal minds would know
of the changes taking place in their bones
men walking or taking exercise would
have fractures and strange changes in their
shape due to the gradual weakening and
bending of their long bones but men
who lay in a long drunk for a month dull
with opium and pleasured with drug
dreams would gradually weaken and be-
come helpless without knowing what was
happening to them

  this was the final revenge of heracles
to turn these men into boneless horrors
men without skeletons jelly fishes of hu-
manity helpless in their despairing terror
-and they would not diel that was the
beauty of it-that they would live on for-
ever like the queen bee in their system
was food sufficiently concentrated and pow-
erful to keep them alive a thousand years
yet what would such a life mean to
them

  heracles in his joy visioned these
helpless men in the hall of the dragons
levitated thousands of feet into the air he
saw them living in a palace cold and cheer-
less with the damp of doom at noonday
turned into a freezing living death of cold
as soon as the weakened sun dropped be-
hind the western mountains there they
would live perhaps worshipped and cared
for as gods by a few shivering moun-
taineers perhaps neglected and forgotten
but no matter what happened they would
never die that was the beauty of it-
the fact that they would keep on living

  he was going to send them up up up
in the air so high that there would be no
wolves to tear their boneless bodies and so
cold that no flies would larvate in their
helpless nostrils perhaps for a year or
so he would visit them and talk over mat-
ters with them he might even induce
the emperor of mo to come on an excur-
sion and see for himself the fate that bad
come to those who had plotted the destruc-
tion of mo

  the entertainment began and the em-
peror of gobi was happy in that he had
such a wise physician such a long life
ahead of him such a fine ending to mo

such lovely women and a skillful high exe-
cutioner who could think of so many new
and novel ways of killing men slowly they
laughed and loved and drank and stupidly
thrilled over the slaves who died in front
of them for their entertainment not once
realizing that their bones were slowly be-
ing dissolved within them

  across the hall of the dragons heracles
had his seat of honor he only of all those
in the hall could come and go for the em-
peror had given command that of all who
came into the hall at the onset of the
month none should leave it till the golden
button was pressed none that is except
the dead slaves and those who killed them
and heracles sat there day after day see-
ing his enemies weaken from the disease
now known as osteomalacia but the
queens and those servants who were
shapely enough to comfort the emperor
by serving as pillows for him and his wise
men and the dancing girls were spared the
disease they simply lived on in a phantas-
magoria thinking that the growing inca-
pacity of the emperor and the other great
men was simply the raction born of surfeit
and drunkenness

n the twenty-eighth day when
heracles knew that all of his plans
were ready he lessened the dose of the
opium and thus allowed the drugged men
to come alertly to their senses preparing
food and wine in abundance he left the hall
of the dragons cautioning the guards to
let no one in or out he retired to his palace
there to finish the destruction of the hated
country

  when he had shut barred and double-
locked the room in his castle wherein stood
the table with the map of gobi on it- he
had everything in readiness for the debacle
the tank was full of compressed air from
it tubes ran to the hollow of each the four
telescopic legs the joints of these legs
had been carefully oiled with grease ob-
tained by boiling the fat of bodies of slaves
on the table was the finished map perfect
in every detail a turn of the screw would
loosen the compressed air the pressure
of which would raise the map thirty feet
into the air as the map would rise so
would all of gobi

  the secret of such scientific magic is
now lost to mankind but this much we
know the pressure of the air in each of
these little tubes was by his device mul-
tiplied billion-fold by a force under the sur-
face of gobi aided by powerful volcanic
gases when the table was lifted the force
of the gases under gobi proportionately
great lifted the country

  heracles now turned on the screw and
there was a hiss of air nothing happened

  for a very little and unexpected some-
thing had taken place during the twenty-
eight days the chamber had been tenant-
less a hungry mouse had wandered into
the room and foj some reason had taken a
fgncy to the taste of the fiber tubes through
which the air parsed the rodent had eaten
through the tubes in many places little
holes hardly to be seen but large enough to
permit the leakage of air


  heracles foi all his wisdom had not
been able to foresee this mouse now
with but two days at his command the
entire plan was ruined unless he could re-
pair the tubes it was useless to try and
make new ones there was nothing else
to do except work this he did tire-
lessly and persistently repairing hole after
hole but even with all his ability the
main tube remained weak and not fully
worthy of trust when the full pressure
of air was turned into it it still leaked so
that it was insufficient to raise the table

  heracles spent more precious hours re-
filling the tank with compressed air and
then he did the only thing he could do he
took part of the map oft the table to lighten
the load thus all of the map represent-
ing what is now southern china burmah
and the lower part of india was removed
and shared no part in the cataclysm that
befell the rest of gobi

  finally all was ready yet in this delay
many valuable hours had been wasted and
heracles stood there swaying from fatigue
and nervous tire and worry beneath his
hand the screw that turning would de-
stroy gobi

  suddenly he heard a dull roar and then
another and another like a distant thunder
storm and he sickened for he knew that
he had waited too long

  there being nothing to do he turned the
screw and sent the full force of air into
the legs of the table it worked and up
went the map of gobi into the air but one
leg was weaker than the rest the table
rose unevenly and there was some sliding
and slithering of the earth forming the
map

  heracles felt himself moving slowly as
the palace he was in also went up because
all of the land under it was in upward mo-
tion it was a slow movement and hard
to realize in this central part of gobi with
all of the land for thousands of square
miles around going upward in perfect har-
mony there was no way in this part of
the country to detect the extent of the
movement save by the gradual increase
in the coldness of the air

heracles knew that his experiment
had been a success

  yet from far away there came the
rolling thunder with a sickening sense
of failure he knew that he had been a
little late and that already mo was sinking
under the tormented waves of the great
ocean

  sighing he put on heavy furs that he
had prepared against this hour and walked
slowly through the deserted streets of the
great city here and there a small house
had fallen but all of the royal palaces re-
mained as they had been for the most
part the people accustomed to a semi-
tropical climate were seeking warmth in
ther houses thus the streets were de-
serted

  on the great physician went past the
royal palace and on to the hall of the
dragons there he found the guards on
duty but almost numb from the cold with
pity in his heart he bade them seek warmth

if they could find it then he went into
the inner hall of the dragons where he
knew that helpless lay the emperor of
gobi with his seven wise men and his
high priest perhaps with them would be
a few of the queens but of this he was in
doubt

  while heracles had been working in al-
most a frenzy to repair the air tube the
emperor and his advisers had slowly re-
gained their normal senses almost dazed
it was hard for them to realize what had
happened to them but one thing they knew
and that was the useless state of their
bodies a strange sense of helplessness
overcame them and all efforts to move
but resulted in a peculiar writhing and a
sad changing in their shape with no pro-
gression

 the emperor was no fool while un-
able to know what had really happened
to him he had no difficulty in determining
who was at the bottom of it only one
man in all gobi could work such a wonder
as the dissolving of a mans bones in his
body he looked and saw that he was
being supported on cushions held by his
favorite wife

  not daring to speak he made signs with
his eyes that he should be lifted up a little
she raised him slowly for the sudden bend-
ing of what had been his backbone caused
fearful pains to shoot through him nearly
killing him with the dreadful agony

 the woman wiped the sweat from his
face and he looked around him there
on the divans he saw the men who had
been his counselors they lay in odd
shapes like leather bags full of thin sau-
sage and on the faces of all of them was
a hell of despair knowing not what had
come over them they knew that they
could not move and were growing cold
and realized that they could not die

  one by one the women took the gold and
the silver and the precious gems and fled
from the accursed place only one re-
mained she held the head of the em-
peror and tried to ease him of his pain
for she was his favorite wife and was
going to bear him a son

 the emperor tried to remember what
it was all about and how he had come
to this depth of trouble he recalled his
bitter hate and knew that mo still re-
mained undestroyed he breathed harshly
and his woman put her pink shell near his
mouth with a great effort he told her
to press the golden button this she did

 thus mo was destroyed by the dainty
fingers of a slave woman who had no
name and was simply there and faithful
to the emperor

 as the room grew colder the women
gathered the rugs and silken sheets and
wrapped each jelly fish of a man up as
warmly as she could but the warmest
things she put around the emperor there
the nine lay boneless and unable to die
and the breath from their nostrils con-
gealed like steam in the frosty air

  thus heracles found them

 he sat down by the emperor and told
the story of what he had done and how
he had planned that his enemies should
live on for centuries filled with the long
life of the bee-jelly and boneless because
of the gland-juice that he had given them
the emperor heard it all soundless and
motionless but in his eyes was a look of
hatred that only a great man can devise
and in his heart was a deep content for
he knew from the rolling thunder that mo
was destroyed

flmt o was being blown to pieces the
-a-- damage done by thousands of tons
of powder was only a small part of the harm
done to that fair land the buried gases
exploding tore the deep rocks into a mil-
lion fragments and all over mo volcanoes
burst into activity tidal waves over-
flowed the land lava buried it sixty mil-
lion people were drowned burned or suf-
focated with the poisonous fumes

  a continent was destroyed leaving scat-
tered islands as small fragments-borneo
on one side and the easter islands on the
other australia to the south was formed
arid cheerless a fit home for bushmen
some of the citizens of mo survived on
the mountain peaks hurled upward as in
the hawaiian group but their culture
temples wealth and even their tradition
were hopelessly lost

  the emperor of mo with his favorite
wives and nobles was feasting in the
small city of refuge the shock of the
cataclysm reached them even in that far
rock-bound enclosure they feasted on
each man and woman pretending to his
neighbors at the banquet table that the
sound was thunder

  the banquet passed on through the
night and the next day a breathless mes-
senger arrived with the news that could
only be given to the emperor this news
was whispered in the royal ear as the
great man sat at the head of the table
he shivering commanded a certain wine
to be served and ordered in all seriousness
that a health be drunk to their beloved land
of mo all of the great men and their
lovely women drank of this wine and then
sat down and died their servants fled in
terror to press on into the desert where
they died in various ways

fourteen thousand years later three
prospectors typical desert rats of
arizona prospected for gold near the colo-
rado river one day while working in a
twenty-nine foot shaft one of them drove
his pick through the roof of what seemed
to be an abandoned mine shaft it was
paved with square beveled stones fastened
together with cement these stones had
the appearance of great age

  descending into this shaft with torches
they followed it for twenty miles and
came to a buried city there they found
many old buildings one of which con-
tained a circular chamber it was a large
table of marble around which sat the dead
bodies of seventy-two persons all over
six feet tall with blue eyes and white
skin and the flesh was white and firm
being preserved in some wonderful man-
ner on these bodies was jewelry but
most of the clothing had fallen into dust

 in another large room were the dead
bodies of over two hundred women who
looked as though they had been lovely in
their day

  throughout the city there were peculiar
trap doors and all kinds of interesting
levers and mechanisms the use of which
was hard to determine

  taking a lot of the jewelry with them
they sought civilization to secure help in
the exploration of the city when they re-
turned they found a freshet of the colorado
had covered the opening of the tunnel with
sand and they were unable to re-locate
it

hus died the great land of mo

  the fair country of atlantis had no
enemies it lived only for pleasure and
art from ireland to the shores of america
it lay in the sunshine then one day a
great continent across the globe was de-
stroyed a terrific shifting of balance
of weight took place large tidal waves
rolled from one sea to the other and sud-
denly the continent of atlantis was swal-
lowed up by the water of the atlantic
ocean thus a kindly lovable people
paid the price of the hatred between two
nations that they had never harmed so
perished the second of these great lands

 where gobi once ruled supreme now
rule the himalayas these mountains the
greatest in the world run nineteen hundred
miles from east to west and an average
of ninety miles from north to south they
cover a total of one hundred and sixty
thousand square miles of these moun-
tains the greatest peak mount everest
reaches upward to the sky twenty-nine
thousand one hundred and forty feet above
sea level immense sections of these moun-
tains are inaccessible to modern man

  hidden in the tops of these mountains
unknown to man save by tradition lies the
ancient capitol of the lost empire of gobi
half-frozen tartars insect-ridden lamas
barbarians of every description remain as
the sole descendants of what was once
a great people even the memory of their
former greatness has been lost in the chang-
ing struggles of fourteen thousand years
if they are asked how old these moun-
tains are they will reply that they have
always been there how could they know
that once all this land was lowland forest
land a pleasant country for rich folk
to live in how could they know of the
physician from mo and his magical table
and map thereon

 yet amid those mountains lies the
ancient city and the hall of dragons
there on their silken cushions and their
beds of goosefeathers lie the boneless
emperor the boneless high priest and
the boneless seven wise men though
their bodies are chilled with the frost of
centuries yet would there come a pleasant
day of springtime with blossoming almond
trees and a warm gentle shower those
frozen hearts would once again send puls-
ing life through those boneless sacks for
full of the jelly-food of the queen bee they
can never die at least not for a long long
time

startling stories

blue to jet-black by the venusians
wizardry

  you ar-re za-tizzfied zorr

  swell doc kellie muttered husk-
ily swell

  he looked at his hands at the fresh
fingertips and the unmarked palms
he had been a pilot and it had been
necessary to remove the telltale cal-
louses from his palms everything
had been done perfectly now it was
up to him

  he rose and drew a deep breath into
his big chest from now on john kel-
lie was dead and gone there existed
only barron kirk with a new passport
in his pocket-a passport to a new
life he turned and saw that dr awi
was regarding him with a faint smile
on his bland face

  you think im a fugitive awi
john kellie said slowly youve
thought so all along why did you
operate

  the venusian shrugged it izz not
my con-zern what you may be

  i am a fugitive but for a crime i
never committed thats the truth
awi

  that is youre-re conzern alone
zorr

kellie nodded these venusi-
ans were certainly wonderful
people doing their jobs without ask-
ing a lot of questions back on terra
or mars he would have had to fill out
a hundred forms to get this operation
and by that time there would have
been virhac-

  as john kellie pulled on his new
suit of clothes he thought grimly of
the man who for five years had driven
him out of every city and across every
planet in the system ever since he
made his escape from william virhac
aboard the convict ship bound for
lune ii five years ago the patrol of-
ficer had never been off his trail

  kellie knew why virhac hunted him
with such tenacity his escape was
the only serious blot on the service
mans record and to a man of vir-
hacs stamp only his own death or his
preys could serve as an excuse for
not erasing that blot

  kellie had slept without peace
eaten food without surcease from

hunger for five years he had known
only the desperation of the convicted
fugitive the memory made his big
jaw harden let the famous patrol
hawk bag him now-if he could rec-
ognize him

  here doc and thanks

  he handed awi most of the notes
in the crisp wallet it was the agreed
price and cheap at that it left him
little but that didnt matter he ought
to be able to land a job now maybe
even as a pilot hed been a good
pilot once good enough to handle the
new orion on her maiden voyage out
of los angeles five years ago it had
been on the orions home trek   

  kellie shook off the old memories
of the accident that had made him a
hunted man he had learned that did
nothing but drive him crazy to think
of it he buttoned his coat rapidly
and turned to awi

  good-by zorr the venusian
bowed toward the door bez-zt of
luck

  john kellie emerged from the low
venusian dwelling into notorious
judas st in venus city the narrow
alley that crawled crookedly through
the systems largest demi-world was
now almost empty in the gathering
dusk there were still a few people
abroad-lethe runners penny murder-
ers and fugitives-as he himself had
been up to now

  he merged with the crowd that
walked silently heads low by force
of habit kellie tucked his chin into
his chest and buried his face in the
collar of his topcoat but at once he
raised it there wasnt any need of
his hiding now he told himself an-
grily not even his mother if she
were alive would have known him

  he walked slowly for he had been
flat on his back for three weeks and
hadnt yet got his sea-legs at the
end of judas st a broad avenue
crossed and led to the space terminal
there the empress of cairo with a
hull cargo for new york and some
incidental passengers lay in her steel
harness the empress was due out in
an hour and john kellie had in his
pocket a top-deck ticket under his
new name he walked more buoyantly
as he thought of new york it had

been many years

  i beg your pardon have you a
match

  kellie halted and turned impatient-
ly to the slim dapper little man who
had addressed him he flicked a
light and stared by its glow into the
sallow sharp-featured face of william
virhac

the sight of his enemy came as a
perceptible blow to kellie even
though he had known that the service
would trail him to venus city he
felt no fear only hatred and a sort of
tingling curiosity could virhac
pierce dr awis creation

  john kellie had the creepy sensa-
tion that the quick beady eyes which
scanned his face while virhac drew
on the light between his cupped hands
were more than ordinarily curious
there seemed to be a strange intensity
in the service mans deliberate gaze

  passport

  virhac showed his patrol badge at
the same time as he clipped out the
word

  sure kellie said

  the voice awi had given to him
still sounded strange to the big earth-
man he pulled out the flat book and
handed it over virhac opened it

  barron kirk the little man read
rapidly occupation stevedore ten
years in good standing he glanced
up that you

  of course

  virhac looked back at the passport
a sudden rage almost overcame kel-
lie as he watched he could murder
virhac with a single blow of his fist
and on judas st there was a good
chance that he could escape unscathed
the urge to wipe out the human ma-
chine before him-the machine that
had tracked him as relentlessly as if
he were an animal-surged up in john
kellie like a blazing fire yet he
stayed his hand

  he was no criminal but killing vir-
hac would make him one in a way
it would be playing into dark-skinned
devils hand kellie smiled grimly to
himself and stood quiet abruptly
virhac handed the book back

  judas streets no place for an
earthman he said curtly id ad-

vise you to be on your way

  with that the service man passed
on

  happiness flowed through john
kellies veins like strong liquor as he
continued toward the space terminal
it must have been his imagination that
had seen recognition in the sleuths
gaze he told himself virhac hadnt
known him couldnt possibly have
known him from now on john kellie
-or rather barron kirk-was free to
go and come as he pleased and by
antares twenty-six moons he pleased
right now to go to terra just as fast
as the leaky old empress could carry
him there

  sue had said she would be waiting
for him no matter how long it took
sue wasnt the kind to break her word
an observer watching the big earth-
man leg it to the terminal would
scarcely credit the report that john
kellie had spent the last three weeks
under a surgeons knife

the empress of cairo had once
been the pride of the great starry
fleet now sporting her tenth or
eleventh coat of cheap gilt paint plus
plenty of goo amidships to grease her
squeaky struts she was lugging along
on her twentieth hour out of venus
city when john kellie emerged from
his compartment the ship was roll-
ing somewhat on her beam kellie had
to use the corridor bulkhead to bal-
ance himself as he made his way to-
ward the main salon

  he felt as refreshed as a man will
who has slept nearly the entire clock
around the great salon was hardly
a quarter-full when he got there it
was an off season for venusian tour-
ing

  kellie quickly scanned the faces of
those in the spacious room there
were three or four business men with
their families the usual sprinkling of
salesmen and one or twoschoolmams
and in a far corner near a port a
man sat reading

  john kellies heart lurched queerly
as he caught sight of the thin-lipped
sallow face behind the newspaper

  virhac

  it needed all kellies strength to
prevent a cry of surprise and dismay


startling stories

from escaping his lips but he gripped
himself and deliberately sat down next
to a group in full view of the service
man after all virhacs presence on
the empress might be just a coinci-
dence to hide now would be sense-
less

  did you hear that one of the pilots
was taken sick this morning a fat
red-faced man who looked like a
banker had turned and addressed kel-
lie that means theres only the
man on duty now i think its an un-
holy scandal the way these ships are
understaffed ill tell you what im
going to do im going to report this
to the investigation board as soon as
we land

  the red-faced man puffed pom-
pously he was the kind that thought
nothing of making trouble for the
crew but he was really frightened
now kellie could see that his fear
had infected the others including his
own family one of his children a
little fair-haired boy was pulling at
his knee and wailing

  daddy whats the matter what
is it daddy

  i dont think theres anything to
worry about kellie tried to be re-
assuring one man can pilot a ship
for twenty-four hours if necessary
why i-

  he had been about to mention that
he himself had held the orions con-
trols for a stretch of fifty-one hours
but he caught himself he was not
john kellie any more he must train
himself to remember that he was
barron kirk stevedore a single slip
might render awis elaborate work
worse than useless

  im certain theres nothing to
worry about mister he finished
lamely

  the banker looked down the length
of his nose at kellie as if questioning
kellies right to have opinions on any-
thing

  well i think there is something to
worry about he snapped i pay
taxes where in blazes does our money
go if it doesnt provide for extra pi-
lots to insure our safety

  kellie shrugged and moved only his
eyes toward the salons far corner
he saw that virhac had lowered his

paper now and was regarding him
steadily when their eyes met the
service man acknowledged their pre-
vious meeting with a short quick nod
and kellie replied in kind but for
a long moment virhac did not relin-
quish the gaze again john kellie
felt the queer stabbing certainty that
virhac knew he struggled hard with
the overpowering sensation before
throwing it off

  nerves he berated himself he
cant know me im still jittery from
all that neo-coc old awi shot into my
spinal column

hen dinner was served kellie
sat next to the red-faced banker
at the long dining salon table the
banker was more agitated than ever
the empress had run into a little
stormy ether every time the ship
lurched slightly kellie thought the
fat man would collapse he was worse
than any woman yet there was always
at least one of his type aboard every
ship

  kellie raised his eyes and found
that virhac was staring at him across
the long table he raged inwardly
what did virhac expect to do-x-ray
barron kirk with his eyes and dis-
cover john kellie underneath

  kellie grinned deliberately into
virhacs face let the black devil
think what he wanted no one could
prove that john kellie existed so long
as barron kirk denied it that was
the thing to remember

  the ether got worse as the meal
progressed and the diners had to use
the table slots to keep their plates
from shooting around by this time
the two children of the red-faced
banker were crying loudly and their
nurse had to take them to their com-
partment

  kellie frowned as he saw them go
if necessary men and women could
always escape in the emergency boats
their grown bodies could withstand
the pressure of the little craft even
for twenty-four hours but it would be
torture for the little ones kellie had
seen children who had been too long
in a dory rocket it wasnt a pleasant
memory

  this was a real ion-storm all right
trails end



kellie could feel the light-weight
beryl-steel frame of the empress
shiver in time with the concentrated
energy waves striking her hull broad-
side the pilot was doing his best to
outride the storm he knew all stern
and fin rockets were working wide
throttle

  the blasted fool kellie thought
why doesnt he change his course
and head into the storm its the
quickest way to lose it

  then he remembered with sudden
apprehension that the pilot had been
alone for the last fifteen hours he
must be groggy as blazes by now

  it needed a thoroughly wide-awake
man at the controls in a storm like
this

  everybody had stopped making any
pretense of eating and a current of
suppressed anxiety filled the room
only virhac continued methodically
and calmly with his meal didnt the
service man realize the danger if
so he gave no sign kellie looked at
the cold sallow face of his enemy with
something akin to admiration vir-
hac might be nothing but a mechanical
bloodhound as rumor described him
but he was certainly no weak sister

  suddenly as if everybody had been
awaiting it the old empress came
through with a crazy lurch that threw
kellie off his chair and almost
sprawled him full-length on the car-
pet when he jumped up the ship
was still rocking jerkily and there was
bedlam in the salon everyone was
crawling to his feet and yelling at
the same time

  what happened the two-school-
maams were screaming

  the emergency boats the red-
faced banker was shouting hoarsely
get us to the emergency boats at
once

a white-jacketed steward
slipped into the salon from the
forward gangway kellie saw virhac
stop him and flash his badge the
steward said something to the service
man that kellie couldnt catch through
the noise virhac nodded and mounted
a chair

  quiet please his unhurried
tone cut through the hysterical din

the steward has something to tell
us

  all eyes in the salon turned in hope
toward the white-jacketed figure
whose brow was creased worriedly

  ladies and gentlemen the steward
began quickly we must all keep our
heads i have just come from the
control room the pilot was injured
slightly by the last shock and-

  please he cried through the sud-
den wave of moans there must be
order the pilot will keep his place
until the ship is empty everybody
must go at once to the boat assigned
to his compartment a crew member
at each station will see that the boats
are launched according to number

  john kellie shook his head frown-
ing

  but were too far out he pro-
tested the children wont have a
chance

 the stewards distressed gaze
turned toward the big passenger it
was clear to kellie that the white-
jacket knew too well the fate awaiting
the children aboard

  cant be helped sir the steward
replied thickly wed all go in a few
minutes the pilot cant last longer
than that

  he turned away virhac standing
by caught the white-jacket by the
arm

  but steward the service man said
if there were a licensed pilot on
board he could relieve the man on
duty couldnt he

  his words were addressed to the
steward but his eyes were looking
straight at john kellie

  he knows kellie thought

  this time there was no doubt in his
mind the steward nodded in re-
sponse to virhacs question but
shrugged helplessly indicating that
he expected no such piece of luck

  if there were a pilot aboard vir-
hac repeated

  the cold contempt in his voice as
he looked at john kellie was like the
bite of an icy wind

  a trap kellie thought the devil
is laying a trap for me

  aloud he grunted in a low voice
no chance of that i guess

  the steward nodded hopelessly

startling stories

then its the emergency boats for
everyone it had better be quick

  kellie picked his way slowly along
the heaving salon floor to the other
side of the room from there he
watched with a strange numbness as
the preparations were made to aban-
don ship the crew moving with
great rapidity was assembling the
necessary provisions at each boat sta-
tion the steward was doing his best
to keep the panicky passengers in
order

the red-faced banker lurched into
the salon loaded down by three
heavy grips it would have to be left
of course but he didnt know that
nor apparently did he know what the
twelve-hour trip to the nearest port
in a dory rocket would do to his kids
maybe he didnt care about anything
so long as he himself got away

  the children came out next tears
streaming down their frightened
faces kellie thought that already he
could see the frail little bodies man-
gled and torn with blood spurting
from their mouths crushed by the
fierce pressure in the small boats a
child under six might survive an hour
or two in a dory but never half a day
they were rushing out to their death

  john kellie felt his new palms rub-
bing together restlessly tormentedly
he knew that from somewhere in the
room virhac was still watching him
but he didnt want to meet the little
mans gaze now he kept his head
low staring straight out befox-e him

  dont be a fool now a voice within
him whispered not now after five
years when youre safe sue and a
new life lie ahead of you once you
get into a dory to blazes with a
couple of brats think of yourself
youve gone through plenty barron
kirk is a dock-walloper no pilot

  but john kellie is another voice
came from deep inside him sue
wouldnt want you if she knew the
price of your freedom sue had faith
in john kellie she believed in him
and still does barron kirk wont be
able to tell her that he let a dozen
children go to a pressure-death it
will be a guilty secret hell have to
carry to his grave alone

  john kellie blinked and something
snapped inside him he hardly knew
he had crossed the salon until the
steward stood before him he grabbed
the man by the shoulder

  take me forard

 what- the white-jacket began
uncomprehendingly

 dont ask questions kellie
snapped take me to the control
room

  something in his voice caused the
steward to drop the water jugs in his
hands as if they were white-hot he
led the big passenger along the gang-
way into the pilots cabin kellie
tapped the green-uniformed back of
the man at the controls

  okay bud move over ill take her
from here

  the pilot looked over his shoulder
smiled weakly and nodded he moved
along the leather bench to the far side
of the cabin almost immediately his
body slumped in the seat there was
an ugly gash along his forehead where
he must have struck the panel when
the ship lurched john kellie noticed
it only briefly because he had grabbed
the firing wheel the moment the pilot
let it go

  the hard wheel felt oddly familiar
under his hands it had been many
years since he had sat behind controls
could he still pilot the question
hadnt occurred to him back in the sa-
lon now there wasnt time to think
there were only the fiery ionic cas-
cades against the broad port in front
of him the ship under him storm-
struck and quivering crazily

he strove to bring into play long
unused muscles and a half-for-
gotten sense of balance gripping the
wheel so tightly that his new skin was
soon ripped and bleeding but he did
not notice his hands slowly the feel
of the ship was coming to him the
skin on his fingers and hands was not
his but the muscles and nerves inside
still belonged to the man who had
been called the best pilot between jove
city and menagon mercury

 kellie fought the old empress
striving to head her into a wild tor-
rent of ions that seemed to come from
all sides at once he forgot every-
trails end



thing but himself and the ship in the
whole wide universe there was noth-
ing but him and the crotchety em-
press whose crazy pulse he was hold-
ing under his hands

  her rockets fired late and each set
had a slightly different timing kellie
wasnt used to them it needed split-
second firing to avert the heaviest
blasts before they opened a seam or
burst a bulkhead suddenly he des-
paired and cursed himself as a mur-
derer at least if he had kept quiet
the men and women aboard would have
been saved

  it was not too late to call the stew-
ard and tell him it was no go they
could still abandon ship in the dories
but john kellie couldnt drive the
image of the mangled children from
his eyes

  the empress was now at the com-
plete mercy of the storm a whirl-
pool or a bad cross-current would
wreak havoc on her yet the maneu-
ver did one thing it prevented the
old ladys own vibrations from help-
ing to tear her to pieces

  in haughty silence the empress
rocketed through the darkness in fric-
tionless fall she gave no further re-
sistance to the buffeting currents and
surrendered to every fiery burst

  theyd get through kellie thought
if they didnt catch a twister-a super-
cluster of ions revolving at incredible
speed he kept his hand on the con-
trols and watched hard if he saw
one coming he could still try a burst
though it wouldnt do much good

  come on lady he addressed his
unvoiced plea to the ship stay away

  look forward to-

  plus many other outstanding stories
  and features coming next issue

 he had to bring the empress
through

  the storm was almost weird in its
intensity one of those disturbances
that make a pilot think theres some-
thing alive and vicious in space kel-
lie thought of a trick he had once tried
and got away with it was dangerous
but it seemed the only thing left

  he rang for the steward

  have everyone fasten themselves
to the emergency hooks in the cabins
he told the white-jacket do it
quick

  the steward nodded and exited hur-
riedly after counting off a full min-
ute on the dial chronometer kellie
kicked off the rockets and the trem-
bling ship went dead only the soft
thrum of the grav-generators re-
mained

from twisters and head for calm ether
its up to you

the empress obliged with her
skirts tight about her ankles like
the dainty old lady she was the old
ship rode out the storm in fine style
kellie could have kissed her face
plates in affection tiredly he kicked
down on the slats and the rockets burst
out strong as they cleared the tail-end
of the storm

  that was a fine bit of piloting-
kirk

  kellie didnt have to turn to know
who had entered the cabin he had
forgotten about virhac for the last
few hours but now reality flooded
back over him with the unpleasant
shock of an icy shower he kept his
face forward to hide its grim bitter-


startling stories

ness from the ferret

  the long chase was over and he had
lost

  you know the low voice behind
him was saying i thought only one
man could have brought this ship
through the way you did pilot by
the name of john kellie too bad
about him though he turned into
a criminal and became a convicted
fugitive

  there was a pause kellie sat death-
ly still then virhac added in a low
intense tone

  he was a criminal-a hard ruth-
less murderer

  somehow john kellie got the curi-
ous idea that the man behind him
wasnt stating the words he was
asking pleading to be contradicted
it was an odd thought that virhac
should doubt now after five years
the knuckles on the firing wheel
tightened

  i knew this fellow kellie the pi-
lot said huskily he was innocent
he never killed that man the da
railroaded him because it looked like
an easy conviction

  yes virhac replied slowly i
remember his story kellie said his
co-pilot was drunk and raising the
devil in the orions cabin he said he
had to hit him the man fell and
struck his head badly that was kel-
lies story

  it was true virhac

  but the da found that both men
were in love with the same girl a cer-
tain sue arnold he also discovered
that the two men had always hated
each other

  the hidden pleading note seemed
to beg for the truth as if virhac
wanted badly to believe john kellie
answered it earnestly

  maybe they didnt like each other
but neither one was a murderer john
kellie was no murderer virhac
was he the type of man who
couldnt bear to see a little child die
needlessly

  i-i think he was john kellie
said

  in the silence that followed kellie
almost felt the man behind him sway-
ing it must have been hard he knew
for virhac to admit he was wrong

it would take a real man to change a
mind set in one way for five years

  im glad you told me this kirk
virhac said suddenly the voice was
changed now it was brisk as if the
service man had put a laborious de-
cision behind him i suppose you
know kellies dead yes he fell from
a crag near venus city while climb-
ing too bad eh the body hasnt
been reclaimed but there were native
witnesses im going home to make a
report on it

  the man at the wheel could hardly
believe his ears was this virhac
speaking was he serious if he
was- john kellie felt cool relief
running through him like balm

  by the way kirk virhac added
before kellie died he paid a plastic
surgeon to disguise him it was a

food job but he made one mistake
f i were wanted by the service kirk
and i decided to change my identity
and pose as-say a stevedore-the
first thing id do is make sure the doc
didnt leave me with hands like an
infants dock-wallopers dont sport
rosy palms kirk when a man holds
up a match its easy to look at his
hands

silence followed then the sound
of footsteps going out of the
cabin and down the gangway virhac
was gone

  kellie sat dumbly only one thought
in his mind virhac had given him
back his life and tossed away five
years all in a few seconds gratitude
and admiration for his enemy welled
up in kellie

  virhac was hard but honest a real
service man

  he lifted his hands so that was
why virhac had become suspicious
but his hands werent like a new-
borns any longer they were solid
mats of blood

  he gripped the wheel again and al-
most enjoyed the pain

  come on baby john kellie whis-
pered to the ship were going to
terra and sue

  flattered the empress kicked out
on all her rockets as if she were an
upstart stripling instead of a grand
old dame of twenty-five winters

by the fire-shades of vulcan did the old sarge recently feel as though
he had made a trip through the nethermost sulphurous regions a big
and husky spaceman of some two hundred-odd pounds tonnage came
stalking through the editorial offices trailing clouds of smoke and fairly snorting
flames under one brawny arm he carried a briefcase which was smoldering
like the fungi on the landing fields of pluto after a rocket ship takes off

on his way over from new jersey i cant

come up to our control rooms

  so prepare yourselves for a red-hot dish
we preserved the manuscript by keeping
it under an oil bath in the manner of me-
tallic sodium and cooled wellman down

he fused his typewriter as thoroughly as
if he had used a proton ray-and next

a repair job on startling

by d w boggs

  dear sarge after hitting a torrid pace with
the july issue startling stories seems
to have slipped back again to the rut with
the september number the burrough boys
just couldnt follow jack williamson their
bottom of the world might have amounted
to something if jack had been its creator but
the thing was just too incredible the way they
did it the story started out rapidly and
after a aeries of spark-plug failures got into
high gear prom then on the thing ripped
along so doggone incoherently that i lost
interest about the time that norris lost his
bathysphere

  i didnt get a letter sent after the july issue
came so here i want to say that williamsons
gateway to paradise was one of the finest
stf jobs of the year i list jack way up there
and that yarn arrowed me-bulls-eye well
well so this yarn like hamiltons t w s
yarn son of two worlds resulted from
the santa monica beach story conference in
august  more conferences

 cover for september not bad-in fact
good in comparison with some of beiarskls
other covers the boy apparently has learned
about perspective and shading

  incidentally i notice many readers were
hard put to figure out where in gateway to
paradise artist belarski found his inspira-
tion for the july cover they evidently missed
claytons tale of his ancestors experiences
during the dark stars passing p 

  as for the other stories for september
death prom the stars is certainly one of
the best of the circa  vintage many early

partment but recently there has been too

much emphasis on letteri its degenerated
into an alphabet soup down with all so-
cieties the inter-epistle comment is some-

times silly but i must admit sarge that you
can sho null sling that lingo despite your
handle you are anything but saturnine
grave gloomy phlegmatic where did your
cherished xeno brew get its name an
old spacedog once told me that its called
xeno because after one swig you xeno
evil hear no evil speak no evil in fact you
don t see hear speak period as an old
xeno lover from way back you should know
izzat right- benjamin street n e min-
neapolis minnesota

  simple isnt it peelot boggs just
wants an overhaul job done right out
here in space rocket jets cleaned and
fuel tanks blown while you wait not
to mention shifting of ballast and trim-
ming of cargo now if somebody will
just hand me a broom ill sweep out at
the same time    anyway boggs doesnt
bog down in sounding off

  so listen kiwi thats a good letter and
the old sarge isnt saying that some of
your views arent pertinent but what would
suit you exactly would be about ten sizes
too large or too small for a lot of other
spaceteers youre telling me the letters
are too windy  tell the other space rats
to boil down their bubblings and make their
communications more to the point ps
your letter isnt precisely an epigram it-
self

 look what comes now

an apple for the teacher

by e earl bielfeldt

  dear sarge bring out the xeno and some
venuslan cheroots cause i want to gab a
while

  everybody wants to know who you are
thats silly cant they read your name is
sergeant saturn youve said so many many
times who gives a martian zentzo about
your background maybe thats better kept
quiet anyhow eh sarge

  but to get on with what i wanted to tell
you ss is a good book to put is mildly my
subscription ended with the september issue
but tell that subscription department of yours
to keep right on sending startling to me
money oh sure look hard and youll find
a money order for ninety cents

  to classify the last six issues would be a
hard job so ill just put them all in first place
and let it go at that the other two better
publications sf books tws and captain-
future are also fine captain future
got off to a slow start but hes picking up
fine

  say sarge are there any pictures of you


around if not ive drawn one which i think
might look like you touu find it too with
this letter

  whoa-cut forward rockets im way off
my orbit this spach is to tell you about
your book ss some very fine hall of fame
stories have been published in the past im
a comparitively new fan so i have never seen
any or the old stories

  the crossword puzzle is great fun keep it
each is just hard enough to keep a fellow
busy informative too much better than a
science quiz i always was a sucker for a
crossword puzzle anyway

  by the way what has happened to the
guest editorials they were good put your
authors to work writing them again i guess
that they can take time off their stories for a
few minutes cant they

  im keeping you up so i guess ill go now
thanks for the xeno-maple and cherry
lanes thornton illinois

              ut-a-
sergeant saturn

  well seal my port and call me sherry
do you snickering space tramps see what i
see so this is the impression peelot biel-
feldt has of the old sarge maybe id better
call a convention of you birds to appear
before me in the control room so you can
get a good look at my mug great martian
zoop flowers i dont scan through the
televisors like this do i or do i never
mind dont answer that nice caricature
earl keep up your art work

first blood

by sylvia singer

  dear sarge this is my first letter to a sci-
ence-fiction or any other mag and the cause
of it all is jack williamson with the best sp
story that ive yet read gateway to para-
dise you could really see the world he
imagined with easy life inside the ring and
the outside bleak and terrible captain
glenn clayton was somebody real alive
somebody that one couldnt help going to bat
for compared to him lieutenant barry
shane was more of an authors tool but only
as compared however the story was super-
colossal boy am i getting oratorical

  man-beast of toree the best hall of
fame yet was just naturally second with
calling of the harp a close third cross-
roads of the universe was just ordinary
space-filler

  incidentally has reader paul carter gone
space-mad tsk-tsk too bad belarskis ex-
cellent cover illustrating gateway to para-
dise had nothing to do with the story or
my mistake maybe he just cant read oh
well

  and heres where i join the fight please
please sarge we dont want bems on the
covers ss hasnt offended so much but some-
times tws has  pick up a mag with one
and feel a thousand eyes boring into me a
thousand fingers pointing accusingly and

good as edgar rice at his best-things like

think they are doing better than some of the
john carter and carson particularly the
former stuff that is now being published in

this spaceteers been
doublecrossed

by edward c connor

  dear sergeant saturn your editors seem to
have a peculiar habit of making a fellow
change his opinions first you give us a very
punk story or so and at the first opportunity
say ha ha just wait walt until next
time weve got something good

  when you recently made a like statement
regarding oscar j friends novel water
world l knew how things would turn out

  but-whats this-i find myself forced to
make the following statement water world
is a definite hit it is a smasheroo a whlz-
bang in fact-i have been doublecrossed
what hus friend done- butler st peoria
illinois

 and here we are again one mans
meat is another mans poison who said
that was a cliche we still eat dont we-
when we can get it and ive run into
the darnedest variety of poisons kicking
about the solar system it all boilb down
to the simple fact that some folks like this
and other folks like that you birds would
have the old sarge space-dizzy if it werent
for one thing cut your blasts and listen

  confidentially im glad to air your frank
opinions but personally i like em all
so evidently does peelot sealover

space liner fiction

by art sealover

  dear sarg i am going to ask a question
about this bi-monthly publishing of the best sf
mag on the market today why why
why why not monthly

  i am just about to start sojarr of titan
and i hope it is as good as a yank at val-
halla that was a humdinger the city of
singing flame was awful

 i have been a reader of startling
stories for over a year now and have only
a good report to make that is almost all of
the time but just keep up the good work
and i hope when we are able to take a space
ship to mars or the moon i will be able to
take along a copy of startling stories

a jug of xeno and speaking of xeno
read this snappy report

a crack at belarski

by frank shaney

  dear sarge pass around the xeno jug
sarge the september issue was a honey
after struggling past the cover and nine
pages of advertisement i found the best issue
of the past nine months

  speaking of the cover heres an atom bomb
you can put under belarski the scene is
supposed to illustrate the bottom of the
world but far be it from me to find any
connection they must be on the surface of
the earth since the humans are not wearing
pressure suits but then how did the seamen
get there they arent wearing suits either
by the way those seamen look like zombies
returning from fight with a plutonian wild-
cat how did the girl get there and who
is the green-faced gent with the pointed ears
in the background

  the burroughs boys really did a swell job
on the novel john can really swing a wicked
pen on those illustrations too hes better
than some of your staff artists i could men-

well belarski tippled a shot from my xeno
jug when i wasnt looking and hes been
running on atomic energy ever since but
youd better look close for scenes illus-
trated by the cover paintings they are
generally there accurate enough too if
you allow for a little artistic license and
concede the symbolic parabolic allegoric

the space quiz-kid

by paul cox

  dear sarge i have just bought the septem-
ber issue of startling stories so have
not yet read it but that cover is punk i have
never seen but one cover by mister belarski
that i liked-back in  the ideal cover
would be some dark space scene such as an
asteriod floating in dark space or a comet
with a background of black

  drop the scientific crossword puzzle and one
short story and fill in with the ether
vibrates letters are much more interest-
ing than moat of the short stories not my
letter of course

  sarge why dont you answer the letters
i dont mean personal correspondence but
under the letters that you print you com-
pletely ignore most of the questions put to
you i am going to ask some of the questions
that many have asked but received no an-
swer please answer them

  	how may i get back issues are the first
three issues still available

  	who is the editor of ss tws and cf

  	why did tws go bi-monthly

  	if i wish to join the science fiction
league how may i do so without injuring the
magazine

  	why dont you use bok in your mag-
azine- thave columbus georgia

  as i live and endeavor to breathe with
asteroids this kiwi wants a longer de-
partment and he is calling the old sarge
down when all the time i thought i was
going to great length to answer appro-
priately every query printed in this quarter
of space which required an answer the old


sarge has felt at times as gabby as a
couple of plutonian chipmunks at a venus-

sequence peelot cox one we cannot

frequently i see ads anent such things in

are handled by a small group of specialists
on our busy staff you can always hit the
nail on the head by communicating with

you really want to know instead suppose
you boost the idea of more fans buying
magazines rather than trading them around

is planned to alternate with thrilling
wonder stories which appears in

   now for the second most of your stories
 are hardly science fiction at all but merely ad-
 venture yarns such as the bottom of the
 world sojarr of titan and twice in
 time when new york vanished the
 three planeteers the fortress of utopia
 are actually science fiction so what do you
 say to a good heavy science yarn such as
 time travel and space legions

   ah ha your short stories are ok so is
 thehall of fame how about bringing the
 moon conquerors by r h romans into this
 hall of fame too

   now for a blast into the money box how
 about trimed edges	 	 

   the feul of this pen just exploded- s

   okay peelot macfarlane jr you ve
 had your say now take a tip from the
 old sarge who has seen many a kiwi come
 and go decide upon one name preferably
 your own and do all your corresponding
 with the old space dog under the same
 by-line catch on

   to give the final blast to rockets before
 we start free-wheeling in space heres a
 hot message from an indefatigable fan

 katie warms up

 by katherine baum

   dear sarge all right so you can wesso and
 bergey for an issue and what do you do
 stuff orbana monstrosities down our respec-
 tive throats really sarge those were the
 worst pics ever seen in startling and to
 add insult to injury you give us a cover full
 of martian greenies or whatever they are
 for shame i liked the black lettering quite
 distinctive

   friends story was very well done his
 dialogue is about the best of current writers
  believe that friend and decamp handle dia-
 logue better than any stf author with the
 sole exception of weinbaum who was always
 at his best when doing the dialogue witness
 the new adam why can writers stf
 get women into their stories without making
 them aa insipid as a pack mule that chalks
 up another score for decamp and weinbaum

   id like to see another humorous tale by
 friend of the type like kid from mars
 hamilton does rather well in the humorous
 vein too jack williamsons story sounds
 good hope finlays illustrations grace it

   oh by the way did you notice that each
 person on the cover resembles some movie
 star ye damsel in distress is the image of
 rita johnson and the sinewy hero looks like
 crooner kenny baker the guy tied to the
 wall is the counterpart of larry crabbe and
 that greenle in pain is a repulsive combina-
 tion of karloff lugosi and colonna

   we are going to miss andersons witty
 or should  say brilliant letters too much
 wordage so thats about all

   pa all fans in pgh crawl out of your
 holes and get into tho swing of things by
 joining the pgh branch of the science fiction
 league for heap fun and frolic come on
 lets hear from ya regular meetings being
 held phone me at fa  for details-
 juniata st n s pittsburgh pa

   thanks bonnie kate thats a pretty
 good kick in the pants to end this months

 
es to i

to five ions ser-
vice we make oil
atylep of plates

department on but listen gal pull your
punches just a wee bit the old sarge
has to censor your spaceman lingo a trifle
before putting you on the ether

  and what are the rest of you space
birds grinning at if you dont know
it everything has to be edited before it
can go down to the printers yeah even
fan letters many a literary reputation has
been salvaged in the old sarges control
room whats that well you should
see your own letters before i get the blue
pencil to working

  while were on this course suppose i
mention that it would be a lot easier on
old saturn if you space apes would type
your letters double-spaced on one side of
the paper only and dont forget to sign
them if you want them printed

  all right close and seal ports all
aboard for the home port if we dont
blow a head gasket ill ride herd on you

didnt even
know
my name

he said he remembered seeing me around
but he didnt even know my name until the
i c s wrote him that william harris had
enrolled for a course of home study and was
doing fine work

   whos william harris he asked
then he looked me up told me he was glad
to see i was ambitious said hed keep his
eye on me

  he did too gave me my chance when
frank jordan was sent out on the road i
was promoted over older men who had been
with the firm for years

  my spare-time studying helped me to
get that job and to keep it after i got it it

certainly was a lucky day for me when i
signed that i c s coupon

	 

one reason employers recognize the value
of i c s training is that many of them are
former i c s students they recognize
that todays i c s students are tomor-
rows leaders

  in the  years since these schools were
founded more than  has been
spent in preparing and revising texts a per-

been developed isnt it better to get the
