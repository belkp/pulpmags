the argosy voiv xxv august no a peruvian paradise the find of three adventurers among the andes-a quest for treasure that brought to light a strange community-exciting experiences among the descendants of the incas complete in this issue chapter i-an unequal combat

he narrow trail wound up the mountain side like a brown ribbon

writhing in and out among the huge boulders and clumps of sturdy
timber now skirting the verge of a sheer precipice anon following the dry
bed of some torrent far above toward the azure arch towered the snow
clad peaks of the andes  below the depths of the verdant valleys were
almost lost in the haze of distance

   the tinkle of a silver bell was all that disturbed the silence of the day
around a rugged spur of the mountain came a pack train the like of which
can be seen nowhere but in the peruvian andes

   first appeared the awkward camel-like face of the leading pack animal-
a great llama with a silver bell fastened to a strap about its throat by the
odd creatures side trotted a half naked indian lad with the leading strap in
his hand then one by one followed nearly a dozen smaller llamas each
with a pack strapped on its back two indians walked beside them while
the rear of the procession was brought up by three individuals dressed in the
half native half european costume of white travelers two were young
men both sturdy of limb and of pleasing presence  the other was a short
  squatty  fellow with flabby cheeks and little twinkling pig-like eyes
almost hidden in layers of flesh he was well along toward fifty and when
he removed his broad brimmed hat to wipe his perspiring forehead showed a
well developed bald spot on top

   this tramp hits you where you live eh fitch laughingly inquired
one of the younger men a brown haired sunny faced fellow

      him getting to hold for it hi am mr kinsale replied the short man
puffing like an asthmatic donkey engine this trading business is too
bloomin hactive an thats no lie hid better be back in eunnon than ere
in this blessed ole hit was a sorry day for bob fitch wen e leaved a
civilized country for a eathen land


a peruvian paradise

     and yet youve been at it the better part of ten years  queried kin-
sale  i should think youd have gone back before

     gone back is it   cried fitch with a flourish of his huge bandanna
 if hid made money enough dye think hid stay ere him not such a
bloomin fool

    havent made money enough in trading all these years to pay your pas-
sage home eh said kinsale with a twinkle in his eye most of you
traders make two or three hundred per cent on the gimcracks you sell the
natives  

     tut tut  never believe hall you ear sir said fitch with an answer-
ing grin  but after a mans been told e can get gold for the pickin hup
e dont want to go back to is hold friends an neighbors with just a com-
fortable living  

     want to cut a dash do you  

   well hi was told hid get rich ere remarked fitch drily hi
dont want to disappoint them as told me sir

     what you want is to find some of those old treasure caves of the incas
that keeth was reading about last night

     if id been trading among these mountains for ten years id have had a
look for some of them said the third man with gravity

    he was a tall black haired man of twenty five or so well built and athletic
and with a sharp penetrating eye he was so dark that he made an ex-
cellent foil for kinsales blond face

   thats hall nonsense sir declared the trader with some emphasis
 them yarns are just to play hoff on strangers nobody but a dago would
believe em

then you dont believe in the treasures of the incas    queried kinsale
 not hi   cried fitch with emphasis  they say these ere hinjuns
and he pointed contemptuously at the half naked llama drivers  was once a
great nation an ad hall sorts o treasures nonsense hi says wheres it
hall gone   

     history tells us that pizarros conquestadors got a good share of it re-
marked the dark man

    e was another of these dagoes i suppose said fitch who might be
rather shaky on history but had all the average englishmans contempt for
the conquerors of peru  e probably lied about it

    oh get out   said kinsale  pizarro and his companions found dead

loads of treasure- 

   you cant convince mr fitch ford interrupted his friend thats
impossible nothing but the actual sight of an inca treasure house would
do it

    youre right mr keeth declared fitch  if the forebears of these
hinjuns ad stored up gold from the old mines as they say they did an
other valibles these ere hinjuns of today would ave found it an spent it
for rum before this

   both his companions laughed

   well said ford kinsale if keeth doesnt locate his nitrate beds
a peruvian paradise



pretty soon im going to hunt for the incas old hideouts when the
spaniards drove the tribes into the mountains they lugged a pile of treasure
with em it must be hidden somewhere

    you get to monkeying among these mountains off the beaten paths
and youll be up against something you wont like observed keeth

    what 

    well they say all the indians arent as peaceable as the coast natives
or those fitch trades with in the interior

    ill risk em said ford  im bound to get some fun during my va-
cation if its going to be a brush with wild indians why let it come
goodness knows after boning down at a desk in callao for eighteen months
steady i ought to stand a little excitement

    pooh  pooh   exclaimed fitch  you young men dont believe hall
them old womans tales about the mountain tribes do you  

    fitch said keeth  youre the most unbelieving man i ever saw

    hes worse than that cried ford  its abominable remember
were out for a holiday-at least  am dont try to break down our faith
in all the romantic traditions of the country let us believe in the descend-
ants of the incas themselves who they say inhabit the upper plateaus of the
andes

    nonsense  nonsense   declared the trader with some heat  were
in as wild a part of the sierras now as a white man cares to go theres
nothin but mountains hand wild beasts to the north of us hive been
hover this trail dozens of times an hi never even saw one o them hinjuns
youre talking about hits all a bloomin booger story

    if thered been any truth in it fitch would have been trading with them
before this interposed keeth drily

    thats so said the trader  thats just what i would-

    at that instant the steady jangling of the bell on the leading llama ceased
the pack train came to a sudden stop the animals crowding upon one
another in the narrow path

   the trail ahead was hidden by a towering spur of rock from beyond
this obstruction came the loud clash of voices and the trampling of feet

    whats up another pack train   demanded ford

   fitch started forward but before he had rounded the head of his train the
sound of voices had increased to a roar above which the strokes of metal
upon metal were plainly audible

     a fight by jove   cried ford and he started on a run up the trail

   but keeth passed both of them before they reached the spur of rock he
unslung his rifle as  he ran and when he rounded the obstruction held the
weapon at a  ready 

   the scene which met his gaze was a most startling one on the narrow
trail above him a group of nearly a score of indians were struggling and the
victim of their wrath was a single individual who stood at bay with his back
to the rocky wall the indians were fairly falling over one another in their
furious endeavors to thrust the imperiled man through with their spears

   he was a slight lithe man-a spaniard keeth was sure at first glance-


a peruvian paradise

and his remarkable activity was all that had saved him up to this point he
was bleeding badly from several wounds but was dexterously catching most
of his enemies thrusts upon a round rawhide shield attached to his left arm
with his own spear it seemed his only weapon he was doing no little dam-
age to his foes one lay face downward at his feet quite dead

   the indians themselves were plainly of a different tribe from those who
bore the llama train company they were a fiercer people-that was evident 
and they were taller and more sturdy their soled sandals rattled on the
rocky path and they fought like furies the outcome of the uneven battle
could not have long remained in doubt

   these facts keeth saw at almost a glance he shifted the rifle from his
arm to his shoulder in a trice and the crack of the piece rose above the shouts
of the savages he had purposely aimed high and the bullet splintered the
rock above their heads they ceased their onslaught and fell back at once
turning their angry faces toward this new antagonist

   at the same moment ford and the trader appeared beside keeth both
equally well armed the indians were evidently cowed by the appearance
of the europeans with rifles in their hands while they hesitated the man
whom they had attacked suddenly leaped out into the trail and ran at break-
neck speed toward his rescuers

   the indians started in pursuit but both keeth and ford kinsale raised
their weapons and instead of keeping on the natives wheeled and scattered
among the rocks evidently expecting a volley from the guns in a moment
they were out of sight and their victim covered with blood and well nigh
exhausted fell into keeths arms

chapter ii-will you go

    what about your booger stories now fitch demanded ford as he
assisted keeth to place the wounded stranger on the ground

   but the trader leaving his two companions to care for the victim of the
indians wrath ran forward and examined the dead man lying in the trail
when he returned he found the stranger sitting up with his back against a
boulder and keeth bathing his face ford and the three llama drivers were
looking on fords expression depicting the liveliest interest the indians
features as expressionless as so many tobacco store signs

   there bent nothin strange about them hinjuns declared the lon-
doner

    what do you mean   asked keeth looking up

  hi know them said fitch they were mountain hinjuns but
hive been among em hall theyre as civilized as my llama men ere
and he pointed to the three drivers

   they acted mighty civilized said ford if wed been a minute
later our friend here would likely have been a victim of their excessive civil-
ization

   hi dont understand it muttered fitch jerking his thumb over his
shoulder at the dead man  hive hoften traded with that fellow yonder
a peruvian paradise



   the wounded man opened his eyes once or twice  but his conflict with
the indians had completely exhausted him and he rallied slowly there
was a nasty wound in his forehead just at the roots of the hair and the blood
had streamed down his face  keeth wiped it away carefully there was no
other serious wound but upon the right cheek just below the eye was a
mark tattooed upon the skin about the size of an american half dollar
keeths attention was at once attracted to the cabalistic figure and he pointed
it out to ford and the trader

   upon the three white men the tattooed sign made  impression other
than serving to stimulate their curiosity but it had a most surprising effect
upon the three indians who were staring over their employers shoulder at
the wounded spaniard they begap to jabber together in their own tongue
pointing excitedly at the strange mark

    well wots the matter with you  demanded fitch who despite his
ten years experience in peru had never been able to master the gibberish
of the natives and even spoke the spanish with a cockney accent that would
have driven a linguist crazy

   senor said the oldest of the drivers replying in fair english no
good you hep that man we come away and leave him here eh 

     whats that leave the poor fellow here to die   cried ford
whats the matter with im demanded the trader e aint got
the small pox has he  

   he mooch better haf small poc we no hep him we mooch better
go on and leave him

   why hid like to know cried fitch

    the indian pointed slowly to the tattooed cheek

    what the dickens does he mean fitch  asked ford

    some o their bloomin superstition hi suppose replied the trader
in disgust then turning to the indian he said   now look-er ere juan
hi wanter know wot you mean wots the matter with thisere fellow
that we should leave im hout ere on the trail to die  

   again the indian pointed solemnly to the tattoo mark

     he is forbid he said

    fitch muttered an oath  but the llama driver continued 

     senor that sign is a command to us we must obey he is accursed
he should die  

   keeth reached for his winchester and cocked it

     tell them that if they undertake to follow out that idea ill give them
a taste of lead myself   he said to fitch

    dont you fret mr keeth returned the trader  him blessed if i
avent a mind to ide the ole three of them the hignerant niggers  

    what do you mean by his being accursed asked ford looking at
juan

    los americanos ees stranger here eh  you know not my people said
the indian drawing himself up proudly  we were a great people once
we haf not forget that though we speak a tongue other than our own and
worship a god other than that of our forefathers but that mark we know  


a peruvian paradise

he pointed to the spaniards cheek  bet was known to our ancestors long
before the spaniards conquered the land he is accursed   

   the indian laid his hand on the long knife at his belt but keeth was
watching him

    not on your life   he exclaimed snatching up his weapon again  i
tell you this fellow shant be hurt disarm that scamp fitch

   the indian sprang back with flashing eyes

    the senor knows not what he does he said hoarsely bet is at
your lifes risk that you assist that man

    well well risk it interposed ford  but you keep your hand off
that knife my friend

     you fellows go back to your places   commanded the trader  an
dont lets ear hanny more of it well make a urdle to carry the poor
lad on

   but the indians jabbered together and did not move

    come do you ear   cried fitch glowering at juan and his companions
    does the senor leave that man   demanded juan	

    no sir  e is going with us to ualpa

    den we not go wit you declared the indian

    you rascal you   cried the trader shaking his fist at him  hif
you leave me in the lurch this way youll not get a cent of your pay hand
when i get back to the coast hill make you sweat for hit too  

    bueno  it must be so   responded juan with a shrug of his shoul-
ders  adios senor  

   he turned on his heel and with his two companions passed out of sight
down the trail leaving fitch in a state of rage bordering on apoplexy

    come come fitch said keeth theres no use talking that way
how far is the next town   

    oh we can get to ualpa tonight if this chap dont keep us back too
much growled the trader

    ill answer for him we wont have to carry him  hell be able to
walk i think ford youll help mr fitch with the beasts wont you   

    sure responded kinsale

   wed best camp here for lunch im thinking pursued keeth

  lemnie that flask in your pocket fitch  

   the cockney handed over the liquor and then went back with ford to
bring up the pack train keeth forced a little of the spirits between the
lips of the wounded man he choked opened his eyes and struggled into
a more upright position

    senor he said weakly  you haf safed my life-you and your com-
rades  	

      how are you feeling   asked keeth

   better-mooch better he looked hastily about  the indians   he
queried   where are they   

    skipped out replied the american  their spears were hardly of use
against our winchesters

    ah-yes had i possessed a gun i should haf shown a better fight
a peruvian paradise



    you might have driven them off but i doubt if you could have put
up a pluckier front returned keeth with admiration  why did they set
upon you   

    a shadow crossed the spaniards face

    that senor i can scarce tell you-at least so that you wouldunder-
stand   he raised one hand to his cheek and touched the tattooed mark
 eet was this he said  i am accursed senor

    what do you mean by that  demanded keeth in surprise

    wait senor i cannot talk yet your name 

     ronald keeth at your service

     americanc  

   yes from new york civil engineer representing the peruvian
nitrate company

   thank you i shall always remember you senor keeth

    well well returned keeth dont think your rescue entirely due to
me here are my companions-mr ford kinsale of callao and robert
fitch trader and he waved his hand toward ford and fitch

     senors your servant said the spaniard inclining his head to all  i
am jose rodriguez a name not unknown in the coast towns when my father
was alive  but i am the last of my family  

   and your family come mighty near bein snuffed hout said fitch
 what was the row between you an them hinjuns if hi might be so bold
as to hask sir  

     there was nothing between me and them senor replied rodriguez
slowly

     come come  they werent trying to kill you just for fun  cried the
trader  wot do you tyke us for  were no hinfants 

   the spaniard again touched the mark on his cheek

      see you this senor   he asked

     what of it   replied fitch curiously

   those who tattooed it there did so for a sign that wherever i went
among these mountains it should be known that i had escaped from their
hands it is a sign-aye perhaps a command quien sabe f-for all indians
to kill me

    his three listeners looked at one another curiously

    explain yourself senor rodriguez said keeth  what you say is a
riddle to us  

    the spaniard took another sip of the strong liquor and a little color came
into his cheeks

     if you insist senor he said gravely  i will tell you you haf safed
my life eet is only right that you should know my story

     go ahead said the trader beginning to fill his pipe  this eres th
bloomiuest start ever hi see  

    know you then began the spaniard  that for three years i haf been
a prisoner among a tribe of indians many leagues to the nort of here-indi-
ans as different from the miserable creatures of the coast as dark is from
light


a peruvian paradise

    what do you think of that fitch   interrupted ford kinsale

    dry up ford commanded keeth  let senor rodriguez tell his
story

   i haf always been of an adventurous nature senors continued the
spaniard i was hunting with a single guide among the upper andes
we were set upon by a party of these savages my guide killed and i taken
prisoner for three years i haf lived among them i say

   senors they are as untamed as warlike as mooch heathen-dios help
them -as were their ancestors when the gr-reat pizarro led his conquesta-
dors to old cuzco and wtith them senors-with them i say-i spent tree
long years ah  they were terrible years but i am repaid-ah yes
senors   he looked from one to the other of his listeners senors he
whispered  i haf knowledge of the lost treasures of the incas  

   the faces of keeth and ford kinsale displayed their interest but the
traders ruddy countenance was white and he stared at the speaker with wide
open eyes and mouth

   i jose rodriguez learned that which the indians themselfs knew
not pursued the spaniard  i learned the secret which their old men had
forgotten aye i was their captive but i had eyes si senor i haf seen
the incas cave

      the incas cave    repeated keeth

    si senor the cave of wealth  the tr-reasure house of the great
incas who ruled this land when my countrymen conquered it my eyes
haf been blinded by the glare of gold-dazzled by the flash of such gems
as would fitly adorn a monarchs crown i jose rodriguez haf seen
all dis  

   he uttered these words excitedly and looked from keeth to his friends
with keenest scrutiny

    you doubt me senors   he cried  look  behold  

   with trembling fingers he tore open his coat and thrust one hand into a
slit in its lining in an instant he drew forth a thin bar of metal half a foot
in length and three or four inches wide it was dead yellow in hue

   he threw it down at their feet and brought out three others from the
same hiding place fitch pounced upon them like a hawk he touched
his tongue to a bar bit it and turned to his companions with a face as white
as chalk

    gold-virgin gold as him a livin man   he gasped

   where those came from senors went on rodriguez becoming calmer
as his listeners excitement increased  were great heaps of such bars-
wealth senors  reeches beyond belief  

     and those are all you brought away    demanded keeth

    si senor-all i was alone  i beliefed i was pursued though now i
tink i was not ket was trough the old treasure cavern i make my escape
an its entrance has been lost to the indians themselves for generations i
found it quite by accident they perhaps tink me drown but by the
blessing of sancta maria i was safe i travel many days trough these
mountains
a peruvian paradise



   then i fall in with the indians from whom you rescued me they
were kind to me at first  but when they see this-he pointed to the tattoo
mark again- carramba  they all like fiends the mark was placed there
soon after i was captured eet is a sign known to all the indes of the
andes only for eet i would- 

    he stopped and looked searchingly into their faces

    you would what  demanded ford

     i would go back an secure some of the lost wealth of the incas 

    fitch pressed forward

   see ere he said eagerly if a man could fix it so nobody would
see that mark would you risk it

     can you do that senor demanded the spaniard his eyes flashing

   hi believe so returned the trader  hive got some grease paint
in one of my packs-such as hactors use i carry a little of everything
hi believe hi could make you hup so that your mother wouldnt know you 

      if you can do this senor- 

   rodriguez looked about at the two younger men studying their eager
faces carefully

    will you all tree go he said  there is enough and to spare for
all eet is dangerous death lurks not alone in savage foes but in the
trails the torrents to be crossed the precipices to be scaled but the prize-
tink of the prize  wealth beyond your dreams senors  will you go

chapter iii-a frightful catastrophe

   keeth and ford looked at each other questioningly to the latter the
venture suggested by the spaniard appeared very alluring for its own sake  to
keeth the struggling young civil engineer the possibility of finding wealth
such as rodriguez declared he had seen was indeed tempting

   it was true that the story the spaniard told sounded visionary-in fact
seemed impossible in the year of grace eighteen ninety odd but rodriguez
appeared honest  his words rang true  and stronger evidence than all there
were the bars of yellow gold before them there was no discounting them

   keeth reached out and grasped jose rodriguez hand

    ill go with you he said  theres my hand on it

    and you senors  inquired the spaniard turning to kinsale and the
excited trader

     if keeth is willing to risk it  am declared ford

   an as for me said the cockney wiping his forehead furiously with
the bandanna  you couldnt keep me hout of it bob fitch  never refuse
a chance to make is fortune hi ope

     but i thought you didnt believe in any of these yarns about the incas
and all that sort of thing suggested ford slyly

    thats hall right young man thats hall right responded the trader
with some asperity  mabbe hi dont believe in every cock an bull story
hi ear but hi believe in solid gold bars like them and he handled the
yellow metal caressingly
io

a peruvian paradise

    senors said rodriguez  i feel better give me of food for i haf eat
noting for two days

    give im a bit of that lassajo to chew commanded the trader it
wont do to feed im too igh at first ow long ave you been traveling in
these ere bloomin mountains

    quite two weeks senor but only till two days ago did i quite lose my
way

    well youre alf a days journey to ualpa now said fitch

   ah i haf come a long way-a long way muttered the spaniard
shaking his head slowly

    and you are sure you can find your way back   inquired ford anx-
iously

   after reaching a certain place in the mountains-eet must be tirty
mile to the nort of here-i shall know the way back to de incas cave ver
well

    but how will we find this place  

    we must haf a guide to that spot senors eet is a place known to
many of the mountain people-eet must be known to them eet is a spot
where three great pines overhang a chasm there ees a bridge across the
river-a bridge which you senor ingenicro will wonder at and he bowed
to keeth

    i dont like that interrupted fitch  well ave to tyke one o these
bloody savages into hour confidence

    oh these indians are perfectly civilized interjected ford with a
grimace

    shut up ford commanded keeth  i agree with fitch it will be
dangerous to allow an indian of any tribe to accompany us if the are all

banded together as they appear to be-

    i tink senor that we can get a guide witout arousing suspicions as to
our intentions eet us once get to the three pines and i will get rid of the
guide on some pretense-send him back for food or ammunition or someting
surely someting will turn up-quien sabe f 

    thats hall right growled fitch   but hi dont like goin hit so
blind

   dont be a wet blanket interposed ford come lets have some
lunch ourselves we ought to be on our way to hualpa

     before we start it would be better for senor feetch to try to cover this
and jose touched the tattoo mark upon- his cheek   i wish to enter hualpa
witout that so plainly showing

    good hidea returned the trader and he got out his paint at once
keeth had bound up the cut in joses forehead and removed all traces of
blood and dust from his face fitch set to work and with more art than his
american friends would have given him credit for changed the spaniards
appearance completely the mark was entirely hidden although the paint
had to be laid on rather heavily for the purpose  but when the job was done
it would stand pretty close scrutiny

    hi guarantee none o them hinjuns will know you now sir said
a peruvian paradise

ii

fitch with satisfaction the only thing is you must be careful about
getting water on your face  that  have to be renewed every day or two
well lets move on proposed keeth how do you feel senor
rodriguez  think you can get along by leaning on my arm   

    i belief so replied the spaniard  det me try

   he got upon his feet and although a bit unsteady at first managed to
walk quite well with keeths aid

    start up the leader mr kinsale said fitch  blow th hugly beast 
hi ope this  be the last tradin trip bob fitch ever as to make

    dont conjure up too rosy a prospect rejoined ford laughing  the
disappointment if we shouldnt bring back the treasure will be all the
greater if you do  

   dont you worry sir said the trader with emphasis  if theres
gold in them ills onder like that senor rodriguez showed us him goin
to ave my share an dont you forget it

   in a short time they got the llamas started up the trail and with fitch in
the lead and the spaniard leaning on keeths arm hobbling along in the
rear moved on hualpa the little mountain settlement was reached just at
dusk their entrance was scarcely noticed and they smuggled rodriguez
into a back room of the hotel without attracting the least attention they
were anxious that their wounded acquaintance should not be recognized by
any of the party of indians who had attacked him if they were lurking about
the town

   fitch made a bargain with a returning trader who happened to be at the
posada to take his whole stock and got rid of his llamas as well through
the same agent jose rodriguez sold one of his bars of gold with the pro-
ceeds of which he purchased an outfit for the proposed journey into the
interior of the sierras the other bars he deposited with a fellow country-
man living at hualpa

   rodriguez wound having nearly healed at the end of a week and he
having recovered from the fatigues of his experience in the mountains
preparations were made for an immediate start upon what they were careful
to make public was a search for nitrate beds keeth whose firm was well
known in the town took command and his presence gave color to the avowed
intentions of the party but it was left to fitch to engage a guide for he
had had the longer experience in dealing with the indians

   and he found a man who more than satisfied keeth and ford kinsale
neither of them had ever seen such a big man among the indians of the
coast fitch declared him to be a member of an interior tribe-one which he
had occasionally traded with-far superior in point of intelligence as well as
in form and feature to the natives who made up the bulk of hualpas popu-
lation rodriguez expressed no opinion of the guide at all in fact he did
not see him until the party were ready to leave the posada on the morning of
departure

   the indian was known by the name of manuel he having probably been
baptized into the catholic church by some wandering priest when a child
nominally all the native peruvians are under priestly control although their


a peruvian paradise

ignorance of religious as well as other matters is appalling he was a man
fully six feet in height-as tall as ronald keeth himself-with a mighty
chest and arms like a gladiator he wore a loose tunic of cured skin sandals
and very little else his right shoulder was untrammeled by even the sack-
like tunic but the garment was belted in at the waist and fell nearly to his
knees he carried a long knife in his belt and a spear for a staff his long
black hair made other covering for his head unnecessary and the thongs of
his sandals wound round and round his ankles protected those parts from
the rocks

   he professed himself entirely familiar with the sierras for a hundred
leagues to the north of hualpa and agreed to guide the party directly to the
spot where the three pines overhung the gorge for a small sum in addition
he offered to carry one of them the entire distance in a chair or cradle such
as these mountaineers often bear upon their shoulders but none of the four
cared to travel in that precarious way

    hive rid on one of these fellows backs said fitch   but one trip
was enough hi was sicker than wen i come acrost from eunnon ten year
ago a man dont feel safe swingin over precipices a thousand feet deep
with nothin but a strap around a hinjuns ead a-lioldin of itn on

   they left hualpa early one morning and set out over a trail to the north
a path which showed for the first few miles that it was much traveled each
one in the party carried a pack strapped to his shoulders and keeth bore a
coil of small though very stout hemp rope the four europeans were heav-
ily armed and ford because of his inexperience and fitch because of his
blind contempt for the inhabitants of the mountains felt confident that they
would be more than a match for any party of wild indians which might
attack them jose rodriguez assured them that the tribe who had held him
captive so long knew nothing about the use of firearms fighting entirely with
bows and arrows spears and great war clubs

    wy cried fitch in talking it over  we can go right in harmed as
we are hand drive the ole crowd hout of the mountains

   but the spaniard shook his head there were places in the mountains he
knew where a man with merely a bow and arrows could hold a whole army at
bay

   before they stopped for their noon meal the guide led them off the main
trail into a side path which was much more arduous to follow it wound up
and up among the rocks occasionally crossing an almost level plateau then
winding about the base of a peak which snow covered to the summit towtered
far above them among the clouds the atmosphere among these peaks was
chill and at night they were glad to descend beyond the ridge into a clump
of hardy trees and build a huge campfire before which to stretch themselves
for rest

   it had been the hardest days march ford had ever experienced  but it
told the most upon the trader whose figure was too corpulent to make walk-
ing a pleasure poor fitch fell asleep immediately after supper and slept
right on until nearly morning when in common with the others he was
awakened by an entirely unlooked for incident
a peruvian paradise



     when the party had sought their blankets the guide assured them there
  was no necessitj of standing watch the stars were shining brightly in an
  unflecked sky  but they awoke just before sunrise in the midst of a mountain
  tempest the thunder was roaring overhead and the lightning crackling
  from peak to peak illuminating the gorge in which they were encamped with
  an unearthly flickering light

     then came the rain-not in drops or in sheets but simply pouring out
  of the heart of a cloud which had torn its way across the face of a neighbor-
  ing peak it was a cloudburst in earnest and in an instant they were all
  wet to the skin there was no shelter at hand from the furious downfall
  and all they could do was to imitate manuel he squatted upon his haunches
  on the shelving side of the gorge and made a tent of his blanket covering
  himself completely

     in a little while the tiny stream at the bottom of the gorge had become a
  rushing roaring torrent sweeping boulders fallen timber and all sorts of
  debris down its course but the stream subsided as fast as it had gathered
  strength when the storm ceased

     the rising sun found them in a drearily saturated state there was no
  dry wood and every vestige of their fire had been swept away

      tassajo and left over cakes dont make a very appetizing breakfast
  do they    said ford ruefully   but this must be part of the-  roughing it  i
  wanted i suppose   then he looked at rodriguez and suddenly burst out
  laughing

      what do you find to laugh at  demanded keeth who had been rum-
  maging over his pack to see that all was right

     but ford brought himself up suddenly in the middle of his laugh and
  glanced around at manuel the guide he stood a little way off with his eyes
  fixed intently upon joses unconscious face the sudden rainfall had played
  sad havoc with the spaniards make-up the grease paint was washed
  completely off in streaks and the cabalistic mark upon his cheek was plainly
  visible

     the instant the indian saw fords eyes turned upon his he withdrew his
  own gaze from the spaniards face and went about some unimportant task as
  coolly as though he had seen nothing but young kinsale was confident
  that he had noted the tattoo mark

     his thoughtless laughter had called keeths attention to the havoc made
  by the storm and he pointed it out to the trader

      confound hit  i ope that bloomin hinjun didnt notice it mut-
  tered the englishman snatching up his paints and beckoning jose to go
  with him

      but he did ford declared to his friend  if theres any truth in the

	yarn that all these indians understand the meaning of that mark wed better
  keep a mighty sharp watch on manuel yonder

     but the guide seemed entirely oblivious of the accident when jose
  and fitch returned the former with the damage repaired the indian did
  not vouchsafe him a glance but keeth took pains to place rodriguez 
  his guard


a peruvian paradise

   eet ees a misfortune but what can one do now-eh wha-at he
asked with a shrug of his shoulders

   after their frugal meal they set off on the blind trail which manuel
seemed to follow more by instinct than by sight if the iirst days jaunt
had been arduous this was doubly so they made scarcely ten miles from
sunrise to sunset the grandeur of the scenery in these peruvian andes
cannot be surpassed even in the himalayas but grand scenery could not
make poor fitch forget the toils of the journey

   since the occurrence of the early morning the white men watched their
guide very closely they feared he would play them some trick and to be
left alone in this wild region with but a fleeting remembrance of the path
over which they had come was not a pleasant possibility

    but how the dickens will we find our way back any way  demanded
ford as they talked the matter over

   that is a risk we must run if we would find the incascave i take it
replied keeth but what do you think senor rodriguez shouldnt
we have reached the three pines you spoke of before this   

    we cannot be a great way from them now if the man is not playing
us false replied the spaniard  but i haf yet to see the first familiar
landmark  

   the pines were not sighted that day  but upon being questioned manuel
declared that he would get them to the place by the middle of the next fore-
noon for fear that he contemplated treason it was agreed that one of the
white men should remain awake all night and this watch was faithfully
kept

   soon after leaving their second nights camping place they began to
descend into a deep valley the sides of the mountain were heavily timbered
and manuel led them through the pathless forest as unerringly as the crow
flies just before noon they came out upon a high bluff overlooking a swiftly
flowing river several rods across as soon as they came out of the timber
jose rodriguez uttered an exclamation of satisfaction

    eet is the same he muttered  i could not be mistak

   recognize the place do you   demanded keeth who walked beside
him

    si senor we be not far from the pines and the wonderful bridge of
which i tol you

   manuel set off up the stream which flowed three or four hundred feet
below them it rapidly narrowed until just after passing a sharp bend
they reached a spot where it was scarcely a dozen yards across a few rods
before them the three huge pine trees leaned over the gulf from the opposite
bank near the trees a great log surely three feet thick at the butt
spanned the abyss

   for heavens sake cried keeth what manner of men must have
been the people who placed that timber in position  

    ah i knew the senor would be surprised said rodriguez showing
his teeth in a smile ees eet not wonderful-eh wh-at  that senor
feetch he added turning to the trader  was done by these same savages
a peruvian paradise



whom you profess to think so poorly of then in a low voice that the
guide might not hear and with a wave of his hand toward the opposite
mountain slope   beyond that stream lies the country of the tribe with
whom i lived so long we must not let this man go farther wit us

    but what shall we do   demanded keeth  how will we get rid of
him

     let us cross and camp for our noon meat i will find some way to rid
us of his presence  

     but can we find our way back without him   asked ford

     that we must reesk

    go ahead said fitch recklessly  him goin to see this ere thing
through wotever comes

   but when they reached the bridge even ronald keeth shrank from
crossing it

   ah senors eet ees simple exclaimed rodriguez noting their
hesitancy

   he motioned manuel to lead the way and leaped upon the end of the
timber himself the guide started across the gulf as nonchalantly as though
he were crossing a perfectly secure bridge with a hand rail on either side
instead of a tree trunk which quivered and shook with every step the
spaniard followed close on his heels

    hold on lets see how they get across said keeth and he and his
two friends watched jose and the guide with intense interest

    but they crossed without mishap and immediately upon feeling the solid
rock beneath his feet jose turned and swung his hat encouragingly for
an instant his back was turned to the guide that instant was evidently the
opportunity for which manuel had been waiting

    before keeth or his comrades could utter the warning shout which rose
to their lips the huge indian had seized the slight form of the spaniard about
the waist he pinioned one arm but jose must have possessed muscles of
steel he twisted about in the giants grasp and seized him in turn by the
throat neither could draw his knife and for a moment they swayed and
struggled  the verge of the precipice

    uttering a loud shout keeth forgetting the swraying bridge sprang upon
the log and ran toward the scene of the battle he drew his pistol from
its sheath as he went but he dared not fire the men were so closely inter-
locked the timber swayed frightfully beneath his feet but he scarcely
noticed the vibration his eyes were on that struggling pair he sawr nothing
else

    suddenly jose tore his other arm lose instantly his freed fingers sought
his belt he drew the knife and like a flash struck it into the guides breast 
the indian staggered back but not for an instant did his grip about his
antagonists body relax gathering his waning powers for one desperate
effort he sprang forward to the edge of the cliff and pitched headfirst into
the gulf carrying the spaniard with him 

    they whirled over and over in the air as they descended striking the
water with a mighty splash at last and disappeared beneath the surface
i

a peruvian paradise

keeth fell face downward upon the timber and clung there with both arms
outstretched striviug to pierce the swiftly flowing water with tear blinded
eyes but neither the indian nor his victim came to the surface again

chapter iv-trapped

   with limbs which almost refused to bear him up keeth finally crept
to the end of the log and stood upon the solid rock ford and the
trader were but a moment behind him in their excitement they crossed
the yawning gulf with scarcely a tremor  but the engineer was so dizzy and
ill he could scarcely stand

     poor jose   exclaimed ford kinsale  we should have kept a closer
watch on that fiendish savage  

     what an awful death   murmured keeth still unable to look over the
cliffs edge without shuddering

     but wot are we goin to do now  demanded fitch

    come said the engineer shaking himself together  we must find
some way to descend this bluff we must find joses body and give it decent
burial at least the river is full of eddies and snags it may be along
shore there

     weve got hourselves to think of first objected fitch

   oh come along lets be unselfish said ford the poor chap is
dead of course  but as keeth says we may recover the body i believe
hed done as much for one of us i must say he was the only spaniard i
ever cottoned to  

   keeth was already examining the rugged face of the bluff it was not
all rock  there were some treacherous looking gravel slopes in a few
moments he began to descend and his comrades trusting themselves to his
leadership followed he had found the only place in the bluff as far as
they could see where descent was possible  but when they got within thirty
feet or so of the foot they were forced to halt from that point the place
was a sheer precipice so smooth that a mountain goat could not have found
a foothold

     got us hin a box mr keeth you ave declared fitch

    oh dry up said ford  we can go back and try again

   hi dont try no more declared the trader with emphasis hive
got enough it looks mighty like we wouldnt be able to crawl back hup
there anyow

   we wont talk about getting up till weve got down said keeth
quietly and he began to uncoil the rope he carried

   there you have it exclaimed ford id forgotten the rope
heres just the place to fasten it

    a huge boulder sunk deep in the bluff hung over the narrow beach be-
low keeth quickly knotted one end of the cable over this projecting rock
and then swung down the remaining distance to the verge of the river ford
and the trader quickly followed him

the shore was not a dozen feet broad at any point within their view and
a peruvian paradise



the river raced along with a sullen murmur the water was low now in
time of freshet the river doubtless filled its bed from bluff to bluff entirely
covering the narrow strip of shingle they had made the descent of
the bank some distance below the bridge there were plenty of little eddies
near the shore and great black snags reached their ugly limbs far out into
the river but the thing which they hoped to find caught among these ob-
structions did not appear the treacherous guide and his victim locked in
that awful embrace seemed to have sunk to the bottom of the stream and
remained there

   they searched the margin of the river as far down as they could go at
the sharp bend half a mile or so below the bridge the shore ceased they
could go no farther the bluff above them looked forbidding and unscal-
able the only path by which they might return to the summit was the
one down which they had scrambled

    come we may as well go back said keeth in despair  poor jose
is beyond our reach  

    you fellows will ave to elp me hup that rope declared fitch gloomily
this cliff climbing haint wot hi built for

    oh well get you up all right said ford  what well do when we
are up again is whats bothering me

    hit looks to me as though we was in a box-thats wot it looks like
dont you believe we can find our way back to hualpa inquired
keeth

    mabbe  replied fitch but hi know bloomin well we cant find
the treasure cave now the dagos gone

     all you think of is the treasure said ford in disgust

    thats wot we started hout for returned the trader stoutly  hits
blessed awkward that jose was killed if ee ad to be killed before ee told
us ow to get to the cave

     youre a cold blooded chap fitch

   but keeth made no comment they reached the point where the rope
had been left dangling from the protruding boulder and keeth prepared to
mount

   ill go up first and give you a lift ford together we can pull mr
fitch up i guess

   he laid hold of the hemp and began to ascend hand over hand bracing
his feet against the rock as he went he had not gone up a dozen feet
however when something gave way above he dropped several feet and the
gravel and broken rock fell about him in a shower

     great heavens keeth    shouted ford   come back  the whole
cliff is falling  

   the trader caught him by the legs and pulled him down through the
falling debris they could see the huge boulder around which the rope had
been fastened toppling slowly outward ford and fitch seized keeths hands
and ran with him along the beach an instant later the mass of rock had fallen
directly upon the spot on which they had stood  tons upon tons of earth and
gravel followed the rock and a huge fissure was made in the bluff side

      b
i

a peruvian paradise

   when the noise ceased and the debris stopped falling the three advent- 
urers gazed at one another with pallid faces not only had they narrowly
escaped an awful death but they were now stranded upon the margin of the
river the path to the summit of the bluff was obliterated 

    trapped by jove   exclaimed ford

   but keeth ran back to the heap of earth and rock and rescued the rope
which had already been of such service to them

   we wont say that till we try up stream he said returning to his
comrades  come along 

    what do you think fitch  demanded ford

   fitch may have been pessimistic as regarded small things  but now that
a real catastrophe faced them he developed a genuine english bulldog grit

    we haint dead yet he declared shaking his head  him not goin
to spend the rest of my days down ere-not if hi know myself  

   but after tramping by the margin of the stream for several miles and com-
ing to no point where the bluff was scalable even he began to lose hope

   were getting deeper and deeper into the country of those indians
of whom jose told us said keeth if we should fall in with them
it might go harder with us than it did with him i dont fancy remain-
ing three years a captive as he did

    what will you do  cried ford who was quite disheartened  stand
here and wait for the first freshet to drown you im going ahead if i walk
a hundred miles along this confounded shore there must be some way to
get to the summit of the bank  

   but the way did not appear and just before daylight faded from the sky
and the night shadows settled upon the surface of the waters their further
progress was barred by a wide break in the shore the river lapped the
rocky wall there was not even a narrow shelf to offer a foothold so they
made themselves as comfortable as circumstances allowed and prepared to
spend the night

  chapter v-a rescue and a menace

   ford and the trader slept like logs after the fatigues of the day  but
ronald keeth was awake long before the first finger of light traced the out-
line of the distant mountain peaks their situation shut into the gorge as
they appeared to be disturbed him to be lost in this barren wilderness was
bad enough  but to be inclosed upon a narrow strip of land scarcely ten
yards wide at its broadest point and in places so narrow that only a footpath
separated the insurmountable cliff from the black river was infinitely worse

   he arose from his uncomfortable couch as soon as it was light enough in
the gorge to see and examined the strip of water which had halted them the
night before the bluff was a sheer precipice here with not the faintest
sign of a path but his anxious eye caught sight of a weather beaten stub
protruding from the gravelly shore beyond this belt of water once a tree
had stood there  but some furious freshet had broken it off three or four feet
from the ground
a peruvian paradise



   the river was deep and ran like a millrace between the spot on which he
stood and this old stump no man could breast the fierce current supposing
even that it was not too deep to be waded but keeth was an ingenious
fellow and had experienced life in some of the wilder portions of the states
before coming to peru he had accompanied a united states exploring ex-
pedition through arizona and new mexico before his twenty first birthday
and had learned in those cattle raising countries something of the value of a
thirty foot rope the instant he saw the stump he saw as well a way out
of the present difficulty

   he caught up the coil of hemp made a running noose and planted
his feet firmly  the edge of the water preparatory to making a cast

     if the ropes long enough to reach and that old stub holds were all
right he thought as he swung the coils about his head

    it was a long cast and the loop did not fall over the stub at the first or
second trial  but keeth was delighted to see it drop just where he wanted
it to the next time however when he had drawn it taut he found it so
short that he could not fasten it at the side of the inlet and he had to shout
for his companions to help him ford and the englishman came running
with their rifles in their hands fully believing that he had been attacked by
indians  but they forgave him for disturbing their morning nap when they
discovered what he had done

     hits a great ead you ave mr keeth declared fitch  hid never
thought of it

    but will the stump hold asked ford kinsale

    well all get hold of the line and try it replied keeth we know
the rope is all right if it holds ill cross over and help you fellows
across  

   the stub proved to be firmly set in the ground and without waiting for
breakfast keeth removed his clothing and prepared to make the passage of
the river he wrapped his garments in his blanket swathed his gunlock
in oily rags and slinging both bundle and weapon over his shoulder plunged
into the water ford hung to the end of the rope and steadied him and
although keeths feet were almost immediately swept from beneath him he
managed to reach the opposite shore without serious difficulty he hurried
into his damp clothing and helped fitch across and then flung the rope back
to ford and with the traders assistance drew his friend and the provisions
over the flood

   well i pray heaven we wont have to cross another such place
kinsale panted as they drew him to land im not half as anxious to see
the incas cave as i was when poor jose was telling us about it

   i thought you were looking for lots of excitement this vacation said
keeth slily

   oh were having too much fun declared ford ruefully  i didnt
know what i was talking about if ever i get back to callao i shant ask
for another vacation for ten years  

    they marched along the shingle for some miles further fortunately finding
it good traveling all the way  but it was nearly noon before they reached what


a peruvian paradise

seemed a promising path to the top of the cliffs the foot of this trail was
extremely rugged but it looked better above and with keeth in the lead
they started up before they had climbed fifty feet the path became quite
easy to follow in fact it showed the baud of man in its construction

   it was a gradual incline extending along the face of the bluff becoming
wider and wider as they mounted upward there were marks of great
chisels where slabs of the soft rock had been split off and while still a hun-
dred feet or more from the summit the adventurers reached a place where
the ancient constructors of the road had used the waste material to build a
substantial wall four feet or more in height along the outer edge here
the way was broad enough for four men to walk abreast the mortar which
held the stone in place was still as hard as adamant the rocks themselves
in fact instead of the mortar had crumbled with age

    what do you think of such engineering as this   demanded ford

   it is wonderful declared keeth  this must have been built three
hundred years ago-possibly at a still more ancient date-yet the best work
of civilized peoples today cannot surpass it what giants those old incas
must have been for they had few tools to aid them this was all done by
sheer bodily strength they had  hoisting apparatus

    hand do you mean to say them hinjuns did this   cried fitch

   they certainly did replied the engineer probably the road was
built about the time that pizarro conquered the country

   fitch shook his head over it

   they must ave been a deal different from the niggers hive been used
to he said

   they were still more astonished when they had gone some rods further
on rounding a corner in the precipitous wall they found that the ancient
workmen had tunneled a spur of rock to reach the summit of the cliff the
tunnel was a dozen yards in length and opened out upon the plateau on top
of the bluff and right before the mouth of the tunnel were the ruins of
several stone houses built against the side of the mountain

    an ancient town-almost like the cliff dwellings ive seen in colorado
declared keeth  jose told us nothing about this i wonder how far we are
from the town of the indians among whom he was a captive  i only
hope-

   he broke off with a startled exclamation on the verge of the cliff a
few rods from the old tunnel was the figure of a woman she stood in a
listening attitude but with her face turned away from the white men
evidently she had heard their voices but had not discovered from which
direction there were approaching

   she was an indian girl-almost a child in appearance-as lithe and grace-
ful as a deer her skin was of a brilliant bronze hue and a great mass of
coal black hair hung to her waist  her head was guiltless of other covering
she was dressed in a tunic-like garment which fell below her knees and was
open at the throat displaying the full roundness of her bosom a broad
sash of strange texture and brilliant hue held the garment together at her
waist her feet were shod with sandals over her shoulder was slung by a
a peruvian paradise



thong a quiver of arrows and she held a short bow in her hand in keeths
startled vision she seemed a diana in bronze

   he was speechless with amazement  but ford and the trader noticing
the abrupt termination of their comrades sentence glanced up also a sharp
exclamation from the englishman made the girl turn she saw them and
wonder filled her face her great eyes black as night gazed deep into
keeths own even in that brief instant he felt the magic of her glance

   but she remained motionless only a moment like a flash she fitted an
arrow to her bow and a wild bird-like call burst from her lips the arrow
was trained full at keeths breast and her brown fingers trembled on the
string he dared not move as she began to step lightly backward her eyes
still fixed upon him

   suddenly ford uttered a shout of warning the girl evidently forget-
ting the proximity of the cliffs brink made a misstep in a breath she
had plunged backward into the abyss  the arrow flew high in the air and
a piercing cry reached the ears of her horrified audience as she disappeared

     my god   cried ford   shes gone  

     shell be dashed to bits on them rocks below   said fitch his usually
ruddy face perfectly colorless

   but keeth ran forward to the brink of the precipice he expected to see
the poor creatures mangled body bounding from rock to rock to the foot of
the cliff instead of the horrible picture which his imagination had conjured
he beheld her lying in the fan shaped top of a stunted tree which grew out of a
fissure in the cliff just below him her bow had fallen from her hand and
she lay seemingly stunned upon this insecure resting place

   quick knot that rope around me under the arms he commanded

 she may slip at any moment hang on the rope with all your might and
dont let it chafe against the edge of the rock

   he divested himself of his coat and ammunition belt as he spoke and in
a moment was lowered over the brink his feet scarcely gained a foothold
on the rock but ford and the englishman eased him steadily down occa-
sionally a bit of rock gave way beneath his weight and went crashing into the
gorge and his hands were torn and bleeding before he reached the tree the
girl had not fallen more than twenty feet  but the shock had evidently de-
prived her of consciousness she lay amid the broken branches with her
eyes closed and head hanging limply over the abyss

   resting one foot upon a protuberance on the face of the rock and the
other on the limb of a tree keeth was able to raise her in his arms she
did not stir and holding her tightly against his breast with his left arm he
fended himself off from the cliff with the other hand and shouted to his
comrades to draw him up he could no longer see where to place his feet
and once or twice swung against the rough wall with cruel force but he
kept his own body between the cliff and his burden and she was not injured
in the least before they reached the summit her eyes opened and she gazed
up into his face

    keep still dont move he said and although she could not under-
stand the words his voice evidently reassured her she did not seem


a peruvian paradise

frightened nor struggle as keeth expected she would instead she lay
passive in his arms although she must have realized their danger

   then in a moment keeth felt fords hands on his shoulders he was
dragged upon the rock still bearing the girl in his arms and set her down
safely upon her feet his clothing was torn to rags his hands were
bruised and bleeding and there was a long gash on the side of his face the
girl darted away from them like a startled creature of the wood evidently
unhurt by her fall but she did not go far for finding herself unmolested
she stopped and looked back	

   by jove keeth youre a sight cried ford but get into your
coat and come on we must make a break from here

    whats the matter demanded ronald still a bit dazed

    theres indians about they may be down on us any minute
yes said fitch  while you was a-riskin your life for that ussie we
saw one of em among the rocks up there weve got to run for hit  

   keeth picked up his coat and started to put it on but a cry from the
girl caused him to look up out of the timber before them came a crowd of
men armed with spears and clubs they were indians-of a lighter com-
plexion than those usually seen in peru-and were dressed in all the savage
magnificence of an uncivilized people

   they were clothed in little but a short tunic and sandals but there were
brilliantly colored feathers in their hair and their arms and ankles were
adorned with heavy bands of gold they were fierce looking keen eyed
men and without noticing the white mens superior weapons marched
solemnly toward them their huge spears were advanced threateningly
and two or three had already fitted arrows to their bowstrings at their
head wralked an old man with wrinkled parchment-like face dressed in a
long white robe of finely woven llama wool

   great scott keeth ejaculated ford were in for it shall we
fight or run  

   fitch had already unslung his rifle and raised it to his shoulder  but
keeth roused himself in time to strike the weapon up

    not on your life man   he cried  one of those follows with the
bows would spit you like a dried codfish keep still and lets see what they
want it will be time enough to fight when they try to disarm us  

    but theyll surround us in a minute growled fitch

    stand back to the tunnel here they cant get behind us then re-
turned keeth  keep your eyes open and dont let them get the better of
us by a sudden sally  

   the indians had halted a few yards away and the old man advanced a
step he addressed some words to the white men which none of them un-
derstood it did not sound like the dialects of either the coast or the moun-
tain tribes with whom they had previously fallen in

   whats that hes saying demanded ford  can you understand
the gibberish fitch  

    not hi try them with spanish mr keeth suggested the trader
 most hinjuns understand that
a peruvian paradise



    keeth thus adjured exercised such knowledge as he possessed in that
direction the indians faces did not show that they had understood him
they waited in silence a moment and then the old man said something to his
followers

    at once the spears were raised again and the bows bent

    its fight i reckon said keeth between his teeth  get ready to
jump behind that wall yonder if we can once get under cover we can wipe
em out before they can send for reinforcements be sure your magazines
are full

    but at this critical moment when it seemed as though hostilities would
at once begin the girl who had looked on in silence suddenly darted between
the hostile parties she knelt gracefully at the old mans feet and began to
speak he listened attentively and as she continued he waved his hand to
the men behind him and their spears were lowered again the three white
me looked on with anxious faces uncertain as to the outcome

chapter vi-guests or captives

    the girl was explaining to her people the incident which had taken place
just before their appearance and was pleading for the lives of the white men
who had rescued her keeth was sure of this and as he watched the old
mans face he gathered hope it kindled with love and pride as he gazed
down upon the kneeling girl and the young american shrewdly saw that
through their effort in her behalf they had reached the old indians heart
it was probable that she was his daughter or granddaughter and there was
little wonder that the stern man loved her barbaric as was her dress and
ornaments keeth was forced to admit that he had never seen so lovely a
creature

   the color came and went in her dark cheeks as she talked  her eyes
shone  every motion was grace itself the tightly fitting gown displayed
every rounded curve of her form and although she was so petite the matur-
ity of her figure was evident she was a true daughter of the tropics

    but the affair was too serious to admit of much thought upon the girls
beauty it was in her power keeth believed to avert bloodshed and he
prayed fervently that she might be successful the fierce looking men who
were gathered in the background could not be driven back by one discharge
of the rifles they would fight till the last one dropped  and if blood was
shed and he and his comrades should be finally captured keeth knew that
they would suffer the greater punishment

    finally the old man lifted the girl to her feet with her hand in his he
advanced toward the three white men and again spoke to keeth the in-
tonation of the language was pleasant to the ear  there were few harsh
sounds in it but as far as keeth was concerned it might have been
choctaw he couldnt understand a syllable the old man talked earnestly
pointed to the white men then to himself and his companions and waved
his hand to include the surrounding territory keeth guessed that he was
declaring the fact that he and his people were the only rightful possessors


a peruvian paradise

of the country thereabout and that the white men were trespassers pos-
sibly he was inquiring as to their business in the mountains so as best he
could keeth replied in spanish hoping that the old fellow could understand
his very pacific speech but if he did he gave no sign

   instead he uttered another long harangue and keeth began to feel that
they might stand there for a week and talk without understanding each
other but here the girl came to the rescue when the old man ceased she
looked to him for permission and as he gravely bowed she tripped timidly
to keeths side she laid her hand upon his rifle and pointed to the guns
of his companions then waving her hand for the waiting indians to ap-
proach she showed that he and his friends were to give up their rifles and go
with her people

    they wrant to disarm us  evidently they know something about the
destructive power of these guns said keeth speaking to his comrades
 what do you think about it 

    hi say dont give hup the guns exclaimed fitch  hif they know
hennything about em theyll shoot us if they get em in their ands

   not if we unload them and keep the ammunition returned keeth
 its very necessary that we should not arouse their anger it is likely that
there are plenty more of them not far from here we do not know this
country and they do we are in a ticklish position

    cant we make a break for it beat them off for a while and get to that
bridge after dark  asked ford  once across that we could cut the log
off and then they nor nobody else could follow us

     well kinsale if we tried to use our guns how long do you suppose it
would be before we were spitted on some of those ugly looking spears i
for one dont wash to attempt it keeth declared

    but it haint sense for us to give hup the guns cried fitch

   well weve got our revolvers i dont believe they know that these
little things in our belts are dangerous their primitive knowledge of fire-
arms was probably handed down to them from their forefathers the mak-
ing of firearms was not a fine art in the days of pizzaro and his brave con-
questadors lets slip the cartridges out of the magazines and let em have
the guns what say   

   well youre the captain said ford slowly pocahontas yonder
seems to have taken a fancy to you and maybe shell see that the old graven
image nor her bare legged countrymen dont hurt us here goes  

   he removed the cartridges from his rifle and held it out toward the
savages one of them stepped gravely forward and received it keeth
followed suit but fitch gave up his very unwillingly

    hi tell you well see the time well wish we adnt done it he
growled

   when the rifles were in their hands the indians fell in behind the three
white men whom the old man beckoned to follow him the girl walked by
his side

   they marched into the forest which covered the mountain side there
was a broad path cut through the timber leading straight up the slope for
a peruvian paradise	

nearly a mile they remained in the shadow of the wood then they came
out upon a broad plateau great fissures opened in the rock in all directions
and they had to pick their steps with care around boiling springs and holes
from which clouds of sulphurous steam escaped

     nice country this said ford in disgust

   but keeth glanced about him with appreciative eyes he saw unmistak-
able signs of the richest mineral deposits

    they were nearly an hour in crossing the plateau then they descended
through a narrow ravine which turned and twisted like a snake and sud-
denly without warning came out into a most luxuriant valley the white
men could not suppress exclamations of surprise at the view which met their
eyes

   a long gently undulating stretch of prairie lay before them it was
surrounded  all sides by unbroken cliffs as far as they could see the
opening through which they had entered the miniature paradise was the
only entrance to it at its widest point it might have been three miles
broad there were great patches of luxuriant grass and here and there
small gardens there were three or four groups of houses but by far the
larger number were just at the left of the ravine through which they had
come and stood in a rude circle about a great flat roofed structure which
covered surely an acre of ground

   all the houses were of gray stone without the least ornamentation
they looked as stern and forbidding as the cliffs which surrounded the
valley a little stream like a crinkled silver ribbon crossed the prairie
and disappeared at the base of one of the towering cliffs herds of llamas
were grazing in the meadows  but no other animals were visible

    the old man and the girl led the way toward this nearest group of dwell-
ings as they approached the people began to swarm out but although
they were evidently very curious regarding the three white men they stood
respectfully aside at a motion of the old mans hand evidently he was a
power in the tribe

    in a few minutes they reached the center of the little town where stood
the great building its front was a vast porch the mighty roof upheld by
rudely graven pillars and before the porch in the center of what might be
termed the plaza wras a broad low altar the armed escort went at once
into the main building the temple keeth decided but the old man and
the maiden led their guests to a row of small houses just in front of the
principal entrance the man opened the door of one and motioned ford
and fitch to step within but when keeth tried to follow them he waved
him back and pointed to a somewhat larger house beyond

    keeth hesitated  he did not fancy being separated from his friends but
ford who saw his hesitation said 

    go ahead ronald were in for it now and might as well go the
whole figure his nibs evidently thinks ou are a great chief and youll
get better treatment than we i wouldnt mind taking dinner with that girl
myself

     if anything happens fire your pistol keeth said in a low voice and


a peruvian paradise

then suffered himself to be led to the other dwelling he found that it
consisted of but one room  nevertheless it was light and airy the windows
were mere slits in the thick walls  but the door was a heavy wooden one
hung upon roughly wrought hinges of some kind of metal-just what he
could not decide

    he was left to himself but a few minutes and then a tall woman entered with
a jar of water on her head and a pile of garments over her arm she placed
the water on the floor and laid down the garments then bowing deeply
but without looking at him she went out

    good   thought keeth  a chance for a bath and something better
than these rags i hope to put on i wonder if the other boys will fare as
well   

   but when he came to look the garments over he was a little doubtful
about donning them there was a shirt of finely spun llama wool cut very
low in the neck and sleeveless it clung close to his body and reached half
way between his waist and his knees the tunic of cured skin probably
from the same useful animal was likewise sleeveless and fell scarcely lower
than the shirt there were sandals too-and queer enough they were the
soles were covered by a series of small scales of metal and upjn examination
he found that metal to be gold 

   talk about the riches of the incas   he gasped when he made this
discovery  why these people dont know the value of the stuff

   but he was a sight when he was dressed 

   wont ford guy me   he thought as he tried to see his manly pro-
portions as he stood in the light from the window  but i cant wear those
tattered and torn clothes i had on then i might offend my entertainers if
i refused to wear these  

   at that moment there was a gentle rap at the door he turned about and
hastened to throw it open the girl who had already so well proved her
friendliness for him and his comrades stood without and the tall woman
who was evidently a servant was with her

   they entered and the girl taking a small jar from the womans hands
approached him she smiled up into his face and touched the wound on his
cheek and pointed to his bruised hands removing the cover of the jar she
began to bathe his wounds with its contents it was an ointment which gave
relief at once as she rubbed it gently in with her fingers keeth thrilled
beneath her touch and felt himself blushing furiously somehow he
couldnt make himself look upon her as merely an ignorant savage and
felt vexed with ford because he had laughingly referred to her as   poca-
hontas  

   when she had gone the woman spread a cloth upon the floor and brought
an abundant supply of food there was some boiled meat-keeth thought
it probably kid-with vegetables not unlike mealy potatoes and cakes of
coarse flour there was also a jar of liquor which although of a rather
pungent odor was not unpleasant to the taste he made a hearty repast
and when he had finished saw by the waning light that it was almost night

   he was left undisturbed until it was quite dark once he heard the loud
a peruvian paradise



clangor of brazen cymbals from the direction of the temple and the hum of
many voices in the courtyard but after a while the concourse of people
dispersed and then there came a commanding knock upon his door he
opened it two gigantic indians armed with their ever present spears
stood outside and beckoned him to come with them his belt was buckled
around his waist beneath the tunic and he felt of the butts of his revolvers
to make sure they were in place before he obeyed -then he stepped forth
and was led toward the temple porch

   before the door the armed men were relieved by a priestly looking indian
in a long white robe who motioned keeth to follow him he carried a
a torch which lit the labyrinth of passages through which he guided the
white man finally they halted before a heavy door and his guide rapped
keeth was sure that they had descended some distance beneath the level of
the ground yet the air in the passages was cool and sweet these wonder-
ful people had some knowledge of ventilation

   a voice-a voice which he recognized-replied to the knock the guide
touched the door and it swung inward he motioned keeth to step within
and when he had done so the door immediately closed and the young man
found himself in a long gloomy apartment the high roof of which was up-
held by sculptured columns at the further end of the room a single lamp
hanging by chains from the roof shed a dim glow upon a stone table at
the table sat the old man whose acquaintance he had already made

   keeth walked slowly down the room and came at length to the table
the light revealed the brown face of the patriarch with all its innumerable
wrinkles but despite his appearance of extreme age the eyes glowed
brightly in the half darkness keeth found himself strangely attracted by
those eyes they seemed to scrutinize his very soul and hold his own gaze
captive

   for a few moments there was silence between them the old man was
looking his visitor over and a little smile curled the corners of his mouth as
he noted his fiue proportions now so well displayed by the indian dress
upon the table before him were some rolls of what looked like parchment
frayed and yellowed by time keeth saw that they were covered with markings
in various colored dyes or inks and they seemed like ancient manuscripts

   suddenly the old man spoke and instead of the unintelligible tongue
which he had previously used he said in the purest of castilian yet with
an accent which sounded strange to keeth accustomed as he was to the
speech of the south american spaniard 

    senor who art thou and whence comest thou  why dost thou seek to
penetrate the fastnesses of these sierras which have so long been the refuge
of my people  

chapter vii-the fiat goes forth

   keeth was astounded upon the occasion of his first meeting with the
aged indian the latter had not made even a sign which led him to believe
that he understood spanish he now stood dumb before him


a peruvian paradise

    speak senor said the indian somewhat sternly  what dost thou
seek  

   then the young man found his voice he realized that he had a very
delicate task before him it would never do to tell the entire truth the
principal reason for the presence of his friends and himself in the mountains
must remain hidden

    we had lost our way he said bowing respectfully to his interrogator
when you and your people found us we entered the mountains many
leagues to the south of here he stretched out his hand in what he sup-
posed to be the right direction   our guide fell from the cliff at the three
pines where the tree is laid across the canyon and was drowned

   the old man inclined his head to show that he knew the spot

   we climbed down the bluff to find his body and were unable to get back
therefore we pursued the path by the rivers edge until we found the road
to the summit of the cliff made by your people  

    built by our fathers murmured the indian

   then senor you know how we came suddenly upon the girl your
daughter--

   not my daughter stranger interposed the old man gently my
sons child i am an old man senor-an old old man i have been a
priest of my people since my youth but how earnest thou in these sierras 
who was thy guide  

   an indian replied keeth

  his name

    manuel was all the name we knew him by

    it is not an indian name said the old priest quietly

    no senor he probably was named by the spaniards

   a cloud crossed the others face  and senor art thou not a spaniard  
    no i am of a different nation i am an american

    we have no knowledge here of nations and peoples ssid the old man
sadly  the world is large senor  he asked the question with childish
curiosity

   very large indeed replied keeth

   and our mountains-these mighty peaks-are but a small portion of
it 

   again keeth replied affirmatively

    then why do you come here senor why do you seek to disturb
the unfortunate children of the incas

   the old mans face flushed and he rose suddenly to his feet we
have been conquered the brutal spaniards drove our fathers into these
fastnesses ages ago senor they lusted for gold-for treasure why dost
thou and thy companions come here	

   it is not of our own choice that we are here replied keeth pacifically

     not here-no  but you came into our country-you seek out the hid-
ing places of my unfortunate people dost thou lust for gold too 

   keeth was silent he did not know how to reply to the old priests
vehement query
a peruvian paradise



    you are not a spaniard senor-i can believe it for i can scarce under-
stand your speech the knowledge of the spanish tongue has been handed
down from priest to priest since our fathers came into these mountains to
escape their conquerors we are all that are left-this handful of my
people-of the true descendants of the incas we have kept ourselves free
from contamination of the spanish we await the time when quesalcoatl
shall return and reestablish his people in their former power  

   he dropped the spanish and with hands clasped before him broke out
into a hymn or psalm in his own tongue his face kindled his body
swayed backward and forward as he recited the rhythmic lines keeth stood
in awe suddenly the other ceased and coming quickly from behind the
table seized the young american by the wrist

   senor answer me truthfully by the god thou servest why dost
thou come here  is it for riches  

    these mountains are full of mineral wealth replied keeth lamely

      the spaniards searched out our old mines and our treasure houses  
said the priest  gold is their god we have no rich mines now we
only work those which were abandoned by our fathers and their treasure
caves are even hidden from their children by the will of the gods we have
naught for thee senor why didst thou come to disturb my people 

    we will gladly go from you oh priest responded keeth  put us
on the trail to hualpa and we will never trouble you again-i swear it  
nay nay  that cannot be my people would not hear to it said
the old man sadly   besides i know not the place thou namest we have
no knowledge of the outside world our intercourse with the poor creatures
from among whom thy guide must have come is very slight nay senor 
thou art here  here thou must stay   

    keeth turned pale at the words a prisoner for life among these people 
death were better

   thou palest senor-yet thou art a brave man said the priest

  hadst thou not been i would have had no imozene to bless my last days
i am an old man  soon i shall go to my fathers but while i live thou and
thy companions shall be well treated

     but priest  cried keeth  why should you keep us it was  fault
of ours that we fell upon this place

     senor said the old man shaking his head  thou hast not told me all
the truth thou mayest not be a spaniard  but all men of thy fair skin
esteem gold above all other possessions if thou couldst thou wouldst bring
into our mountains many like thee to dig for treasure this is our refuge
the old man drew himself up to his full height  my people are brave
they have all the courage of the great incas but they cannot withstand
the onslaught of thy people they would fight for their homes till the last
drop of blood was shed but it would avail not we cannot let thee go
 i think you look for that which would not occur senor murmured
keeth yet he knew the old man spoke the truth the time would come
when white men would overrun the andes and wrest from their serried
sides the treasure which he believed was hidden there


a peruvian paradise

   the priest suddenly seized both his hands and gazed deep into his eyes

    look upon me my son   he commanded drawing keeths gaze despite
his will to his own flaming eyes  thou shalt see what the result of thy
search for gold wouldst be

   the young man fought against the influence which he felt was slowly
overpowering him his brain reeled  the columns upholding the dimly
lit room seemed circling about him  he strove to withdraw his hands
from the priests grasp but the will which enthralled him conquered all
opposition slowly he sank back upon the rough bench beside the table
he fought no longer he was passive in the priests hands the voice
of the wonderful old man seemed to reach his dulled ear from a great dis-
tance

   	 look    commanded the priest   behold the end of thy plans oh
worshipper of the god of gold   

   keeths eyes slowly closed  and yet he saw the wall of the cavernous
room seemed like a cloud it was a cloud in motion rolling writhing
changing form continually

   suddenly it opened and through the mysterious gloom a picture took
shape and grew under his gaze it was a precipice and hanging from its
verge by a slender thread of hemp was a man upholding the slight figure of
a woman the mans face was his own  the girl was the indian maiden
whose life he had saved that very day quickly this picture passed he
saw his companions and himself in the strange city of the descendants of the
incas these first visions were indistinct  but as he looked those which fol-
lowed were plainer

   he saw himself and ford and fitch in what looked like a great arched
cave the walls glittered with gems heaps of golden bars such as jose
rodriguez had brought away from the incas treasure cave flashed back the
light of their torches but always with them was the face of the girl imo-
zene no picture as they passed in kaleidoscopic rapidity before his eyes
was complete without her

   then the cloud writhed and twisted like a mortal in agony and from out
of it appeared visions of great rocks seamed with glittering gold he saw
men mining the precious metal  first himself and his comrades  then others
joined them houses and towns sprang up on the rugged plateaus of the
mountains the miners increased and then he saw the peaceful valley of
the indians again-but oh how changed  the light on this picture was
dim but he beheld the prostrate forms of dead men and pools of blood and
fearful strife the miners were battling with the ancient occupants of the
valley

   he saw himself fighting in the ranks of the victorious white men he
gave and received blows the din of battle was in his ears then the
awful carnage ceased the valley was dotted with the bodies of the dead
there were no more of the children of the incas to battle for their homes
and altars

   yet the man whom he recognized as himself fought on he was opposed
by but one enemy-a figure so slight so ethereal that it evaded his fierce
a peruvian paradise	

onslaughts and for a long time escaped his vengeance it was covered with
a mantle and its face he could not see but at length his sword clove his
enemy through he pulled the dripping blade from the inert body and
waved it over his head in triumph but as the body of his foe fell the
mantle came away from the face and it was revealed it was the white dead
face of the girl imozene 

   keeth shrieked aloud at the awful sight he struggled with unseen
hands  he fought for breath and then of a sudden he found himself
lying in the old priests arms who held a cup of some liquor to his lips

   drink he commanded and as keeth obeyed the old man said
 what thou hast seen remember as thou seest so shall it be if my people
let thee go forget not oh rash man  

chapter viii-reviewing the situation

   it was some minutes before keeth regained his composure the ner-
vous strain engendered by his involuntary trance had shaken him terribly

    you are a wonderful man priest he murmured  no one ever took
my will from me before and showed me what was in his thought

   the old man smiled quietly  thou art mistaken senor he said  i
did not show thee that which i imagiued think not i have played thee
some childs trick i know not what thou didst see if the gods revealed
to thee that which would follow thy rash purposes be warned thereby i
am but their servant  

   keeth looked upon him earnestly he understood something of the
power which the old man had shown him it was a form of hypnotism  but
evidently what he had seen had not been suggested by the priest never
could the old man have beheld that last awful picture and remained so calm
the american was greatly perturbed

    thou art a noble young man stranger   pursued the priest   although
we must detain thee thou shalt have such courtesy as befits thy rank  thy
companions too shall be well treated i shall esteem it an honor to take
thee into my own household  but now thou wilt return to the house where
thou art lodged   he struck a sharp blow upon a brazen gong with a little
hammer and the priest who had guided keeth through the temple appeared
and beckoned him to accompany him

   they passed swiftly through the silent corridors once more mounted the
long flights of stone steps and at length reached the porch here the two
waiting guards conducted him back to his house

   the heavy door was closed but it wras not barred he could have gone
out at any time for he doubted if a watch was set upon his movements but
it would be of no use to leave the town there was only one way out of
the valley and without doubt that way was well guarded the lack of sen-
tinels assured him that his captors considered escape absolutely impossible

   he found a pile of robes at one side of the room and after arranging this
bed lay down and slept soundly till morning he was awakened just before
light by a terrible clangor on the plaza and springing from his couch ran to


a peruvian paradise

the window a great crowd of indians were gathered before the temple but
it was still so dark that he could not see what was going on so after a
moments hesitation he opened his door and slipped out

   the sky in the east was aglow with the rising sun but as yet it had not
appeared above the rugged cliffs which shut in the valley here it was still
dark he could see the people thronging into the open court before the
temple there must have been nearly a thousand of them-men women and
children the noise which had awakened him was made by two white robed
priests standing at either end of the porch beating great gongs which they
held in their hands

   soon a procession appeared at the entrance of the temple and the gongs
ceased but the priests leading the procession had small cymbals which the
continued to clash most noisily  but these tiny cymbals gave out a high
shrill note not at all displeasing to the ear

   the priests marched slowly out upon the porch two by two those
who had no cymbals swung metal dishes of burning incense which filled the
whole place with its pungent odor the priests filed down the steps and
arranged themselves about the altar  and then the old man appeared an
attendant led forward a kid and it was seized and thrown upon the altar on
which a pile of fuel had already been laid

   the high priest held the struggling animal down with his left hand
raising a huge bronze knife aloft in his other the people chanted in their
musical tongue while the light increased in the sky and the shadows stole
away from the valley

   suddenly the sun appeared it shot up from behind a peak of the mount-
ain and its first beam rested full upon the face and figure of the high priest
the chant changed to a shout and the knife was plunged into the throat
of the sacrifice another attendant ran with a blazing torch and in a
moment the flames from the pile on the altar were flashing skyward the
voice of the concourse of indians rose like the deep full notes of an organ
the chant was the most solemn thing to which the american had ever
listened

   then they dispersed and keeth went back to his place wondering ex-
ceedingly

   after his breakfast had been brought him and he had eaten it he started
out to find ford kinsale and bob fitch nobody molested him and he
easily discovered the house in which they were lodged he saw that the
door was open and looked within his friends were still at breakfast sitting
cross legged on the floor and evidently enjoying their meal extremely

    theres one thing about it fitch ford was saying  these bare leg-
ged heathens dont intend to starve us

    mabbe theyre fatting us hup for to sacrifice us responded the
cockney gloomily

    nonsense 

   ye cant tell sir hi ad a cousin-a sailor ee was-an ee was
wrecked among the south sea cannibals ee said ee was never treated
better in is life as regarded eating
a peruvian paradise



   oh get out these people arent cannibals hullo heres one of
em now

   ford glanced up sideways at keeth standing in the doorway he didnt
recognize him until his eyes reached his face and then he sat stock still
with a bowl of something in one hand and a cake in the other and stared in
round eyed amazement fitchs attention was attracted also by his com-
panions long silence

     wy him blest if it haint mr keeth   exclaimed the trader

   of course it is responded keeth in some disgust whats the
matter with you ford dont be an idiot  

    but ford dropped his eatables and fairly rolled on the ground in the ex-
cess of his hilarity

   oh oh oh   he shouted just look at him fitch   the white
chief of the incas   oh this is rich keeth wont you be burnt a deep
rich brick red if you go dancing around in those togs you look like a
scotch broad sword dancer you do what you going to do  marry poca-
hontas and settle down with these people   

    keeth couldiv t help grinning himself

     get up and dont act so like a fool he said  i had to put on some-
thing besides those rags of mine and this was all they had i shall have to
wear em till i can get my measurements to my tailor in new york and he
sends me something different  

     thats nice said ford cheerfully

   dont laugh so loud though pursued keeth both you fellows
may come to it yourselves  

      how so  are they going to make us don their attire   

     no  but what youve got on wont last forever

     what do you mean   demanded ford sobered at once

     i mean replied keeth  that our friend the old priest tells me that
he is under the painful necessity of keeping us here the remainder of our
natural lives how does that strike you  

   great scott ejaculated ford grave enough now you dont
mean that  

      i certainly do i had an interview with him last night and that was
the outcome of it he promises that we shall be treated well but we shall
have to stay here

     stay ere   repeated fitch his pig-like eyes wide open  not if hi
know myself  

       thems m sentiments    quoted ford

   thats all very well said keeth you neednt think i dont ap-
preciate the situation too  but merely saying we wont stay will not help us
out of the difficulty

     i didnt know but you had already promised to be his son in law said
ford slyly

     come said keeth his eyes flashing dangerously this is no time
for fooling it is a serious matter  but we must talk and move circumspectly
jose rodriguez got away from these same people  what man has done man


a peruvian paradise

can do well find a way to escape too but at present i think we had
better seem to acquiesce in the priests decision i think because of what
we did for the girl-who by the way is his granddaughter not his daughter
ford--he is inclined to be friendly to us  but how the rest of the indians
feel about it i dont know wed best go easy

   well go easy fast enough if we once get the chance to go at all
murmured ford

    hif you think bob fitch is goin to be shut hup in this bloomin valley
for the rest of his natural life youre mistaken said the cockney  but as
mr keeth says there haint no use a-rushin things so if hits all the
same to you hill finish my breakfast

   but ford had lost his appetite and followed keeth outside where they
could talk together undisturbed sitting in the sun by the wall of the house
keeth told him all that had occurred during his interview with the old priest
 that old chap must be the very devil was fords comment

    he is a wonderful man responded keeth  but theres nothing so
very remarkable about the hypnotic power he displayed although i never
met the mesmerist before who could control me  

      but all that stuff you say you sawt- 

    ive studied that out interrupted keeth  i was dazed by it all last
night but ive been thinking about it this morning he couldnt have seen
what i did if he had hed have acted differently he couldnt have helped
showing it

    then he didnt suggest the pictures which you thought you saw

    i suggested them myself i saw what was in my own mind or what
was the legitimate outgrowth of the thoughts which filled my mind at the
moment he placed me in the trance he was more than half right when he
said that if he let us go we would in the end destroy him and his people on
that plateau across which we came and at other points in the mountains i
have seen sure signs of rich deposits of nitrate and other minerals which
would pay men well to look into when once the riches of these upper
andes are known people will flock here and that will mean death to this
handful of an already down trodden people

   seems to me said ford gloomily that youre dreadfully tender
hearted toward them to my mind theyd kill us quicker than a wink if they
thought it would benefit them any  

chapter ix-imozene and keeth

   that day keeth took up his residence in the temple as a guest of the
old priest the rear apartments were occupied by his household including
the grandchild imozene the american felt some little diffidence in allow-
ing his captors to lodge him so much better than his companions  but both
ford and the englishman advised him to accept the priests invitation

    theres no use in making an enemy of the old fellow said ford
 were getting good food and a decent place to sleep if you can get any-
thing better why take it
a peruvian paradise



     hand more than that mr keeth added fitch  you maybe hable to
elp us by standin in with the old chap

    thats so keeth stroke his fur the right way and make love to the
girl you may be able to get the whole crowd of us out if youre sweet
enough on her  

   but ronald keeth made up his mind that that was one thing he would
not do the priests granddaughter should receive as respectful treatment
at his hands as though he had met her in a new york drawing room fords
insinuating remarks about his interest in her grated upon the engineers
finer nature he could not look upon the sweet face of imozene without
remembering that moment of awful peril when they hung together over the
gorge with only the frail hempen rope between them and death how brave
she had been  and how kind she was to him afterward coming herself
to anoint his wounds no he could not think of her lightly and promised
himself that neither by word nor look would he take advantage of her guile-
lessness

   he spent much time with the old priest for that strange individual
seemed to have taken a fancy to him beside he was the only person about
the temple with whom he could at first converse the knowledge of their
conquerors language had been guarded very jealously by the priests of the
incas  his host told him that but one member of a generation was ever
taught it

   but keeth had a taste for languages himself and before long he was
rapidly picking up the dialect of these people with the priest he always
conversed in spanish  but for several hours every day he was more or less
in imozenes society  and when two young folks who have no reason for abso-
lutely hating each other are thus thrown together they must find some
medium of communication under the girls tuition keeth advanced in his
study of the indian tongue

   imozene though scarcely more than a child in years she was about
seventeen as near as keeth could figure from the indian measurement of
time was a woman in thought and feeling and as soon as they learned to
understand each other she showed great curiosity in regard to the outside
world many things he tried to tell her she could not understand-nor was
it possible for him to explain what he meant for her language had no words
by which he might express his meaning that the world beyond the confines
of her own mountains was a vast place full of wonderful things and wonder-
ful people was the fact which impressed her most she was amazed that the
white men when they already had so much should care to penetrate the
fastnesses of the andes for any cause whatever

   keeth had in his pack a small map of peru which he showed her and tried
to explain its uses she thought that the diagram represented the whole
world and when he told her that even that vast territory of which her
beautiful valley was but a tiny spot was a very small portion of the globe
she scarcely believed him

    dost thou r-eally mean that my lord   she asked laying her hand on
his arm and looking up into his face


a peruvian paradise

    it is even so imozene he replied the unfamiliar sounds falling from
his tongue haltingly  i would not tell thee what was not true

   she sighed a little and let her head fall so that the waving black hair hid
her face  i cannot understand why thou earnest hither my lord she said
 is there anything my poor people have which thy people have not  have
they not gold and treasures

    yes many of my people have riches of which thou hast never dreamed
but i am poor

    thou wilt want for nothing here returned the girl simply my
people count not gold as did those cruel men who came to our land so many
many years ago she looked searchingly into his face again  thou art
a warrior  thou art handsome  thou knowest-oh so much thou art rich

here  

    thou wilt make me vain imozene he said laughing a little

    thou art not like the men of my tribe she went on  thou art as
much a man yet thou art tender and the red blood mounts to thy cheek like
a womans our men are fierce and wild is it because thy people are better
than mine it is not because thou art not brave  i know thy courage oh
my lord

    it is because we have learned more while the years have passed said
keeth  our young men are not taught to fight and kill they learn peace-
ful pursuits yet they can fight when there is need

    and are there no warriors among them   

    yes there are warriors but all have not to be warriors to be called
men  

    here my people are ashamed of a man who is neither warrior nor priest
the women will not look at him what do the women of thy laud sa to the
men who do not fight  do they not scorn them  

    no princess it is not considered beneath them to dig in the gardens
as the women do here  

   imozene shook her head in wonder then she raised her face suddenly
and looking into keeths eyes asked 

    are there beautiful women in thy land my lord  

   yes

      how do they look  are they as beautiful as the men    and she looked
at him frankly

    thou hast too high an opinion of the mens beauty oh princess replied
keeth

    thou and the man thou callest  ford  art as handsome as my own
people thou art far handsomer than gonnatzl and he is my own cousin
and will be priest when my grandfather dies but thy other servant-he is
so round and red and fat   and the girl laughed like a chime of silver bells
over the thought of poor fitchs personal appearance  now tell me of thy
women my lord are they beautiful 

    some of them are responded keeth hesitatingly

    are they as beautiful as i am   she asked frankly   gonnatzl says
i am beautiful  but perhaps thou dost not think so my lord   
a peruvian paradise



   keeth laughed again this time to hide his embarrassment

    thou art very fair indeed princess he said

   a little shadow rested on the girls face but in thy country they are
fairer  she asked  what are they like  

   keeth drew from the leather case in which he carried the map a bent
and dogeared photograph and showed it to her the color left her face and
her pretty teeth pressed her red lip till the color fled from that too as she
bent over the picture

    is it the work of gods-or demons    she asked breathlessly

   thy people have carvings and paintings on the walls of this temple
said keeth  my people make their pictures more lifelike this is one
thing we have learned in turning our backs upon war

   but who is she she ts beautiful the admission seemed fairly
forced from her lips

   keeth looked at the noble high bred face so different from the dark
passionate living one beside it and sighed  it is my sister he said

   the color flashed back into imozenes cheeks and she smiled again
 and thou canst never see her again she said slowly  and she is so
beautiful-much more beautiful than i i never had a brother she added
after a moment   she must be sorrowful to lose thee my lord-and thou
to lose her  

   keeth bowed the girl crept nearer and laid her little hand again upon
his bare arm the touch thrilled him and he started to draw his arm away
and then hesitated fearful that he might offend her but he dared not look
at her-for his own sake

    let me be thy sister in her place she whispered softly  i am sad
for thee my lord

   sheleaned against him as he sat upon the stone bench and after a
moment slid down upon the seat beside him keeth was forced to look at
her and found her dark eyes running over with laughter

    how do brothers show their love for their sisters in thy country my
lord  she asked glancing at him sideways out of her sparkling eyes

   in a flash keetli had his arms about her and turned her face up to his
for a single instant their lips met the blood suffused her cheeks the
laughter died out of her eyes and tears filled them instead and she darted
away from his side for a moment she looked at him reproachfully and
then turned and fled from the room leaving him filled not alone with wonder
at her action bu- with auger at his own

chapter x-a crisis

   keeth could not understand how he had offended the princess so sadly 
but that she was offended there could be no doubt she had been so be-
witchingly coquettish that he had broken the promise he had made himself
when first she sought his society and now paid the penalty for his unfaith-
fulness for days together he scarcely saw her and when he did it was
never alone he had no opportunity to crave her forgiveness for his rash-


a peruvian paradise

uess  though he could not understand why a simple kiss had so strangely
affected her

   he thought upon it so much that finally he determined to ask the old
priest something about the customs of the tribe in regard to the intercourse
of the sexes possibly he told himself he had commited some crime against
their social customs by kissing her  or perhaps kissing was an entirely
unknown quantity among these indians therefore he inquired of his host
so carefully that he would not suspect his reasons for asking

   the old man seemed delighted whenever keeth showed any unusual
interest in his people he had grown fond of the young stranger during the
weeks of his captivity and seemed never tired of talking with him and
during a long and rambling resume of the customs and laws of the tribe
keeth learned a very interesting fact he ascertained that the kiss was a
sign of betrothal and that it was considered a great breach of etiquette for a
man and woman to exchange such a caress unless marriage was con-
templated

   to say that keeth was troubled at this information is to put it very
mildly he understood now the change in imozenes behavior he had taken a
liberty which a proud spirited girl could scarcely forgive and he felt humili-
ated to the dust despite the fact that he had done the thing unwittingly
from remarks the old priest let drop he thought that it was his intention to
betroth imozene to her cousin gonnatzl who would be the head man of the
tribe when he was gone keeth wondered what gonnatzl would do if he
learned of what had passed between the princess and himself

   he knew the young indian he had been among those who had attended
the priest and imozene the day keeth and his friends had been brought to
the valley of the incas he was a brawny stern visaged savage-a noble
looking man though a bit surly in disposition the engineer fancied that
he looked upon him and his two companions in captivity with an unfriendly
eye as it was

   two months had now passed since they had come among these indians
and the first opportunity for escape had not presented itself fitch was in a
state bordering on desperation and ford was in despair

    youre taking it mighty easy keeth up there with that old priest at
the temple complained ford what dye suppose my house in callao
thinks of my being gone all this while  and i should think you would
feel kind of funny about your own position do you intend to stay here for-
ever   

    please dont be an idiot ford returned the engineer  if you can
show me the merest chance for escape ill try it with the rest of you i cant
make chances

    no nor youre not looking for them declared ford

    well what can we do  

   hi tell you wot it is young man said fitch seriously theyre
treatin you so bloody fine hup there that you dont moren alf care wether
you get away or not but me n mr kinsale do were goiu to do some-
thin desperate yet
a peruvian paradise



   im just as anxious to get away from here as you are declared keeth
 but im not such a fool as to let these people see it

    you manage to hide your anxiety well from them-and from us too
interposed ford

    hang it all man  what can we do  demanded keeth in disgust

    take a look around an see wot this bloomin valley looks like sug-
gested fitch theres no use in stickingere like toads hunder a toad-
stool you get the hold fellers permission for us to tyke a look around well
see if theres only one way through them blessed clifts

   so keeth spurred on by his friends made the request known to the
high priest it was granted without hesitation and the old man said he
would send somebody with them which last was not exactly to their taste
but they were not in a position to file objections the guide selected
proved to be the young man gonnatzl and this displeased the engineer
still more

   but the three prisoners could find no fault about the way in which they
were treated the people gazed upon them curiously as they traveled from
place to place it is true but they were unmolested the valley was about
eight miles long and not over three wide at its broadest point and as for
escape through or over the cliffs-well keeth made up his mind before they
had made the circuit of the place that unless a man had wings like one of
those condors whose nests topped some of the most inaccessible crags or
enough dynamite to wreck half the mountain system of peru there was little
chance of either

   the river-or more properly brook during this dry season-crossed the
valley from west to east it spouted out from beneath an overhanging ledge
and was augmented by half a dozen little rills which trickled through the
valley or fell down the cliffs it slanted across the meadows at one point
forming a little lake in which hundreds of wild fowl sported finally disap-
pearing in a -wide crack under the base of the eastern cliff this opening
was scarcely five feet high and showed by the slime which discolored the
rock that during the rainfall the stream became no inconsiderable torrent

      where does the water go to prince    inquired keeth of their guide

    to the under world-to the abode of gods and demons oh white man
responded gonnatzl harshly  we had a prisoner once-it was not so many
moons ago-who sought to escape the children of the incas by following the
bed of yonder stream and he pointed solemnly to the mouth of the cavern

    keeth started but recovered his self possession instantly could this be
jose rodriguez-and had he escaped through that forbidding entrance to
what the indian called the  under world  

    and what happened to him oh prince   asked the engineer

    the gods sent a great rain and he never returned replied gonnatzl
simply   when the banks of the river are full the waters tear through the
rock as swift as a condor when it swoops upon its prey  

   keeth made no further comment but when he and his friends had re-
turned to the neighborhood of the temple and wtere alone he told them what
gonnatzl had let fall about a former prisoner
o

a peruvian paradise

    by jove  that was jose sure declared ford

    we may reasonably suppose so

     and he went through that hole and never came back   

   the three white men looked at one another

    wot do you think of hit whispered fitch hoarsely  if thats the
wy jose got hout its the wy we can get out

    let us be sure that the prisoner gonnatzl meant was jose responded
keeth ill try to sound the fellow further or ask some of the priests
but we must not arouse their suspicions

     its not an inviting looking hole said ford reflectively

    but if were reasonably sure that jose escaped by that means you will
risk it   asked keeth

   ford was silent a moment but fitch did not hesitate

    hif you harsk me that mr keeth hill tell you mighty quick he
said doggedly  him goin to try it if theres the least show of getting
hout alive bob fitch as stayed among these eathen just as long as ee
wants to ees gyme for hennything

    i shant be behind you fellows said ford quietly life is sweet
but liberty is sweeter and theres no knowing when the apparent kindness
of our friends here may change to something different i dont like
that gonnatzls eye and you say hes a high cockalorum in the tribe
keeth   

   keeth nodded but he kept his suspicions of gonnatzls enmity to himself
there was no use in worrying ford and fitch further but he firmly be-
lieved that the young man who some day would be at the head of the tribe
was anything but friendly toward them he had a demonstration of this fact
within a few hours

   that evening he had an opportunity of speaking again with imozene for
a few moments although one of the women servants crouched in the corner
all through the interview he did not know how to broach the matter of
their last tete-h-tite although that lay nearest his heart but he told her of
the tour of the valley which he and his friends had made that day and asked
about the captive of whom gonnatzl had spoken

    ah yes i remember him my lord responded imozene with her head
turned so that he could see only the profile of her face she seldom looked
at him now and all the childish frankness and candor were gone from her
manner  he stayed with us many moons-but he was not like thee he
was of that nation who conquered our fathers in the days that are past

     gonnatzl said that he was swept into the cavern by the river   sug-
gested keeth

    he was seen to go there my lord she answered  the great rain
which the gods sent carried him down-down to the abode of the gods he
was seen never more  but his spirit sometimes walks and wails about the
river it has been seen at night or early morning by the herdsmen they
will not go near the place except by broad daylight

   so he was a spaniard   said keeth  he was not treated as kindly
as are we then   
a peruvian paradise

i

     had gonnatzl his way my lord you would be less gently treated he
 does not like men with white faces and says they are all alike   said imo-
 zeue softly

      but thanks to you and your grandfather we receive far better treatment
 than we deserve rejoined keeth with a smile

    ah my lord she said raising her eyes to his fora moment and he
 saw that they were full or tears  we cannot know what may happen my
 grandfather is old gonnatzl will succeed him and will then work his own
 will and i-what am i but a weak woman  i can do nothing to save you
 beware of gonnatzl my lord  	op

     she looked at him with all her soul in her eyes and then ran sobbing from
 the room

     hang it   thought keeth the girl knows more than she tells i
 believe that gonnatzl already intends us some injury we must risk that
 river bed at once desperate as the chance appears i feel quite confident
 that the prisoner they speak of was rodriguez ill see ford and fitch the
 first thing in the morning and well make the attempt tomorrow night if the
 fates be propitious

    but the morning brought a peril which was entirely unlooked for he
 was awakened in his chamber at the rear of the temple by the beating of
 the brazen gongs every morning the priests performed some ceremony in
 homage to the rising sun  but keeth knew by the uproar in the court
 before the temple that something of an unusual nature was afoot he
 arose and dressed although it was still quite dark he had scarcely slipped
 on his tunic when his door was opened and two solemn faced priests beck-
  oned him out

    he followed them in wonder to the porch of the temple not until he
 reached this place and saw the concourse of people and ford and the trader
 each between two guards at one side of the porch did he suspect that they
 were in danger the priests who had brought him gave him over to the care
 of two armed indians and he was placed beside his comrades

     whats up asked ford in a whisper

     i dont know anything about it im just out of bed replied keeth
 in the same low tone  is the old priest here   

     havent seen him that red rascal gonnatzl seems to be the master
 of ceremonies

    hi believe theyre goin to roast us an ave a feast said fitch
 gloomily

     i tell you theyre not cannibals declared keeth but he wished that
 the benign if stern face of the old priest would appear he remembered
 that imozene had warned him against her cousin only the night before the
 situation looked serious

     have you got your pistols he inquired

    yes and theyre in good order too declared ford grimly

      then if worst comes to worst well be able to put up a good fight said
 his friend  but wait for me to give the signal i can understand what
 they say and you cant


a peruvian paradise

    hif hi see one o them niggers cornin for me with a toasting fork i
shant wait for you to give the word to fire declared fitch mutinously
 hits evry man for imself then an the devil elp the indermost  

   the priests were grouped behind the prisoners on the porch the people
crowded the plaza before the altar and keeth observed by the light of the
torches gonnatzl and a group of warriors just below him on the broad steps
suddenly the young indian sprang out into the open space behind the altar
and began to speak to the crowd and as keeth listened to the passionate
words which fell from his lips he paled and grasped the handle of the revolver
beneath his tunic for gonnatzl was proving all that imozene had feared he
was inciting the people against the white prisoners and was even decrying
the leniency the old priest had shown them

chapter xi-the sign op the curse

   what does that red rascal say anyway whispered ford nudging
keeth with his elbow

   keeth looked at his friend strangely

    whats the matter with you  speak up   exclaimed ford

   you remember that mark on poor joses cheek that caused all his
trouble   

   surely

    well gonnatzl is kicking because we have not been treated to the same
delicate attention he accuses our friend the priest of showing us unwar-
ranted favoritism by not tattooing us before and he demands that we receive
 the sign of the curse  at once

   bob fitchs hands sought the side pockets of his ragged coat where re-
posed his two revolvers

  may has well be shot for a hold sheep has a lamb   he muttered

    be quiet fitch   commanded keeth  dont either of you make a
move until i give the word if the priest comes this may blow over  

   but still the old man did not appear and gonnatzls words were evidently
having their effect upon the assembled throng the torches lit up the dark
fierce faces of the men in the front of the crowd but the mass of the people
were in the black shadow of the building which surrounded the plaza and
only their outlines could be seen the young princes impassioned utter-
ances were inflaming the warriors who were without doubt his friends and
supporters looks of hatred and malice were cast at the three prisoners
and it seemed as though the savages were ready to make a rush upon them

   suddenly there sounded the shrill tinkle of cymbals within the temple
keeth started and turned to his friends in excitement he knew that the
sound of the cymbals always announced the approach of the high priest at
any ceremony the sky in the east was already glowing with the approach-
ing dawn the torches burned dimly in the increasing light

   gonnatzl evidently recognized the fact that his time was limited his
voice rose to a shriek and he threw his arms above his head in an ecstasy of
rage
a peruvian paradise



    curses  the white faced prisoners   he shrieked let them be
branded with the sign of the curse   

    a hoarse shout answered him and a number of the armed guards started
forward gonnatzl wheeled and headed their charge up the temple steps
the prisoners drew back together and keeth shook off the guards who had
laid hold of him

     back to the wall boys   he exclaimed

    the confusion of voices swelled to a roar the crowd swept up the steps
like a breaker on a sea beach torches were thrown down and trampled
under foot and the half naked savages looked like fiends from the pit in the
dusk of the early morning

    all the while the shrill note of the cymbals could be heard above the
confusion the old priest was advancing from the temple he reached the
entrance just as gonnatzl and the foremost of the mob arrived upon the top
step his face revealed by the light of the torches carried on either hand
by his attendants showed no emotion as he saw the hurlyburly on the
temple porch he advanced neither more swiftly nor more slowly than was
his wont but as he neared the end of the porch he gave a quick glance from
the three white men at bay against the wall to the crowd of dark visaged
indians who had hesitated at his appearance

    he said no word but at a wave of his hand the rabble slunk back down
the steps and even the fiery young prince gave way before him the babble
of tongues died away and there fell an awted hush upon the assembly the
old man stretched forth his hands above the heads of his people and at the
sign the remaining torches were dropped and stamped under foot by their
metal soled sandals immediately a low solemn chant was begun by the
priests and the concourse of indians took it up the light grew above the
eastern peaks and the ceremony in honor of the rising sun went on as though
nothing had occurred to mar the repose of the occasion gonnatzls revolt
had been stamped under foot with the blazing torches

    when the usual sacrifice was burning on the altar the people quietly dis-
persed the priests filed silently back into the temple and their leader
turned and spoke to gonnatzl for a moment whatever he said did not
please the young man for he scowled darkly and casting a malignant glance
at keeth and his friends marched slowly away from the place

    the old man bowed to keeth as he passed him

    have  fear senor he said in spanish  inzalkl still rules his
people

    but keeth looked after him in doubt as he entered the temple his step
was slow and liis hand shook with the palsy of age he was not the same
strong man he had been when first they had seen him how soon would it
be ere gonnatzl should reign in his stead 

     boys we must get away tonight if such a thing is possible he whis-
pered in his comrades ears go home and get your breakfasts ill
come and see you this forenoon and well make our plans save what
food you can from your meals today its better to run the risk of fol-
lowing that river bed than to go through such another experience as this  


a peruvian paradise

   thats the most sensible thing youve said for manj- a long day
mr keeth declared fitch and he and ford went off together arm
and arm

   keeth went to his own apartment filled with conflicting emotions they
wtere to run a desperate chance indeed if the cavern into which the waters
of the brook flowed proved to be unavailable for purposes of escape their
treatment when they were recaptured would be far more severe than it had
been even the old high priest inzalkl would be unable then to save
them from the wrath of gonnatzl and his friends and then it was
impossible to tell what danger lurked in the bed of the subterranean river

    but its the only thing to do thought keeth pacing his room rest-
lessly after breakfast  i see no other way the cliffs are unscalable  the
only entrance to the valley guarded our only hope is that river and if
jose rodriguez was the prisoner who left the valley by that means-well
what man has done man can do but if it were not he-if it were some
other unfortunate fellow- well a man can die but once and we had better
die trying to escape than become veritable slaves of these savages  

   he was about to go out and seek his comrades in misfortune when there
came a timid rap upon his door he opened it and found imozene standing
at the portal

      my lord i must speak to thee    she exclaimed

   what is it princess he asked taking her hands tenderly and
drawing her into the room  why do you tremble so what has hap-
pened 

    my grandfather-the great inzalkl-

   what about him cried keeth half suspecting what her answer
would be

    he is stricken my lord   gasped the girl beginning to sob he is
dying

    not that you are too easily alarmed princess

   he says himself he is dying said the girl solemnly he knows
my lord he calls for thee  

      i wall go to him at once  

    keeth stepped to the door but looking back he saw the drooping pitiful
figure of the girl leaning against the rough stone wall he hesitated a mo-
ment and then went back to her side

    i am sorry for thee imozene he said gently  i wish i might com-
fort thee

    thank you my lord she returned gravely  i sorrow for thy sake
as well as my own gonnatzl feels harsh toward thee-beware of him if
the great inzalkl die thou and thy friends will fare ill but hasten-he calls
for thee again

   keeth bowed and walked slowly from the room he was sufficiently
familiar with the temple now to find his way to the old priests apartment
there were several white robed attendants hovering about the old mans
c-ouch immediately upon seeing the white man enter he motioned the
others to leave him and the room was soon cleared
a peruvian paradise



   senor he said speaking almost in a whisper  the hand of death is
on hie i arose in my weakness this morning and saved thee from the
young prince gonnatzl  i cannot save thee again thou art in danger here
my people have had poor crops this season  they lay it to the wrath of the
gods because i have had thee as my guest and have refused to enslave thy
servants when i am dead senor all will be different here gonnatzl will
have no mercy i fear me

   i have sent for him he is to espouse his cousin little imozene and
as she is thy friend perhaps i may lead him to show thee mercy after all
yet and the old man spoke more slowly and shook his head  the young
prince is not so eager to wed his cousin as he was i fear me he will not
treat her with kindness if thou canst be of aid to her at any time thou
wilt not hesitate to offer her thy arm   

    i am her servant oh priest replied keeth bowing

    farewell then white man i can say no more-i can do no more
my life is slipping away from me the things of this world seem small to
me now oh son for a moment his eyes became fixed upon keeths face
their dulness passed away and something of the fire came into them which
his guest had seen on that first night when the wonderful occult power of the
priest was displayed but now it was not keeths soul which was enthralled
the limbs of the old man grew rigid his eyes burned like dull coals  slowly
his lips opened and he spoke but in a voice which the listener scarcely
recognized

    art thou there my son  listen  fear not the path thou shalt tread
death is not before thee-fear not he was silent a moment his face
growing more rigid his lips moved stiffly  i see-i see what thou canst
not ah my people  my people  they are doomed thy people oh
son shall sweep aside the children of the incas as chaff before the threshers
fan but imozene-my little imozene  care for her son i charge thee-
care for her  

   his words became inaudible though his lips still moved keeth placed
his ear close to them but could distinguish nothing the rigid lines slowly
relaxed his breath came more easily and the old priest sighed and turned
his face to the wall he had fallen peacefully asleep and keeth stole from
the room

chapter xii-into the tunnels mouth

   when keeth arrived at the abode of his friends he was just in time to
witness a spectacle which despite the serious matters occupying his mind
forced a laugh to his lips ford kinsale and the trader had been reduced
during their captivity to little else than rags for clothing and at last had
been forced to abandon their european garments and don the tunic of their
captors they had continually made fun of keeth for wearing the indian
costume but now the laugh was on the other side the engineer was a
picture of manly beauty beside his two friends

   ford was a muscular fellow but he was lean and his long shanks stuck


a peruvian paradise

out of the skirts of the tunic like a pair of broom sticks and as for fitch-
well he was a sight  he had lost none of his corpulency while in captivity
and the llama skin tunic fitted him as tightly as his own cuticle his waist
line had disappeared some years before and his aldermanic proportions were
much en evidence as he strutted about the room

   the first intimation he and ford had that they were observed was a
burst of laughter from keeth in the doorway

    hullo you there  exclaimed ford in disgust  what sort of ballet
dancers do we make 

 oh youre out of sight   keeth declared between his chuckles  if
you could only see yourselves  fitch you look like a keg of ale on stilts
 ho ho  thats a good one on you fitch   roared ford in delight
and you look like a superannuated clothespin  added the engineer
turning to his chum with a broad grin

   aw-gwan  i bet i dont look any worse than you responded
ford though with less hilarity

    i dont know about that said keeth  somehow your bones-you
are awfully bony ford-project out into the ambient atmosphere really
more than they should you need upholstering my son

   well you cynt say that of me mr keeth interposed fitch

    no  its a pity you couldnt turn over some of your superabundance of
flesh to poor ford and thus even things up oh you two are sights  
my ancestors were used to kilts said kinsale reflectively its a
pity if i havent enough scotch blood in me to carry off a little thing like
this i dont believe i look as bad as you say ronald

    its lucky youre so unbelieving old man returned keeth coolly 
 for if you really knew how badly you look i shouldnt be able to get you
outside the door yonder and it has become very necessary that we do get
outside he added more gravely

    why whats up anything new 

    the old priest is in a very bad way  in fact hes dying said keeth

    by jove  you dont mean it  

    hour cakes dough sure enough i  exclaimed the englishman

   ford nodded i shant stay here alone he said fitch and i

got a package of grub stored up yonder-some dried meat and cake well
need torches wont we 

   yes and our blankets ill get the torches returned keeth and
forthwith ensued a long discussion of ways and means each suggestion was
examined in detail and when keeth departed every possible contingency had
been thought of and planned for

    he remained in his own chamber till noon and then thinking the time
opportune seized an armful of torches from a pile in one of the corridors near
by wrapped them in a rug and carried them to one of the side entrances of
the temple ford was on the lookout for him and came across the court and
carried the innocent looking bundle to his quarters on his way back to his
apartment keeth passed the young prince gonnatzl near the door of the
high priests chamber gonnatzl had evidently been in to see the old man 
but what effect the dying inzalkls pleading had had upon fhe hot headed
fellow keeth could not guess for the prince passed him with averted face

    he heard nothing from the dying priest during the afternoon he tried
to sleep knowing that if all went well he would be upon his feet all the
coming night but his mind was so troubled by thoughts of imozene and of
the danger menacing his friends and himself that it was impossible the
impassioned words of the old priest-the last he would probably ever hear
from his lips-still rang in his ears

   ah my people  my people they are doomed thy people oh
son shall sweep aside the children of the incas as chaff before the threshers
fan but imozene-my little imozene  care for her son i charge thee-
care for her   

   keeth repeated the words over and over what had the old man meant 
by his wonderful occult power had inzalkl looked into the future and really
seen some great danger menacing his granddaughter  of keeth he declared
he should escape death did he know f

    it wras impossible for the american to sleep while these and like thoughts
were rioting through his brain he paced the confines of his narrow room
like a caged beast the afternoon waned and the night began to fall the
narrow streak of sunlight which crept across the floor from dawn to dark
disappeared and through the window he saw the stars come out in the still
glowing sky from the bustle and confusion outside he judged that a great
many people had gathered about the temple the news that the old inzalkl
was near death had gone out among his nation and from all parts of the
valley they had gathered

    suddenly the great brazen gongs at the door of the temple began to beat
slowly their rhythmic throbbing filled the remotest corridor with clangor-
ous sound a hush fell upon the throng without keeth listened at his
door his heart beating tumultuously what was the meaning of the jarring
notes  had the end come  had the old man already passed away 

    but as he listened another sound reached his ear it was a faint sobbing
just without the portal he unbarred the door and swung it back and
there in the gloom of the corridor lying on the threshold he beheld a pitiful
little heap shaken by a tempest of sobs


a peruvian paradise

    imozene   he cried and in an instant caught her up in his arms she
hid her face on his shoulder and he felt the heaving of her bosom against his
own breast

    what is it-tell me my child   he said bearing her in his arms to the
stone bench beneath the window

    he is dead whispered the girl not offering to disengage herself from
his embrace  but her sobs ceased

    inzalkl

    yes my lord the gongs beat out the sad intelligence to my waiting
people dost thou know what it means to thee-and me   

    to me it means danger oh princess if gonnatzl now reigns but to
thee it means sorrow for the loss of a kind friend and counselor thou wilt
reign over thy people with gonnatzl  

    thus my grandfather intended but it will never be my lord

     why not    demanded keeth hoarsely

   slowly the girl disengaged herself and sat upon the bench beside him
 had i the key to the treasure cave of our fathers-the cave lost to our
people by the will of the gods so long ago-gonnatzl would not wed me he
has so declared i shall never wed my lord i am alone-alone  

   her head slowly drooped until her forehead rested against the cold stone
her hair hid her features from her companion and again the passionate
sobs shook her frame

   keeth sprang to his feet and leaned above her once he put out his
arms as though to gather her again within them but he fought down the
temptation

    god knows ive done her harm enough was his bitter thought

     i cannot save thee my lord gonnatzl will have his vengeance on thee
i shall see thee die-and then die myself  before another sun thy friends
and thyself will fall before my cousins rage

   we shall not   exclaimed keeth defiantly  oh priucess weep not
for us we shall escape him  

    then the gods must shield thee she said simply  imozene cannot
she still lay hopelessly upon the bench her body shaken by her sobs
keeth was torn with conflicting emotions should he fly alone from the
temple or should he take her with him  he believed she would go without
protest if they escaped she need never return to the wilderness  if not-
well they would die together he knew-aye he confessed it to himself
with shame yet with a strange exultation-that he loved her he loved this
woman-this half savage creature in all the barbarism of her nature and
surroundings he loved her 

   yet because this was so he could not do what inclination prompted he
could not sacrifice her should they fly together and be captured what
horrible punishment might not be meted out to her by her fanatical people 

   he glanced back over his shoulder for a last glimpse as he crept like a
thief to the door the little heap of barbaric finery still lay upon the bench
and the last sound he heard as he stepped so softly into the corridor was a
choking despairing sob from behind the curtain of her glorious hair
a peruvian paradise	

   keeth groped his way to the side door of the temple no one opposed
his exit the side court was deserted all the people who had thronged
into the town had crowded into the plaza before the porch with swift steps
he made his way to the lodgings of his friends and aroused them

    what  shall we start this early  demanded ford

    at once returned keeth  the old man is dead we do not know
when the blow may fall upon us gather up the torches and the food and
come

   they did as he commanded and like three ghosts though it must be
confessed that poor fitch was a very corpulent spirit they flitted through
the deserted town and reached without mishap the open country a dark
mass of cloud was slowly gathering in the west foreboding a storm they
went on through the oppressive silence to the river

   suddenly keeth halted and seized fords arm whats that old
man   he demanded  your eyes are better than mine

   he pointed to something moving along the brook bed toward the cliff

    hits a man exclaimed fitch

     its alivewhatever it is said ford uneasily

    hive a good mind to give hit a bullet declared the englishman
 hits one o them bloomin hinjuns

     dont you dare   cried keeth hastily  want to call the whole crowd
back there down on us well follow him

   but the shadowy figure had already disappeared and keeth remembering
what imozene had said about the herdsmen being afraid to go near that por-
tion of the valley at night for fear of the haunting spirit of the other prisoner
who had ventured into the mysterious tunnel went on with a rather creepy
feeling about their undertaking the thought was gruesome

   the water murmured among the boulders as it hurried into the dark rift
beneath the cliff the three fugitives did not hesitate when they reached
the mouth of the tunnel keeth led the way inside and before going far
from the entrance ignited one of the torches holding this above his head
he went carefully forward while the dancing light played over the slime
covered walls of the passage and the torch hissed as the drops of moisture
fell upon it from the roof

chapter xiii-like flies in a bottle

   the bed of the subterranean river was strewn with boulders and broken
bits of timber which had been swept in from the outer world by bygone
freshets at first the roof was only a little above their heads  but as they
advanced the tunnel inclined more rapidly and it grew higher the water
ran over the stones with growing murmur and soon the roar of a cataract was
borne to their ears

    well be getting into a mess yet said ford  suppose we cant get
over these falls were coming to 

    we wont suppose anything of the kind returned keeth briefly
ive got our old rope that did us such good service before


a peruvian paradise

   witliiu half an hour the noise of the falling water was so loud that they
were obliged to shout to each other any communication they might wish to
make they had not been able to travel very rapidly but were possibly
half a mile from the entrance the water poured over a great slab of rock
and dropped a sheer fifteen feet keeth quickly looped his rope over a pro-
jecting knob and went down hand over hand the water in which he landed
was only half way to his knees

   come on he roared waving his hand to his friends above and
although they could not hear him they could see his motion in the light of
the torch he carried so both followed him

   keeth again coiled the rope over his arm and they went on now wading
in the water for the passage had narrowed considerably sometimes the
roof became quite low and they had to stoop to pass through  but nothing
turned them back all three recognized the fact that this was their only
chance for liberty and even fitch made no audible complaint when he barked
his bare shins against the boulders

   the water was ice cold in this cavern and the damp air chilled them to
the bone it was almost a continual descent after they passed the first fall
and sometimes they were obliged to scramble down over the slimy rocks on
hands and knees  at other times they could make use of keeths rope

    if we had to get out of here in a hurry i should pray for wings
shouted ford with a grin

   at length they passed the cascades and went on through a straight tunnel
for several hundred yards keeth figured that they were nearly a mile from
the entrance and then suddenly without any warning they arrived at the
end of the cave 

   they were in a circular chamber the floor of which was sand and into
this sand the waters of the brook sank not a solitary outlet appeared
they were like flies in a bottle

    trapped by jove   exclaimed ford

   keeths face looked drawn and haggard fitch sat down upon a boulder
puffing from his exertions the sand below them looked damp and the
slime clung to the walls far above their heads not long since that pocket
had been full of water-probably during the last storm

   im afraid said keeth slowly  that the poor devil who got into this
tunnel wasnt jose

   he leaped dowrn to the floor of the chamber instantly he sank knee
deep in the treacherous sand he struggled to reach the rocks again but
each step he took sank him deeper

    youll have to help me out boys   he cried and when ford and the
trader hurried forward they found him already waist deep in the quicksand

   dont step down here ford keeth warned the other theres
no need of us both getting into it take that rope yonder and fling me one
end you and fitch will have to haul me out  

   all the while he was speaking the treacherous sand was dragging him
down and by the time he had got the rope knotted under his arms he had
sunk to his breast
a peruvian paradise

i

    just as they were about to pull on the rope fitch held up his hand

     what is it  demanded ford hanging stiffly upon the rope and cock-
ing up his ear to listen

   a strange muffled moaning sound echoed down the tunnel it died
away then swelled again to a throbbing roar the three men looked at one
another with startled faces

     what the dickens is that demanded ford in an awed voice

   fitch shook his head but a look of intelligence flashed into the
engineers face

     for gods sake pull me out boys   he gasped  its thunder  

    his words startled his comrades into activity they laid hold of the rope
with vigor and after a deal of tugging managed to get him out upon the
solid rock again but he was so weakened by the strain and chilled by the
exposure that he could scarcely stand

    again that same dismal moan long drawn and fear inspiring came down
the cavern which acted like a speaking tube between them and the outer
world

     go back as fast as you can boys said keeth struggling into a sitting
posture  dont wait for me you know what these thunder storms in
the mountains are like in a mighty short time this river will rise and
youll be drowned like rats in a hole

    and you-- cried ford

   dont stop for me man i tell you its your only chance get up
where the tunnels broader

     hi say   cried fitch  hand leave you  

     hang it man  why should you two risk your lives for me  

   and hang you exclaimed ford what do you take us for
well carry you if you cant walk

    they seized him despite his objections and staggered up the tunnel
the muttering of the thunder was now an intermittent roar were they in
time they were not sure for as they issued from the cul-de-sac they
heard the water coming down the rocks with a different noise from that it
had made a few moments ago clearly the storm was beginning to tell upon
the stream and the work of- recrossing the pools and climbing the slippery
rocks especially with keeth so helpless looked desperately hard

   keeth demanded that they set him down after having been hauled up
the first incline the rough exercise had warmed his stiffened limbs and he
pushed on as rapidly as his companions but each moment the water in-
creased in depth where they had before walked dry shod it was already
over their ankles

   at the first cascade ford climbed up alone wasting several precious
miuutes in the trial for he was not as active as keeth the latter when
once his friend was on the rock above flung him the end of the rope but
he was not successful in the first cast ford should have taken the rope up
with him but he didnt think of that in his hurry keeth made a second
attempt and the rope fell back upon fitch and knocked the torch from his
hand


a peruvian paradise

   it went out in the water with a hiss and they were left in total darkness
had they another dry one  and when that was found had they dry
matches  ford and fitch had not but keeth found a single lucifer in his
match safe and after a few minutes of styx-like darkness they had the
cheering presence of a flaming torch again then keeth again cast the rope
this time with success

   fitch swarmedup like a performing elephant and with his aid ford was
enabled to assist keeth to the top of the cascade the water was now
sweeping down the tunnel waist deep they hurried on sometimes plung-
ing into holes to their armpits and barking their legs sadly on the
hidden rocks but keeth held the torch high above his head and managed
to keep it alive

   at last they arrived at the bottom of the highest cascade-the first one
they had encountered upon entering the tunnel the water was tumbling
down it and boiled at the bottom like a caldron the three adventurers
looked at one another aghast they could never climb up that rock and it
was an open question whether keeth in his present exhausted condition
could throw the rope over the knob of rock where it had been looped when
they descended

   the water swirled around them and almost carried them off their feet by
its force the thunder still echoed and reechoed through the tunnel the
storm was at its height

   suddenly at the top of the cascade amid the driving spray appeared
a face-a wild haggard face which peered down at them with bloodshot
eyes

    what is it   gasped ford shrinking back from the sight

   the creature waved its arm and fortunately keeth understood the sign
he coiled the rope quickly and tossed it upward the claw-like hands of
the strange looking being clutched it and looped it over the jagged spur of
rock keeth inspired by the discovery he had made seized the rope and
went up hand over hand he was breathless when he reached the top and
was thankful for the assistance of the stranger in getting upon the rock

      queek  de others    cried his rescuer in his ear

   but ford was already half way up the rope and when he was by their
side they laid hold of the hemp together and hauled fitch from the bottom
of the cascade the torch had been lost again and they were in darkness

    follow-queek   muttered the strange man  the wrater will be over
our heads in a moment come  

   he darted along the narrow shelf on which they stood and the three
breathless men followed him in the darkness of the cavern the outlines of
the stranger looked like those of a huge ape

   in a moment they came to a crack in the wall-a crack so narrow that
they had passed it by unnoticed in their descent into the tunnel their
guide squeezed through this opening and keeth and ford followed him
poor fitch had to be fairly pulled through the crack by main force

   they found themselves in a narrow corridor branching off at a right
angle from the bed of the river the floor at first slightly inclined upward
a peruvian paradise



in a few moments they reached a good sized room in the middle of which a
small fire was burning their guide went quickly to a pile of fuel in one
corner and threw an armful on the blaze the flames flashed up instantly
and illuminated the place revealing the features of all

   keeth and his two comrades stared at the scarcely human looking
figure of their rescuer he was clad in a few shreds of garments the original
nature of which it was scarcely possible to guess his bare arms were lean
and his hands like claws his gaunt drawn face seemed familiar yet it was
only keeth who was sure of his identity he walked quickly forward and
placed his hands upon the shoulders of the attenuated creature

     jose   he exclaimed  how did you get here 

chapter xiv-once more imozene

   fitch uttered an imprecation and fell back against the wall of the cav-
ern utterly unable to properly express his astonishment

   its never jose rodriguez exclaimed ford scarcely above a
whisper

   si senor-eet indeed ees responded the strange looking individual
hoarsely

     alive  cried ford again scarcely willing to believe his eyes

   dont be a goose ford said keeth good naturedly of course
hes alive though he looks more like a ghost than a human being

    i haf eaten leetle for weeks explained the spaniard simply  only
such food as i could pick up in the herdsmens huts yonder

    and weve been living on the fat of the land said ford  havent
we some food here keeth 

     i lost my pack when i got into that quicksand returned the engineer

  perhaps fitch has something  

     food hand torches ave all gone declared the cockney still staring at
rodriguez with protruding eyeballs

   everything was swept away in the rush of the waters said keeth
with disappointment  but we will get more

      how    demanded ford kinsale

    by going back to the town

    what-tonight  cried ford

   it is already morning senors said rodriguez v the storm did not
arise till near midnight when it began to rain i feared for you and hurried
down the tunnel to warn you

   you hurried to warn us  repeated keeth  plow did you know we
were here  come jose you must tell us your story we have believed
you dead we searched for you all along the shore below the spot where you
and that guide fell over the cliff how did you get here  and how long
have you been here  

    the senor must wait i cannot tell him all in a breath-eh wha-at  
responded the spaniard with a smile eet us sit down about the fire i
am easily chilled when i haf so leetle on  


a peruvian paradise

    were hall in the same box grunted fitch stretching his bare legs
out toward the fire

    true senor feeteh said jose with another broad smile  i did not
know you all in dose raiments-eh wha-at  i see you going into the mout
of the tunnel yonder but i not be quite sure it you  

    then you were the man we saw flitting about the entrance of the pas-
sage   interjected keeth  we feared it was one of the indians

      i haf been out into de valley many nights   said jose   i haf try to
learn if you be captive among these people that i not able to learn for
sure though i know they haf somebody	

    come tell us your story said keeth

   the spaniard stretched himself upon a ragged bit of blanket beside the
fire and with many gesticulations and  eh wha-ats   related his terrible
experience he had fallen unhurt over the cliff in the desperate embrace of
the treacherous savage but fortunately when they struck the water the in-
dian was underneath the contact with the cold water loosed the guides
hold  they sank together but jose alone rose he was greatly weakened
by his struggle and the swift current swept him down stream and around
the bend in the river in a very few moments he did not get to the bank
until he had been carried quite two miles below the bridge and then he was
so exhausted that he could scarcely crawl out of the water

   he lay there by the river for most of that day but before dark climbed
to the summit of the cliff he had alittle food and his blanket he cleaned
his revolvers and found plenty of ammunition for them in the waterproof
compartments of his belt at sunrise the next morning he started in search
of his companions he discovered the place where they had descended to
the shore of the river and saw the effects of the landslide which had shut off
their retreat to the top of the cliff knowing that they could not go down
the river he followed along the stream hoping to overtake them at some
point higher up

   but he was a few hours behind them and although he reached the
ruined and abandoned settlement of the indians in time to see the party who
had captured his friends entering the forest he was not quite positive that
keeth and his companions were with them but as the white men did not
appear at any point along the river shore he believed they had been taken
prisoners or that the indians had massacred them

   alone though he was he determined not to return to hualpa without as-
suring himself on this point he believed that he alone knew the secret en-
trance to the indians valley by which he had made his escape before
therefore he ventured into the labyrinth of subterranean galleries to the
tunnel through which flowed the little river which watered the inclosed val-
ley in these galleries he had lurked all these weeks hoping to obtain an
opportunity of speaking with the prisoners but keeth and his friends had
not been treated as he had been when he was a captive the indians had
shown him little mercy as he was a spaniard he had been made to herd
the llamas and goats and work with the women in the fields

    i haf been as far as the town-at night senors declared jose in con-
a peruvian paradise



elusion  for these indians set no watch except at the entrance to the val-
ley but i not find where you was lodged now that you haf escaped we
will be off ver soon and i for one hope nefer to see this place again

     but ow about that treasure  suggested fitch leaning forward

    ah senor feetch your experience haf not made you forget dat-eh
wlia-at  

    hi should say not i came out for it hi want to take some of it back
to pay me for wot hive been through

   you shall haf your weesh senor declared the spaniard

     but we cant go without food said ford

     true responded keeth  and another supply of torches eh jose
     the senor speaks true torches we must haf

      but how will we get them   

     do not these heathen gather in front of their temple to worship the sun
as it rises  

       they do  

     then let us go at that time enter some estado on the outskirts of the
town and take what we need

     when shall we do it  

     tonight replied jose

    anged if hi believe hi could squeeze through that place again said
fitch nodding toward the narrow aperature by which they had gained en-
trance to their present abode  hi was so scared then that hi felt small
and slipped through easy

     slipped through easy    exclaimed ford laughing  if i hadnt
pulled like a yoke of steers youd be sticking there yet

     we not all go said jose  two of us a plenty eh senor keeth 
     yes  you and i if you think you can stand it

   ver well we will go and now senors as we cannot eat let us
sleep and the spaniard followed out his own philosophical suggestion by
rolling up in the tattered blanket and dropping off at once the others did
the same and all four slept until late in the day

   when they awoke keeth and ford with a flaming brand from the fire
went out through the narrow passage to the river the water had subsided
and trickled peacefully along the rocky bed falling over the first cascade with
a pleasant roar they could scarcely realize that it was the same stream that
had threatened to overvvhelm them early in the morning

   they walked out to the end of the tunnel and looked into the valley
nobody was in sight-not even the herdsmen of course their escape had
been discovered but if their recent captors suspected that they had entered
the tunnel they doubtless believed that the sudden tempest which had broken
over the valley had raised the river to such a height as to drown their
prisoners

   they went back to their comrades and waited in the side chamber with
such patience as they could command for the time to come for the raid upon
the stores of the indians fitch dozed  but the three younger men felt their
situation too keenly to admit of that they sat in silence for the most part


a peruvian paradise

until past midnight then jose declared it time they started and shaking
hands with ford and letting the sleeping fitch lie undisturbed he and keeth
went out

    they were both armed with revolvers and their last act before leaving
the retreat was to make sure that the weapons were in perfect order

     i hope we wont have to use them said keeth as they set off   but
if we should happen to need em well need em bad

    they made their way to the mouth of the tunnel and after assuring them-
selves that there were none of their enemies lurking near they slipped out
of the passage and set off up the valley in the direction of the town the
mist lay heavy upon the ground and out of this gray cloud occasionally
appeared the elongated shadow of a stray llama quietly feeding they saw
no herdsmen  if they had they would scarcely have been challenged  for
in the dim light keeth looked like an indian himself and jose looked as
much like one as he did like anything human

   the eastern sky was already aglow when they reached the edge of the
group of stone buildings about the temple like two shadows they crept
behind one of the houses and crouched down to wait for the people to gather
on the plaza they could hear the occupants of the house stirring and soon
the beating of the brazen gongs on the temple porch denoted that the time
for the morning sacrifice was near at hand the people left their houses
and hurried to the place

    when the sound of the sandals had died away the two fugitives ventured
into the house on a stone slab beside the fireplace were bread and meat
which the woman had prepared for the family breakfast keeth seized a
blanket and wrapped the food in it

    then they entered another house and another in each finding food but
few torches it was quite necessary that they should have plenty of light
wood for jose declared the caverns through which he proposed to lead
them to be a veritable labyrinth and the only manner by which they might
find their way was by marks he had made upon the walls

    but the houses seemed all deserted and as long as the people remained in
the temple court they might search for what they needed unmolested they
went from house to house as coolly as though nearly a thousand savages were
not gathered within a few rods of them finally from one place and another
jose managed to collect a goodly bundle of torches these he strapped upon
his back so as to leave his hands free  keeth had already done the same
with his package of provisions

     now come on whispered the latter  well get out before they be-
gin their pow-wow  

    but in going back they passed within sight of the plaza the open space
before the temple was choked with people but all standing as motionless as
graven images it was growing lighter now and the fugitives could see
across the plaza to the group of priests upon the temple porch the great
gongs ceased their clangor and as they gazed the crowd of white robed priests
parted and a figure dressed in savage magnificence swept down the steps to

	the altar it was gonnatzl
a peruvian paradise



   keeth halted and clutched his companion by the arm

    wait he said breathlessly  that is the new high priest let us
see what follows

     we shall be discovered senor whispered jose

   not yet

    the light of the torches which attendants held upon either hand fell full
upon the noble figure of the young indian massive gold bands covered his
arms and great bars of gold hung from his ears the cloak which swept the
steps behind him flashed a dozen lovely shades it was made of the brilliant
plumage of the paroquet and a chain of dull gold links held it upon his
shoulders

   after standing a moment in silence the prince began to speak his
powerful voice penetrated to the farthest side of the plaza and every word
was easily distinguished by keeth his first few sentences held the fugitive
enthralled gonnatzl was arraigning the princess imozene for the escape of
the three white men 

   keeth could hear murmurings of anger break out among the assembly as
the wily gonnatzl went on the man accused her of forsaking her own
people for the love of one of the white prisoners keeths face burned and
his hand clutched the butt of his pistol as he listened to the foul accusations
he blamed himself now-oh how bitterly -for leaving the girl to the mercy
of her people yet at the time he had believed he was doing right

   suddenly a rosy beam of light filtered through the fog the sun was
rising at a motion from gonnatzl the torches were extinguished and the
people commenced a wild fierce chant the crowd of priests above him
separated and a slight shrinking figure was pushed forward it was imozene 

   the high priest seized her by the shoulder and dragged her forward to
the altar her wrists were knotted together behind her back and her cloth-
ing had been half torn from her body with a quick twist of his muscular
arm gonnatzl threw her back upon the altar and just as the first beam of the
sun struck full upon him he poised the huge sacrificial knife above her bared
breast

   he drew back the knife for the awful stroke the assembly was hushed
again

   suddenly the crack of a pistol shattered the silence a tiny red mark
appeared in the center of the high priests forehead and he staggered back a
step the knife fell clattering to the pavement and swinging around with
blindly groping hands gonnatzl dropped at full length beside the altar

   the awed hush was broken by frightened screams of women and the
hoarse cries of men several of the priests rushed forward to their fallen
leader  but again the crack of the revolver rose above the tumult one and
then another fell or staggered back in agony as the leaden messengers reached
their marks the fusillade continued they could see nothing-not even
the smoke of the discharge simply the whiplike crack of the weapon and
the dropping of those about the altar-that was all

   the cries of the assembly rose to a terrified shriek they scattered
through the lanes and alles of the town the priests darted back into


a peruvian paradise

the temple leaving their dead and wounded companions heaped about the
altar

   suddenly a figure leaped out from the shelter of a house and ran across
the deserted court it was keeth  but the fusillade of pistol shots did not
cease for jose stood at the corner of the building and fired at the last dis-
appearing indians

   the american reached the altar in an instant he whipped out his
knife and cut the bonds of the victim of the indians fanatical rage he
raised her in his arms and turned to fly but the girls eyes were closed
and she lay a dead weight against his breast

   was she dead  had the horror of the awful experience through which
she had passed snapped the frail thread of life  keeth tried to feel if her
heart beat but in his horror he was unable to discover the faintest flutter

    my god  she is dead   he thought and staggered down from the
altar  she is dead   he repeated and pressed his lips to the closed lids
and pallid cheeks

   and then as though his touch had called her back to life the eyes
opened and she gazed up into his own

    my lord she whispered in wonder  is it thou 

   suddenly joses voice rang out across the plaza 

    como seno  que desea f they are coming back queek  
   aroused by these words keeth recrossed the court and joined his comrade

   we haf not a moment to lose   cried jose  what do you wit the
the senorita   

   she goes with us replied keeth between his teeth if i cannot
escape with her ill not escape at all

   they ran toward the edge of the town but before they reached the open
country the brazen gongs of the temple clanged forth a summons for the re-
gathering of the populace soon they would be pursued and keeth strained
every effort to keep pace with his more fleet footed companion

chapter xv-at last the treasure

   keeth will never forget that race in the dusk of the early morning a
great mass of drab cloud obscured the face of the lately risen sun and the
fog still lay thick upon the valley the damp mist wrapped them about like
a blanket and hid them from the eyes of the savages

   they met none of their enemies during the flight down the valley they
were all behind but the loud notes of the brazen gongs rang in their ears
till they reached and entered the tunnel

   keeth was panting from exhaustion  but he would not set imozene down
until they were well into the subterranean passage jose drew his match safe
from a ragged pocket and lit one of the torches with this flaming over his
head he led the way the american followed him still bearing most of the
girls weight upon his arm

    my lord she said  where are we going 

    	 come senor  what do you want 
a peruvian paradise



     do you fear to trust yourself to me imozene   he asked

   she halted in the rough path and cast her arms about his neck  not
now my lord for i know thou lovest me

     not even if i tell thee thou wilt never see thy people again 

   she shuddered   they are no longer my people if i follow thee to
the abode of the gods it were better   

    then thou shalt go to my people imozene he said and they went on
again hand in hand

   ford was waiting for them at the entrance of the side passage anxious
because of their long absence when he saw imozene several different emo-
tions struggled for the mastery in his face at once  but something in keeths
eye warned him to restrain his natural impulse to chaff they all four en-
tered the inner chamber and awoke fitch before anything else was done or
said keeth briefly related what had occurred in the town and the circum-
stances which led to iniozenes presence with them

    hand you did just right mr keeth   declared fitch  them bloody
devils  him only sorry hi didnt get a shot at em myself dye think
theres henny likelihood of their attacking us here 

    i dont know returned keeth

    we will not give them the chance said jose  we will stop up the
entrance to tliees place and then go on trough the caverns to the river
come senors  at once  

   he naturally took the lead and with fords and keeths assistance set
about closing the entrance of their retreat from some dark part of the
chamber he produced a rudely wrought iron bar and with its aid pried sev-
eral bulky boulders into the passage these they   chocked   with smaller
stones finally completing a barrier that would cause their enemies much
trouble in breaking down even providing they discovered the fugitives re-
treat then with the bar in one hand and a blazing torch in the other jose
led his little party deeper into the bowels of the mountain

    thees rock is soft senor he said to keeth  some time-long past
-the water carve out these passages they lead down-down-down till
they reach the level of the river the ancestors of these indians perhaps
used thees way ver mooch-quien sabe  

   imozene looked about her in wonder as they passed down the echoing
aisles  yet she recognized the place from the traditions of her people

   my lord she said are not these the lost treasure caves of my
people  

   so we believe replied keeth our friend yonder-he who bears
the mark upon his face-discovered this way of escape when he ran from thy
people months ago it will now prove our salvation  

   as they went on they had often to halt and examine with interest the
carven walls and hideously sculptured columns which upheld the roof of the
caverns in some apartments were rude forges and iron and bronze imple-
ments which showed the early occupants of the caverns to have possessed no
inconsiderable knowledge of metal working fitch was in a continual state
of amazement
o

a peruvian paradise

    hi wouldnt ave believed hit   he kept repeating  hi cynt believe
them niggers ever did all this

   in one great cave the roof of which arched above their heads like the
dome of a subterranean st peters jose led them to a point in the wall where
a seam of glittering quartz quite two feet wide was laid bare from base to
roof it flashed back the light of the torches most dazzlingly it was a
vein of gold 

   a little further on they passed into a smaller chamber through a crumbling
doorway the door itself lay upon the floor but the lintels were still well
preserved showing how slight the action of the atmosphere had been upon
them during the centuries since they were placed there the air was per-
fectly dry and sweet throughout the cave

    senors exclaimed jose waving the torch around his head feast
your eaes upon the treasures of the incas  

   the walls were covered with rude picture writing but these attracted
no attention from his comrades on the floor were heaped hundreds of bar
of metal such as jose had shown them that day on the trail to hualpa
they were of gold -pure virgin gold 

   fitch and ford kinsale fairly cast themselves upon the ground before the
treasure but to keeth the gold seemed of smaller moment now

   why man what ails you demanded ford looking up at him
 dont you see were rich for life 

    providing we can get away with enough of hit interposed fitch hand-
ling the bars almost caressingly

    i see returned keeth   but imozene here is laughing at you she
doesnt consider the stuff worth much and i dont know but shes more than
half right

    fol-de-roll   exclaimed fitch when a man has a chance to make
his fortune in a moment hell do it-even you mr keeth

    for my part said ford determinedly  i shall take all the stuff with
me i can carry and i advise you to do the same  

    youre right mr kinsale the trader said  hits a crime to waste
a hopportunity like this hi say  

   and it was so when they left the treasure room the next morning
every man was loaded down with bars of gold keeth as heavily as the rest
he remembered that money would be a good thing after all if he was going
to take imozene back to new york with him they found upon the floor
of the chamber not a few valuable stones as well and had not prudence for-
bade their longer remaining they would have explored other portions of the
labyrinth

   near noon of the second day they emerged from a narrow defile which
was a continuation of the main gallery of the cavern and found themselves
upon the wooded gently sloping bank of a river the towering cliffs and
peaks were at their back and the low foothills to the east scarcely obstructed
their view of the horizon they had passed through the mountains and
were many and many a league from hualpa

   after careful discussion they decided that to try to reach the town as
a peruvian paradise



jose had would be a matter of great difficulty and at keeths suggestion
they constructed a stout raft and set sail upon it supposing that the stream
would turn out to be a branch of the huallaga and that they would reach
some settlement upon its banks

    it proved however to be a branch of an entirely different river and after
sailing for three days and nights they entered a stream so broad that fitch
declared it to be one of the main arms of the amazon and he was right
though it was not until nearly a fortnight that they arrived at a trading
station where his opinion was verified

   being already so far from the pacific coast they decided to follow the
current to the east and after purchasing a large  wood skin  and plenty
of arms and ammunition and hiring a member of an interior tribe for a guide
they pursued their way down the great river four months after making
their escape from the incas cave they arrived at santarem where they were
able to get passage in a sailing vessel to para and from that city took steamer
for new york

   it was nearly eight months from that eventful morning when imozene
was the intended victim of the incas awful sacrificial ceremony that the
steamship reached new york quarantine fight months daily intercourse
with her companions and proper habiliments which had been obtained for
her at one of the amazon river towns had changed her appearance wonder-
fully she had learned to speak english too with a most charming accent
and keeth who had cabled his sister from para was not at all doubtful
as to the impression imozene would make when she came aboard to welcome
them

   the bars of gold had been exchanged for drafts in santarem and para
and after negotiating for the sale of most of the uncut gems which they had
brought with them fitch and jose rodriguez sailed for liverpool the
former to dazzle the eyes of his cockney relatives and the spaniard to return
to his native country

   ford kinsale and keeth bought homes near each other close to new
york kinsale once in a while talks about going back to peru with a larger
party and exploring the incas cave further and seeing if something
cannot be done toward reopening and working the abandoned mines of the
ancient tribe it would mean wealth untold but nevertheless keeth always
does his best to discourage such suggestions he cannot forget old inzalkls
warning or the prophetic vision he himself beheld while under the priests
hypnotic influence

   and then ford doesnt talk near as much about journeying to the uncivil-
ized portions of the globe as he did keeths sister who finds that she is no
longer so necessary to her brothers comfort now that he is married
has consented to give more of her attention to ford which satisfies him far
better than anything the field of exploration has to offer

the end
sullivan jones boarders

how the plans of two gentlemanly rascals were neatly thwarted by a pair of clever boys-
a successful robbery followed by an equally successful capture

i

 ith a long shrill whistle which echoed through the kittatinny gap
and a glare from its headlight that danced and glimmered far across
the water and then vanished in the deep shadow of cove mountain the
night mail swept around the narrows and thundered up to the little station
at dauphin

    a brief pause a pull at the bell rope and it rushed on up the northern
central toward sunbury rattling through the village street and spitting out
columns of red flame at spasmodic intervals

    the station master the telegraph operator and half a dozen wildly dissi-
pated individuals who kept late hours came to the door of the waiting room
and looked with eager curiosity at the two passengers who had just alighted

   they were young men both of them-thirty or thirty five one would say-
and they did not look unlike  for each had a closely cropped yellow beard
and a drooping golden mustache they wore neat fitting suits of rough
tweed and soft slouch hats and each carried a big valise a gun neatly cased
and a bunch of fishing rods

   sportsmen from the city evidently and just such men as could be found
every season down at rockville or up above the clarks ferry dam where
the fishing was best but to find them at dauphin was more of a rarity for
although the fishing is equally good the river here is dangerous and full of peril

   the two strangers paid no heed to the crowd in the doorway and sought
no information but after a short consultation lifted their valises and started
quietly down the road

   without hesitation they crossed the stony creek bridge in the darkness
and pulled up a moment later at the old tavern it was only half past ten
but within all was dark and silent

     this is the place jim said one of them

    yes i believe so well make sure though

   he struck a match and holding it up to the weatherbeaten sign that
creaked over the entrance he read in faded letters 

stony creek tavern
stjlwvan jones

as the match died out they stepped across the porch and rapped sharply
on the door twice they repeated it and at the third summons an upper
sullivan jones boarders



window was raised and the harsh voice of mr sullivan jones hitnself
answered   whats wanted down thar  

    the men stepped off the porch and looked up

     are you mr jones  said one

   thats my name sir

   ah well you perhaps recollect an inquiry some time ago from the
city concerning accommodations for two fishermen we are the parties who
wrote you

     waal waal is that so i had no idee you was cornin just wait a
minit will ye  

   the window was slammed down and soon a light shone and a commotion
was heard in the house and then the door was opened and mr jones ushered
his guests inside slamming the door in the face of the inquisitive group from
the station who had followed on behind

   before eight oclock the next morning all dauphin had passed and
repassed by the tavern door much to the glory of old jones who smoked his
pipe on the porch and smiled kindly on the villagers it was nearly noon
however when the new arrivals condescended to come down stairs and
while they were partaking of a late breakfast in the special dining room the
crowd flocked into the combined barroom and office and read on the pages
of the register-which book by the way had been opened thirty years be-
fore and was nearly a quarter full-the neatly inscribed entries on which the
ink was hardly dry 

                  j mayne prior new york

              douglas r mortlock new york

    while old jones attends to the wants of the thirsty crowd in the barroom
we jvill take a glance at the important individuals at breakfast

    in the light of day they appear a little older perhaps and the expression
of their uneasy gray eyes would impress a close observer of character rather
unfavorably there is an indefinable something that rather detracts from the
gentle appearance of those soft beards and mustaches

    all right so far says mr prior as he dissects a tempting omelette

     yes responds mr mortlock who is slowly sipping his coffee  the
outlook is favorable and as for the people with whom our lot is cast i must
confess they appear childlike and bland to a marked degree

   breakfast over the two go out and smoke their cigars on the porch
the afternoon is devoted to getting on the right side of the citizens
which is speedily accomplished by a general invitation to appear before the
bar and before nightfall dauphin has unanimously declared the strangers to
be two of the most perfect gentlemen that ever graced the town with their
presence

    they prove to be enthusiastic sportsmen and under the expert guidance
of mr jones who is an oracle on angling they spend the next few days in
fishing for bass around the piers of the old bridge but strange to say if is old
jones who catches all the fish they do a little gunning for snipe too and
in the evening they come out on the tavern porch and listen to the some-
what remarkable conversations that take place for dauphin is at present the

headquarters for a large force of men who are relaying the pottsville division
of the reading road which was almost entirely destroyed in a recent flood

ii

   up along the river road at a cozy little farm house tom lurgan and
charlie rogers were spending a two weeks vacation they both had posi-
tions in a large clothing store in harrisburg and chose this way of passing
their holidays from reasons of economy

   it was saturday evening and they were on their way down to the post
office to get their mail

    do you know charlie said tom abruptly  i would give a good deal
to know what those two men are doing in dauphin they have been here
now for nearly a week and they know very little about fishing for i dont be-
lieve either of them has caught a bass yet though they go out on the river
every day  

   it is strange replied charlie did you notice they cant even
handle their rods right  

    yes continued tom  and i discovered a very queer thing yesterday
you know young carson down by the lock well he says this man mort-
loclc bought an old boat and a pair of oars from him and has it hidden
among the rocks down at the foot of the wall somewhere near the curve
carson took it down for him and mortlock said he wanted to use it to go
fishing early in the morning it may be very foolish and all that but i cant
help feeling that these men are here for a purpose we will keep our eyes
open anyhow

   when the boys reached the post office early as it was the tavern porch
across the way was filled and the crowd were singing scraps of songs

   whats up tonight   asked tom

   well replied the postmaster you see its pay night an theyre
feelin purty good they havent been paid fur nigh onto three weeks or
more an tonight the paymaster comes down here with the stuff

    when does he get here   asked tom

     well let me see the pay car reaches ellendale forge at half past
seven from there the road aint been tested yet so the paymaster takes
the hand truck an comes on down ter dauphin on that i believe he goes on
down ter rockville an harrisburg an pays the men off there too hell
get here in an hour or too for its half past six now

    much obliged said tom and the boys left the post office

   as they crossed over toward the tavern a man came running up ex-
citedly from the direction of the station it was mike malley the road fore-
man

    stir yourselves he shouted to the loungers on the porch  thars a
landslide up at powels creek an the bridge is gone an the wires cut off
thars no time to lose so come on now all of you we must do all we kin
tonight yet

   some grumbling followed this startling piece of news
sullivan jones boarders



    whard you hear all that   cried some one

    down at the station cried mike  the operator found he was shut
off an then a trackman from powels creek come down the river in a boat
an told me he went on down to tell the gang at rockville but come on
now we must beat the rockville gang sure

   the men jumped up and hurried down to the station where half a dozen
hand cars lay on a side track while a lot of the villagers out of mere
curiosity started to walk up the river to the scene of the disaster at powels
creek

   it all happened so quickly that when the boys reached the tavern it was
deserted and sullivan jones was standing  the porch wearing a somewhat
sour expression on his wrinkled features for he had counted on a very busy
evening

    we want a couple of your best cigars said tom and then following
him back to the bar he added  where are your two boarders tonight mr
jones  

   the tavern keeper handed out the box and then said slowly 

    theyve gone fishin up stony creek started bout half an hour ago
in abe millers boat theyre mighty fine fellers but blamed ef they know
much about fishin why they went for pike with a big cork an a can of
worms and mr jones shook his head as he tapped a bottle of birch beer
for the postmaster who had just entered and called for his favorite beverage

   the boys left the tavern and bidding charlie wait a moment on the porch
tom ran up to a store a few doors above and purchased a red light left over
from the fourth of july stock he stowed it away in his pocket and hurried
back to the tavern

    i have an idea charlie he said hurriedly  i cant take time to tell
you come on along quick 

   they hastily crossed the bridge and turned up along the railroad

   stony creek dam lay on their left but no fishermen could be seen on its
broad surface half a mile further it ended abruptly and the boys forced
their way down through the bushes to the point where the creek entered the
dam from above

   pulled up in the bushes lay the boat the rods and the can of worms still
resting on the seat but  trace of the fishermen

   toms face paled for an instant

    by jove charlie he cried  i see it all those men are going to rob
the paymaster  look here now he continued excitedly  we must do
something if i was only certain it was right we could alarm the village and
capture these fellows in their own trap but there is the rub suppose
there is nothing in it after all  i thought of that so i bought this red light
at the store now listen charlie heres what you must do go back to
dauphin and stay around the station where you can see up the valley i
will hurry  ahead it will soon be dark now and the paymaster ought to
get here in less than an hour if i discover anything i will run up on the
side of the mountain and touch off this red light and as soon as you see the
signal alarm the village and send them up the valley as fast as they can go

      e


sullivan jones boarders

you know what to do now so hurry back and keep a sharp lookout and
leaving- charlie standing by the boat tom plunged into the bushes

iii

   tom kept on for a mile or more and then it began to grow dark he
felt that he was in a situation of peril for if robbery was the object of these
men they would hardly hesitate at murder to accomplish their plans and the
more he pondered over it the more certain he felt that his suspicious were
justified for all the circumstances pointed just that way

   he was now nearly two miles up the valley it was rapidly growing
dark and as yet he had seen and heard nothing a few feet above him up
a little embankment lay the railroad track with the mountain rising steep
beyond not far ahead round a slight curve the creek ran in between the
mountain and the railroad and was crossed by an open trestle work tom
stopped a moment all was silent but hark 

   a low grating sound rises in the distance it comes closer becomes
louder and up above his head the rails begin to sing faintly

   tom quickly forced his way up the bank through the thorny blackberry
bushes and peered cautiously out it had grown suddenly dark in the last
minute and he can only see an indistinct form rolling round the curve above
him it rushes on swifter and swifter and with a whirr like the rising of
quail the velocipede hand car dashes past him in the gloom with two
motionless figures on the seat tom drew a long breath and stepped out
from his place of concealment what a fool he was to be sure  all this
trouble and worry for nothing he turned down the track toward dauphin
when suddenly a thought strikes him-a thought that brings him to a stand-
still and makes his blood run cold he turned and hurried up the track
he rounded the curve approached the trestle work and stood looking down
on the shallow bed of stony creek a cry of horror and he leaped down
the embankment

   two motionless forms lay among the stones dead to all appearances  but
placing his hand on the breast of the man neaiest him tom felt the heart
beat faintly he pulled him to a sitting position and dashed water on his
face again and again and finally with a moan of pain the man opened his
eyes and closed them again wearily

   the other lay partly in the water no sign of life was visible and drag-
ging the body to the shore tom rushed up the bank and with frantic leaps
fairly flew up the face of the mountain

   if he could only give the alarm in time  the murderers must be near
dauphin already

   half way up he stops he scrapes a match on the rock it burns and
goes out the next one burns brightly and ignites the end of the red light
a moment of suspense and then the ruddy scarlet glow flares up like a volcano

iv

   charlie made his way slowly back to dauphin he was just a little
doubtful about this deadly plot of toms but he was equally suspicious
sullivan jones boarders



of these strange fishermen so he determined to be on the alert for toms
signal

   he sat down for a while  the old stone wall of the bridge and watched
the water rushing under the arches once he heard a faint roaring sound
up the valley like the rumble of a distant train but it stopped suddenly
he felt thirsty and wanted a drink  but he dared not leave his post

   after a while the station master came down the road toward the village
and as he reached the bridge a man on horseback galloped furiously down
the street

    hello malley whats up  called the station master

   the foreman pulled his horse up short

    is that you   he cried  has darrel arrived yet with the money  

     no  hes late tonight

    good lord   cried malley  somethings wrong theres no land-
slide at powels creek at all hurry back to the station quick  

   the station master turned back with malley and for a moment charlie
sat there absolutely dazed for all doubt was gone now

   every second was precious malley and the station master were already
out of sight should he run to the station or to the tavern  but no  the
tavern was deserted he had a better plan

   down at the canal just above the lock was a little inn frequented by
boatmen and here at night were to be found all the fishermen of the vil-
lage-strong sturdy fellows who sat on the benches smoking and chatting
he dashed over the bridge and down the road and looking over his
shoulder as he ran he saw behind him a red glare rising over the darkness of
the valley

   he was close to the river now for he could see lights shining down
toward marysville a few steps more and he ran dowm to the bank of the
canal

   no one was at the lock but up at the inn the lamp was lit in three
jumps he crossed the swinging bridge a few yards more and-

   he sprang back in fright as two burly figures rose from the ground and
seized him a gag was stuffed into his mouth a cold pistol barrel was
pressed to his forehead and grasped by each arm he was forced quickly
down the towpath

   unable to resist or make any outcry he was hurried on under the shadow
of the old susquehanna bridge across a bar of yellow light that actually
streamed down from the station where a loud commotion was already heard
and then the three passed on into the deep shadows of the trees that fringed
the towpath

   they were directly opposite the narrows now on the left lay the canal
dark with the reflected shadows of the mountain  to the right the wall of
rock falling sheer and steep to the river-the famed dauphin rapids that
boiled and raged in their rocky channel

   round the bend they stopped it was moonlight now and charlie easily
recognized mr mortlock and mr prior prior took the gag from his
mouth


sullivan jones  boarders

    no noise now lie said tossing the revolver up and down in his hand
  can you guide a boat through these rapids   

   charlie shook his head

    you lie   said prior  you know the channel and you must take
us across

   a yard beyond rude steps ran down the side of the wall prior took
the lead pulling charlie after him and mortloclc came behind tugging at a
valise that seemed to be a terribly heavy burden

   at the bottom prior drew a boat from the bushes they forced charlie
to the middle seat and then took their places one at each end

   now then said prior take those oars and land us safely on the
other side below the falls no trifling now or youll make food for the
fishes    and he handled the revolver in a suggestive way

   there was no escape so charlie took the oars and pulled out into the
current he was badly scared but he still had his wits about him and as
the boat glided ahead under his quick strokes he tried to think what to do

   the robbers-murderers indeed no doubt-intended to catch a train
somewhere on the other side the satchel contained the stolen money
they were desperate men and to thwart them in their plans would be next
to impossible the river was very low and the channel was extremely
perilous little wonder the robbers had pressed a guide into their service

   bright as snow in the moonlight the rocks tossed up the foam and spray
but with a cunning hand charlie steered the boat among them scraping dan-
gerously near at times and then riding high on the crest of the waves at
his back was mortlock with the valise while prior faced him revolver still
in hand

   neither of them spoke as the passage was safely made through the first
dangerous rift and when they reached a bit of calm water prior said 

   now mind young fellow no nonsense take us below the falls all
right and well land you high and dry on the first island some one will
take you off in the morning and not a word about this to any one   

   they were now half a mile above the rockville falls in their rear lay
the scattered lights of dauphin while ahead over the top of the great rock-
ville bridge a silvery white halo reflected from the electric lamps showed where
harrisburg lay five miles below

   a spurt through the rapids again and the boat shot beneath the bridge
as they neared the falls and the roar of the water increased prior looked
about him uneasily

   the rockville falls are almost an unbroken line of gray rocks that
stretch in the form of a crescent a mile and quarter across the river the
channels are known only to the old rivermen and are dangerous at all times

   in the center rises an unusually high group of rocks running a few yards
above the falls and splitting the current into two streams which sweep
around it on both sides with terrible velocity straight for this point charlie
steered the boat and as it shot with the swiftness of an arrow directly toward
the rocks both men half rose in alarm

    now then charlie called out loudly above the roar of the water
sullivan jones boarders



 when the boat strikes jump out i will go over the falls and take you in
from below

   prior made a motion of assent no thought of trickery entered his head
with a clever stroke charlie carried the boat directly across where the current
split and in an instant it grated heavily on the rocks prior and mort-
lock made the jump safely and the boat freed of their weight swung into
the current on the right with a dizzy whirl it plunged into the seething
abyss of foam and spray and shot over the falls it struck fair and square
below and as the short choppy waves smacked it on the sides charlie rose to
his feet and then like a flash dived overboard

   he rose gasping for breath and clutched the bow of the boat a moment
of silent suspense and then crack crack crack the bullets pattered about
him while a terrible cry of rage burst from the baffled robbers bn the rock

   he was out of danger in an instant borne on by the fierce current and
in a few moments he grounded on a grass bar

   it was short work to turn the boat and empty it and then with eager ex-
citement he pulled for shore at rockville he luckily caught the night
mail and just as they were bringing paymaster darrel and his assistants into
the village on stretchers he rushed among them dripping wet and breathless

   a dozen boats started for the falls and two hours later they came back
with the robbers and the bag of money unable to swim they were as se-
cure on the rocks as they would have been in prison and without resistance
they surrendered

   no one in dauphin slept that night and when sunday morning dawned
a ceaseless crowd flocked to the old tavern to shake hands with the brave
boys who had caused the capture of the robbers while overhead in old
jones best room the injured men came slowly back to life and consciousness

   the robbers had thrown the car from the track by means of a big stone
hurling the riders into the creek below where they lay stunned and in shal-
low water then seizing the money and dragging the uninjured truck to the
rails they actually rode down to the edge of the village thus getting ahead
of toms signal

   the confederate who brought the false news of the landslide and thus
cleared the coast for the robbers was never discovered

   mr prior and mr mortlock were promptly convicted and sent to the
penitentiary and tom uurgan and charlie rogers received a present from
the railroad company that will enable them to spend their future vacations
where they please

   mr sullivan jones still smokes his pipe on the tavern porch and is always
willing to relate the whole story to the chance traveler who puts up at his
inn

   yes indeed he invariably adds at the close  appearances is a mighty
deceitful thing an not to be relied on at all  why sir you never seen in
your life two more perfect seemin gentlemen than them same mr prior and
mr mortlock an yet sir they was bad to the core

a tale of moscow the nihilists and the czar-the extraordinary experiences of an englishman
who assumes the name and obligations of a russian army officer-complications that
bring the bold adventurer within shivering distance of siberia and the tactics
which earn for him a notable nickname

synopsis of chapters previously published

    hamylton tregethner is an englishman who has lived a great part of his life in russia
deceived by the woman he loves he is about to go to st petersburg to offer himself for the field
in the event of war with turkey hoping somebody will put a bullet through him when at the
moscow railway station he is approached by a stranger olga petrovitch who takes him for her
brother alexis to whom he bears a marvelous resemblance this alexis is a good for nothing
roysterer a lieutenant in the russian army he has become involved in a quarrel with major
devinsky who persecutes olga with unwelcome attentions and fearing to meet the major on
the dueling field is about to flee in disguise tregethner becomes interested in the case and
being reckless of what he does in any event gives alexis his passport as hamylton tregethner
and decides to remain in moscow as alexis petrovitch he fights the duel with devinsky
utterly routing him but presently finds himself in a tangle because of a love affair his prede-
cessor had with paula tueski the wife of the chief of police she is deceived as are all other
friends of the lieutenant to say nothing of the nihilists witli whom it turns out he has had
dealings

    one night he is summoned to a meeting in a house by the riverside after being conducted
through devious ways he finds himself in a room occupied by some thirty or forty men each
carrying a knife he is told that he has been brought there to die whereupon he declares that
he will make it easier for them to kill him by giving up his revolver and baring the heart side of
his breast a tall man seizes him in a grip like iron and bends him backward so that either
his throat or his heart is at the mercy of the long knife he raises aloft

chapter viii-contimied-the riverside meeting

   i let no sound escape me and did not move a muscle the next instant
my left hand was seized and a finger pressed on my pulse in this position i
remained for a full minute i do not believe that my pulse quickened save
for the physical strain by so much as one beat

   it is enough said the man who had before spoken  and i was
released

   you are no coward he added addressing me i withdraw that
you can have your life on one condition

    and that

   that jou swear-

    i will swear nothing i interposed

    you have taken the oath of fealty

 i will swear nothing take my life if you like but swear i will not

if i had meant treachery i should have had the police round us tonight like
a swarm of bees you have had a proof whether im true or not and when
i turn traitor you can run a blade into my heart or lodge a bullet in my
brain but oaths are nothing to a man who means either to keep or break
his word what is the condition  i told you mine before  

    yours is accepted your task is -here he sunk his voice and whis-
pered right into my ear- the death of christian tueski 

    i accept i answered readily i would have accepted had they told
me to kill the czar himself   but it will take time i will have no other
hand in it than mine it is a glorious commission mine alone the honor
of success and mine alone the danger or mine alone the disgrace of fail-
ure i looked on the whole thing now as more or less of a burlesque  but
i planned the part i had chosen as well as i could and when the little
puny rebel put out his hand in the darkness and clasped mine i gripped his
with a force that made his bones crack as if to convey to him the intensity
of my resolve and my enthusiastic pleasure at the bloody work they had
allotted me

   then i was told to leave and in a few minutes i was once more in the
open air quite as undecided then as i have always remained as to what had
been the real intentions in regard to myself

    one of my chief regrets was not to be able to see the burly giant who had
twisted me about on his knee as easily as i should a fowl whose neck i meant
to wring he was indeed a man to admire and i would have given much
for a sight of him

   but my guide hurried me back through the labyrinth of streets into
respectable moscow once more and i was soon busy wondering how long
a shrift i should have before my new  comrades  would grow impatient for
me to act

   certainly they would have plenty of time for their impatience to grow
very cold before i should turn murderer to further their schemes but i
could not foresee the strange chain of events which was fated to fasten on me
the new character that i had assumed so lightly and dramatically-the char-
acter of a desperate bloodthirsty and absolutely reckless nihilist

  chapter ix-devinsky again

   it will be readily understood that i now found life exciting enough to
satisfy me my complications multiplied so fast without any act of mine
that i had no time to think of the old troubles and disappointments which
had so soured hamylton tregethner they had already faded into little
more than memories associated with an existence that i had once lived but
had now done with altogether i was getting rapidly absorbed by the dan-
gers and incidents of the new life

   how completely i had changed the current of opinion about alexis petro-
vitch i had abundant evidence during the next few days in the form of invi-
tations to houses which had hitherto been closed to me people also began
to remember olga and she equally shared in the altered condition of things


by right of sword

    i did not tell her any particulars of my night with the nihilists nor of
the mission with which i was charged it would probably only distress her
and could do no good  unless i might find it necessary to use it to compel
her to leave moscow i questioned her as to her own connections with the
nihilists and from wliat she told me i saw that though they wrere slight in
themselves they were enough to put her in the power of a woman such as
paula tueski and emphatically much more than sufficient to make her ar-
rest a certainty if i were to be arrested or if anything should happen to
throw increased suspicion on me

   our meeting after her letter to me was a very pleasant one she came
up to me with a smile and begged me again to forgive her that was not
difficult

    i can speak frankly to a brother now i couldnt always you know
alexis-she glanced with roguish severity into my face- because a few
days ago you used to get very bad tempered and even swear a little but
ill admit you are improving-in that respect though i am afraid you are
as dogged as ever but i can be dogged too and if i speak frankly now it
is to tell you that nothing you can do will make me go out of russia until
you are safe you may form what opinion you like of me-though i dont
want that to be very bad-but a coward you shall never find me

   i didnt think you a coward you know that you said it in your
letter  and i shall not forgive that rudeness of yours if you persist in this
attitude

     what is the use of a brother if one cant be rude to him pray  as for
your forgiveness you cant help that now youve given it besides on
reflection i should not be frightened of you will you make me a promise   
 yes if it has nothing to do with your going away

   it has

    then i wont make it but ill make a truce i will not press you to
go away unless i think it necessary for my own safety will that do 

     yes ill go then she answered readily holding out her hand to make
a bargain of it as she added   mind if its necessary for your safety

     youre as precise as a lawyer said i laughing as i pressed her hand
and saw a flush of color tinge her face a moment

    now she said after a pause  i have a surprise for you i have a
letter from an old friend of yours-a very old friend

    an old friend of mine oh i see an old friend of your brothers
yon mean well who is it now  is there another complication 

    no no an old friend of my new brothers from mr hamylton
tregethner she laughed merrily as she stumbled over the old cornish
syllables  i dont like that englishman she added gravely  do you
know why   

     not for the life of me

   well i do not like him but i cant say why her manner was
peculiar see here is the passport mr tregethner has sent it and he
seems to have crossed the russian frontier without the least difficulty he
has gone to paris by way of austria when shall you go  she did not
by right of sword



look up as she asked this but stood rummaging among the papers on the table
i took the passport unfolded and read it mechanically  then without think-
ing folded it up again and put it away in my pocket

   evidently she meant it as my dismissal  and it was very awkward for me
to explain that i could not be dismissed in this way because of the difficulties
in the road of my leaving i did not wish to appear to force myself upon her
as a brother  but i could not go first without seeing her in safety  and there
was the crux

   ill make my arrangements as soon as i can i replied after a longish
pause  and i was conscious of being a little stiff in my manner   but of
course i cant manage things quite as i please you see i didnt come into
this-i mean i took up the part and-well im hanged if i know what i
do mean  except that of course im sorry to seem to force myself on you
longer than you like but i cant get away quite so easily as you seem to
think i know it puts you in an awkward position but for the moment i
dont for the life of me see how its to be helped

   as i finished she lifted her head and her expression was at first grave
until the light of a smile in her blue eyes began to spread over her face and
the corners of her mouth twitched

    then you wont be able to go yet of course its very awkward as
you say  but i must manage to put up with it as best i can in the mean
time as we have to continue the parts we had better play them so as to
mystify people dont you agree with this  

     yes i think that certainly i answered catching her drift and smiling
in my turn

    then i am riding this afternoon at three oclock  and as it might occa-
sion remark if our afternoon rides were broken off quite suddenly dont you
think it would te very diplomatic if you were to come with me   

   yes very diplomatic i assented readily but you never told me
before that we were in the habit of riding out together every day

    it hasnt been exactly every afternoon answered olga laughing  in
fact its more than a year since the last ride but the principle of the thing is
the same we ought not to break the continuitj 

   it was an exceedingly jolly gallop we had as we rode back we discussed
the question of the best course for us to take we were both too much ex-
hilarated by the ride to take any but a sanguine view  and so far as i am
concerned i think i talked about it rather as a sort of link between us two
than in any serious sense

   when i got to my rooms i was surprised to learn from my servant borlas
that my old opponent major devinsky had called to see me i did not know
he was back in moscow though i knew he had been away i had been at
drill that morning-i had quickly fallen into the routine of the work-and
had heard nothing of his return certainly there was no reason why he
should come to me  though there were many why he should keep away

   he might have watched me into my rooms for almost before i had changed
my riding things he was announced he came in smiling impudent self
assertive and disposed to be friendly


by right of sword

     what can you want with me that can induce you to come here   i
asked coldly

      i want an understanding petrovitch  

    lieutenant petrovitch if you please i interposed

    oh i beg your pardon lieutenant petrovitch im sure he answered
lightly  but theres really no need for this kind of reception i want to
be friends with you

   i bowed as he paused

      you and i have not understood each other quite in the past  

      not until within the last few days   i returned significantly

   im not referring to that he said flushing though as youve
started it ill pay you the compliment of saying youre devilish neat and
clever in your workmanship i had no idea of it either nor any one
else- 

    what do you want with me i interrupted with a wave of the hand
to stop his compliment

    i want to talk quietly over with you my suit for your sisters hand i
want to know where we stand you and i

    my sisters hand is not mine to give this very curtly

    i dont ask you to give it man i only want to win it i am as good
a match for her as any man in moscow    and with that he launched out
into a long account of his wealth position and prospects and of the position
his wife would occupy

   i let him talk as long as he would quite understanding that this was only
the preface to something else-the real purpose of his visit gradually he
drew nearer and nearer to the point and i saw him eyreing me furtively to
note the effect of his words which he weighed very carefully he spoke of
his family influence  how he could advance my interests what an advan-
tage it was to have command of wealth when making an army career  and
much more until he showed me that what he really intended was to presume
on my old evil reputation and bribe me with money down if necessary and
with promises of future help if i would agree to let olga marry him

    your proposal put in plain terms means i said bluntly when he had
exhausted his circuitous suggestions that you want to buy my consent
and assistance i told you at the start that my sisters hand was not mine
to give  neither is it mine to sell major devinsky

   he bent a sharp calculating look on me as if to judge whether i was in
earnest or merely raising my terms

    i am not a man easily balked he said

    nor i one easily bribed i retorted

    you will have a fortune and more than a fortune behind you with
skill like yours you can climb to any height you please

   sink to any depth you please you should say i answered sternly
 but my sister declines absolutely to be your wife she dislikes you cor-
dially-as cordially as i do  and no plea that you could offer would induce
her to change her mind

    you werent always very solicitous about her wishes he muttered
by right of sword



with an angry sneer i didnt understand this allusion  but it made me
very angry

    you are under my roof i cried hotly  but even here you will be
good enough to put some guard on your speech it may clear your thoughts
to know what my present feelings are i now spoke with crisp cutting
emphasis   if my sister could by any art or persuasion be induced to be
your wife i would never consent to exchange another word with her in all
my life as for the veiled bribe you have offered i allowed jou to make it
that i might see how low you would descend sooner than accept it i
would break my sword across my knee and turn cabman for a living
but your visit shall have done result-i will tell my sister all that has
passed- 

    by heaven if you dare-

    all that has passed now and if she would rather marry than retain her
relationship to me i will retire in your favor but you will do well not to
be hopeful   i could not resist this rather petty little sneer

    you will live to repent this lieutenant petrovitch 

    at your service i replied quietly with a bow

   he was white to the lips with anger when he rose to go and he seemed
as if fighting to keep back the utterance of some hot insult that rose to his
lips but his rage got no farther than ugly looks and he was still wrestling
with his agitation when he left the room

   i could understand his chagrin he would have dearly liked to force
me at the point of the sword to consent and the knowledge that this was no
longer possible that in some way which of course he could not uuderstand
i had broken his influence and was no longer afraid of him galled and
maddened him almost beyond endurance he looked the baffled bully to the
life

   it was two days before i had an opportunity of speaking to olga about it
i had made a rule of seeing her daily if possible lest anything should
happen that needed explanation by her  but she was away the next day and
our daily  business conference did not take place

   she took the matter very curiously when i did mention it she was a
creature of changing moods indeed

     i have a serious matter to speak to you about something that may
perhaps surprise you i said when we were riding  i am the bearer of
a message to you i have to be very much the brother in this  in fact the
head of the family  and then without much beating about the bush i told
her of devinskys visit and of his desire to make her his wife

   she listened to me very seriously scanning my face the while  but did
not interrupt me i had expected a contemptuous and passionate refusal
but her attitude was simply a conundrum she heard me out to the end
with gravity and when i had finished reined in her horse and for a full
minute stared point blank into my eyes

   then she laughed lightly and asked as she sent her horse forward again 

     do you think i ought to marry him-brother   

   frankly i was a good deal disappointed at her conduct i did not see


by fight of sword

why there should be a moments hesitation about her answer especially
after all she had said to me about the man and this feeling may perhaps
have shown itself in my manner

   i could do no less than tell you of the proposal considering that
devinsky believes in the relationship between us i said  but i dont
see how you knowing everything can look to me for the judgment i should
have had to give were that relationship real and i actually head of the
family

    this stilted reply seemed to please her for she glanced curiously at me
and then smiled as i thought almost merrily or even mischievously as she
replied 

     a proposal of marriage is a very serious thing alexis

     yes  so people often find it

    major devinsky is very rich and influential he is right when he says
that his wife would have a very good position in one way in moscow

    i wish her much happiness with him i retorted grimly

     he is ver handsome too

   i said nothing she disappointed and vexed me

    ah you men never see other mens good looks youre very moody
she added after a pause when she found me still silent

     i dont admire major devinsky i said rather sullenly

   she laughed so heartily at this and seemed evidently so pleased that i
wished i had found the laugh less musical next she looked at me again
thoughtfully before she spoke as if to weigh the effect of her words

   it would be greatly to your advantage too alexis to have major
devinsky- 

   thank you i cut in shortly i do not seek major deviuskys
patronage when i cannot climb or stand without it ill fall and quite
contentedly even if i break my neck shall we get on and i urged
my horse to a quick trot

   my evident irritation at her suggestion-for i could not hear the matter
without showing my resentment-seemed to please her as much as anything
for she smiled as her nag cantered easily at my side but i would not look
at her if she meant to marry devinsky i meant what i had said to him

i would have no more to do with the business and i would get out of
russia as soon as possible the best way i could

   a sidelong glimpse that i caught of olgas face after a while showed me
that the look of laughing pleasure had died away and had given place to a
thoughtful and rather stern expression  making up her mind was my
thought and then having a stretch of road ahead i quickened up my
horses speed to a hard gallop and we had a quick burst at a rattling pace

   when we pulled up and stood to breathe our horses before turning their
heads homewards the girls cheeks were all aglow with ruddy color and her
eyes dancing with the excitement of the gallop she made such a picture of
beautiful womanhood that i was forced to gaze at her in sheer admiration

   we had not spoken since i had closed the last bit of dialogue and now
she maneuvered her horse quite close to me and said 
by right of sword



    alexis did you bring that proposal to me deliberately 

   yes it was scarcely a question i could answer for you

    couldnt you  her eyes rested on mine with an expression that at
another time i should have read as reproach  did you think there could
be any but one answer   

   no i didnt but one never knows i said remembering what she
had said just before the gallop

    dont you well you must think we russian women are poor stuff 
one day ready to sneak off in disgraceful cowardice  and the next willing
to marry an utterly despicable wretch because he has money and influence
and position do you mean to tell me that you acting as my brother
actually let this man make this proposition in cold blood and did not hurl
him out of your rooms  you  

   i stared at her in sheer amazement at the change and could find not a
word to say nor was there any need now that her real feelings had
forced themselves to words she had plenty and for some minutes she did
nothing but utter protestation after protestation of her hatred and contempt
of devinsky  while her hits at me for having been the mouthpiece of the
man were many and hard what angered her was she said to feel that the
smallest doubt of her intention had been left in devinskys mind and it was
not till i told her much more particularly and exactly all that had passed on
this point that she was satisfied

   we had ridden some way homewards when her mood changed again and
laughter once more prevailed

   so you told him i must choose between him and-my brother or
rather my present relationship to you 

    i told him i would never speak to you again if you married him
well i have chosen she replied at once i shall not give up-
my brother   and with that she pricked up her nag and we rattled along
fast her cheeks growing ruddier and ruddier than ever with the exercise

   i couldnt follow her change of mood  but i was heartily glad she had
decided to have nothing to do with devinsky she was far too good a girl
to be wasted on him

chapter x-that butcher durescq

   we were not by any means done with devinsky yet and i was to have
striking proof of this a couple of days later i met him in the interval as
men in the same regiment are bound to meet  and i deemed it best to avoid
all open rupture seeing that he was my superior officer and unpleasant con-
sequences to others beside myself might result

   i told him shortly that olga declined his offer and that it must never be
renewed he took it coolly enough replying only that his feelings for her
would never change nor should he abandon the resolve to make her his wife
then as he made overtures of peace and apologized for what he had said i
thought it discreet to patch up a sort of treaty of mutual tolerance

   i	was speaking of this to essaieff to whom in common with all the mess


by right of sword

deviuskys infatuation for olga was perfectly well known and my former
second seemed particularly impressed by it since the duel i had seen more
of him than of any other man and i liked him i could be with him more
safely than with others moreover because he had seen so little of the unre-
generate alexis every man who had been at all intimate with my former
self i now avoided altogether because of the risk of detection-although
this risk was of course diminishing with every day that passed

   i dont like what you say petrovitcli said essaieff after he had
thought it over  im convinced devinskys a dangerous man  and if he
attempts to make things up with you depend upon it hes got some ugly
reason behind

    a reason in petticoats said i lightly  a brothers a charming fel-
low-to a man in love with the sister  

     no doubt but he thought he was going to kill the  charming fellow 
in that duel why did he go away  and where did he go 

    he didnt tell me his private business naturally

    yet im much mistaken if it didnt in some way concern you

    i dont see how

   we dont see the sun at midnight man but thats only because
theres something in the line of sight other people can see it clearly
enough

   well i dont see this sun anyway and im not going to worry
about it

   have you ever heard of durescq alexandre durescq he asked
after a pause

   no never i answered promptly making one of those slips which it
was impossible for me to avoid in my private chats essaieffs next words
showed me my blunder

    my dear fellow you must have heard of him durescq the duelist
the man who has the reputation of being the best swordsman in the russian
army the french felloe who was naturalized and clapped a  c  into his name
and cut off the tail of it to make duresque into durescq why he was here
last year and dined with us at the mess devinsky brought him you had
joined us then surely and must have been introduced by devinsky you
must remember him

    oh that durescq   i exclaimed as if recalling the incident

     that durescq   theres no other for the whole russian army said
essaieff dryly and if he heard you say it hed want an explanation
quick enough

    i wras thinking for a minute of another duresque essaieff whom i
knew much better different sex whose killing of men was in a different
way i smiled as i made the equivocation

    i met him this morning said my companion noticing my remark and
looking more thoughtful than before  i wonder if devinskys absence has

anvthing to do with durescqs presence and whether- he paused and

looked at me  it would be a damnably ugly business  but deviuskys not
incapable of it and so far as i know the other mans worse moreover i
by right of sword



know they have been together in more than one very dirty affair but this
would be murder-sheer deliberate damnable murder-and nothing else

   i had rarely seen him so excited as he was now

    you think devinsky has brought this man here to do what he couldn t
do himself the other morning  i asked

    i dont say i think it replied essaieff cautiously  i shouldnt like
to think it of any man  but if i were you id be a bit cautious about getting
into a quarrel

    caution be hanged i cried  if thats their game ill force the pace
for them well have a real fight next time essaieff but ill have one
condition and one only-that devinsky meets me first

 what a fire devil youve turned alexis said essaieff enthusiastically
it was the first time he had used my christian name and it pleased me

	even the rankers have found you out now  that devil alexis is what
they call you one to the other since you beat their best men in leaping and
running and staff playing if the war comes as like good russians we pray
it may what a record youll make theyll follow you anywhere yet
theres shrewdness enough in your last devilment if you insist on first
killing devinsky durescq will probably take back a bloodless sword to the
capital

   his pithy reference to the feeling in the regiment touched my vanity on
its weak spot and gave me quite disproportionate pleasure as we talked
over this possible plan of devinskys i tried to get him to speak of the feel-
ing again it is rather a paltry confession to make  but the nickname

	that devil alexis was exactly what i would have wished to bear

   although essaieff had suggested this action on the part of devinsky i
scarcely thought it possible that he would do what we had discussed  but i
had not been many minutes in the club that evening before the thing seemed
not only probable but certain  and i saw that i had a very ugly corner to
turn

   alexandre durescq was there and i eyed him curiously he was taller
than i by an inch but not so broad his figure was well knit and lithe and
he moved with the air which a man gets whose sinews are of steel and
are kept in perfect condition by constant and severe training

   his face was a most unpleasant one the features were thin and all
very long  and the thinness added to the apparent abnormal length from
brow to chin his complexion was almost mongolian in its sallowness  his
hair coal black and his eyes set close to his large and very prominent aqui-
line nose were small but brilliant in expression and seemingly coal black in
color altogether a most remarkable looking man  and i was not astonished
that essaieff had been surprised when i said i had forgotten him he was
not a man to be forgotten

   the expression of his face was sardonic and saturnine and his manners
and gestures were all saturated with intense self assertiveness he moved
looked and spoke as though he felt that every one was at once beneath him
and afraid of him

   he was at the far end of the room when i entered and i saw devinsky stoop
o

by right of sword

and whisper to him immediately he caught sight of me the man turned
slightly and glanced in my direction and my instincts warned me of danger

   i would not balk the pair  but i would not provoke the quarrel i moved
quietly about the room chatting with one man and another but keeping a
wary eye disengaged for the two at the other end gradually i worked my
way round to where they were and both rose as i approached i saw too
that devinskys old seconds and toadies were near and were wyatching me and
smirking they formed a group of three or four men who seemed to have
an intimation of what was coming they were waiting to see me  jumped

   i knew however that if i kept quiet i should make the task more diffi-
cult for the pair and thus compel devinsky to show his hand and so give me
the pretext i needed to force the first fight on him

    good evening petrovitch or lieutenant petrovitch i suppose i should
say said devinsky and the instant he spoke i could tell he had been drink-
ing  i think youve met my friend captain durescq 

    not yet i said looking straight into devinskys eyes with a meaning
he read and didnt like

      is this the gentleman who is so particular in asserting his lieutenancy 
good evening lieutenant petrovitch he said this in a tone that was in-
sufferably insolent  and as if to point the insult the two toadies when they
heard it sniggered audibly

   nothing could have played better into my hands all four made an ex-
traordinary blunder since they showed before i had opened my lips that
the object was to force a quarrel  and thus the sympathies of every decent
man in the place were on my side i kept cool i was too wary to take fire
yet

    i thought you knew captain durescq when he was here last year
said devinsky  but you may have forgotten

    good evening captain durescq said i ignoring devinsky and re-
turning the other mans greeting what is the latest war news in st
petersburg   

    bad for those who do not like fighting he said looking at me in a
way that turned this to a personal insult

    but good perhaps for those soldiers whose swords are to hire i re-
turned with a smile which did not make my point less plain

   the mans eyes flashed

    they will take the place of your friends who do not like the fighting
i added  and to this all about us grew suddenly silent

    my friends how do you mean   asked durescq stiffly

    those whom you mentioned in your first sentence whom else should
i mean    and i let my eye rest as if by accident on devinsky

    you have a singular manner of expressing yourself lieutenant

   we provincials do not always copy the manners of the capital you
know i returned in my pleasantest manner  i think the provinces are
growing more and more independent every year we arrange our own affairs
in our own way have our own etiquette form our own associations and
settle our own quarrels without aid from the capital
by right of sword



   i heard devinsky swear softly into his mustache at this  but there was
nothing for them to take hold of though every man in the room understood
what i meant  and nearly all were now listening

     yes i have heard you have singular manners in the provinces my
friend here devinsky has told me several curious things i heard of one pro-
vincial for instance who allowed himself to be insulted and browbeaten till
his cowardice was almost a byword and it became really impossible for him
to remain in the army unless he accepted the challenge he had so often re-
fused and then he begged almost with tears to get terms made  and when
this was not done he deadened his fears with drink and came to the club
here like a witless fool behaving like a drunken clown  and then at last
actually went out and fought in a condition of seeming delirium we do
not have that in the capital in st petersburg we should have such a
scabby rascal whipped on a gun  

   a movement among the group of toadies showed me how this burlesque
of my conduct was appreciated there while devinsky was grinning boast-
fully

    did major devinsky tell you that i asked my voice down at least
two tones in my excitement while my pulses thrilled at the insult but out-
wardly i was calm

     yes i think thats a pretty fair description isnt it devinsky   replied
durescq turning coolly to the other for confirmation then he turned again
to me and asked why do you recognize the description lieutenant
petrovitch   

   you have not heard the whole of the story i answered getting the
words out with difficulty between teeth i had to clench hard to keep my
passion under control  the man who was beaten in the duel left moscow
in a panic and went to st petersburg for a purpose-that you may perhaps
approve there was now dead silence in all the room and the eyes of every
man in it were riveted on me the first object of the duel was that he
might kill in it the man whose skill was thought to be inferior to his own
so that he might persecute with his disgusting attentions the sister of him on
whom he had purposely fixed the quarrel failing in this he went to
fetch a cleverer sword than his own with which to do his dirty work  and
lie fetched- i paused a second and then my rage burst out like a vol-
cano- he fetched a butcher named durescq to do butchers work  and i
by heaven wont balk him

    with this i lost all control and springing upon durescq i seized his nose
and wrung it and twisted it dragging his head from side to side in my un-
governable fury until i nearly broke my teeth with the straining force with
which i clenched them then raising my hand i slapped his face with a
force and loudness that resounded through the room and made every man
start and wonder what would come next

    that is from the man you say dare not fight one last word before
i meet the butcher i insist on meeting the man who hired him lieutenant
essaieff will act for me  

    with that i left the room feeling that although i was now all but certain


by right of sword

to be killed by durescq i should at least die as became  that devil
alexis  

chapter xi-danger from a fresh source

   i walked home with a feeling of rare exhilaration whatever happened
this was my own quarrel and i had so acted as to secure the sympathy of all
who knew the facts the quarrel had been fixed on me in public in a manner
peculiarly disgraceful to both my opponents and if they killed me it would
be murder

   if on the other hand i could kill either or both the world would be
sweeter and purer for its riddance of them moreover i had so arranged
matters that i saw how i should have at least an equal chance of my life i
should have the choice of weapons and i would fight devinsky with swords
and the   butcher   with pistols

   i thought much about durescqs skill he had a huge reputation both
as a swordsman and a shot but i was very confident in my own skill with
the sword and inclined to doubt whether he could beat me even with that
but in the end i decided not to run that risk the issue should be left to
chance one should be loaded and one unloaded  and a toss should settle
which each should have we would then stand at arms length the barrel
of one mans weapon touching the others forehead the man to vhom for-
tune gave the loaded weapon would thus be bound to blow the others brains
out whether he had any skill or not

   about an hour later essaieff came to me and told me that the whole
regiment was in a state of excitement about the fight and that feeling against
devinsky had reached a positively dangerous pitch especially when it was
known that he had practically refused to meet me that point was still un-
settled and essaieff had come to get my final decision

    my advice is stand firm he said  youre in the right there isnt
an unprejudiced man in the whole army who wouldnt say you were acting
well within your rights  just as i must say my dear fellow youve acted
splendidly throughout

   i told him what i had been thinking

    it seems a ghastly thing to put a life on the spin of a coin he
commented

   better than to have it ended without a chance by the thrust of a
butchers knife

    that name will stick to durescq always he said with a slow smile
 it was splendid do you know you made me hold my breath while you
were at him he is a butcher

    do you say devinsky wont meet me   i asked

   no not that he wont but he raises the excuse that as durescqs
challenge was given first-as it was indeed-the order of the duels must
follow the order of the challenges but thej arranged the challenges pur-
posely in that order

    i shant hold to the point i said after a moments consideration  if
by right of sword



they insist i shall give way and meet durescq first but this will only
make it the more easy for us to insist on our plan of fighting dont give
way on that i am resolved that one of us shall fall  and chance shall settle
which

   essaieff tried to persuade me to insist  meeting devinsky first  but
i would not

   no he shant carry back to st petersburg the tale that we in
moscow are ready to bluster in words and then darent make them good in
our acts  

   i hope hell carry back no tale at all to st petersburg answered my
friend grimly  and then he left me

   i completed what few preparations i had to make in view of the very
probably fatal issue of the fight  wrote a letter to olga and inclosed one to
balestier as i had done before  and was just getting off to bed when essaieff
came back to report

   his message had added to the already great excitement and there had
been at first the most strenuous opposition to our plan of fighting but
he had forced his way and the meetings-with the  butcher first and if
i did not fall devinsky afterwards-were fixed for eight oclock he
promised to come for me half an hour before that time  and he urged me to
get to bed and to have as much sleep as possible to steady my nerves

   they were steady enough already i gloated over the affair and i
meant so to use it as to set the seal to my reputation as  that devil alexis
whether i lived or died but after all i was balked i slept soundly enough
till borlas called me early in the morning and told me strange news a file
of soldiers were in my rooms and the sergeant had requested me to be roused
at once as he had an important message

   i called the man into my bedroom and asked him what he wanted

    you are to consider yourself under arrest lieutenant he said salut-
ing and drawing himself up stiffly  and in my charge

    what for

    i dont know lieutenant i had my orders from the colonel himself
first thing  and if you please i am to prevent your leaving the house
youll understand my position sir will you give me your word not to
attempt to leave   

   where are your written orders i knew the man well and he liked

me

    my orders are verbal lieutenant but very strict and imperative

    privately do you know anything of the cause of this 

   youll have a letter from the colonel i think lieutenant within an
hour requiring you to go to him major devinsky is also confined to his
quarters sir and also i think captain durescq weve heard in the regi-
ment sir what happened at the officers club last night a certain look
on his lined bearded face and in his eyes as he saluted me when he said
this told me much

    chafed at the interference and anathematized the colonel for having
apparently taken a hand in the matter this butcher would now be able to


by right of sword

go back to st petersburg with a lying garbled tale that we in moscow got
out of quarrels by clinging to the coat tails of our commanding officers  and
it made me mad i tried to persuade the sergeant to let me out to go to
the place of meeting promising to be back within an hour but he was im-
movable

    i would if i dared lieutenant  but i dare not im not the man to
stop a fair fight and i hate this work but dutys duty

   when essaieff came he threw new light on the matter the affair had
caused a huge commotion in the early hours of the morning he had been
summoned to the colonel who had in some way got wind of the affair a
very ugly version having been told him my friend had to tell the plain
truth and there had been the devil to pay the wires to st petersburg had
been kept going through the night the whole thing had been laid before
headquarters at the ministry of war  and the arrest of the three principals
had been ordered from the capital

   soon afterwards a peremptory summons came forme from the colonel and
when i got to him i found both devinsky and durescq there together with
two or three of the highest officers then stationed in moscow a sort of
informal examination took place out of which i am bound to say both the
other men came very badly  and in the end we were all three ordered off
to stay in our quarters under arrest i found that not only were we not
allowed to go out-sentries being posted in my rooms all the time-but no
one was permitted to enter  nor could i communicate with a single indi-
vidual for two days

   at the end of that time the order came for me to resume duty  and as
soon as the mornings drill was over the colonel sent for me and told me
what had happened the military authorities at st petersburg had taken
the harshest view of the conduct of my two antagonists it was regarded as a
deliberate plot to kill devinsky had been cashiered and only durescqs
great influence had prevented him from sharing the same fate as it was he
had had all his seniority struck off had been reduced to the rank of a
subaltern and sent off there and then under quasi arrest with heavy
military escort to a regiment stationed on the most southern turkestan
frontier

   as for devinsky the regiments well rid of him said the colonel
with such emphasis and earnestness that i saw his own personal animosity
had had quite as much to do with the mans overthrow as the latters own
conduct but it pleased the old man to put it all down to me and when we
were parting he shook hands cordially and said  the regiment owes you a
vote of thanks my boy and ill see that its paid in full

   one question i should like to ask said i how did you get to
hear of it all  

   the news was everybodys property lad-dont ask questions he
replied with dry inconsequence and would say no more

   but i was soon to learn and the news surprised me as much as any
part of the whole strange incident

   the first use i made of my liberty was to go and see olga and explain my
by right of sword



absence and all that had happened she had heard a somewhat garbled account
of it in which the part i played had been much exaggerated and she received
me with the greatest tenderness and sympathy and even tears of what seemed
pleasure but she explained as cold glistened in her eyes we had a long
and closely confidential chat and she made me feel more by her trustful
manner and gentle attitude than by her actual words how much she had
missed me during the days of our separation and how thankful she was to be
free of devinsky for good and how much she felt she owed to me on that
account

   for myself i was sorry when i had to leave her she was the only person
in moscow to whom i could speak without restraint a fact that made our
interviews so welcome that i was loathe to end this one

   it was almost dusk when i left and as i walked home i was thoughtful and
preoccupied the question of olgas safety was pressing very hardly on me
and made me extremely anxious the more i saw of her the more eager i
was to get her out of harms way  and the consciousness that she must share
the consequences of any disaster that might happen to me were i discovered
troubled me greatly i was beginning to anticipate more vividly moreover
the coming of some such disaster the time was passing very quickly it
was getting on for nearly three weeks since the nihilist meeting and i knew
that my nihilist   allies   would be growing anxious for a sign of my zeal
they were probably well aware that i was doing nothing to redeem my
pledge

   there was also the undeniable danger inseparably connected with the
infernal intrigue with paula tueski i had so neglected her in my character
of lover that i was hourly expecting some proof of her indignation i had
only seen her twfce in the three weeks  and each time in public  and though -
olga and she had interchanged visits i knew perfectly well that she was not
the woman to take neglect passively

   i blamed myself warmly too for my own inactivity my whole policy
had been to try and gain time and yet i had made no use of it except to
get into broils which had increased the already bewildering complications

   that this would be the effect of my quarrel with devinsky and durescq

i could not doubt when i came to think the matter over in cool blood i
had been the means of getting them ruined  and naturally every friend they
had in russia would take part against me i knew that durescq had
friends among the most powerful circles in russia and i had nothing to
oppose to their anger save the poor position of a lieutenant in a marching
regiment and a past that was full of blackguardism and evil repute per-
sonally this was all nothing to me  but when i thought of the indirect
results it might have for olga it troubled and worried me deeply

   everything pointed to one conclusion--that olga should leave russia
while she could do so in safety

   i was meditating on these things when a girl stopped me suddenly asking
if i were lieutenant petrovitch she then gave me a scrap of paper  and i
glanced at it and read 

    the old rendezvous at once urgent p t


by right of sword

   i questioned the girl as to who gave it to her and where the person was 
but getting no satisfactory account dismissed her with a few kopecks

   it beat me obviously it was from paula tueski equally obviously it
was an appointment at which she had seemingly something to say of impor-
tance but where the deuce the old rendezvous was i knew no more
than the dead

   i am not one to waste time over the impossible  and as i certainly could
not go to a place i did not know of i tore the letter into shreds and went on
home

   i let myself in and found that my servant was out-a most unusual thing
at that time of the day  but i had begun to fear that the man was below
rather than above the average of russian servants and was already contem-
plating his dismissal i did not attach much importance to his present
absence however  and throwing myself into a chair sat and thought or
tried to think of some scheme by which i could induce olga to leave the
country and some means by which her departure could be safely arranged
she must go at once she had promised me to go when i could tell her it
was necessary for my safety  and i could truthfully say that now if she
would go i would have a dash for liberty myself

   while i was thinking in this strain some one knocked at my outer door
and when i opened it to my surprise paula tueski rushed in quickly

   a glance at her face showed me she was in an exceedingly ill temper  as
indeed it appeared to me she generally was

    where is your servant   was her first question hurriedly asked

    i really dont know out somewhere  but-

    his absence means danger alexis why didnt you come to me when
i sent a message to you just now you read it questioned the girl and
then tore it up and threw it in the gutter  and all this as unconcernedly as
if you did not know full well that from our window you nitist be in full view
of me are you always going to scorn me 

   i took care to show no surprise  but it was clear i had blundered badly
and that the rendezvous was close to the spot where the paper had been given
to me

    i could not come i had to hurry home i--

   bah dont trifle with me like that havent you had enough of
your prison during the last two days   

   you know the news then   said i following her gladly off the track

   it is you who do not know the news ah alexis you are giving me
more trouble in this new character of yours than ever you did in the old one-
much as you harassed me then

    what do you mean about new character  i asked her phrase had
startled me

    i like it better than the old fifty thousand times better  that devil
alexis than  that roue petrovitch but whenever i think of the change
i cannot understand it i dont understand you i could almost swear
sometimes you are not the same man she came close up to me and put-
ting her hands on my shoulders stared long and earnestly right into my
by right of sword

 

eyes   and then i wonder how i can have been so blind as not to have
seen all that lay hidden in you  all that was noble and brave and daring
but i love you alexis twenty thousand times more than ever and to have
saved your life now is a thought of infinite sweetness to me  

   i stared back as if she had stung me

   do you mean you had anything to do with- i stopped and she

knew what i meant she smiled and in a voice exquisitely sweet and tender
though hateful to me she answered 

    your life is mine alexis  do you think i would let that butcher from
st petersburg take it  let him keep to his own shambles yes i set the
wires in motion and i did not stop until the one man was utterly ruined and
the other degraded in the eyes of all russia your life is mine alexis-
she seemed to revel in this hateful phrase- and those who would strike at
you must reckon with me as well we are destined for each other you and
i and we live or die together  

    you have done me a foul wrong then i cried hotly  you have dis-
graced me  made me out for a braggart that provokes a fight and then shirks
it by screening myself behind the law do you suppose i thank you for
that   i spoke as sternly as i felt but she only smiled as she answered 

     i did not think of your feelings this man would have killed you
his hands are bloody to the armpits do you think i would let him find
another victim in you when i could stop him and save you  did you not
reproach me when i did not interfere before and tell me my love was cold 
would i suffer such a reproach again think you no no your life is
mine i repeat and for the future i will protect it whether you will or no
that is how i love  and so it shall be always i have come now to warn you
hush  what is that  

   i listened and heard some one moving in the lobby of my rooms

    it is borlas returned i said and opening the door called him getting
no answer i called him again loudly  and then my visitor whispered to me
to come back but i paid no heed to her and went forward a few steps to
go into my servants rooms as i did so a desperate rush was made and
three men disguised dashed at me violently they had gained an entrance
somehow and were no doubt making their way to attack me in my room or
were going to lay in wait for me when my quick ears heard them and thus
spoiled their plans

   i was unarmed and in a moment saw the foolishness of attempting to
fight three men probably armed while i had not so much as a stick
making a feint of an attack upon the nearest therefore i jumped aside and
darted back into the room i had just left closing the door instantly behind
me while my companion and i held it shut until i had secured it

   then i turned to her for an explanation

   they are my husbands agents she whispered he suspects us
as you know  and he arranged this attack thinking that if you were killed
the act just at this juncture would be set down to devinskys revenge i
came on purpose to warn you if they catch me here now we are both
ruined beyond all hope


by right of sword

    then they shant catch us i replied  or if they do they shant live
to carry the tale outside the door    and i proceeded to put in execution a
plan which had already occurred to me

chapter xii-christian tueski

   while the men were straining and fighting to gain admission to the
room i loaded my revolver seized a heavy stick that lay in a corner and
opening the window noiselessly with some little trouble and agility got into
the street i let myself into the house and then i thundered at the outer door
of my own rooms as if seeking immediate admission

   instantly there was a great scuffling within and i knew that the men were
making off by the back in the probable belief that they had been disturbed
by some unexpected caller judging the time as best i could so that i might
perhaps catch one of them i rushed in suddenly one had fled the second
was in the act of dropping from a window while a third was just clamber-
ing out

   i struck this one a blow on the head which laid him senseless in a heap
on the floor and leaning out was in time to give the second a whack that
must have nearly broken his arm then without wasting a moment i bound
the other and closely bandaged his eyes

   telling paula tueski that i had scared the rascals away i dragged the
fellow to the light that she might recognize him she identified him directly
and without a word being spoken except by me i thrust him into a dark
closet and turned the key on him while i settled what to do next

   you knew him i could see i said when i joined my visitor again
 is he a police spy   

    no not in the ordinary sense i have seen him with my husband  but
exactly what he is i dont know i believe he is one of a small band of
really villainous men used for especially ugly work

    but why am i marked out for a visit from them 

    i believe my husband has suspected you-on my account i know he
hates you cordially you remember that affair in the opera lobby when you
insulted him so grossly  i nodded  but of course i had not the remotest
idea what she meant he never forgives since then he has been ac-
cumulating every jot and tittle of fact against you-and you have given him
plenty alexis-and if he can work your overthrow he will

    yes  but why try to get me assassinated ill go at once and ask him
i said readily and impulsively

    are you mad   exclaimed my companion

    on the contrary ill go and show him the danger of interfering with
me where is he to be found now   

    at home he will not leave for an hour yet to make his evening visit
to the bureau but he will never consent to see you

    at any rate ill try  and im much mistaken if i dont force him i
have a plan i added after a minutes thought  i will clear us both at
a stroke go at once to my sister and tell her from me that i wish her to
by right of sword



come back here with you and wait for me mind too should any one come
to fetch away that fellow ive locked up let olga say enough in his presence
to make it clear that she was here with us when the attack was first made
be quick and careful for much will depend on all this being well done

   i drove rapidly to the place and sending in my card asked for an imme-
diate interview with the chief of police on urgent business the reply came
back that m tueski could not see me  i was to call at his office i sent the
messenger back with a peremptory reply that i must see him as i had dis-
covered an assassination plot i was still refused admittance though a longer
wait showed me he had considered the matter carefully

   this time i wrote a brief note one of your hired assassins has been
identified has confessed and lies at this moment bound and in my power
if you do not see me now i shall communicate direct with the ministry of
the interior 	 

   that proved the  open sesame and in a few moments i was ushered into
the presence of one of the most hated men in russia-the man i had been
commissioned to kill

   he was small with a face that would have been common looking but
for its extraordinarily hard and cold expression it was lined and seamed 
and each line might have been drawn by nature with the express object
of marking an absolutely merciless calculating and emotionless man

   his eyes were very bright as they fixed themselves on me and his
voice harsh high pitched and tuneless

    men dont belie your new character when they call you daring was
his greeting he was standing by the side of a long table with his black
clothed figure outlined against the soft colors of luxuriant tapestries with
which the walls were hung he motioned me to a chair near enough to be
within the demands of courtesy to an officer bearing the emperors commis-
sion and far enough removed from him to be safe should the visitor turn out
to be dangerous i noticed too that an electric bell button was well within
reach   what do you wish with me lieutenant  this visit is unusual  
 i am not accustomed to bother about what is usual where my life is
concerned i answered firmly  i want a reply to a plain question why
do you send your bravoes to assassinate me  

    i have sent no bravoes to assassinate you lieutenant i dont under-
stand you we dont hire assassins as though the whole thing were
ridiculous

    yet your wife recognized this man instantly

   my wife he exclaimed with a sufficient change to show how this
had touched him

    yes your wife she was in my rooms when these men came

   he drew in a deep breath while he looked at me with eyes of hate i had
got right between the joints of his armor of impassivity it was a cruel
thrust but i had an ugly game to play and was forced to hit hard

   he seemed to struggle to repress his private feelings and to remain the
impassive official but human nature and his jealousy beat him and his
next question came with a jerk that showed the effort behind it


by right of sword

   what was she doing there his tone was the essence of harsh
bitterness

    what was she doing there i echoed as if in the greatest astonish-
ment  why what should she be doing but calling with my sister they
are there now keeping guard over your-assistant  

   he turned away for a moment to prevent my seeing in his face the relief
which i could hear in his voice as he answered 

   you are an even bolder man than i thought

    i dont understand you of course but i have need to be bold i re-
torted  with you against me ready to plan my private execution theyre
heavy odds but now perhaps youll answer my question why do you
do this   

   there might be many reasons-if it were true he answered in the
same curt tone he had first used

     ones enough for me if its true i replied copying his sharp manner
    he stood a minute looking at me in silence and then sat down

     i think ive been doing you an injustice lieutenant he said presently
 i thought when you forced your way into my presence you might be coming
to assassinate me but i see now youre not such a fool as to try to do any-
thing of that kind when you have left a broad trail behind you that would
lead to your certain detection you are young with all the weaknesses of
youth strongly developed-rash hot headed sometimes tipsy a fool with
women and when necessary a knave too loose in money matters and un-
scrupulous a gambler a dicer and a bankrupt in morals religion and honor
but shrewd-for youve deceived every one about your sword skill and your
courage-and under the garb of a worthless fellow you have a cool calculat-
ing and yet daredevil head that should make your fortune others are morg
right about you than i

    others i asked interested and amused by this quiet enumeration of
the results of the analysis of two very different but united characters

  who are the others   

   a faint ghost of what in another man would have been a smile relaxed the
grim hard straight lips for an instant in mockery of my attempt to draw
him out

    you are not unknown lieutenant as you may find soon  but you are a
fool to mix yourself up with the nihilists

   it was my turn now to be on the defensive

    that is a charge which a child can make and the wisest man can some-
times fail to rebut i answered sharply  i am not a nihilist

    he waved his hand as if my repudiation were not worth a serious thought

    i can make you a career if you will if you will act under me-

   thank you i returned coldly  i know what you can do you can
put me first on the list for some task which will insure my being served as
you meant me to be served today one commission is enough for me and
i prefer the emperors

    you dont know what you say nor what you refuse

     all the more reason for not regretting my refusal i retorted lightly
by right of sword



but this does not answer my question-why do you seek to have me
assassinated  

    siberia is getting overpopulated he returned manifestly angry at my
refusal

    you mean its easier to kill than to exile

   one must have some regard for its morals too he sneered with a
contempt at which my rage took fire

   i looked at him with a light in my eyes which he could read plainly
enough

    you are a coward m tueski said i sternly   because you presume
upon the office you hold to say things which without the protection that
guards you you would not dare to let between your teeth

    it is useless to talk in that strain to me he said shortly  i know
you

    no-by heaven you dont-yet but ill let you know something of
me now men say you know no fear  that your loves desires emotions
are all dead-all save ambition ill test that this plot you have laid
against my life is your own private revenge for some fancied wrong you
have sought to carry it out even at the very moment when you had had a hint
to guard me it was cunningly laid and nearly succeeded  and then you
would have set the blame down at devinskys door

   he listened without making a sign  quite impassively but the mere
fact that he did listen showed me i was striking the right note and further
that he wished to see what i meant to do

    go on he said contemptuously when i paused

     i can prove this  aye and i will prove it even if i go to the emperor
himself and prove it-by your own wife  he could not wholly conceal
the effect of this he knew the strength of the threat

    more than that i cried then quickening my speech and showing
much more passion  you know what the world says about me and your
wife you showed me you knew it when i told you just now that she was
in my rooms when your men came to try to take my life you have dared
to smirch my honor in regard to women  and you have lied so far as your
wife is concerned there has never been a thought of mine toward her tainted
with dishonor so far as i am concerned she is virgin pure but by heaven
beware how you taunt me  it lies with you to say whether her reputation
shall be safe after- 

   i left the sentence unfinished and the change in the mans manner showed
me how he was inwardly shrinking and wincing at my desperate words

    go on what do you want  he spoke after a great effort and strove
to keep his voice at the dead level of official lifelessness but the man was
an inward fire of rage and jealousy

    this duel is not my seeking but yours m tueski i continued
 and for my part i would as soon have a truce but if we are to fight on
i will use every weapon i can lay my hand on-and use them desperately
you can prove the truth of what i say send round some one to my rooms
and fetch away the scoundrel who is there my sister will let him go your


by right of sword

wife her friend is staying with her to help in case of need and if she
were guilty i should not give her to my sister for a friend

 you are the devil   the words forced themselves through his teeth
i had picked my words deliberately  and it was the shrewdest thing i
could have done he left the room without another word going through a
doorway behind him  and calling to some one he whispered some instruc-
tions

   you have sent you are right i said when he returned and
now call off these bloodhounds of yours  and so long as you play fair with
me my sister and your wife can be friends and no longer one other
condition give me two police permits to cross the frontier on special business
one for myself and one for my sister you may not be sorry if i decide to
take a holiday

    i cannot give them and you cannot leave he answered

    write me the permits ill see about using them

    no  i cannot write them if i did they would be canceled tomorrow
by the ministry of the interior

   why

    the fact is what i saj you cannot leave russia

   i care nothing for that write them-or we resume this duel m
tueski

   he was a changed man he was so accustomed to exact implicit obedi-
ence to his will and to ride rough shod over every one about him that now
he was beaten his collapse was utter and complete he was absolutely over-
come by the pressure i could threaten and he thought i was blackguard
enough to apply

   for once at least my old black character did me a good turn he acted
like a weak child now entirely subjugated by my will he wrote the permits
as i directed

   as he was writing it occurred to me there must be some influence behind
the scenes which told with him else why did he not forthwith write out
the order for my imprisonment  he had done it hundreds of times before in
the case of men infinitely more influential than myself his signature would
open the doors of any prison in russia it suggested itself that it was this
reason which was at the bottom of the attempt to get me killed he dared
not follow out his own desire

    one thing puzzles me i said coolly as i took the permits  why
havent you instead of writing these written an order packing me off to jail 
what is this power behind you   

    i may live in hope perhaps he returned  your sword and your
shrewdness may carry you far  and some day as far as the jail you speak of

i shant fail to write that order when the time comes

    i left him with that

   as i quitted the house a man pressed close to me and i turned to see
what he wanted there was no one else about

     is it done   he whispered

    i looked at him keenly  but i had never seen him before i thought
by right of sword



    what do you mean   i asked

     the night in the riverside wharf he whispered back

    he was a nihilist here right in the very eye of the police web

     the way is laid i answered equivocally as i hurried away

    i had actually forgotten in my eagerness all about my charge to kill the
man with whom i had been closeted in conference

    but i saw instantly that the nihilists would probably hold it for an act of
treachery that i had been in tueskis house and yet had let him live

chapter xiii-olga in a new light

   i walked back to uiy rooms as i wished to cool my head and think the
interview with christian tueski had excited me and what was of more im-
portance had kindled a hope that after all i might be able to escape the tre-
mendous difficulties that encompassed me

    one thing in particular pleased me for it was a double edged knife loos-
ening two sets of the complications it wras the promise i had given to the
man to respect his wife so long as he kept faith with me this gave me
power over him and what was of infinitely greater value to me personally it
was a shrewd defense against the wife also

    i smiled as i thought of the ingenuity of this but i little anticipated
what would really be the result it seemed then the shrewdest and cleverest
as well as the most daring thing i had done  but in the end the consequences
were such as might properly have followed an act of the grossest stupidity
and villainy possible but for the moment it pleased me  and i was in truth
finding the keenest pleasure in this parrying of the thrusts which the fates
were making at me

   there was a problem i could uot solve however in the question of the
power which seemed to be behind the chief of police  the power which made
him apparently afraid to strike me openly though so willing to trip me se-
cretly i could not imagine what it could be nor whence it could come

   when i reached my rooms my sister and paula tueski were waiting for
me in the greatest anxiety  and both were overjoyed to see me safe and ap-
parently in high spirits the police agents had been for the fellow i had
left under lock and key and olga had taken care to carry out my instruc-
tions to the letter her quick instincts had warned her and she had made
a parade of almost affectionate friendship for the other woman during the
time the men had been present

   after i arrived she could scarcely take her eyes off me and i saw them
glistening as with tears

   i will take you home directly i said carelessly as a brother might
speak   but i have something to say first to madame tueski  so you must
wait for a few minutes  

   a look of reproach nearly found expression in hasty words but remem-
bering herself she said liastil acting the part to the life 

    oh youre always so mysterious alexis ive no patience with you
   then i led the other into my second sitting room and told her much of


by right of sword

what had passed  and when i came to that part of the interview that imme-
diately concerned herself she was very bitter and angry

    you think i am a pawn to be moved where you like in your game  of
no account and the meanest thing on the board you and he are both alike
in that-but wait your life is mine alexis i have told jou

     but you must surely see that the first consideration must be all our
lives-to say nothing of our safety i answered rather roughly i fear and
very unsympathetically her heroics rasped me  what good is your
living going to do me if your husband shuts me up in a dungeon or sends
me dancing to siberia or causes a dagger to let out my life blood  

    you mean to keep the word you gave him 

    certainly so long as he keeps his

   she fixed her large lustrous eyes on me and let them rest on me during a
long silence

    you and he together will drive me to some desperate deed she said
at length very slowly then perhaps you will learn what a love like
mine will dare for your sake i cannot and will not bear this separation

   she wearied me with these protests but i said nothing and went on
fo question her as to whether there was any power behind her husband influ-
encing him in regard to me she knew nothing but admitted that she had
her suspicions

   i next told her that while he was trying to assassinate me she might find
the tables turned on him as there was a nihilist plot on foot to murder
him she paid little heed to it at first saying that there had been many
such schemes formed all of which had proved abortive because he was
most carefully and continuously guarded a moment later however her
manner changed a little and she questioned me somewhat closely concerning
the matter

   they dont choose their agents shrewdly in these things she said

  and we hear too soon of their designs they should choose a man like
you alexis she seemed to speak with a hidden meaning and i was
doubtful whether she knew anything but i kept my doubts to myself

    if they had done that i had a rare chance tonight i answered

     a bold man or a reckless woman makes the chance   she retorted in
the same manner i am going alexis she added and then forced on
me caresses which were vastly repulsive but i could not reveal my true
feelings until i had at any rate placed olga in safety my indifference and
coldness were apparent to the woman and she upbraided me with a burst of
angry passion till i had to patch up a sort of peace

   we went back to olga and soon afterwards drove away olga and i set-
ting the other down at her door

   so long as madame tueski was with us olga maintained the part of
the impatient sister but as soon as we were alone her manner changed
altogether

    i had to send for you this eveningi said  and you saved me from
a situation of great difficulty and hazard by coming so promptly i thank
you for having done so  
by right of sword	

   no reply i glanced at her in the gloomy light in the cab and saw the
profile set hard and immobile with the lips pressed closely together

    storm signals out thought i

    i was saying i thanked you you acted with rare discretion and did
me a great service  

   not a word

    you were not so silent just now i hazarded

   i was acting-with discretion she repeated my word with that
relish and enjoyment which a well regulated mind always feels about a telling
sarcasm

    and what sort of discretion is this  i retorted laughing

   she was silent again

    i have a gooddeal to tell you in explanation

     i have no wish to hear anything thank you   she interposed   i can
trust your discretion -much emphasis again on the word- as completely
as you can mine i am glad to have been of use to you and madame tuqski  
she threw the word  use  at me as if it had been a bomb to be exploded in
my face

    what have i done thats wrong im very sorry i said

    i beg you not to apologize you never used to and as you appear to
be slipping back into your old habits it would be out of character to apolo-
gize-to me i am only to be used  

    i dont understand you

   there was a moments silence and then she could contain her indignation
no longer and burst out with the cause of it

   why didnt you send me home immediately you returned  you could
surely have give me your servant as an escort then you would have spared
me the shame and humiliation waiting during your private interchange of
confidences with that woman

   at that instant we stopped at her house

    please do not come in tonight she said  i have had to keep certain
things waiting here while i was being of use to you and was sitting alone in
your rooms  and i have now very much to do  

   i am sorry to trouble you blit i am coming in this thing must be
cleared up at once   and i followed my very angry sister into the house

   she led the way to a small drawing room and turning to me said coldly 

    i am ready to hear what you wish to say

   i had been thinking quickly during the interval and now changed my
point of attack

    i have a very serious thing to say you gave me your promise-

    i would rather you would not remind me of any promises she inter-
rupted this was said deliberately but then she broke through her cold
formality and with a little stamp of her foot finished angrily  i wont
keep them i wont be reminded of them things are altered-altogether
altered  

    what i was going to say is- i began when she broke in again

    i wont hear it i dont want to hear any more i wish youd go


by right of sword

    you must hear me i said quietly but with some authority in my tone

    must   i dont understand you

    must-for your own safety  

   thank you i can protect myself your other cares and responsibili-
ties have a prior claim on you will you please leave me now  

    no i cant go until ive told you-

    i will not listen  didnt i tell you  she was vehemence itself

   i shrugged my shoulders in despair

   this morning- i began but the moment i opened my lips she

broke out again with her vehement interruptions

    ah things were different this morning i had not then been insulted
do you forget i am a russian  and think you can treat me as you wrill-keep
me waiting while-bah it is unbearable will you go awray  is there no
sense of manliness in you that will make you leave me  must i call for
assistance  i will do that if you do not leave me you can write what you
have to say but please spare me the pain of seeing you again

   her words cut me to the quick but then roused me also

    you had better call for assistance i answered firmly then i crossed
to the door locked it and put the key in my pocket  i will spare you the
pain of another interview but now that i am here i decline to go until i
have explained

    you cannot explain she burst in the word seemed to madden her

    cannot explain what  

    that womans kisses  

   the wrords appeared to leap from her lips involuntarily and she repented
them as soon as uttered  and drawing herself up she tried to appear cold
and stolid but this attempt failed completely and in her auger at the
thought behind the words and with herself for having given it utterance she
stood looking at me her bosom heaving and tossing with agitation and her
face and eyes aglow with an emotion which with a strange delight i saw
was jealousy

   there came a long pause during which i recalled her manner and the
way she had played with my words while on one of our rides when we had
spoken of devinskys proposal to make her his wife

   i have always been slow to read womens hearts and have generally read
them wrong  but i began to study this one with a sense of new and peculiar
pleasure she was growing very dear to me for a sister

   if mj guess was right my conduct with that infernal woman paula
tueski must have been gall and wormwood to olga

   how should i have relished it had the positions been reversed and
devinsky been in paula tueskis place 

   these thoughts which flashed across me in rapid succession produced a
peculiar frame of mind i had stood a minute in silence not looking at her
and when i raised my eyes again to her i was conscious of sensations toward
her that were altogether different from anything i had felt before she had
become more beautiful than ever in my eyes  i more eagerly anxious to
please and appease  while at bottom there was a dominant fear that i might
by right of sword



be mistaken in my new reading of her actions in which was mixed up another
fear not nearly so strong that her anger on account of paula tueski might
really end in our being separated

   my first act showed the change in me i ceased to feel the freedom with
which i had hitherto acted the part of brother and i immediately threw open
the door and stood aside that she might go out if she wished then i said 

    perhaps you are right my conduct may be inexcusable even to save
your life

   whether there was anything in my manner that touched her-i was con-
scious of speaking with much less confidence than usual-or whether it was
the act of unfastening the door  or whether again some subtle influence
had set her thoughts moving in parallel columns to mine i do not know
but her own manner changed quite as suddenly as mine  and when she
caught my eyes on her she flushed and paled with effects that made her radi-
antly beautiful to me

   she said not a word and finding this i continued 

     i am sorry a cloud has come between us at the last and through some-
thing that was not less hateful to me because forced by the needs of the case

we have been such friends but- here i handed her the permit- you

must use this at once  

   she took it and read it slowly in silence and then asked 

      how did you get this   

    myself personally from the chief of police

      why did you run the mad risk of going to him yourself   

    there was no risk-not so much in going to him as in keeping away
from him he had tried to have me murdered and i went to find out the
reason

    i told you i would not leave moscow

    unless-and the condition now applies-it was necessary for my safety

    and you    the light of fear was in her eyes as she asked this

      as soon as you are across the frontier i shall make a dash for my liberty
also i cant go before because my absence would certainly bring you under
suspicion

   she now looked at me again very intently her head bent slightly forward
and her lips parted with the strain of a new thought while suspicion of my
motive chased the fear for my safety from her face

    is this to get me out of the way  i wont go  

   all my honor for myself and my love for her were in that note of re-
proach and thejr appeared to waken an echo  for then this most strange girl
threw herself down on a couch and burying her face in her hands sobbed
passionately

   i turned away from the sight of her emotion-the more painful because
of the strong self reserve and force she had always shown-and paced up and
down the room i forced back my own feelings and the desire to tell her
what those feelings were to do that would be worse than madness till
we were out of russia we were brother and sister and the bar between us
was heavier than we could hope to move

      o


by right of sword

   when the storm of her sobs ceased she remained for some minutes quite
still and i would not break the silence knowing she was fighting her way
back to self possession

   presently she got up and came to me holding out her hand

    i will go alexis-we are still firm friends  this with a little smile
of wistful interrogation   can you forgive my temper  i was mad for the
moment i think but i trust you i do indeed absolutely i know you
had no thought of insulting me i know that i couldnt think so meanly
of you its hard to leave-russia  and-and everything and you too
-at this time must i really go   a half beseeching glance into my eyes
and a pause for the answer i could not give very well i know what

your silence means come tomorrow morning-and say- she stooped

again and bit her trembling lips to steady them as she framed the word-
 and say-good by to me and now please let me go-brother and truest
friend

   she wrung my hand and then before i could prevent her or even guess
her intention she pressed her lips to it and with the tears again in her eyes
she went quickly awtay leaving me to stare after her like a helpless fool
longing to call her back and tell her everything and yet afraid

chapter xiv-the deed which rang through russia

   it was not destined that olga should leave russia yet a terrible event
happened within the next few hours the report of which ran through russia
like a clap of thunder convulsing the whole nation and shaking for the
moment the entire social fabric to its lowest foundations and one of its
smaller consequences was to ruin my plans and expose me to infinite personal
peril

   olga was to start at noon and i proposed to see her an hour before that
time for what i knew would be a very trying ordeal but when that hour
came i was in the midst of a very different kind of interview

   outside official circles i was one of the first men to learn the news just
before ten oclock a messenger came with a request for me to go at once to
the police bureau i started in the full conviction that for some cause tueski
had changed his mind and meant to arrest me i was of course helpless  and
could do no more than scribble a hasty line to olga telling her of my appoint-
ment asking her not to wait for me and bidding her good by but i did
not send it the police agent said with great politeness he would prefer my
not doing anything then  i could send the note equally well from the bureau
i knew what that meant and yielded

   the moment i arrived at the office i could see that some event of altogether
unusual importance and gravity had occurred the air was laden with the
suggestion of excitement there was an absence of that orderly business-
like routine always characteristic of russian public offices the police agents
were present in exceptionally large numbers hurrying through the corridors
thronging the rooms and standing in groups engaged in animated discussion

   i was kept waiting some time perhaps half an hour before a word was
by right of sword



spoken to me by any one in authority  and then i was ushered into the
presence of a man i did not know

    i am sorry to trouble you lieutenant petrovitch but there are one or
two questions you can answer  and i need not say that as a russian officer
bearing the emperors commission we shall look to you to reply very fully
i bowed it was a fit preface to a conversation which should end as such
things generally did but at any rate i should learn what they intended to
do with me before he spoke again i asked that the letter i had written to
olga might be sent but he put the question aside with a curt reply that it
could wait until the emperors business was finished  and again i bowed in
acquiescence i could do nothing

     please to tell me exactly what passed between you and m tueski yester-
day he said  and particularly how you obtained the permits for your-
self and sister i invite you to be particularly frank

   the question startled me i couldnt understand it

   your question surprises me i replied to gain a little time to think
 m tueski himself knows and can surely tell you everything 

    i ask my questions in the name of the emperor sir returned my
examiner sternly

     m tueski had done me the honor of trying to have me murdered and
i went to see him to demand the reason he did not deny it i persuaded
him in the end to abandon his private malice and prevailed upon him to give
me the permits for myself and my sister to leave russia for a while when
he had given them to me i left him  

   where are they

    here is one the other is with my sister who leaves moscow at mid-
day

    you may stop her attempting to leave it will be useless what else
passed  and he then plunged into the closest cross examination of me
the real object of which i could not guess unless it meant that tueski had
in some way got into a mess for letting me have the permits i answered
all the questions as fully as possible taking care only to avoid mentioning
paula tueskis name in connection with the compact with her husband

   to my surprise i seemed to satisfy the man for the time when he had
about turned me inside out he sat for some minutes looking over my answers
and comparing them with some of his notes  after which he remained
thinking closely

    what did you do after leaving m tueski 

     i went straight to my rooms and my sister  together we drove madame
tueski to her house  i then went home with my sister remained there about
an hour or perhaps less and wrent home and to bed

    you have told me all you know lieutenant  

    you can ask m tueski i returned

   he fixed his eyes steadily on me while i could have counted twenty and
then said slowly and with deep emphasis 

    m tueski is dead

    dead   i repeated in the profoundest surprise
roo

by right of sword

   murdered found this morning in the lower part of his own house
with a dagger thrust through his heart

     murdered   i could scarcely believe my ears

    yes for freedoms sake  said the man with a curl of the lip at
least so a message on the dagger said now you can understand the signifi-
cance of my questions

   i understood it all well enough  far better than the man himself even
imagined  and i was completely beaten as to what the inner meaning of this
most terrible event could be

    one of my first reflections was that if any of the suspicious of my nihilism
which the dead man entertained were chronicled anywhere my arrest and
that of olga would certainly follow  and we should both be doomed

     i can scarcely realize it i said  it is horrible

    so these wretches will find returned my interlocutor  these car-
rion but now in view of this-and i have told you because of the candid
manner in which you have answered my questions-is there anything you
noticed in your visit yesterday to help us  

   clearly he did not suspect me  and no records had been found yet

    no the place seemed alive with inmates-like a rabbit warren
enough to have held it against a regiment great heaven what villains  
i cried in horror mine was genuine feeling enough for some of the
terrible effects to myself were fast crowding on my thoughts i recalled my
encounter with my nihilist comrade on the very threshold of the house

    of course those permits will be withdrawn now lieutenant said the
official as he dismissed me but his manner wras much less severe and curt
than at the outset as a matter of fact they ought never to have been
granted though i cannot explain why just now but under the circum-
stances you will probably feel personally unwilling to leave russia at such a
juncture

    i should feel myself a traitor said i grandiloquently  and in fact i
did feel very much like one as i left him rejoicing that i still breathed the
fresh air of heaven instead of the fetid atmosphere of a jail

   one thing was certain now-neither olga nor i could hope to escape yet
any attempt would be fatal the murder of such a man would mean that
the lurid searchlight of suspicion would fall in all directions on the guilty
and guiltless alike the liberty certainly and probably the life of every
suspected nihilist in moscow were at stake  and the slightest trip or false
step on our part would amount to direct invitation to ruin

   as i walked back sadly and thoughtfully to my rooms i had abundant
proofs of the terrible effects of the assassination the police agents were
everywhere watching raiding arresting  and in my short walk i met more
than one gloomy party of them each with its one or two prisoners hurrying
on foot or in hired carriages to the police stations

   it is not my business however to describe here the scenes that followed
the most daring most secret most thrilling and save one most terrible
assassination that ever convulsed russia the murder of the czar stirred the
surface of the world more because it had more of the pageantry of crime
by right of sword

ioi

about it but the death of the chief of the moscow police caused a much
deeper sense of insecurity and spread a far greater dread of the secret power
of nihilism

   who had done it  to me it was an inscrutable mystery  unless it had
been the man i had seen near the house but what i had to consider was
not whose hand had driven the dragger home but rather what the effects
would be to me and to her for whose safety i now felt more fear and concern
than i had felt for myself in all my life

   one incident in the interview i had just had impressed me greatly  the
reference which the official had dropped as to the power behind tueski in
dealing with me my questioner had seemed to know about it that morn-
ing  and all this perplexed me

   as soon as i reached my rooms i had to hurry off to the barracks in re-
sponse to an urgent summons  and i joined readily in the excited conversa-
tion of my comrades about this latest nihilist stroke the news was only
beginning to leak out and it assumed the wildest shapes  nor did i feel at
liberty to reduce the rumors to facts

   before the mornings work was over orders came that the troops were
to be paraded for duty in the streets  and we were told off for patrol work in
different parts of the city to protect the railway stations and other public
buildings all that day we were kept on duty  and as other troops kept
pouring in from other centers the whole place seemed under arms like a
beleaguered town

   all day and all night the raids and surprise visits by the police were in
progress and hundreds if not thousands of men and women must have been
arrested until the jails were crowded to suffocation point and every spot
where prisoners could be packed was crammed and choked with suspects

   we were not relieved until late at night having been all day without
food  and even then we were kept in the barracks in readiness for any dis-
turbance

   the next days program was much the same  and i fretted at not being
able to either see or send to olga knowing of her brothers nihilism
she would surely think i had been arrested  while i on my side was afraid
for her

   in the afternoon of the third day we got leave from duty and from bar-
racks for a few hours and i went straight off to olga meanwhile not a hint
had been obtained as to the identity of the assassin

   i found olga white and wan and ill on my account and when we met i
was on my side almost too moved for speech at first i could do no more
than glance into her eyes as we clasped each the others hand

    you are looking frightfully ill olga i said at length

   she returned my look without speech and then her brow contracted she
breathed deeply as if in pain and turning away wrung her hands with a
gesture of despair

     what is the matter  what has happened to you  there must be

something-i stopped or rather the sight of the white face all drawn and

quivering with pain stopped me


by right of sword

    oh it is too horrible too awful god have mercy ou us god have
mercy on us  

   sad as things were so far as i knew them this dejection seemed dis-
proportionate and excessive she was like a mad woman distraught with
fear or grief  and she waved her arms and hands about as if wrestling with
emotions she could not conquer

    oh it cant be true  it cant be she moaned  and then came suddenly
and clinging to me turned my face to the light and holding it between her
white trembling hands she gazed at me with a look of mingled anguish
fear doubt wdlduess and-love  her lips parted and her bosom rising and
falling as if in the strain of her passionate feelings

   when her scrutiny was over her hands seemed to slip from me and she
fell on her knees close to me and i heard her muttering prayers with vehement
fervor

    what does this mean olga  i asked gently bending down and lay-
ing my hand on her shoulder she looked round and up at my touch and
tried to smile then she rose and standing opposite to me put her hands on
my two shoulders so that her face was close beneath mine and all the time
she was muttering prayers then in a voice broken and tremulous she said 

    brother swear as you believe there is a god in heaven you will answer
truly what i ask

    i will i swear it i answered wishing to quiet her

      did you really do this   

    do what   i asked not understanding

    kill christian tueski 

   did i kill him no child certainly not i spoke in the greatest
astonishment

    oaths may bind you to secrecy i know but for gods sake tell me
the truth-the truth you can tell me iam- i felt her shudder

     is it this which has been driving you distracted  there is no cause
i know no more by whose hand that man came by his death than a babe un-
born

     say that again alexis say it again it is the sweetest music i have
heard in all my life

   i repeated the assurance and a smile broke out over her face next she
cried and laughed and cried again and then sat down as if completely over-
come by the rush of relief from a too heavy strain

    what does all this mean  i asked quietly after a while  try and
tell me

    i have been like a mad thing for two days let me wait a while i
will tell you presently oh thank god thank god for what you have said
it drove me mad to think you should have been driven to this by me  and
that perhaps for my sake you might have been urged to do such a horrible
thing waking and sleeping alike i have thought of nothing but of your
suffering torture and death and all through me-through me she cov-
ered her face in horror at the remembrance of her thoughts  but a moment
later took away her hands to smile at me
by right of sword



   you have not told me yet what made you think anything of the
sort

    i will tell you as soon as i heard the news i knew of course that as i
had been mixed up in some old nihilist troubles it would be hopeless for me
to think of leaving moscow  and when the police agent came i let him un-
derstand that i had given up all thought of going then i was all anxiety
for news of you and in the afternoon i went to your rooms i found them
shut and could hear nothing then i began to fear for you i am only a
woman  

   she stopped and smiled to me before resuming then with a shudder
she continued 

     then a most strange thing happened borlas came to me j ust at dusk 
and he looked so strange that at first i thought he had been drinking saying
he had a message from you he waited until i had sent the servant away

       what is it   i asked

    for answer he gave me a sign that made my heart sink i knew it
too well and i looked at him with the keenest scrutiny had the nihilists
put a spy on you even in your own servant  then i saw-that it was not
borlas but a man so cleverly made up to resemble him that i had been at
first deceived

      what do you want here   i asked now with every nerve in my body at
full tension

       do you know   and the light in his eyes seemed to flash into mine

     do i know what  i could see there was something behind all this

   he bent close tome though we were of course alone and spoke his reply
in a fierce whisper

      tell your brother that after this proof our hearts beat but for him  our
plans shall all wait on him  every man of us will go to his death silently and
cheerfully at his mere bidding he leads we follow he has nobly kept
his pledge for the cause of god and freedom

    as i heard this my heart seemed to stop in pain i had to hold the
table to save myself from falling

     do you mean i gasped  that alexis has murdered-

    silence sister replied the man sternly that is no word for you
to utter or for me to hear your brother is as true a friend as russian lib-
erty ever had and i thank my god that i have ever been allowed to even
touch the hand that has dealt this vigorous blow and done this noble and
righteous act

    i will tell him i said

   tell him also he need have no fear not a man who was at the
meeting is in the city now save me  and not a single soul of the thousands
these dogs of tyranny can seize knows anything-save only me and i would to
heaven they would take me and torture me that i might use my last breath
and my latest effort to taunt them that i know the hero who has done it and
die with my knowledge a secret 

    then this terrible man you may not know his name but i know him
left me telling me it was  a glorious day for russia and that god would


by right of sword

smile forever upon you for this deed  and i was plunged into a maelstrom
of agonizing fears racking doubts and poisoned thoughts about you and
what i had led you to do  

   what olga said had immense importance and significance for me it
showed me a startling view of my situation it was clear the nihilists
attributed the murder to me and what effect that would have upon us i was
at a loss even to conjecture

    the mans blood is not on my hands olga  but i cannot be surprised
at the mistake i will tell you everything  and i related to her then all
that had passed

     who can have done it then  she asked wlieu i finished

   it is as complete a mystery to me as to the police the man i saw
near the house might have done it  but then i suppose it must have been
the same man who came to you  and in that case he certainly wouldn t have
set it down to me i am beaten but i am likely to find the wrongful
inheritance embarrassing i must be more cautious than ever to draw down
no word of suspicion upon either of us we must both be scrupulously care-
ful and thus it will be impossible for you to think of getting away  

   its a leaden sky that has no silver streak replied olga  and that
impossibility is my streak

   i could not but understand this and even while my judgment condemned
her my heart was warmed by her words but my judgment spoke

    if you were away my anxieties would be all but ended

   if i were away my anxieties would be all but unendurable she
retorted following my words and smiling it was not possible to hear this
wtitli anything except delight  but i had my feelings too well under control
now to let them be seen easily

    that may be i said  but my first and chief effort will be to get
you safe across the frontier

   she made no answer but her manner told me she would not consent to go
until it had become a rank impossibility for her to stay presently she said
with much feeling 

    if i had been away and the news had come that you had done the thing
these men assert how do you think i could have borne it  i should have
either come rushing back here or have died of remorse and fear and anxiety
on your account it was through me you commenced all this  

    but of my own choice that i continued i replied  and believe me
if all were to come over again i should act in just the same way i have
never had such a glorious time before  all i want now is to see yousafe
olga paused to look at me steadily

    youve never told me the whole reason why you were so ready to take
all these desperate risks will you tell me now   

   i had made a mess of things generally as i told you before i an-
swered with a smile and a slight flush at the reminiscence thus disturbed by
her question

   was there a woman in it  her eyes were fixed on me as she put the
question
by right of sword



   theres a woman in most things i answered equivocally

    es i suppose so she turned away and looked down and asked

    were you very fond of her alexis 

     judging by the little ripple that remains  the surface now that shes
gone out of my life no  judging by the splash the stone made at first yes
but shes gone

   yet the waters of the pool may be left permanently clouded i am sorry
for you alexis  and if you were really my brother i would try and help
you two to mend the breach

   thats not altogether a very proper thing to say i spoke lightly
and she looked up to question me  her husband might not thank you i
mean  though im not quite sure about that and then having told her so
much i told her the story of my last meeting with sir philip cargill and
edith but she did not take it as i wished

    you must have loved her if you meant to kill her she said

     and ceased then if i left her to live a miserable life

   i should like to see the woman you have ceased to love she said
womanlike in curiosity-and something else

    you may do that yet if only alexis petrovitch can make a safe way for
his sister out of russia   aud then i added pausing and looking at her with
a meaning in my eyes wrhich i wished her to understand though i dared not
put it in plain words   but we shall not be brother and sister then

   she glanced up hurriedly her face aglow with a sudden rush of thought-
pleasurable thought too-and then looked down again and smiled

    in that case how should we two be together  she asked

     do you mean that such a time as that will be likely to render us ready
to part  

   to that her only answer was another glance and a deeper blush then i
made an effort and recovered myself on the very verge

    but while we are here we are brother aud sister olga   and feeling
that if i wished to keep other things unsaid i had better go away i left her

chapter xv-the key to the mystery

   the more i contemplated the position the less i liked it aud the more
urgent appeared the reasons for hurrying olga out of the country

   all my care was for her before this new feeling of mine for her had
forced itself upon me the situation had been really a game of wits with my
life as the stake but now olgas life or at least her liberty were also at
stake it was there the crisis pinched me till i winced and writhed under it
pear had got hold of me at last and i tugged restlessly at the chain

   that night and the next day the day of christian tueskis funeral wrere
occupied with heavy duties because the authorities both military and civil
persisted in believing there was danger of an emeute i could have coun-
seled them differently if i had dared to open my lips at least i thought
i couid  although i did not then hold the key to the mystery i got it
from paula tueski
io

by right of sword

   in the afternoon of the day but one after the funeral i had a brief note
asking me to call on her i went and found her surrounded by all the signs
and trappings of the deepest mourning she received me very gravely and
while there was any one in the room she played the part of the sorrowing
disconsolate widow  but the instant we were alone she showed a most inde-
cent and revolting haste to let me know her mind

    we are alone now alexis she said

    i have called as you asked and because i wished to express my sym-
pathy-

    psh  dont let us be hypocrites you and i she exclaimed half
angrily and with great energy i do not pretend to jou that i am sorry
to be free and dont you pretend to me either

   i didnt answer and my silence irritated her

   would you have me weep tear my hair put ashes on my head and
grovel in the dust because the biggest villain and coward that ever lived in
human shape is dead  i hated him living  shall i love him dead  

    at least the dead are dead and to revile them is mere empty brutality
said i somewhat harshly

     then i like empty brutality if it relieves my feelings i have been a
hypocrite long enough i should hate myself if i did not speak the truth to
you

   i shrugged my shoulders i had no answer

    why didnt you send a wreath of pure white fkywers as an emblem of
your regard  why not a message to swell the millions of lies that men have
uttered in their squalid fear of offending the government by silence  ugh 
it makes me sick when i think of it all  and she shuddered as if in disgust
 he was a fiend and i wont call him by anj softer name merely because
his power to harm is gone didnt he try to murder you and wasnt it
jealousy ah we have much to be thankful to the nihilists for you and i
there was an indescribable suggestion of a hidden meaning about this

   i hated the woman

    you have no clue yet i suppose  

   yes i have a clue she replied with a laugh that sounded like a
threat  i can put my hand on the murderer when i will-and i will if he
proves a traitor

    you are in a dramatic mood i answered  who is the man  why
not denounce him surely this act is what you must call treachery

    there was a nihilist plot to kill the man she said speaking with con-
temptuous flippancy of the dead

    yes i told you that myself i replied

    it was because of that he died

      so everybody thinks  

    and how do you account for it   she asked looking at me keenly

    i have no more idea than tourself 

   she laughed and a hard forced laugh it was then she got up from her
chair and walked twice up and down the room in dead silence she stopped
in front of me and stared down into my eyes
by right of sword



      alexis do you really love me   

   the question was au exceedingly unpleasant one and filled me with disgust

    surely this is  time for us to speak of such things i said

    do you love me alexis  she repeated

    i will not answer now i said rising

    why not  why should we not speak of love now-now aye and always 
or is your passion so poor and sickly a thing that a puff from the wind of pro-
priety kills it  not speak of such things  i would plight my love to you
across the very body of the dead man   she spoke with passionate vehe-
mence   remember what i told you-your life is mine you cannot escape
me now tell me do you love me  

    i have given my answer and if you ask that question again today i will
not stop in the room i said angrily  the womans persistency increased my
disgust

   she laughed-a half hysterical laugh of anger

    so you will not stop in the room and will never i suppose return be care-
ful  she cried with one of her quick passionate changes  or i will send you
away and never let you come back except begging for mercy on your
knees for yourself and your sister she turned away and stood by the
window  and i could see by her movements that she was struggling with
violent emotions

   she came back at length the face paler and the voice not so steady

    i will ask you if you love me she said  and i dare you to go away
from the room

   i accepted the challenge without an instants hesitation

     i am going i wall see you when you are cooler    and i went to the
door

   with a quick rush she prevented my opening it and putting her back to
it stared at me in the most violent passion which thickened her voice as she
spoke

    you shall go directly-if you wish to you will make me hate you one
day alexis and then-i will kill you

    it will be far better for me to come some other time i said anxious to
leave

    you will have plenty of opportunities never fear she retorted with a
very angry sneering laugh  and what is more you will not dare not to
use them listen-it is love for ou drives me to this-a love that you can
never escape now alexis even if you had the will

   she paused but i said nothing i had nothing to say all i wished
was to get away

    do you think there is anything i would not do for your love alexis
i have told you there is nothing-told you so scores of times now i
have proved it do you hear -proved it i proved it a few nights ago
when this hand plunged the dagger into my husbands heart-for your
sake  

   i started back and looked at the woman in horror

   yes this hand-she held it out-so white smooth deft and
io

by right of sword

shapely dont start from it there is no blood showing on it now and
never was i know how to thrust a dagger home too cleverly to leave a trace
of either blood or guilt on me in all this moscow of ours the one person
who is deemed above allothers guiltless-is myself had it been in reality
the nihilist deadly secret stroke that men deem it it could not have been
more cunningly contrived more secretly planned more fatally executed
yet the motive was not hate of a government but love for a man for you
alexis  you aud you only now do you wish to go  

   she moved away from the door but i made no attempt to move the
horror of her story ifad fascinated me

      there was a tinge of hate in it too mark you and more than a tinge but
ill tell you all you ought to know since you were in reality the cause of
all you gave me the motive suggested the occasion and provoked that
which led to it more than that too you can by a single word from me be
made to bear the brunt now will you go 

   was the woman mad that she spoke in this way  if so there was a
devilish method in her madness as the story she told quickly showed me

    i knew the day would come when either i should kill him or he would
kill me  for he was a devil well you roused all that was most evil vicious
and fiendish in him in that interview aud wthen i saw him he was like a man
bereft of his wits every form of reproach he could heap on me in cold con-
temptuous galling sneers he uttered with all the calculated aggravation that
could make a taunt unbearable he threatened me in everj tone of menace
and when i answered turned suddenly furious aud struck me violent blows
and vowed to kill me it was then i recalled your words that there was a
nihilist plot against his life  and i vowed i would be the means of carrying
it out for i knew i could easily put suspicion away from me i lured him
cunningly to that part of the house where he was found plunged the dagger
into his breast put into his pocket the forged warning of a nihilist attack
opened the house at a point where a man could have entered fastened to the
dagger the nihilist watchword and then crept away to my own rooms

    it was a fiendish plot i exclaimed hotly

    it was inspired by love for you alexis it was truly  for freedoms
sake-freedonwthat should unite us forever

     do you think i could ever be anything to a woman whose hand is red
with murder i cried in indignant horror

    it was done for you-for love of you alexis

    love has no kin with murder i exclaimed bitterly

    your life is mine remember she answered firmly her determination
and strength were inexhaustible this makes you ten thousand times
more surely mine than ever i told you you were the cause-and also that
you could be made to bear the brunt listen you know well enough what
chance a nihilist has on whom the fangs of suspicion have fastened you
are a nihilist your sister is one also i know this well what think you
would that nihilist have of his life whose dagger it was that found its way
between my husbands ribs what then if i had found the sheath of it and
secreted it to save the man  suppose too that i had kept back the dis-
by right of sword



covery because of my love for him  and further that he was leaving the
house when my husband roused by the noise i made met him  and that i
saw the deed done    she paused and changed her tone to one of fierce
directness as she continued   the dagger that killed christian tueski is
your own weapon known by its sheath to a hundred people  and that sheath
with your name on it is in my possession what chance of life would there
be for you and yours if these things were made known now do you wish
to go

   a hot and passionate reply rose to my lips but was checked before
uttered i thought of olga and i knew that every word this woman said
was true-that no power in russia could save my life or olgas liberty if the
tale were told now

   delay i must have at any cost time in which to meet this womans
horrible cunning and daring plot if i had hated her before she was now
loathsome  while the fears she had stirred on olgas account intensified and
embittered a thousandfold my resentment yet hateful as the task was i
was prepared to continue my part with her

   you think this love i said after a pause in which she had been
waiting breathlessly for me to speak  do women love the men they hold to
them by the tether rope of threats   

      do women kill for the sake of men they do not love   

    do you think to keep m love by threatening me with death 

     have i not inflicted death to keep you  why do you wish to bandy
phrases my deeds speak for themselves they show you well enough
what i wtill dare to keep you true to me you are mine alexis and no
power shall ever part us i have told you this often before it was you
who sought me who proffered me your love do you think me a silly
simple fool to be wooed and won and when deserted willing to do no more
than wring m feeble hands and shed silly tears and prate and maunder
between my stupid sobs that my heart is broken and that i fain would die 
bah  i am not of that sort i am a woman who can will and act and
fashion my own ends in my own way it is not the stream that carries me
but i wrho turn the stream even though it be mingled with blood no no
if you pla me false alexis it is you and not i who shall die because my
heart is broken  

  she showed this determination in every line of her beautiful face and
movement of her magnificent figure as she stood before me a lovely hateful
type of a vengeful woman she changed her mood however with astonish-
ing suddenness and turned all softness and tenderness

    but under all this lies my love she said  it was love drove me to
everything your pledge to that made me feel as nothing else could have
done the wall of separation between us while he lived  and my love could
not endure it ah how i love you  

   while she was speaking i was thinking  trying to see some flaw in the
coil she had spread round me but i could see none time might find a
way  but even time she grudged and did not mean to give

   but we cant be married now at the moment when our husband is
no

by right of sword

scarcely lying cold in his grave i said aghast at her cold blooded proposi-
tion  every man and woman in moscow would immediately think we had
murdered him together in order to marry

     every man and woman will not know   she answered calmly   do
you think there is no such thing possible in this holy russia of ours or that
gold cannot buy silence here just as well as anywhere else in the world  

    i know that a secret marriage under these circumstances would put
the lives of us both into the keeping of any one who knew of it however
well you paid him the more you paid indeed the more certain the
inference

      i care nothing for that  nor will you if you love me as you have often
sworn you do she uttered this with the energy and passion which always
were shown when she was crossed but in this i was naturally as resolute
as she

    i will not do it i said very firmly  understand me i will not do
it it has nothing to do with love in any way at all  but simply self pro-
tection it would be sheer suicide and that i can do much more simply in
other ways i refuse absolutely to put both our lives into the keeping of
any man in russia however holy and however well bribed when we are
married it must be openly in the light of day and before mens faces  and
that most certainly cannot be until all this excitement about your husbands
death has died down and the marriage can take place without causing suspi-
cion that must be at least six months hence-and probably a year or even
two years

    i wont wait she cried instantly and angrily you want to break
with me i am no fool

    as you will then instead of marrying me you can denounce me and
come and see me beheaded or strangled if you threaten me much longer
i said bitterly   you will make me prefer one of the latter fates  

   she bent close to me trying to read my thoughts

      and meanwhile    she asked

     are you such a mad woman that you would have us placard the walls
of the city with our secrets havent we all russia to hoodwink do you
suppose your police agents and secret agents are all fools to see nothing
think nothing infer nothing  it may be hard for us to be apart but what
else is possible  even this visit is foolhardiness itself and may set a thou-
sand tongues clacking heaven knows if ever a pair of lovers had need
of caution we have have you dared so much for our marriage only
to toss it all away now just for the lack of a little self control  we
must see very little of each other that is the only possible course

     ill not consent she cried again vehemently and then broke out into
a fresh storm of protests and reproaches but i held to my decision confi-
dent that she would see she must give way

   we parted without coming to any definite understanding  and i was glad
because it spared me the infliction of those outward signs of affection in
which she delighted to indulge and which now would have been more than
ever repulsive
by right of sword

in

   but the knowledge of the increased peril and embarrassment overwhelmed
me with a feeling of anxious doubt and most painful and galling impotence

          chapter xvi-the next nihilist plot

   it seemed to me when i thought over my interview with paula tueski
that the complications which surrounded me could not possibly be in-
creased it was of course hopeless to think of leaving russia except by
some stratagem or in disguise  and this would be all the more difficult be-
cause olga must leave first and her flight would undoubtedly turn attention
on me

    a positively baffling set of conditions faced me whichever way i turned
if i stayed on paula tueski would insist on the marriage and the crisis
would come that way if i attempted to go she herself would join with the
police in following me and the mere endeavor to fly would give just that
color to her story which would make all the world ready to believe it

    again if i tried the remaining alternative of proclaiming my identity i
had so egregiously compromised myself that i could not hope to escape heavy
punishment of some sort while it would certainly implicate olga and at the
same time have no effect against the direct lies to which paula tueski was
ready to swear

   above all a great change had come over me i washed to live and keep
my freedom the old indifference and apathy were gone my object now
was to get both olga and myself out of the country in safety  and thus i took
diametrically opposite views of difficulties which a few days previously-be-
fore i had made the discovery of my love for olga-would have caused me
little more than a laugh of amused perplexity

    baffling as the puzzle was it became infinitely more involved and perilous
a few days later two fresh complications came to kill every forlorn hope

    my nihilist friends were responsible for the first

    the belief that i had struck down the chief of the secret police and had
done it in a manner so mysterious and impenetrable that it staggered the
most ingenious police spies and defied the efforts of the astutest detectives
surrounded me with a glamour of wholly undeserved and undesired reputation

    the first intimation of this had reached me through olga and was followed
by several others  and i received clear proof that i was now regarded as a
sort of leader of the forlorn hopes of these wild and desperate men a man
who could alone and unaided achieve what i was believed to have achieved
was held capable of the greatest deeds so they appeared to argue and i
wras accordingly picked out next for a task of infinite danger and hazard in
a plot of even more tremendous consequences than that of the recent murder

    it was nothing less than the assassination of the czar

   it was resolved by whom and in what center of the empire i never knew
to follow up the murder of christian tueski by the greater blow and to strike
this with the utmost possible despatch  as a proof of the desperate courage
and daring of the nihilists

   i was chosen to play one of the chief parts i had no option to refuse


by right of sword

there was no choice given me the task was committed to me just as a
command might have been given me by my military superior officer when
i attempted to decline i was given to understand that refusal meant death

   i was thus placed in a position of cruel difficulty and i pondered with
close self searching what i ought to do looking back i think i made a
blunder in not disclosing all i knew to the authorities leaving them to take
what steps they pleased  but in forming my decision at the time i was swayed
by a number of considerations most difficult to wreigh

   one of my chief reasons for holding my tongue was that as the plot fol-
lowed so soon after the tueski murder-for the plans wrere all made within a
week-the fact that i knew so much of nihilist affairs at such a time would
bring both olga and myself under suspicion of having been privy to the
former one in such a case everything i wished to win would be jeopardized
a single breath of suspicion would have been enough to sweep us both into a
jail  and once there no one could say when if ever we should come out
for the whole country was red hot against the nihilists and men of the high-
est rank and wealth were languishing in jail

   i was also much concerned as to my supposed past i knew that the old
alexis was gravely compromised  but what he had actually done i did not
know if any old offenses were raked up i should be certain to be called to
account for them now while olga would inevitably suffer with me

   for those reasons i decided to hold my tongue and to seek my own means
for causing the infernal scheme to miss its aim i reckoned that as i was
to have a principal part assigned to me i could by my own effort either
through apparent stupidity or by wilful design wreck the whole project
and with this object i thought carefully over every detail intrusted to me

   the scheme was ingenious and save in one respect simple enough a
fortnight later the emperor was to pay a visit to moscow aud already prepa-
tions had been begun for his reception at one time it was thought he
would refuse to come because of the tueski murder  but with that unerring
accuracy that always made me marvel till i ascertained the cause the
nihilist leaders learned the imperial intentions before they were known in
some of even the closest official circles

   what the czar decided to do was to have all the preparations carried on
as though the original arrangement for the visit were to be carried out but
at the last moment to make a change which would baffle any plots he
meant to alter the arrangement of the train by which he would travel and
this at the very last moment

   the object of this was of course to tlivvart any plot that might be laid to
attack the train in which he traveled and thereby discover the plotters

   but the double cunning of the nihilists was quite equal to this change 
and the plot was indeed exactly what the officials had anticipated-to wreck
the train in which the czar traveled-and i think it was chosen for the very
reason of its apparent obviousness given precise information of the imperial
movements and a little double cunning in the plans it was likely enough
that the authorities would be especially vulnerable in just that spot in which
they believed they had most effectively guarded themselves
           by right of sword	

             the official reasoning was that if the train in which the czar was publicly
         but erroneously believed to be traveling could pass safely then that in which
         his majesty would actually be would be sure to get by without mishap the
         nihilists plans were laid in full knowledge of the official theory

            a part of the line about ten miles from the city wtas chosen where the
         rails ran in a dead straight course over a comparatively flat country for some
         five or six miles and it was chosen because it was the spot which the author-
         ities would the least suspect since it was most easy to watch and guard a
         man standing at either end of the long flat stretch could with a glass
         watch not only the line itself but also the land adjoining the line of all
         the spots the train would pass this was by far the unlikeliest to be selected for
         any nihilist attack

            the most prominent aud conspicuous spot of all was that moreover which
         was picked out for the actual attempt at that particular point a shallow
         dip in the fields caused the line to be embanked to a height of some ten
         or twelve feet  aud the key of the plan was to fix levers to two of the rails
         so that they could be moved at the very last moment just when the train
         was within a few yards of them in this way the train would be turned off 
         the metals aud sent over the embankment into the fields

            the levers worked by electric motive power were of course out of sight
         under the wooden sleepers aud the wires were trailed in tubes down
         inside the embankment and away through field drains to a house more
         than half a mile distant from the line where the operators were to remain
         until after the  accident

            when the train fell over the embankment into the field my work was to
         be done i was told that i should be in charge of the soldiers who would be
         told off to guard that part of the line  aud i was to draw my men up
         round the emperor and under the guise of protecting and helping him was
         to make a clear way for the assassins to do their work in the event of the
         emperor not being killed by the accident

            personally i did not dislike the scheme because i thought i could see
         several ways in which i could prevent any fatal outcome should i have to
         remain in the country long enough to compel me to take part in it it would
         be easy enough for me to appear to lose my head at the last moment for
         instance and so bungle matters that the men who were to kill the emperor
         would be in fact prevented from approaching him

            but there was also in this a desperate personal risk to myself i knew
         that these men would be picked from among the most reckless and daring
         spirits in the empire  men suffering under the grossest personal wrongs as
         well as inspired bythe wildest political fanaticism to them the blood of either
         friend or foe was as nothing if it stood in the way of what their unbalanced
         minds deemed justice and right

            it was thus a perilous aud slippery eminence to which i had been thrust
         and it increased infinitely the hazard of my course

            my thoughts therefore returned to the idea of flight with redoubled in-
         centive  and a circumstance occurred which seemed to promise me some help
         in this direction

   a letter came to me from  hamylton tregethner olgas brother he
had escaped as we knew and had made his way to paris he was going on
he said to america as soon as he had enjoyed himself and when he found
himself in new york he purposed to change his name and nationality once
more and be a pole

     i have not had many adventures he wrote   nor do i seem to have
met many men who know me but i had one encounter that was rather
amusing i was at breakfast and saw a man staring hard at me from the
other side of the room i thought he might be a friend and so i did not look
at him but he would not take his eyes from me and when i left the table
he followed and spoke to me  hamylton old man i did not know you at
first youre looking frightfully ill and altered youre not going to cut
me this gave me a cue though i did not understand all he said when he
added something about  on account of somebodys conduct i did cut him
however  looked him hard in the face and curling my lip as if in profound con-
tempt i turned on my heel i had the curiosity to ask afterwards who he was
and they gave me his name as the hon rupert balestier i suppose i know
him but i thought the best way was not to speak i did not shake him off
however for that night he saw me again just when i was speaking english
to some other men i saw him listening as if he could not believe his ears 
and as soon as i was alone he came up and asked me who i was and what
right i had to masquerade as his old friend hamylton tregethner for
answer i gave him another stare and got away then i changed my hotel
and am going away from paris for a few days i do not intend to be bothered
by the man

    my first impression of this incident was that it boded further danger i
knew balestier he was a man of great resolution and if he imagined that
any one was masquerading in my name in paris he would think nothing of
rousing both the english and russian embassies  or of coming on to moscow
himself to probe the thing to the bottom he loved mysteries  was most
active energetic and enterprising and nothing would suit him better than
to have imported into his rather purposeless life some such task as a search
for me half over europe he was quite capable too of jumping to the con-
clusion that the man he had met had murdered and was personating me  and
in a belief of the kind he was just the one to raise the hue and cry in every
police office on the continent

   what the real alexis called speaking english was of course bad
enough to brand him anywhere as an impostor should he try to pass himself
off as an englishman balestier had no doubt listened in amazement to this
strange jargon coming from lips that looked like mine  and the extraordinary
likeness and  my  peculiar conduct would quite complete his perplexity

    probably i should hear more of the matter  and this set me considering
whether i could not manage in some way to communicate with balestier and
get him to help in smuggling olga across the frontier he would revel in
the work if i could only find him

    i turned to  tregethners  letters therefore to find the name of the
hotel and to my infinite annoyance the fool had not mentioned it  while his
by right of sword



intention to run away from paris aud balestier would cause more delay
the fellow was not only a coward but an idiot as well and i could have
kicked him liberal if my foot could only have reached from moscow to
paris

   as it was balestier with the best will in the world would probably be
blundering about and plunging me still deeper into the mud when he not
only could but would have given me valuable help if i could have got at
him to tell him what to do

    i felt like tantalus wthen i thought of it

chapter xvii-an extraordinary adventure

   the second complication was a much bigger matter  and it was of so
strange a description aud fraught with consequences of such critical import-
ance to olga and myself that of all my experiences of that time it deserves to
be classed as the most remarkable like all else then it came quite un-
sought by me and as the direct and unavoidable consequence of the first step
in my new life-the duel with devinsky and my consequent repute as a
swordsman

   a day or two after tueskis funeral and while the city was still quivering
aud staggering under the effects of the supposed nihilist blow a great ball
took place at the valniski palace

   count valniski was among the richest men in moscow bidding hard for
power and courting popularity right and left among all classes to this ball
all the officers of my regiment were invited together with many of their
friends among the latter olga had a card  and although we were certainly
in a poor mood for a function of the kind we felt it expedient to do what
all the world was doing lest by remaining away we should attract attention
to ourselves

   it was a very brilliant affair as these big russian balls always are and
the crowd included many of the best and smartest people in moscow i
moved about the rooms not dancing much but exchanging a word now and
then with my brother officers and with other people who claimed acquaint-
ance with me

   olga had plenty of partners among my comrades and as she was dancing
with one of them i stood watching her and thinking how completely i had
dropped into the new social grooves of this moscow life and how quickly my
first feelings of strangeness had worn off when my friend essaieff came up
to me

    alexis i have a commission that concerns you he said

  well

    youre in luck try aud guess

   cant i replied shaking my head unless the wars broken out
and im to have a step what is it  

    theres a woman in it high up too there were only two women
in moscow i ever thought about and one of them i wished to see safe out
of russia and the other anywhere out of my way
by right of sword

    give it up i said with a smile

   its that smile of yours fetches em i believe said essaieff smiling
in his turn  it makes your face one of the pleasantest things in the world
to look at he had ripened quickly into a very familiar friend and we
were great chums now

    what is there you want me to do old man you wouldnt waste that
flower of speech for nothing  

    well somethings done it i have been asked to present you to one of
the wealthiest most beautiful and most influential women in moscow-the
princess weletsky  and asked in terms which seemed to imply that the
honor of the introduction will be conferred on her

   the princess weletsky who is she i inquired in absolute ignor-
ance	

    thats just like you alexis im getting to know that sweet innocence
of yours whenever i mention a name that all russia knows you make the
same lame show and ask whos he or whos she youve heard of her
a thousand times you cant help hearing of her you couldnt if you
tried  

    all right i laughed to turn my mistake  have you been talking
about me    he laughed at the idea

    why man where are your wits do you think the princess and i are
on gossiping terms im only the fly on the wheel in this she wishes to
know you  i do know you  she once sent me a card for oue of her assemblies
and snubbed me in a high bred manner  now she can use me and accordingly
i am paraded for duty-to introduce you come along or shell be getting
some court executioner to cut my throat for loitering

   i followed him wondering what it could mean  and half a minute later
was presented to one of the most lovely and stately women i have ever seen
a queenly woman indeed and i should have been an icicle if i had not
admired her i have seen many lovely women of all types but in all my
life none to compare with the exquisite magnificence of this russian beauty

   her reception of me could not have been more cordial had i been one of
the greatest of russias nobles or had she begun to entertain some strong
favor for me

   i asked for the honor of a dance and she gave me her program telling me
i might write my name where i would as it was empty this seemed a
generous invitation  but i scribbled my initials against two dances and was
then going to move off

   she glanced at the program and smiled i cannot describe the effect
which a smile produced on her face

   i had purposely kept the next dance for you lieutenant she said
 but i see your reputation has not belied you

    my reputation  

   yes but i have much i should like to say to you i have heard of
you often  as a daring man even among russias most daring  and as modest
as brave  

    rumor is often an unreliable witness said i
by right of sword	

    she has not always spoken so kindly of you lieutenant but to see
you is enough to prove the truth of her tales  

   we danced that dance and she declared that i waltzed better than any
man in the room  and at the close of the dance she asked me to take her to
one of the conservatories we sat there during two dances until the first that
i had initialed came and then we danced again

   all the time she fascinated me with her manner and the infinite subtlety
with which she implied the admiration she felt for my bravery my skill as a
soldier and a swordsman my strength-everything in short while she was
loud in the expressions of the interest which she said she should take in my
future

   at the close of the dance she sent me to fetch my sister  and when i
presented her she made olga sit down at her side and presently sent me away
saying that womens friendship ripened much more quickly when they were
alone-especially if they were interested in the same man all of which
would have been very sound philosophy had olga been my sister in reality

   essaieff had been watching me and now chaffed me a good deal about my
 conquest and grew enthusiastic about my future

    by gad man shes as rich as a grand duke  and there is no limit to
the height her husband may not climb play your cards well now  and
youve got all the pluck-aye and the brains too if you like to use them 
and youll be war minister before i apply for my colonelcy

   i laughed lightly but i thought to myself that if he only knew the
skeletons in my cupboard that were gibbering and rattling their bones in mock-
ery of me he wouldnt tell quite such an enthusiastic fortune for me

   when i went back for my next dance with the princess olga was just
being led away by a handsome young partner whom the princess had secured
for her

   olga is most delightful she said with one of her smiles she is
worthy of-any one  and a most enthusiastic sister she is the most genuine
soul i ever knew she will be my dear friend when her reserve has worn
off i thought i knew the cause of the  reserve but i kept the thought
to myself

   i did not think that at such a time any woman on earth could have exer-
cised so strong an influence over me in the course of no more than an hour
or two  and when we sat together after our last dance for a few minutes
before she left i felt i would have done almost anything on earth she asked
to serve her something that she said drew from me a rather random pro-
testation to this effect and she reddened and started and then after a rapid
searching glance shot into my face she sat silent fingering her fan restlesslv
while doing this her program caught her attention

   she looked at it and held it so that i could read it

    no name but yours she said almost in a whisper i saw this was so
then she broke the silken cord by which it was fastened to her wrist and
with another glance at me she put it away into her bosom

   it was a little action but from such a woman what did it not mean t
was amazed


by right of sword

   another long pause followed

   then she laid her hand in mine and looked straight at me

    are you really a brave man   she asked i seemed to take fire under
her touch and look

    that is not a question a man can answer for himself test me

      if your sister were insulted would you fight for her    she little knew
the cord she had touched or guessed how the reference cooled me

     i have already done so i returned

    in days of old men fought for any woman who was wronged would
you   

     i have done it before now i answered still thinking of olga and my
thoughts for some reason slipped back to the first meeting on the moscow
platform

   she paused and looked away from me for a moment as if hesitating and
then leaning close to me that i could feel her warm breath on my cheek as
she spoke while her grasp tightened on my arm she said in a tone of deep
feeling 

    i have been wronged you see me here as i am aud what i am but
save for the happiness you have made me feel in being with you i am the
most wretched woman in all russia will you help me  dare you    and
she seemed to hang on my words as she waited for my reply her eyes search-
ing mine as if to read my answer there

    i was about to reply with a pledge inspired by the enthusiasm with which
she had fired me when my instinctive caution restrained me she was
quick to see my moments hesitation and not willing to risk a refusal she
added hastily

     we cannot talk of this here i ought not to have spoken of it now  but
you seem to have drawn my very soul from me come to me tomorrow to
my house i will be alone at three you will come-my friend and
indescribable solicitude spoke through her last two words all suggestive of
infinite trust in me

     certainly i cried  and certainly your friend if i dare

   she answered with a glance  and then seemed to cast aside her excite-
ment rising she let me lead her back to the ballroom

   when i left her there were others round us but as she bowed i caught a
glance and the whispered words 

   i trust you

   i turned away half bewildered and went home at once pondering what
was to be the upshot of this new development

chapter xviii-the reason op the intrigue

   when i was alone and the strange charm of the princess weletskys
presence had given way to calm reflection my doubts began to grow i was
naturally a cautious man under ordinary circumstances  and now my sus-
picions were the keener because my caution had been momentarily lulled to

sleep
by right of sword



   i was all inclined to disbelieve the story which the princess had told or
rather had suggested  and i begau to look behind all she had said for some
motive or intrigue i thought she might wish for the help of my sword for
some altogether different purpose than she had suggested but i could think
of nothing nor could olga with whom i spoke very freely on the subject

   she said she could see no more than appeared on the surface  aud what
that was it was superfluous to ask  especially when she told me that the prin-
cess could or would talk of nothing else to her but my bravery my good
looks my courtesy my chivalry and so on at great length

   it is agreeable to have my brother praised said olga once laughing
 but there are limits

   during the next four or five days olga had ample opportunities of hearing
these praises moreover as the princess would scarcely let her out of her
sight when i called ou the day following the ball i found the two together
aud the princess in the few words we had together out of my sisters hear-
ing would say nothing at all about the subject of her wrongs she enlarged
 the suggestion of the previous night that she had been led by her impulses
and her instinctive trust in me to speak too fully

   for some days she maintained the same attitude of reserve and then
quite suddenly when we were alone she changed again and in words which
i could not fail to understand she let me know indirectly that if i would
avenge her wrongs her hand would be my reward

   i have never in my life had to face a more awkward crisis than that
what reply she expected i cannot tell whether she looked for some eager
passionate protestations of love or some strong pledge of defense or what
whether she really cared for me and the confusion she showed was the sign
of it or whether the whole part was assumed and everything mere acting i
cannot say but i know that i on my part felt indescribably embarrassed
and scarcely knew who to answer her

   i knew the danger to olga and myself of offending a woman so highly
placed so influential and powerful as the princess we had enough
troubles as it was   and if they were to be multiplied and aggravated in this
way we should be overwhelmed it was certain that i must find some way
of temporizing

    princess i am your devoted servant to do with as you will i answered
 and if my sword can be of service tell me how she started and flushed
with pleasure as i said this

     i knew i should not count on you in vain the grand duke ser-
vanieff will now learn that a more stalwart arm than his protects me from
his insults   her eyes seemed to glitter as she watched the effect of this
name on me

     do you mean that that is the man you wish me to fight   i cried in
the deepest astonishment he was all but on the very steps of the throne
and if i had approached him he would have brushed me away into a jail
with no more concern or difficulty than he would have whisked a fly off his
hand

   the woman was mad
	by right of sword

     he persists in forcing his attentions on me and i will not liave them
she said

   all my suspicions had been stung into activity by the mention of the
name of the grand duke  and as i looked at her she appeared to be watching
me too closely to be natural as she added   he cannot refuse to meet any
one to whom i give the right to protect me from him

    it was an intrigue i was sure of it  and this lovely woman was making
me her tool i answered guardedly

      a lieutenant in a marching regiment wrho should presume to challenge
that man would stand a better chance of being whipped at the carts tail than
of meeting him

     he is a great swordsman i know she said as if to pour suspicion on
my courage but i was not a fool to be tripped up by a gibe if i had
wished to marry the woman i would have consented readily enough there
and then aud risked all  but my object was to get out of russia and to get
olga out with me

     i should not fear him were he twice as skilful  but this is  mere matter
of sword fence  

     easy words lieutenant

    i will make them good princess replied i quietly but i must
first see the course clearer for the meeting what say your friends  can i
depend  their influence  

    wont you do this for me then ami mistaken in you there
was a sharp accent of irritation in her tone that i noticed now

     princess it does not best become a beautiful woman to doubt a mans
courage until he is proved a craven here is no matter of personal courage
only  but i should be loosing upon me all the waters of bitterest political
intrigue alone i should be absolutely powerless to stem the torrents that
would sweep me to certain ruin alone therefore i cannot do what you
ask but understand me give me the powerful support of your family and
i will meet the man were he fifty times the highness that he is-if we can
arrange the meeting

    she seemed disappointed at this-quite unreasonably so-and tried to move
me but i stood firm and then with evident reluctance she told me her brother
was with her in the matter and that if i would see him all would be simple

     my brother prince bilbassoff is as you know minister of the interior
and is now in moscow in connection with the visit of the emperor i had
not known who her brother was but when she gave me the name and told
me where i could see him a rapid conclusion leaped into my thoughts

  prince bilbassoff was the real power behind the police and i was prob-
ably going to find now why christian tueski had had to hold his hand
against me

    i wrent at once to see him i found him the very opposite of the popular
ideal of a bureaucrat-a short gray close haired spare man with the air of
a man of the world and a pleasant cheery manner that suggested nothing
formidable or even powerful yet without doubt the man was in many
respects the most powerful and the most feared in all russia
by right of sword	

   he appeared to be expecting me for the instant i was announced he got
up and welcomed me wdth a hearty shake of the hand and said 

    i thought my sister would have to make us acquainted lieutenant
petrovitch she said she wouldnt but i expected you women think
beauty will do everything and somehow are always calculating without the
effects of self interest dont you think so   he spoke with a sort of easy
club mannerism and just let his eyes rest a moment on my face

    of course you know the drift of what has passed then 

    of course i do as well as i know that your coming to me means that
my sisters method has failed i from the first disagreed with it i know a
great deal about you lieutenant petrovitch and i think i could have saved
time but my sister was attracted to you-women always like you hand-
some young fire eaters especially women like my sister-and as she is to
take a rather large hand in the matter she wanted to play it her own way
she appealed to your feelings lieutenant i should have gone straight to
your interest  and really it will be to your interest to do this

    will you tell me plainly what is wanted 

    certainly the death of the man whose name has no doubt been men-
tioned to you

   why

    not because he has insulted my sister though that is fortunately a
plausible pretext  but because he is a menace to the empire

   his bluntness astounded me

    do you take me for an assassin  

    no i take you for a very resolute young man with a great skill of
fence a large desire to push your fortunes high and not too much scruple to
act like a swrord scabbard between your legs and trip you up if you werent
that youd be no use to me as you are i open before you a career such as
lies before  other man in the emperors wide dominions

   and if i refuse

   he laughed and shrugged his shoulders

    you wont refuse he said shaking his head  if you do you will
be a young fool-too foolish to be trusted at large

   i knew what he meant and when i looked at him next i understood
why men feared him that laugh of his would usher a man to the knout or
the gallows

   i thought rapidly

   i like the project i replied  but can you arrange the meeting 
   he was quick as a flash and detected the false note in my voice

    lieutenant there are two courses open to you he said in a tone so
sharp stern and ringing that the change surprised me  you can accept or
refuse the offer-but dont try to fool me

    well then im not a murderer i rapped out angered by his words
thats better he said with a return to his light clubbish manner
 but this is no murder the man is a traitor and no juster act could be
compassed than his death

    then why not do it openly  


by right of sword

   is justice always done openly of course we might do that but he
would laugh at our efforts we might get him assassinated  but he is too
powerful and the noise of the act would defeat the very object we have in
view he is a swordsman worthy of your skill

    i sat thinking but not in the groove he guessed

     well make your sisters fortune as well he said raising the terms
she shall make a marriage into one of the best families in russia and
found a family of the highest distinction think lieutenant

    i was thinking about as hard as i could but no opening offered itself

    i must have time to determine i said it seems to me that i run
the chance of playing the catspaw with all the flame for my share what
guarantee have i that if i do this and am successful i shall not then be
deemed-too foolish to be trusted at large as you say  

      first my honor  secondly your betrothal to my sister and thirdly
her feeling for yourself

     and if i refuse  siberia i suppose  

     no not so far as that he replied lightly

    but what if i feign to consent and carry the story to the man you
threaten   

   there is that chance of course but in the first place he would not
believe you lieutenant and in the second if he did neither you nor he
could do any harm  aud iu the third you would have me for an enemy
and i am pleasanter as well as safer as a friend  

     how long will you give me to decide  

    a week we can then announce the betrothal just before the emperors
visit here and gain the imperial blessing on so righteous a marriage-between
a brave man and a beautiful woman each motived by the highest patriotic
feelings for russia  

    with this half sneer ringing in my ears he sent me away

   i went home in a very unenviable frame of mind  and my temper was
not improved by meeting my old opponent devinsky near my rooms

    for the moment i was powerless to think of any possible means of relief
my helplessness was so complete as to be almost ludicrous and if it had not
been for olga i would have just let myself be dragged along by the singular
chain of events which had coiled themselves round me

   i must rouse myself to some sort of effort for her sake i saw that of
course but a couple of hours thinking only increased my utter per-
plexity and i went off to bed to try if sleep would clear my wits

    i resolved to see olga the next day as soon as possible after my regimen-
tal duties were over there wtas but one thing possible she must go at
once and we must try to hit on some plan by which she could escape at any
hazard but my regimental work was heavier than usual and when it wras
over a meeting of the officers was called in reference to the impending visit
of the czar it was thus late in the afternoon before i could go to olga

    at the house astounding news awaited me

an amateur in dynamite

a summer experience which fills a big space in the memory of a certain young machinist-
the expedient to which his fiancee resorted to counteract the mischievous
influence of a professional agitator

hp he long hot day was done and the seething ocean of human life on the
east side seemed to have boiled up out of the fetid apartments of the
tenement houses through the scuttleholes and spread over the roofs
weary men sprawled at full length smoking their pipes  women gossiped
and nursed their babies  lovers perched on the cope stones of partition walls 
children played games and ran races in apparent unconsciousness of the
abyss bordering their field growler parties sang popular ballads the
air vibrated with a myriad of voices in speech laughter song and quarrel
all swelling together in one great human chord as pervasive and diffuse as
the faintly golden haze doming the city the skys reflection of its million
lights

   gottlieb hebick a stalwart young machinist and ottilie boldtner a
pretty flaxen haired and blue eyed feather worker sat together upon the
partition wall of the two huge buildings that constituted the gruesome flats
he bestriding the cope stone was in his shirt sleeves but that was no in-
fraction of etiquette for his coat lay upon his knees she sitting sidewise
upon the wall facing him seemed occupied with making plaits in the hem
of her apron

   youre right of course said the young man gloomily there
would be some risk in it but its hard within a week of our wedding to
have it knocked in the head i had set my heart upon it and saved up
enough for a nice little home and a fair start i was going to get the furni-
ture next week we might chance it

    no gottlieb  i am as sorry as you are  but just think suppose we
have our home and you can get no work and our little savings are all gone
and nothing coming in then the home wall have to go and i have to come
back to my father and you must go away somewhere and look for work 
and maybe we shall never see each other again you know how it was with
the poor meissners and gretchen detweiler aud her man and more we have
seen all good honest hard working people maybe your shop will soon
start up again aud then i will not say  no any more but  yes as soon
as you like

 but suppose the strike lasts for months  as strikes sometimes do  

   then it would be a great deal worse for us married that as we are
but now you call it a strike and a little bit ago you spoke of it as a lockout
which is it

per cent cut in wages because of dull times other manufacturers were
glutting the market with goods at cost or below to raise money and the

    yes times are bad i know that everybody does

   some of us were willing to stand the cut until business picked up but
others would not and when it was carried to the union a strike was ordered

    i dont suppose they looked at it in exactly that w-ay at all events
when the committee called on colonel withers he just said all right  and
posted up another notice closing the works that made the strike a lock-
out

    and there wouldnt have been any lockout if the union had not ordered
a strike 

    no i suppose not-if the men had stood the cut

    you men make me tired

    i didnt favor a strike myself and i guess nearly all the men in the
works under the circumstances after a growl would have let the ten per
cent go but the union wouldnt allow it

    so it was decided for you by those not directly concerned  

    well we have to stand by the union you know

    will the union feed those it stops from earning their bread

   if it has the funds yes  but some would go hungry rather than take its
money i would

    and if the works start again with new hands who are not strikers
what becomes of you men   

    we will have to do the best we can

      will the union find work for you   

    oh no  it is not for that

   ottilie pondered she was vaguely conscious of the imperative obligation
to stand by the union but it was less a live issue to her mind
than to her lovers her father a piano maker and her brother a
violinist both belonged to unions and she had heard   the union   spoken
of with a sort of reverence all her life yet she could not see that it ever did
anything but interfere with people making a living

   gottlieb went off to a meeting of the late employees of the vulcan works
a growler party two roofs away broke up in a row the playing
children grew sleepy and lachrymose men began dragging up mattresses
from their rooms to sleep on women disappeared ottilie among them
with the duty of  standing by the union  still a matter of question in her
mind

 	   

   the strikers met in the long low ceilinged hall back of the  liederliche
kleeblatt  saloon a piano stood in one corner and the walls were decor-
ated with prize wreaths won in vocal contests by the little singing societies
that rehearsed and drank beer here two nights in each week there was a

small platform used by speakers at strikers meetings but which could be
taken apart and removed easily to give more room for the sunday night
dances a big hole in the partition wall between the hall and the bar room
facilitated the supply of beer on all occasions

   when gottlieb entered the smoke was so thick that he could only see
those nearest to him but when his eyes grew a little accustomed to it he
made out that schmidt was making the report of the committee that had
waited on colonel withers everybody knew all about it already but
listened intently to its formal presentation which occupied some time as
schmidt was fond of details and had much indignation to express then
everybody talked at once and there was much rattling of beer mugs to sum-
mon waiters a few of the older men muttered to each other that it was
bad business as the time was ill chosen for a strike but seemed fearful of being
overheard uttering such treason against the union

   gottlieb less prudent and still under ottilies influence was strongly
minded to say the same thing out boldly but was diffident about trying to
make a speech and while he hesitated the platform was taken by a speaker
who in a shrill voice that was almost a shriek compelled attention by the
cry 

    brothers  fellow slaves  the issue is life or death  

   the utterer of that hysterical exordium was not one of the strikers but
gottlieb knew him by sight as max fiukelmaier a stormy petrel of the
labor sea whose screams were to be heard wherever trouble between masters
and men could be fomented he was supposed to have a trade but nobody
knew what it was by virtue of his permanent attitude of revolt against
toil he assumed to consider himself a sort of ex officio member of all bodies
of strikers whether cloak makers or plasterers marble cutters musicians
horseshoers or waiters were  out max was sure to be found among
them always making furious speeches each strike in turn was a  sacred
cause and he never neglected to mention that the bloated aristocrats
were  fattening on the hearts blood  of his hearers he was in demand
for strike leaders found him useful in stimulating flagging ardor among their
followers and some evenings he had two or three sacred causes for each of
which he was read to  bare his breast to the tyrants steel

   gottlieb listened at first with mere curiosity then with interest and
finally as if fascinated iu the animation of oratory max black reptilian
eyes seemed to sparkle his long nose to curl sinuously his snaky locks to
lash the air like whips and his lean figure to quiver with an energy too
fierce for words one of his sentences that particularly impressed gottlieb
was your purse proud master who refuses even consideration to your
bitter wrongs cares nothing that on his blood stained way to wealth his
iron feet crush human hearts stamp life out of the tender flowers of love and
hope that lie in his path it seemed as if max must be referring to ottilie
how was the young man to know max always said this when a strike com-
mittee had been repulsed 

   the strike-or lockout-lasted long and the men met often max and gott-
lieb became almost inseparable companions the young mans savings in-

stead of furnishing a home for ottilie were steadily and rapidly undergoing
conversion into beer for allaying the unslakable thirst of the agitator whose
diatribes against  capital church and state the satanic trinity in unity
made his throat dry all the time

    herr boldtner the piano maker a stolid elderly germau not much given
to talking shook his head gravely when he heard gottlieb repeat parrot-
like the evil and violent talk of his friend but wasted no words in argument
only when he was gone the old man would say to ottilie  some day he
does a big foolishness and comes by sing sing sure

   the girl whose apprehensions were already awakened by the too pain-
fully evident change in her lovers formerly abstemious habits was not a
little alarmed by her fathers prophecy and set herself to watch for and if
possible arrest before it went too far the  foolishness that would lead to
such a bad end gottlieb she well knew was not naturally an anarchist
but maxs influence upon his impressionable nature was fast making him one
 and she said to herself  he will put gottlieb up to do something awful
that will land him in jail while he sits safe in the dark a prognostication
much more correct and nearer to realization than she imagined

   she tried reasoning with him against his reflection of max specious
sophistries but with little or no effect he loved her but said to himself
 of course a woman could not see what necessity demands men shall do
against the capitalistic tyrants the thought of fire and blood would frighten
her and she would faint at sight of a spoonful of dynamite

    one very hot night ottilies six year old brother hugo was feverish and
slept badly about midnight he cried for water and ottilie who was as a
mother to him got up to supply his want to do so she had to enter the
kitchen the rear room of the flat and was momentarily startled by finding it
alight with the reflected glare of gas from a window facing her in the next
extension of the building that window was gottliebs as she well knew
having often talked with him across the eight feet wide air space in front
of each window-his and hers-was a fire escape balcony rather rickety as
such structures are apt to be on old houses and lumbered with miscellaneous
utensils and debris

    fearing her lover might be ill she looked across he was fully dressed
as if he had just come in and in the act of taking from a coat pocket a small
package that he laid very giugerly upon the table before which he stood
then he began taking something else from another pocket but stopped
suddenly to look at the gas flame as if it suggested an apprehension under
the impulse of wthich he cautiously moved the package to the end of the
table farthest from the light and covered it with his hat the something
else he next produced was simply a cylinder of metal four or five iuches
long and probably two in diameter with his strong fingers he unscrewed
a plug that fitted one end of it and peered inside it was empty and he laid
it down

    the last thing he put on the table was what looked to ottilie like a coil
of thick black string with a bit of bright metal at one end before these
objects he stood motionless several minutes regarding them gloomily as if
an amateur in dynamite



iii a reverie then seeming to suddenly remember that his window was
open he started stepped quickly to it and looked out all was silence and
darkness ottilie in her unlighted kitchen would not have been seen by
him even had she not moved to one side as she did reassured he drew
down the shade and in a few minutes the extinguishing of his light indicated
that he had gone to bed

   ottilie waited for him to fall asleep she knew intuitively what was in
that package and the thought of what it might do made her shudder bver
since he had been repeating maxs mouthings against the  tyrants  she had
expected it but she would save him in spite of himself if her womans wit
was equal to her love and courage

   when she deemed time enough had elapsed for him to be asleep she set
to work from its place beneath the stationary tubs she drew a long but
narrow ironing beard carried it to the balcony and rested its ends on the
light iron railings crossing the abyss like a bridge that it was insecure she
knew very well the railings did not deserve much confidence  if the board
should bend with her wreight in the middle it would be likely to slip off  it
was a narrow path for anybody but a rope dancer to tread in the dark  and
the stone flagging of the yard was full fifty feet below  yet the only reflec-
tion that made the brave girl hesitate even a moment wras if anybody
should see me going across to gottliebs window what would be thought 

   with light quick steps she crossed the chasm reached his window and
groping beneath the blind upon the table which was within easy reach took
the package from under gottliebs hat tightly clutching her prize she re-
recrossed the treacherous bridge-which she temporarily drew in and laid
upon the balcony-and regained her own apartments

   with the shade carefully drawn dowu and the gas lighted she examined
the package a stout mauilla paper wrapping inclosed about a pound of a
queer yellowish brown granular stuff that had a damp greasy feel a sickly
sulphurous odor and a sweetish taste she had never seen dynamite before
but had no doubt of this being as she reflected  the slumbering devil that
max teaches the poor fools will wake up to right all their wrongs

   now that she had it what should she do with it  if she were simply to
destroy it max would supply more  gottlieb would know she could not
betray him and would yet do some dreadful thing her sense of the respon-
sibility she had assumed in sharing his guilty secret became agonizing all
at once an inspiration came to her as good ideas always come to those whose
souls in great travail seek them she would make some innocent dynamite
which would be much safer for gottlieb to handle than the real stuff and it
would go hard if she could not find some way of giving him a salutary lesson
from its employment and this is how she made dynamite from her domestic
materials

   in a large bowl she put a quantity of yellow corn meal equal to that of
the dynamite it was too light in color but a sepia cake-from hugos box
of water colors-dissolved and mixed through it made that right a little
olive oil and brown sugar gave the greasy feel and sweetness of the original


an amateur in dynamite

soaking off the heads of a bunch of brimstone matches and adding a little of
the dilute nitric acid her father kept for staining wood carvings she per-
fumed the mess

   when her work was done even an expert would have had to make some
experiment to determine which of the two dynamites was real and that gott-
lieb would not detect the substitution she felt well assured the package
remade in the original wrapper but with new contents she put under the
hat on gottliebs table again traversing the plank to and fro for the pur-
pose having stowed the ironing board away in its accustomed place the
last thing she did was mixing the dynamite with water to the consistency of
a thin gruel aud pouring it down the sink with enough water following to
carry it well into the sewer and on its way to the sea

    now she said triumphantly to herself as she went back to bed  let
gottlieb go a max-ing if he will he will do no harm aud if he is caught it
will not go so hard with him when they find what sort of dynamite he uses  

	     

   the next day gottlieb remained in his room until late in the forenoon
ottilie knew when he went out and noted that it was full two hours later
than his usual time even since he had been out of work she surmised and
rightly that he was occupied in putting her dynamite into the shell which
she well understood from reading about such things in the newspapers was
meant to be a bomb

   it took him a long time to make up his mind to actually commence the
work and when he did his awkwardness and excessive caution made him
slow but at last he finished the task according to his instructions

   that afternoon he visited ottilie as usual but was nervous distraught
and preoccupied as she had never seen him before it is for tonight
she said to herself and his conscience is troubling him already oh  if
it could only speak loud enough to his mind to stop him how glad i would
be and how proud of him  

   unhappily maxs voice was louder in his mind than that of conscience
he took supper with the boldtner family and made a great effort to be con-
versational and appear at his ease but could not keep it up long and soon
after the meal was over went out saying he had a meeting to attend

   ottilie watched all night for his home coming he did not return until
after five oclock in the morning she got a newspaper at as early an hour
as possible aud anxiously scanned its columns but the only dynamite events
reported were a little real one in spain and a bogus one in england never-
theless she was not easy things happened sometimes she knew too late
at night to be chronicled in the next mornings papers

   gottlieb did not show himself until afternoon and when he did his appear-
ance startled her she did not believe that the loss of a nights sleep could
have so affected him often she had seen him alert bright and jolly the
morning after a whole night of dancing at a ball but now he was haggard
his eyes were sunken and bloodshot his face pale and drawn with sleep lines
and he was so nervous that his hands trembled
an amateur in dynamite



    what is the matter with you gottlieb are you sick  she exclaimed
in alarm

   no im all right he replied with impatient gruffness that sounded
strange from his lips soon he wanted to go out but she positively forbade
it and compelled him to remain with her but to keep him she had to
threaten that if he went away then he need never return to see her a little
after three oclock she ran down to the street and bought an evening news-
paper on its first page her eyes caught at once the startling headlines

another dynamite outrage

strikers adopting anarchistic methods

fiendish attempt to blow up the residence of colonel withers oj

the vulcan works

   she stopped outside long enough to read the article aud chuckled at its
conclusion 

    the bomb was carefully opened by the intrepid sergeant after it had been thoroughly
soaked in water and was found to contain more than a pound of dynamite the cap
attached to the fuse had evidently done its work and that it should have failed to set off
the terrible explosive with which it was in immediate contact is simply miraculous and
can only be regarded as an evidence of the direct interposition of providence

   when ottilie retnrned to gottlieb she found him with his head bowed
upon his arms which were crossed upon the table before him but at her
sudden entrance he sprang to his feet pale and trembling with the look of a
hunted man in his eyes affecting not to notice anything unusual in his
demeanor she exclaimed 

   oh gottlieb such an awful thing the vulcan strikers have
blown up colonel withers house  surely you did not know anything about
that did you   

    oh  why--of course not-how should i   he stammered

    it was last uiglit and they used dynamite

    and colonel withers 

    oh  he was not hurt he was away from home

    thank god   burst fervently from the young mans lips

     but his sick wife and two poor little children his little girl and a play-
mate who was spending the night with her- 

   gottlieb threw up his arms with a hoarse inarticulate cry as of a beast
in agony aud fell forward senseless upon the table ottilie dashed water in
his face fanned him held ammonia under his nose and eventually restored
him to consciousness but not to his senses she was frightened by the over-
whelming effect of her story and if he had given her a moments time when
he came to himself would have confessed how far she had perverted the
newspapers statement of facts but as soon as he could breathe and move
again he struggled to his feet and staggered out beating aimlessly with his
open hands like a man who is fighting for air ottilie strove to detain him
but he broke loose from her hands and went away seemingly deaf though
she called after him again and again
an amateur in dynamite

   whet he had plunged almost headlong down the stairs she sood still a
few moments in dreadful uncertainty what to do then ran back into the
kitchen to watch for his appearance in his room presently he walked in
like a drunken man gesticulating wildly and muttering incoherently to him-
self as he staggered to and fro then as if struck by a sudden resolution
he strode to the window and pulled down its shade

   ottilie realized that the moment was one of supreme peril that if she
would prevent a desperate deed which would fill the rest of her life with
heart breaking remorse she had not a minute to lose to run down the
stairs and up those of the next house to his room would take too long the
leap from time to eternity can be made much more quickly

   almost as quickly as the thought flashed into her mind she had the
board in place over the chasm darted across it pushed aside gottliebs blind
and sprang into his room through the window

   he sat at the table writing and momentarily dashing away from his eyes
the tears that were blinding him deaf to her entrance and unconscious of her
presence though she stepped quickly behind him and looked over his shoul-
der she read 

    farewell beloved ottilie  the longest of all farewells-forever-for i shall never see
you again-either in this world or in heaven i have done what god never will forgive
and i must never look upon your dear face any more in a few moments i shall be
among the lost where i belong and you-

     no  no  gottlieb   she cried unable to restrain herself any longer
seizing the paper from under his hands and tearing it into shreds  i wrill
not have it so  you have done nothing of the sort  i tell you so  i your
ottilie come-understand me-sit up-look at me

   she pushed him upright in his chair he gazed dazedly at her for a
moment then throwing his arms about her dropped his head upon her breast
and burst into a passion of weeping and broken lamentations she held and
soothed him until his excitement had in some degree exhausted itself and
then said to him 

    come now gottlieb be yourself again be a man sit up straight
and stop crying it is enough there  that is right now  do you know
me  do you know what i am saying to you 

   he nodded he could not trust himself to speak she went on 
 very well then  understand this-the bomb did not go off i just made
that story up the colonel was away from home and the others were there
it is true but they were not hurt and no harm was done at all because as i
tell you the bomb did not go off

      but-the paper-and-i heard it  

    the paper says it did not i only told it that way to make you know
how bad you would feel if things had happened as they very well might had
it been real dynamite  

    but-it was

     no do you think i would have let you blow people up with real
dynamite for that villain max
an amateur in dynamite

     you let me  what did you know about it  

    everything i made the dynamite

   he passed a hand over his brow with a gesture of hopeless confusion of
course he said to himself none of this was real the reality was the other-
the horrible things  he had just gone crazy aud simply imagined ottilie was
with him trying to soothe him by saying such kind but absurd things and
how strange it was that he could imagine all this and yet know he was crazy
in doing so  and how good god was to let him be crazy this way instead of
making him hear that bomb and see that poor woman and the children 

   but ottilie who had no idea of the gruesome fancies in his tortured
brain only saw that he was quiet and thought complete control of his mind
was coming back to him so she went on and told him all she had done 
how she had divined the evil he was being led into and had watched him had

made the innocent dynamite aud substituted it for the infernal sort-

    no no   he interrupted her with a wild frightened look  i heard
it i lighted the long fuse and ran away very fast far off but i heard it 
oh  it was terrible  it seemed right behind me and the echoes followed me
a great while

    gottlieb you heard nothing but your conscience the bomb could not
go off the paper says so come i will show it to you when you come over
i told you it did that you should know how such a guilty man would feel 
gradually as she talked his clear sense returned to him and he knew the
truth he tried to tell her of his boundless gratitude but words failed him
and he could only sob aud repeat that she was his guardian angel

    then she said  will you promise your guardian angel you will have
no more to do with that villain max or any of his kind

    yes  yes  i promise it with all my heart and swear it before god
not for nothing shall i have had such feelings as i know this day oh to
think of what i might be this minute but for you ottilie  liebchen  how
shall i be good enough to be worthy of your care for me   

    you will go far away from here in the first place you have made
some bad friends and maybe some bad habits that are not good for you since
you have been out of work and i want you to leave them all-the friends and
the habits

    and you ottilie- 

    would you not if necessary-for a while 

    a little while if i must yes  but i cannot any more trust myself much
if you are uot with me

     i am not the one to argue you out of that idea but here is your
chance my married sister who lives in montana you know writes to me
that a fine opening is there for a good blacksmith who understands tool mak-
ing and you do-dont you 

    oh very well i can forge and temper as well as any man

     then there is where you must go  

    but surely that montana is big enough for two 

   you think so well-we will try

the gold deluge

astounding consequences arising from tfie discovery of a chemist-terror of the governments
to whom unlimited gold meant destruction-the extraordinary lengths
to which erik poulsen was driven to maintain
his independence

synopsis of chapters previously published

    erik poulsen a danish chemist after several years of experimenting succeeds in discov-
ering how to make gold he is anxious to publish the formula to the world but his government
will not hear to it declaring that it will overturn civilization so he and his wife depart for
berlin and here he is offered the crown of a small kingdom in exchange for his secret to be the
property of germany but he indignantly declines and leaves for paris where he proposes to
lay the facts before the editor of a widely circulated journal of chemistry and reap the fame that
is his due even if he should thereby be bereft of the fortune his discovery has brought him
but here too he is made aware that he is under constant surveillance to prevent the publication
of his secret and finally he retreats to a small rocky island off the coast of spain where he
broods over his powerlessness finally he builds a completely equipped steamer the chemeia
and seeks to escape to other lands at once however a french and an english man of war are
sent on his track and although the former is outdistanced the madras begins to wreak des-
truction with her cannonade in this crisis erik loads a cannon with gun cotton and although
the risk to all on board the chemeia is great resolves to attempt the destruction of the enemys
searchlight szemsky a member of the crew who has been on a russian man of war declares
he is willing to risk his life in the firing of the charge and proceeds to train the cannon

chapter xii-nearing the south pole

cuddenly a thunderous deafening crash reverberated from the center m
the chemeias deck and a bright red column of vivid fire shot past the
side of the ship at the same instant everything about them was wrapt in
dense darkness felt all the more  account of the glare of a moment before

the electric searchlight of the english man o war had been destroyed

   for a moment the crew and the officers all thought the chemeia had been
struck by one of the enemys missiles-a large hole had been torn in the deck
and a portion of the nearest cabin was blown away when they realized
that they themselves and their comrades were uninjured they grasped the
full meaning of all that had happened

   you can foire like an angel kelly cried joyfully but the one
addressed spoke not he lay insensible and bleeding near the torn and
shattered cannon

   the night gradually neared its end

   all on board the chemeia had retired for a few hours rest so badly
needed after the terrible strain they had been under the danger from pur-
suit and possible capture seemed averted for the time being the second

the gold deluge



mate had the watch and slowly he paced his post on the commanders
bridge keeping his weather eye on the search for danger while the spaniard
mendez had charge of the wheel where he softly whistled a love song to
while away the time

     how is szemsky   erik made haste to inquire as soon as he appeared
on deck

     shlaping loike a log your excellency kelly replied  does not feel
 the shlightest pain xcept in wan shoulder where he was sthruck but here
 is the rascal hiself  

    szemsky actually turned out with the rest of the crew looking very pale
 it is true but otherwise all right

    erik stepped up to him and shook hands heartily

     thanks szemsky a thousand thanks   he said to the calmly smiling
pole  and thanks to you all turning to the others of the crew   you all
proved your sterling qualities as men

     his excellency-three cheers for his excellency  hip hip-hurrah  
elly cried and willingly all hands joined

   and another cheer for szemsky erik exclaimed enthusiastically
and again the cheer was given with a hearty vim

    eric ordered coffee served for himself and the officers of the ship in the
 little weather cabin on the commanders bridge whence a free view could be
 had of the surrounding ocean as far as the eye could reach not a single
 sail nor any smoke from steamers could be discerned

     well captain erik inquired  where are we now 

     considering the frightful speed at which we traveled i presume that
we must be about near cape horn   captain alsloev replied   i have now
laid the course of the ship more to the west to avoid that part of the polar
territory which reaches up to the sixty first degree and i propose that we
go by way of the coast of victoria eand direct to the south where we will
be perfectly safe

    very good the first mate added  that is also best in my opinion
but-excuse me if i ask-then-what

     yes-what then   the officers all repeated in chorus

    no one replied and erik stared thoughtfully out upon the great undulat-
 ing ocean

    then suddenly the cabin entrance was darkened by the shadow of eriks
young wife who entered and was respectfully saluted by the officers

    erik explained to her in as few words as he could the problem with which
 they were confronted

      we must in some manner or other get into communication with europe  
 she said

      but how    captain alsloev asked smilingly   in the southern lati-
 tudes there are neither post offices nor telegraph stations  

     no-fortunately not junker rejoined  otherwise we would perhaps
have visitors-unwelcome visitors on board all too soon

      have we no possible chance of meeting some ship-a whaler for in-
stance   the steward asked


the gold deluge

    that is the idea erik exclaimed joyfully we will bribe some
whaler aud after swearing him to secrecy have him deliver a packet to pro-
fessor dulcis we will then proceed further south to await results  

    not a bad idea at all alsloev remarked  but whether we will run
across such a vessel and whether the captain wdll agree to our proposition-
that is the question

     gold jackson interposed  makes all things possible 

   the time of year is also very favorable smith suggested  if we
ouly do not meet too many and have some one of them betray us  

    yes there is no doubt but that ship is after us at this very moment
the steward said

   and that miserable petterson smith continued if he was lucky
enough to be taken on board of the man of war undoubtedly made great
haste to tell them all he knew

    bah he knew nothing  at the most that we would sail south and that
is a word full of flexible meaning meantime we have gained enough head-
way and they will hardly pursue us to the pole

   the day passed quietly and without any events that would cause alarm
about noon the captain made an observation of the sun and reported that
the ship was then about  degrees south latitude and a little over  degrees
west longitude and therefore the course was laid more to the southwest by
west in the afternoon a sail was descried towards the northwest which only
appeared a short time on the horizon and soon vanished

   the chemeia moved along rapidly although its speed was nothing near
that of the night before had this been kept up smith declared they would
have sailed around the earth in from ten to twelve days provided the boiler
did not explode

   meanwhile erik was busily engaged in his cabin writing a detailed report
of his discovery for professor dulcis and similar reports for the principal
scientific societies of the world these were to be given by the person to be
engaged to the different post offices in europe to be more secure erik
wrote the treatises in such intricate scientific language that only the greatest
expert could understand what it was all about

   new life hope and ambition had awakened in erik he charmed those
around him by his frank hearty laugh and the glad happy look came back
to his eyes once more

   days went by and one morning when erik as was his custom appeared
early on deck with his wife he noticed the captain looking towards the east
in an eager fashion through his glass erik stepped up to him quickly aud
gazed in the same direction

    far out as far as it was possible to distinguish objects land had been dis-
covered clear aud white as snow the sharp edges of mountain chains wefe
distinctly marked in the rising sun which seemed to asceud noticeably slower
than usual into the blue heavens the glaring white light of large suow-
fields dazzled the eyes and the water along the coast was as a deep blue and as
clear as a solution of copper millions of minute crystals had formed during
the night in the rigging of the chemeia and now glittered brilliantly
the gold deluge	

     polar land    erik cried out lustily

    last evening after sundown we crossed tlie southern polar circle the
captain replied nodding to erik   and now we are sailing to the day lasting
half a year the sun we can now see rising will the nearer we approach south
appear gradually to remain still and only sink after five or six months  

   erik peered thoughtfully before him gradually as the eyes became ac-
customed to the bright glare of the light he noticed that the coast was sur-
rounded by a belt of ice miles in width and that the sea was covered
with countless icebergs

   we must consider it a wonderful thing that we got as far as we did
without feeling the cold or noticing the icebergs   the captain continued 
  we are now on the th degree latitude and james ross himself could not
penetrate further than the th notwithstanding this it would be im-
possible even with a ship as stanch as the chemeia to break through the ice
belt surrounding the land over yonder aud with every hour of our progress
southward the cold will become more intense

     then the navigable water here is much more difficult to pass through
than that in the north pole  the young wife remarked inquiringly

    yes and no the captain replied  around the north pole the sum-
mer is comparatively warm and in the most favorable season any one can
easily penetrate as far as the th degree of latitude and sometimes still further
but to offset this the winters there are extremely severe and rigorous and a
ship surprised in that region by the coldest season is generally lost with all on
board here in the south polar region the temperature is about the same
all the year round therefore the winter does not present so many dangers-
the drift ice is the greatest but to reach as near the pole as up north is im-
possible at least with a ship

    oh look  the wife exclaimed   theres a whale  

   sure enough far out a great dark mass could be discerned plainly cutting
rapidly through the sea and now and then shooting forth mighty columns of
of water like geysers high up into the air

    where are the whalers  erik asked turning to the captain

   asa rule they never come much further south than we now are was
the reply  but considering this unusually mild weather and the remarkable
absence of drift ice it is possible that some of them have penetrated to still
more southerly latitudes if however we want to communicate with any
of them in my opinion it would be best not to proceed much farther our
second mate junker knows the  seas hereabouts better than i do and i sug-
gest that we get his opinion

   consequently all the officers were called together in a ships council
junker who had served his time aboard a whaler was of the positive opinion
that it would not be wise in any case to proceed farther south and that if
the ship cruised about in the vicinity a whaler would sooner or later be
met this was also the opinion of the other officers and the decision
reached was that the chemeia for the time being should keep between the
th and th degrees latitude and that sharp watch was to be maintained
day and uiglit towards all points of the compass
the gold deluge

   this was accordingly done all day a man was posted in the bow with a
telescope erik had completed his literary labors and everything was ready
for delivery days however passed monotonously and yet no whaler was
discovered although numberless whales could be seen sporting in lively
fashion around the ship junker swore to himself in his own way that
it was very inexplicable that nothing appeared and erik began to grow rest-
less and fretful again

   the nervous tension and impatience became greater with each day that
passed the entire crew took the deepest interest in the course affairs were
taking  every one knew what was at stake once the uncertainty had been
taken out of the objects of the cruise it was a great pleasure to erik to
notice the excellent character of his men they were all devoted to him
body and soul and there was not one who wrould not have risked his very
life to attain the much sought object

 chapter xiii-the precious message

   one day erik sat in his cabin morose and discouraged and revising his
manuscripts for the hundredth time suddenly loud cries startled him he
hastened up the companionway to inquire the cause of the hubbub

    kelly stood at the starboard rail and roared out something while the bal- 
ance of the crew crowded around him

   in the hope that he would at last see a ship erik quickly turned his
eyes but in vain-the seas were as bare and void of anything in the shape of
a sail as before

     there  there   kelly cried

    what where   exclaimed peter  i dont see anything

     idiot you   kelly fairly screamed now  dont you see the whale 

   at the same moment the entire crew broke forth in one loud cheer

     a harpoon  

   it was true several hundred yards from the ship swam a huge whale-
a harpoon stuck in his body

     hes drifted from the south the captain told them  and provided he
was not harpooned a long time ago we surely must meet the whaler if we run
a few points in that direction the navigable waters there are very much
more limited than here on account of the pack ice so that he cannot escape
us if we keep our eyes open

   the chemeia accordingly had her nose- pointed towards the south and
early that afternoon the lookout reported a vessel in sight-news at which
the entire crew clambered hastily on deck

   the captain a young southerner tanned to a dark brown by tropical
suns appeared on the deck of his vessel and to the question as to whether
he was the owner he replied in the affirmative he also agreed willingly to
come aboard the chemeia

   erik received him in his cabin in the presence of his wife captain
alsloev and the two mates and asked him rather bluntly whether he would
sell the ship esperanza and agree to undertake a certain mission
the gold deluge

r

   the strange captain thoughtfully stroked his beard he declared then
that their luck in whaling had been unusually good that year and unless
the compensation was very liberal he could not think of a proposition which
would put an end to his trip besides his crew to a man had each his share
in the proceeds and they would ask for indemnity

   erik replied that the price was a matter of indifference to him he would
willingly pay twenty thousand pounds sterling for the ship and give each
one of the crew several hundred pounds as indemnity

   the captain of the esperanza looked at the speaker in surprise not to
say dismay his eyes wandered over the entire cabin with its ceilings heavily
decorated in pure gold and at the priceless hand carvings of the woodwork

    twenty thousand pounds is a good price he frankly confessed  and
i would not hesitate a moment to sell my ship but i must have a talk with
my people first of all although i have no doubt but what they will be agree-
able then naturally i wish to know what the mission is of which you
spoke-for i can easily imagine and he smiled slyly that you are not
paying such a price for nothing  

   as erik did not immediately reply captain alsloev hastened to say 

    our only object is to communicate with europe but it must be done with
the greatest secrecy the facts are these  we are now engaged in a cruise
for scientific purposes which for political reasons must remain a secret it
is our intention to proceed still further south where all conmunication with
the world will cease and therefore it is of the greatest importance for us to
have certain letters and private reports sent to europe you will most likely
be spoken on your trip home by some man of war or other naval vessel and
asked whether you have seen anything of us  that of course you must deny
more than that we cannot say

   iam perfectly well satisfied with your explanation the american re-
plied  i will nowr return to my ship and in half an hour you shall have the
decision  

   he rose and retired from the cabin with a low bow

   those remaining behind continued the discussion would it be wise to
intrust the correspondence to a total stranger suppose he thoughtlessly
spoke of the matter to some enemy 

    it would be better to send a reliable man along junker remarked
 and give him orders to carry the letters to their place of destination

    szemsky would be the right man smith suggested

   this proposition was generally approved szemsky every one knew
could be trusted and junker was therefore at once sent after him

    i am prepared to execute your orders and i feel proud of your confi-
dence in me he said when informed of what was desired of him

   soon all arrangements were satisfactorily made the crew of the
esperanza were very happy at earning such a large sum of money with so
little labor aud erik also was much pleased to feel that the matter was under
the care of as trustworthy a man as szemsky

   several hours were occupied in making preparations for the trip szemsky
was plentifully supplied with clothing of various kinds so that he could use a
the gold deluge

number of disguises mueller an experienced shoemaker assumed the task
of sewing the letters inside a pair of long leather boots so that no one could
find them szemsky was then presented with one hundred thousand pounds
in bank of england notes all above expenses to be for himself

   the esperanza set sail and took a northerly course while szemsky stood
at the helmsmans side waving a last greeting

    captain alsloev gave orders to fire three shots from the cannon as parting
salutes  then the chemeia also resumed her journey-in an opposite direction

     now for the south alsloev said to erik as they stood on the bridge

     yes go as far as the pole if we can reach there erik replied  our
only aim now is to attain a haven of security  

      then we must be prepared to be frozen in and ice bound for six months
or so the captain said

    so much the better we will remain at the pole one year and will
then turn about to see how the world has changed in the mean time

   rapidly the chemeia shot through the waves the distance between the 
two vessels was already so great that the esperanza seemed only to be a speck
on the distant horizon ice floes began to drift past the ship which how-
ever easily cut its way through them with her sharp steel prow in the dis-
tance mountains of snow of high altitude glimmered and large icebergs
glittered in the bright blinding glare of the sunlight

    calmly and joyfully the chemeia sailed  towards the polar summer

  chapter xiv-at the end op a year

   ready kelly called out and with brown calandro and peter
hastened back to the ship more than a nautical mile off they had with the
aid of red hot iron bars melted deep holes in the ice which they filled with
a mixture of powder and dynamite in this manner the chemeia had pene-
trated through the ice quite a stretch during the last few weeks towards the
north

   erik and his wife stood on the bridge looking toward the south where
one year of their lives had been passed in long needed and therefore doubly
welcome rest and peace the sun which had risen three months ago threw
its bright rays over the immense immeasurable ice fields which had again
frozen solidly behind them closing the path of water they had opened when
they left the quiet clear polar sea to return to the great restless world
which so irresistibly drew them back again

      how do you think matters there are now    efik asked thoughtfully
 with each foot that we approach nearer the old world i feel myself to be
more and more restless has everthing gone as was planned  did szem-
sky arrive safely and does the world know the great secret  i can find no
peace until i ascertain the true facts

    it is the same with me his wife replied  i cannot find sleep when i
think that perhaps we must resume the old restless life oh erik how happy
we have been this last year  it was so peaceful and beautiful on the quiet
islands where the air was so pure and sweet how grand it was in the
the gold deluge

i

woods of dwarf trees when the aurora australis flashed in the skies and the
sea lay before us smooth as a mirror  not one sound stirred the peace
not a bird sang the rare polar fish and the dumb seals were the only living
beings besides our party at such times one is so seriously impressed-it
carries one so far from all thoughts of strife we shall never forget the
country we ought never have left  

    you are right but we had to leave remember we return with a second
great discovery-that of the uninhabited islands of the polar regions where
never before human foot has touched what else has fate ordained me for 
i feel i am one of the few selected by it as men of destiny keep up your
courage dear wife  we must go onward no matter by which circuitous route
we reach our goal we must never despair 

            vl

                                                                   

   the open sea 

   a hoarse shout of joy from the entire crew greeted the narrow strip of
blue shimmering far on the horizon the ice now became so thin that the
chemeia could easily cut her way through with her sharp prow a few days
later they saw the sun sink for the first time since they had left civilized re-
gions the night or rather the twilight lasted only half an hour but it was
nevertheless proof that they were much farther north

   they intended to stop at montevideo to take in a new supply of coal and
food from south america they would proceed direct to europe

   a few minutes south of the polar circle the first whaler appeared the
chemeia sounded her whistle and lay to while the crew waved their caps

    have you potatoes   was kellys first question he was an irishman
and had missed these vegetables more than the others

    what do you wish   came back from the strange ship

   it was an argentine vessel and calandro had to be called to act as
interpreter

    have you potatoes   he asked

    yes they replied   some

    ask them how much a bushel kelly suggested

     how much a bushel    calandro called over

    ten pounds sterling

    great scott  kelly exclaimed  are they insane    ten pounds 
two hundred reichsmark mueller mumbled hundred and eighty
kronen for a bushel of potatoes   peter said and laughed loudly

   erik now appeared and showed great excitement

    ask them whether that is the regular price now and whether all other
articles have risen as much

   calandro obeyed

   ten pounds sterling was very cheap they said and that was the only
thing poor people could afford  everything was much dearer the world had
become so flooded with money during the last year that its value had sunk
to zero gold had no worth while real estate on the other hand had
bounded to enormous heights all all was due to the cursed englishmen
who were sending a perfect deluge of gold into the world no one could sur-


the gold deluge

mise how it was done the english navy was the largest in the world
larger than those of all other nations combined and they did as they pleased
-no other country dared oppose them russia had lost nearly all her
asiatic possessions to england and germany its african colonies china
had been conquered and was an english province and it was expected that
the same fate would soon meet every other country on the globe

   erik turned ghastly white the news stunned him

    one more question he tremblingly said  ask them where england
got all the gold

   who knows the argentinian replied there is no parliament
now the english government takes the money out of the clouds without
taxes or budgets they say they make their own gold this is probably
only talk others say they discovered a hill of solid gold in the heart of
africa higher than chimborazo and that very likely is also a fake do you
want potatoes or not  

   erik purchased several bushels and the sun was near the seas edge when
the ships parted far on the horizon a dark oblong mass appeared and
approached with great rapidity  it was too symmetrical and sharp edged for a
cloud bank while it seemed too enormous to be a vessel

   what in the mischief is that in the northwest captain alsloev
exclaimed

   the entire crew echoed his cry

    ask the whaler before he gets too far off-hurry   kelly called out to
calandro

   he formed a trumpet with his hands and called the question over to the
south american which had gained quite some headway

    an english man o war the reply came back

   consternation and fear spread over the features of all on board when
calandro had translated the reply

    then our friend the englishman has grown wonderfully since we shot
him in the eye kelly remarked

   erik and the captain whispered together hurriedly while the men looked
towards the vessel with frowning faces

   the sun sank and the darkness became denser the chemeia changed
her course and attempted to escape towards the east but suddenly the black
monster also changed her course and steamed in the same direction it
appeared to be under full steam and approached almost faster than a hurri-
cane and yet there was no smoke visible

    they use electricity alsloev whispered to erik

    yes i see erik replied with compressed lips

   suddenly the water on the starboard side of the chemeia began churning
ominously a queer object like a double cylinder came up to the ship with
incredible speed it was about twenty yards long and one third as broad
slowly it bobbed up and down still approaching gently touched the side of
the ship and then ran with such force against the platinized steel plates of
the bow that it seemed as if the ship was to be destroyed the crew uttered
a cry of terror
the gold deluge



   from this moment on the chemeia obeyed neither rudder nor propeller
as though she were glued to the double cylinder she was irresistibly drawn
towards the english man o war which now directed a blinding electric
searchlight on the doomed ship

     they have captured us with an electro magnet    alsloev exclaimed
 we are lost  

   erik said nothing he stared defiantly at the colossus the railing of
which seemed to be as high over the surface of the water as the top of a
church steeple

   when the reached the side of the monster ship a windlass creaked and
an officer who had descended ordered every one without exception to appear
on board of the war vessel	x

   silently all obeyed stepping on the platform sullenly ingroups of four

   when they had reached the deck a small man clad in a gorgeous uniform
approached and asked  who is the owner of that vessel 

   erik stepped forward

      is your name poulsen   

   yes my name is erik poulsen he replied and looked at the officer
scornfully

    in the name of his majesty the emperor of england i declare you my
prisoner   

chapter xv-englands insane prisoners

    where have you placed the new patient  asked dr richardson the
chief physician of the state insane asylum

    in no  doctor replied the orderly

     that will not do   the chief rejoined   he is a very dangerous patient
whom you must not lose sight of for one moment and in no case allow him
to come in contact with the other patients you must take him to no 
and guard him carefully when he walks in the courtyard or i shall hold you
strictly accountable

    very well chief  no  then the orderly said and vanished

    out here   he called to erik  here  

   erik rose and measured the man with a look of utter scorn and dis-
dain

    do you really believe i am insane  he asked  if you do you are
awfully mistaken he added when no reply came

   they all say that the orderly growled  no more dillydallying
now out-i say  

   he pushed erik before him towards the stairs until they reached the
upper floor there he shoved erik into a cell and locked the door

   erik found himself alone in a small room with padded walls and a bench
having rounded corners there was a small window placed high up on the
wall and secured with strong iron bars and the breaking of the surf on the
rocks told erik that he was in a cell facing the ocean

   with a deep sigh he sat on the bench and rested his head in his hands


the gold deluge

this then was the end of it all  the threat which the president of the
french republic had hinted was realized

   while he was incarcerated here-of course for life-or until he was old
and gray and perhaps really crazy a nation profited by his discovery and
subjugated all other nations  in fact placed the entire world under it as
vassals that was enough to set him crazy had the discovery only re-
mained his property-his very own-then he could still have hoped but
now

   slowly he rose and began pacing up and down his cell like an imprisoned
lion he raised himself on tiptoe and tried to get a glimpse of the sea but
it was futile only a small piece of the westerly sky reddened by the sink-
ing sun could be seen and he sank back discouraged on the bench once
more	

    he is a monomaniac and imagines he can make gold the orderly
explained to some one in the hall

   a short time afterwards the second physician a young man whose frank
friendly face would inspire confidence in anyone entered the cell felt eriks
pulse and examined him critically

    do you really believe me insane   erik inquired earnestly as he looked
the doctor squarely in the eye

   not a bit of it   the latter replied you are only a little nervous
and excited you need proper treatment-a few shower baths  then youll
be all right again  

    i have been confined here because i claimed i could make gold erik
ventured to test the physician  how now if it were really true that i
had made this discovery  as a physician you surely must have sufficient
knowledge of chemistry not to deny the possibility of such a discovery  

   i must confess that my knowledge of chemistry is limited to pharma-
cology and therefore i cannot form an opinion keep yourself very quiet
for a while try to get some sleep  read a little i brought you a few illus-
trated newspapers to look through and pass time pleasantly i will see you
again tomorrow until then good by

   before erik could say any more the door had closed on the doctor that
visit appeared to him like a ray of light in stygian darkness the physician
seemed to be honest and surely would not deny it if he knew erik was not
insane shower baths  the doctor certainly meant that erik determined
to test him further at his next visit

   time passed slowly twice each day erik was led forth into an open
courtyard for exercise under the watchful eye of a keeper the shower
bath followed and then confinement in his cell the young doctor saw him
daily for a week and the little chats with his patient grew more interesting
and longer until finally erik was gladdened by noticing that the physician
seemed to be worried and nonplussed as to what to think of his mental
condition

   one day he intimated that he would ask the chief physician to grant erik
the freedom of the prison corridors and rooms the next day and day after
however he did not appear the fourth day the chief physician appeared
the gold deluge



aud glanced casually at erik that was the last medical visit and thereafter
only the keeper came into contact with him

   months passed  autumn winter and spring followed each other and erik
fell into a condition of mental apathy from sheer monotony thinking was
of no benefit he found  his fate was sealed apparently  he was buried alive

   what had become of the others-of his wife  where was she  where

was his faithful crew were they free or- he dared not think

further

   at first he harbored thoughts of escape but the massive granite walls and
solid iron bars at the windows the sea rushing against the side of the
asylum and the lynx eyed guard-all this destroyed his hopes one
refuge remained for him-he dwelt in the land of his imagination-where
in his youth he had spent many hours in happy dreams of ambition
there he fouud freedom from his excruciating horrible thoughts over the
reality

   all day he heard distant screaming shouting and laughing emanating
from the other cells  it made him shudder he never saw the other inmates
except perhaps through a grated window or door very rarely he met a
keeper returning with some lunatic from his exercise

   this rare occurrence happened again one day early in june on going
out erik met a keeper followed by a prisoner in the asylum garb who held
his head low erik could not see his features until one step away and then
the man suddenly raised his head-their eyes met and both trembled violently
under the unexpected shock of recognition

   it was szemsky 

   their first involuntary impulse was to call loudly to each other but
thanks to their presence of mind neither betrayed the other as they passed
szemsky surreptitiously made a sign with his index finger indicating a ques-
tion erik whose nerves quivered with the intense strain and the terrible
import of that moment so fraught with meaning for both understood
szemskys meaning and behind the keepers back made a motion as though
writing in the air the number  

   had szemsky seen and understood 

   when erik reached his cell he sank on his couch and lay in awful
suspense deeply in thought

   what result would come from the recognition between szemsky and him-
self  would it open the way to freedom  probably not perhaps szemsky
was not so closely confined and guarded as erik and yet-the hopes that
seemed newly born in his breast soon died again

   where was szemsky perhaps in another wing of the building of
what benefit would it be for him to know the number of eriks cell  the
more he thought of the matter the more he became convinced that his posi-
tion was not one whit the better

   he paced his cell restlessly once more now and then casting a sad glance
at the high grated window outside the foam crested breakers sang their
eternal song of the sea-of life-of freedom  inside the cell life imprison-
ment-a living death 


the gold deluge

   see  what was that at the window  a bird  no only a small piece
of white paper carried there by the wind and clinging to the iron bars such
a small incident was an event in eriks life strange how it clung there 
soon it would blow away again

    erik looked at it closer it did not appear as though it would leave the
window  it seemed to rise a short distance fly outward and then return to
the same place  how strange  erik stepped close to discover the cause

   good heavens  what was it  the paper was suspended by a thread
no one but szemsky could have done that 

    erik tried desperately to secure the paper impossible  he could just
touch the iron bars with his finger tips he could not reach out what
was to be done  the blood throbbed aud hammered in his temples  he
looked around the cell in agony to find something to stand on the bench
was fastened securely to the wall

   suddenly an idea flashed through his mind he slipped softly to the
cell door to see whether he was observed and looked through the wicket
no one was in the corridor erik took off his clothing rapidly formed a
cushion on the floor near the window and stood thereon once-twice-he
reached and failed-the wind sent the paper fluttering from his eager grasp 
but at last he had it he untied it and fastened the end of the thread to the
grating ready for his reply he dressed hastily and devoured the precious
message with his eyes 

   treachery petterson captured by the british letters taken from
me am employed as assistant in the medicine shop answer-quick  
reply  how could he do so  he had nothing with which to write
szemsky must furnish him material with this but how was he to send the
first message 	i

    a story of a prisoner who allowed the nail on his index finger to grow
and then cut it into the shape of a pen came to eriks mind and ink
blood would do for that he now had a better idea rapidly he bit off a
sharp piece of one of his finger nails and in the paper sent by szemsky punc-
tured holes enough to form the words  send me pencil and paper

    he again quickly disrobed formed a cushion of his clothing as before
and then standing thereon fastened the paper to the thread

    erik tried to sleep but could not from excitement he slumbered uneasily
for but a few moments at a time and in his feverish dreams the little message
suspended in the air played pranks on him shortly before dawn he
into a restless sleep

    bright daylight permeated every corner of the cell when erik awoke he
looked towards the window  the paper was gone and in its place hung a
small packet in a moment he had drawn it into the cell and opened it a
short piece of pencil a few strips of paper and this message were inside 
could not reply before had to attend to press in medicine room  people
are watching me  i can walk alone in the corridors  not outside tried to
reach your door  could not guard is there flight impossible cliffs
all around us only exit through the large gateway which is always guarded
sz
the gold deluge



   erik was obliged to wait with his reply as the keeper was liable to appear
at any moment he hid his supply of paper between the floor and wall
padding where it was safe from discovery while exercising later in the
courtyard he looked for szemsky but could not see him perhaps he avoided
meeting him intentionally for fear of betrayal and thus destroying their
slender chances of escape

   erik found opportunity after breakfast to reply to szemskys note and
immediately sent the letter up by the thread half an hour later a new
message dangled before the cell window and this was repeated several times

    the subject of the letters was principally the location of the various divis-
ions of the institution the habits of those within it and like matters with
a view to assisting in their escape szemsky maintained that the only means
of exit was by the large gateway as from there only a road led down to the
shore while everywhere else jagged rocks and cliffs rose almost perpendicu-
larly from the sea besides all the windows faced the sea and were so
small that an ordinary man could not squeeze through even were there no
bars over the large doorway the storeroom was located in the floor of
which was a trap door through which the supplies for the asylum were
hoisted by means of a crane szemsky knew that this trap door was un-
locked and never bolted it would be easily opened their descent was
possible by means of a rope and tackle then the worst difficulty of all had
to be faced-the large gateway

   this was always kept carefully closed by means of a strong combination
lock to overpower the guard would be an easy matter but the combina-
tion  their only hope lay in forcing the guard to disclose it or to open the
gate himself if they failed in their first attempt at escape all hope must be
abandoned forever

   szemsky spoke of several men who had made efforts to gain their liberty
and were afterwards captured and walled in in their cells alive to starve
therefore to flee was taking their lives in their hands even should they
reach the outside of the prison successfully how were they to leave the
island  they must take their chances and rely on the help of providence

   szemsky had no difficulty in leaving his cell he stood well with the
keepers who considered him a harmless case and he was therefore permitted
to assist them in their work his cell door was only bolted at night from
the outside and that bolt he could easily throw back by means of a long nail
which he had hidden in his cell without the knowledge of the keepers but
erik-how was he to get out  his cell was not only bolted but locked as
well only one chance remained szemsky must take the keys from the
guard in the corridor where eriks cell was located on the night when the
escape was attempted

   erik had formed a plan of his own to further the matter he had noticed
that the keeper who was placed on duty friday evenings was very fond of
beer and that every time erik left part of his beer given him each day for
supper the keeper promptly drained the mug to the bottom if szemsky
could smuggle down a small quantity of morphine or better yet chloral from
the medicine room then the worst difficulty was overcome


the gold deluge

   on a thursday early in july when the exchange of letters had been car-
ried on about one month erik sent the following message to szemsky 

    friday night  a m send me a few grains of chloral hydrate and
if possible a vial of chloroform courage friend  provide yourself also
with chloroform  

chapter xvi-the explosion

   friday evening  erik ate his supper closely observed by his keeper
who glanced with longing eyes at the beer mug

   would he never go yes at last he stepped outside a few moments

   quick as lightning erik drew forth from its hiding place behind the wall
padding a small paper package and from it dropped several grains of a
colorless crystal into his mug where they immediately dissolved

   good he thought glad i got chloral he will never taste nor
smell that morphine would have tickled his nostrils

   a moment later the keeper returned his eyes brightened with joy when
he noticed that the mug was still half full of beer he immediately placed
it to his lips and drained it off at one draught he tottered out of the cell
with the plate aud the mug in his hand locking the cell door behind him
erik ran to the little wicket and saw him stagger fumble around in the air
with the hand in which he held the mug and plate then suddenly make
tracks for a settee in a window niche on the opposite side of the corridor
where his head fell over on his arms and he lay in helpless stupor

   erik remained there with eyes riveted to the opening listening and watch-
ing suppose some one came and discovered the sleeping keeper  at each
sound he shrank together no one appeared however and the chloral did
its work undisturbed

   less than the maximum dose he certainly did not ge erik mumbled
to himself  i only hope he will not snore too loud

   the clock in the tower struck twelve the half hour struck then one
in the morning but not a sound in the corridor-what was that  did the
clock strike again  half past one  and no szemsky  nothing-not a sus-
picion of an approaching step-it was awful  finally and szemsky at last 

   a subdued exclamation and a hearty handshake followed and szemsky
by a sign commanded silence

   noiselessly like indians on the warpath both now crept in their stock-
ing feet along the corridor up the steps near by to the next floor where
was located the storeroom pst  a guard wralks with heavy step-a strong
broad shouldered giant will their plan succeed 

   szemsky motioned silently to erik to remain standing where he was 
then took a sponge from his pocket uncorked a small vial and a sweet
pungent odor permeated the atmosphere

   szemsky saturated the sponge and watched the guard for a favorable
moment for attack he approached them and then turned around without
having noticed them he came and turned again-now -his back was
towards them
the gold deluge



   with one wild leap szemsky sprang on him a short sharp struggle
followed then feeble resistance and faint moaning-the chloroform had
done its work the keeper tried faintly to tear the sponge from his nose-
it seemed for a moment as though he would succeed but suddenly strong
giant though he was he sank back helpless szemsky caught him and care-
fully laid him at full length on the dark side of the corridor floor he pressed
the sponge over the fellows nose and signaled to erik to proceed

   suddenly both were startled by a sound the keeper whom erik had
stupefied began singing a lively ribald song from the london streets
louder and louder his voice rose on the still night air awakening the crazy
inmates one by one very soon he was accompanied by a chorus of crazy
voices until pandemonium reigned erik was the first to regain his courage
and explained in a whisper to szemsky that it was not unusual for people in
such a stupor to begin singing

   the stupefied keeper sang louder and louder each moment from one
tune he went to another until it seemed as though the full program of a low
class music hall was to be rendered

   at last  they had reached the storeroom once inside erik bolted the
door which luckily they had found open

   day began dawning and they could indistinctly see objects about them
there before them was the trap door szemsky lifted the cover with all
his strength thank god  it was not bolted time was precious the
drunken keeper and his chorus of lunatics still howled madly and must soon
attract the night guard szemsky was the first to descend into the well or
dark opening erik was just about following him when szemsky clambered
back hastily all out of breath and panted excitedly 

     back  the keeper of the gateway is not there  we cannot open the
door ourselves  we must get back to our cells quickly before we are discov-
ered  they must not know that we ever left

   in desperation both sat there pondering over a means of escape szemsky
stared before him vacantly in mute despair soon their captors would be
upon them and then-they would be walled in alive 

   erik looked about him dazed and bewildered what was to be done 
helplessly he glanced at the objects around him-nothing but sacks cases
carboys of acid for the drug department and several iron cylinders containing
fluid carbonic acid

   absent mindedly he gazed at the labels on the various casks and bales
when suddenly he sprang to his feet

   szemsky he cried roughly shaking his comrade by the shoulder

  i have it -we will burst the gate open with a blast   

    burst blast  szemsky repeated mechanically 

  yes-quick erik now commanded here-glycerin-there-is
a carboy of nitric acid  we will make enough nitroglycerin to blow in the
whole place  

    nitroglycerin   szemsky ejaculated and shuddered

    empty this jar on the floor   erik continued nervously  it is only
distilled wtater here is nitric acid and there glycerin and phosphoric acid

                                                                                                                   j


the gold deluge

fill the jar half full but be careful it means life or death pour in only a
small quantity at a time and watch it the acid must cool before we pour on
the glycerin roll one of those carbonic acid cylinders over here  

   in a few moments a dangerous quantity of nitroglycerin was prepared and
erik looked around him for a suitable receptacle his eyes fell on one of the
cast iron jugs used for shipping quicksilver it was empty and hastily
though carefully the thickly flowing nitroglycerin mixture was poured in

   now erik directed we must freeze the stuff otherwise it will not
explode when we drop it that will not take much time-the fluid carbonic
acid will congeal the nitroglycerin in a few seconds  

   quickly he opened the faucet of the carbonic acid cylinder and imme-
diately the chalky white carbonic acid flowed over the iron jug containing
the nitroglycerin where it formed a flaky snow-like substance

    good   erik chuckled  now to fasten the bomb to the block and
tackle and then-to drop it down below stop  not yet we will also be
blown to atoms we must attach a long rope so we can go to some distance
when we are at the other end of the corridor we will raise and then drop it

   szemsky found a long sound rope strong enough to draw up the heavy
iron bomb without breaking this was run through the pulley one end
fastened to the charge of nitroglycerin and with the other end in szemskys
hand both quickly left the storeroom and hastened towards the end of the
corridor playing out the rope as they went

   the keeper still sang his maudlin song a quarter-perhaps half an hour
had elapsed since he was drugged-but what did erik and his comrade care
about time now  they had reached the center of the long corridor and the
end of the rope szemsky held both at the same time when szemsky pointed
aheadof him ghastly pale ten men of the night guard approached
attracted by the noisy singing of the unconscious keeper and his crazy chorus
they immediately espied the fugitives and made a concerted rush at them

   lost   szemsky groaned and tottered back his hands pressing his
feverish temples

    eet go the rope   erik roared and unconsciously szemsky obeyed

   that instant a blinding flash of fire poured into every window facing that
side and turned the growing dusk into a frightful glare an awful deafen-
ing crash followed simultaneously and the terrible shock threw both fugi-
tives violently to the ground the massive building shook and tottered-
the ceilings fell with a deafening roar and a blinding white dust almost suffo-
cated every living being in the doomed place

   in every corner the huge structure quaked and trembled  the floors
rocked like the deck of a vessel at sea-in a storm the cell doors barred
and locked were all burst open and in a stream the mad prisoners rushed
out another crash-another shock-and a perfect rain of falling masonry
followed hark  the drunken keeper still sings his weird song undis-
turbed

   both fugitives sank down unconscious

                                                         otto m moeller

synopsis of chapters previously published

   guy chutney an officer in the british army on his way back to service in india is asked
to stop off at aden and take important despatched to sir arthur ashby governor of zaila on the
african coast en route tlie steamer touches at berbera where the great annual fair is being
held here chutney rescues from death makar makalo by shooting a leopard whose slumbers
the arab had unwittingly disturbed and a few minutes later he meets an old friend melton
forbes foreign correspondent of an english newspaper suspecting that there is treachery
in the wind forbes sends his native servant momba through the town to investigate who soon
after returns pursued by a mob of somali warriors it appears that manuel torres a portuguese
fellow passenger of guy on the aden steamer and whom he suspects of reading his des-
patches has brought rifles to makar makalo who is instituting rebellion against the english on
behalf of rao khan emir of harar

   melton with his servant accompanies guy to zaila and at the residency they find sir arthur
drinking champagne with colonel carrington their report carries consternation to the breast
of the governor who thinks of seeking safety on board the steamer but it is too late  the
arabs are already swarming about the place the englishmen are all made prisoners and doomed
by makar makalo to be sent as slaves to the somalis of the galla country during the journey
the prisoners are separated through makalos agency guy and melton being carried by the
arabs to rao khan but the people of harar in their hatred of the english demand that they
be executed at once and the emir is forced to promise that they shall be sent to the block in
four days time meantime they are waited upon in their cell melton having been wounded
by canaris a greek who has been a favored captive of the emir for two years he shows them
a document given him by an aged englishman who had died in the prison and which tells of
an underground river in the neighborhood which promises them all escape if they might only
procure the money with which to make a few preparations guy has some in a belt which has
been fortunately overlooked and  an appointed night they overpower the guards and start

   they finally reach the entrance to the underground river-guided to it by a fleeing galla who
makes his escape thereby from a party of abyssinians but their provisions have been exhausted
and they know not what to do until in one of their night exploring trips they capture two stray
camels which inspire chutney with an idea which may mean the rescue of their friends from
the gallas near whose camp they now know themselves to be staining their faces to make
themselves pass as portuguese he and canaris ride in among the gallas declare that they have
been sent from zaila by makar makalo who is hard pressed by the british and that the latter
will only withdraw on condition that the governor of the town and his friends who have been
sold into slavery be delivered up to these messengers with provisions enough to last them on
the return journey to zaila the matter is still under consideration when oko sam suddenly
appears upon the scene

chapter xx-by a hairs breadth

a nervous shiver passed through guy as he recognized the repulsive
face of his- old enemy and instinctively he pulled his burnous closer
around his head oko sam darted a curious glance at the two motionless

                     mailed to any address on receipt of  cents


the river of darkness

figures on the camels and then advanced to meet the head man who broke off
the conference and greeted his newly arrived chief in a most servile manner

    dont despair whispered guy   those infernal abyssinians have be-
come drunk and allowed their captive to slip away just at this critical time
but all may go well yet

   it took but a short time to make oko sam acquainted with the facts of
the case he strode up to the camels and gazed long and haughtily at the
two strangers then apparently satisfied -with his scrutiny he addressed a
few words to the wizened arab and turning to his people jabbered away
volubly for two or three minutes when he ceased half a dozen men started
off in different directions aud the interpreter proceeded to communicate the
decision to guy who in spite of his calm bearing was greatly agitated

    oko sam say yes began the arab  he friend of makar makalo 
he no want makar lose zaila  he give plenty food for journey  he give six
ten twenty men go long so bring back much gift from makar you say
makar give much hey  

   yes replied guy repressing with difficulty his extreme joy  makar
will give big rewards to oko sam

    the arab turned aside with a grunt of satisfaction as half a dozen natives
came up bearing leathern sacks of provisions which were handed up one at
a time to guy and canaris and slung across the necks of their camels

   this proceeding was barely over when to guys amazement aud disgust
a band of gallas fully armed and bearing each a supply of food strapped on
their backs advanced into the open space	

   this was oko sams promised escort instead of two men there were
twenty

   these good fellows here go long said the arab they no have
camels  they go on foot one days journey then reach other tribe where find
plenty camel

   this statement relieved guy considerably it would not be so difficult
after all to get rid of the troublesome escort if they were on foot

   and now came the crisis at a signal from oko sam the guards about
the hut flung open the entrance and in a moment two emaciated half starved
figures wrere led forth whom it was actually difficult to recognize as the
pompous sir arthur ashby and brave colonel carrington

   they still wore their uniforms but the cloth hung in folds about their
shrunken limbs and their faces were pitifully thin and distressed

   guys heart beat fast with indignation as he gazed  this melancholy
sight and then he purposely half turned his face away lest the prisoners
should recognize him and unconsciously cause the failure of the whole plan

   the people drew back as the little group reached the camels the two
englishmen were lifted up behind the supposed portuguese-sir arthur
with canaris the colonel beside chutney-and so weak and helpless were
they that it was necessary to partially strap them in their places

   all was now ready guy and canaris were prepared to start the pris-
oners were in their possession and the armed escort were exchanging fare-
wells with their comrades
the river of darkness

   at this supreme moment when the fullest success seemed assured a
startling diversion occurred

   a big arab a new arrival evidently pushed his way forward and as
his glance fell on the greek he started with surprise and exclaimed aloud
 canaris 

   with wonderful self possession the greek looked at him in mute igno-
rance  but the arab who had probably but just come from harar pressed for-
ward and joining oko sam a few paces away began to talk excitedly in a
low voice

    we are lost chutney whispered canaris in tones of despair

   at the mention of this name guy felt the colonels arms clasp his waist
in a convulsive thrill

    not a sound colonel carrington he muttered under his breath  as
you value your freedom

   the tightened grasp instantly relaxed and guy turned his head slightly
to obtain a clearer view of oko sam

   this action hastened the climax for his burnous caught on the button
of colonel carringtons coat and fell to the ground a glaring torch passing
at the moment completed the catastrophe and the keen eyed galla chief
uttered a howl of rage and amazement as he recognized his old enemy of the
market place at berbera

   never did captain chutneys quick wits do him a better service than at
that moment

   in one glance he took in thp whole situation the astounded chief and his
counselors the swarthy mass of savages ready for instant action the armed
escort that stood between him and the edge of the encampment

   more speedily than words can tell it his determination was reached
with a warning cry to canaris a hasty injunction to colonel carrington
to hold fast he snatched a short dagger from his waist and plunged it an
inch or more into the flank of the greeks camel and then into that of his
own animal

   the frightened and agonized beasts pranced madly for a second or two
and then plunged desperately forward trampling the amazed guards right
and left

   it was over in a moment a howl from the infuriated chief a terrific up-
roar from the vast throng and then spurred to greater efforts by the tumult
in their ears the valiant camels thundered out into the desert heedless of
the scattered rifle fire the volley of whizzing spears with tremendous
strides they bore their precious burdens toward safety and freedom while
the silence of the african night was rent by the venomous cries of their
bloodthirsty pursuers

   for the moment they were safe but in that long four mile race that lay
ahead many perils might be encountered and it was even within the realm
of possibilities that the fleet footed gallas would overtake the heavily
burdened camels

   it was no time for conversation or explanation a fervent   thank
god   burst from colonel carringtons lips as he realized that he had fallen


the river of darkness

into the hands of friends while sir arthur feebly beginning to comprehend
what had happened ejaculated several times  bless my soul as he clung
with might and main to the greeks waist

   faster and faster tljey sped over the plain until the tumult behind them
was lost in the muffled tramp of the camels hoofs they rode side by side
with arms ready for instant use but no foe appeared iu front or behind and
at last with a glad cry canaris pointed to the distant gleam of the abys-
sinian camp

   we are safe now exclaimed guy the gallas feared to pursue
us any further lest their anticipated attack on the abyssinians should be
spoiled 

    yes replied canaris  either that or they have circled round hoping
to cut us off at yonder gap in the mountains wrhere the road breaks through
to the coast and now the rock must be close by ha  what does that
mean   

   bang  went a rifle shot directly ahead and a brief red flash pierced the
gloom

   it is forbes cried chutney he is in danger quick quick
to the rescue

   a loud shout followed closely on the heels of the report and recognizing
meltons voice guy lost to all sense of prudence cried aloud 

    dont give in forbes  we are coming

   an answering hail came distinctly back followed immediately by a second
shot

   the agony of suspense was brief a moment later the rock loomed into
view and the panting camels came to a halt before the entrance to the
cavern

   oh youve come back safe exclaimed melton coolly as he came
forward with a smoking rifle in his hand  ive had a brush with a party
of abyssiuians they were hunting their camels i suppose and took me

by surprise i dropped one of the rascals and- look out  there they

are again

   all dodged to the ground as a shower of spears fell about the rock with
a hollow groan one of the camels dropped heavily over pierced in the throat
by a short spear and his huge bulk formed a natural barrier before the
cavern meltons rifle cracked sharply and a howl of pain attested the
accuracy of his aim

    into the cavern all of you cried guy  the abyssinians are coming
in force  the firing has attracted them to the spot

   already a shadowy mass was visible some thirty yards off and the sound
of voices was distinctly heard

   the greek hastily motioned sir arthur and the colonel into the cavern
and hurriedly tossed in the provisions bag by bag

   the enemy were now quite close and as canaris stowed away the last bag
they came on with a wild rush

   from behind the dead camel guy and melton poured in a hot fire that
checked their impetuous advance instantly and before they could rally for
the river of darkness



another charge both had bolted into the gloomy hole and the stone was
deftly rolled into place

chapter xxi-cut off from the outer earth

                        

   the lamp was lit instantly and without a moments delay guy led the
party at full speed down the corridor until the descent was reached

    now hurry down all of you he cried  you have a flask of powder
about you canaris give it to me

    what are you going to do chutney   asked melton in alarm

    put an end to all pursuit was the stern reply  and seizing the flask
he placed it on the ground and pouring a little powder on a strip of linen
torn from the lining of his blouse he deftly rolled a fuse and inserted one
end in the mouth of the flask

   his intentions were apparent the roof and walls of the passage were
of loose earth and stone a blast would bring down an avalanche

   canaris attempted to expostulate but guy drove them all down the slope
aud applied a match to the fuse

   it was high time for up the passage shone the gleam of torches the
enemy had effected an entrance

   guy joined his companions on the shore of the river and almost instantly
a terrific explosion took place it seemed to rend the earth a tremendous
crash and rumbling noise followed and then all was quiet

   the concussion put out the lamp but as soon as it was lighted again guy
ran up to see the result of his attempt

no trace of the passageway existed in its place was a grim wall of earth

   the full significance of what he had done now flashed into guys mind
and he gazed blankly into the faces of his comrades

    we are buried alive said melton bitterly  we are as dead to the
world as though we were in our coffins  

   we have simply burned our ships behind us that is all replied
chutney  now for the river and freedom

   they went back and sat down beside the swiftly flowing water

   bless me if i know whether i am on my head or my feet said sir
arthur   what on earth does this mean   

    it means that these brave fellows have saved us from a fate worse
than death cried the colonel   that is all i care to know at present

    i will explain all said guy

   he straightway related everything that had happened from the time they
were separated on the way to harar to the discovery of the underground
river and the daring plan for the rescue of the prisoners

   the colonel could scarcely repress his astonishment as he listened to the
wonderful story and at its conclusion he embraced his rescuer warmly

    we owe ou our lives he said fervently  never was a braver deed
attempted never was a rescue more marvelously carried out ah i can
never repay the debt a grateful country shall reward you captain chutney
england shall know of your heroism


the river of darkness

     yes you are right colonel put in sir arthur with a touch of his old
pomposity    the government shall know how its representative was deliv-
ered from the hands of these impious fiends but bless me i dont see that
we are so much better off after all how are we going to get out of this
beastly hole   

    and what has become of momba and captain waller and the hin-
doos    exclaimed forbes who had suddenly recollected the missing mem-
bers of the party

   lost-all lost replied the colonel sadly they were sold to a dis-
tant tribe in the interior two days after we arrived at the village you see
our condition they have made us work from sunrise to sunset we fell
ill and being of use no longer they deliberately tried to starve us to death
it was horrible horrible  

   it was a diabolical outrage interrupted sir arthur  the whole
civilized world will shudder when it knows that the governor of zaila was
fed on tainted meat and spoilt rice and very little of that too if england
fails to resent this outrage ill cast off my allegiance to the crown sir and
become a citizen of some other country i will by jove  

   sir arthur might have gone on indefinitely with the tale of his griev-
ances but guy cut it short by calling general attention to their present grave
situation

   the supply of provisions was at once overhauled and the inspection
proved very satisfactory

   six large bags had been loaded on the camels two of these held-jerked
beef probably buffalo or deer meat one contained rice another a peculiar
kind of hard cakes made from native corn and the remaining two were
filled to the top with dates and figs

    we are assured of food for some time to come said guy   that is
one consolation i wish i could feel as certain of light we have two
lamps and to supply these two big flasks of palm oil not nearly enough
however to last us on a long journey when that is gone i dont know
what we shall do  

    when we stop for rest we shall have to do without light suggested
melton  if we find any places to stop he added

     its beastly chilly in here observed sir arthur with a shiver  two
days in a hole like this will give us all the rheumatism  

    ah said canaris  but i have provided for that see here are the
trappings from the camels which were brought along in with us   and he
held up one by one half a dozen richly embroidered rugs and skins which
had belonged to the leaders of the abyssinians

    this pleasing discovery put them all in better spirits and it was presently
supplemented by another which went far to remove the most formidable
obstacle to their journey for while the canoes were being examined guy
found in a far corner of the cavern a great pile of torches made from some
highly resinous wood these had evidently belonged to the natives who
formerly dwelt here and were used by them instead of lamps on their jour-
neys to the coast they were fifty or sixty in number
the rtver of darkness



    this is a fortunate discovery said guy  with these and the lamps
we may have sufficient light to last out our trip

    yes  that removes the last obstacle rejoined forbes   and now i
propose that we take some refreshment we have eaten nothing for nearly
two days  

   this was true the excitement had almost banished hunger from their
thoughts but meltons words roused their dormant appetites and sitting
down beside the canoes they made a hearty meal and washed it down with
water from the river which was exceedingly sweet and cold

   well said guy when they had all finished and the provisions were
tied up and put aside  it will do us no good to remain here any longer
the river as you all know is our only salvation and the sooner we start 
our cruise the better the natives who once dwelt here are reported to
have made journeys down this stream in boats is it not so canaris  

   yes replied the greek i have heard from the arabs at harar
that it was their annual custom to go down to the coast in large rafts or boats
with trading goods and then return by land

   but where does this underground river empty asked the colonel

 does any one know   

   it is supposed to reach the juba replied guy  but whether near the
mouth of that river or not i cannot say

    ah  but that is a very important thing said the colonel  i possess
some acquaintance with the geography of this part of africa are you
aware that the river juba is nearly eight hundred miles in length  its
source which as yet remains undiscovered lies only a hundred miles or more
to our west aad it flows to the southeast this stream before us appears to
head in a southwesterly direction as near as i can judge it is possible then
that it joins the river juba at a distance less than two liuudred miles from
here in that event our journey does not appear so formidable

    pardon me sir said canaris quickly  but from what i have been
able to learn this river reaches the juba at a point i have heard stated mid-
way between bardera and the coast

    bardera   cried the colonel sharply why bardera is only two
hundred miles from the sea according to that we have a journey before
us of nearly eight hundred miles-a journey underground and on unknown
waters who can tell what dangers lie before us  

    we will never get out alive groaned sir arthur  never in the
world carrington what a blawsted idiot i was to let the government send
me to that beastly hole   

    and is it impossible to escape by land   asked the colonel unheeding
this interruption

    you forget that we have destroyed our only communication with the
outer world ventured forbes  the river is our sole hope

    yes i had forgotten it it is true replied the colonel

   and were the communication now open exclaimed guy escape
would still be hopeless this river is navigable and the existence of those
canoes proves what i say i have been in tighter places than this before and if


the river of darkness

you will trust to my guidance i will do my best to bring you through in
safety if we fail it shall be through no fault of mine

chapter xxii-an unwelcome visitor

    guys stirring speech was just what was needed to rouse the flagging spirits
of the party for the colonels graphic description of the contemplated journey
had produced a very depressing effect

   preparations for the start were begun at once the two canoes were
first tested and found to be absolutely seaworthy then the provisions
the torches the lamps the oil flasks and the rugs were divided into two
parts aud stowed away

   it was decided that guy should be accompanied by forbes aud sir arthur
in the first boat and that canaris and the colonel should follow in the second
for economy one torch was to be used for illuminating their way the torch
sir arthur was to hold in the rear of the canoe eight paddles had been
found in the cavern thus providing an extra supply in case of possible loss

   it was difficult to believe that the sun was shining brightly outside no
ray of light pierced the blackness of the cavern and the dead silence was un-
broken by the faintest sound though at that very moment the gallas and
the abyssinians were probably waging a bloody battle almost overhead
henceforth day and night wrere one all trace of time would be lost and
whether any of that imprisoned band would ever see the light of day again
or breathe the free open air the future alone could tell

   it was a solemn and impressive moment and guys voice had a touch of
huskiness in it as he ordered the canoes to be carried to the water

   a last survey of the cavern was made to see that nothing was forgotten
and then all took their places in silence the canoes swung slowly out from
shore and caught by the current shot off into the gloom on the first stage
of the most awful journey ever made by living men

   guy sat slightly in front of the stern keeping the canoe straight with an
occasional touch of the paddle for the velocity of the current made labor un-
necessary aud close behind him was sir arthur holding the flaring torch
that lit up the water for a short distance ahead and served to guide the second
canoe which was only a few yards in the rear

    if this current continues all the vtay observed forbes  eight hundred
miles will be nothing at all

    yes if no bad rapids are in the road replied guy  there are cer-
tainly none very near or we could hear them plainly

    i dont think we need fear that very much called out the colonel
from the rear canoe   the altitude of this part of africa is not so high
above the sea the valley overhead is a pretty deep one and the river is
some distance beneath that yet moreover those natives would hardly
have made an annual cruise down the river if the channel was very
dangerous  

    it was their custom to start at the close of the rainy season said the
greek  when the river was high and swollen
the river of darkness



    dont mention rapids i beg of you cried sir arthur  it makes me
nervous i cant stand it at all

   for an hour or more they traveled on in almost unbroken silence
on either side the shore was invisible and overhead the glare of the
torch revealed only black empty space the same intense silence pre-
vailed not even the faintest murmur of the river being audible

   this peaceful monotony however was rudely shattered a low hum-
ming sound was heard in the distance which rapidly increased in volume
and left no room to doubt that a course of rapids was below at guys sug-
gestion forbes relieved sir arthur of the torch and scarcely had this change
been effected when the current carried them into a swirling mass of spray

   both canoes grated and bumped against rocks and then before the
frightened occupants could realize that it was over the sullen roar was
fading away in the distance and the smooth current was bearing them rap-
idly ahead

   this little episode considerably relieved their minds if no more
dangerous water than that lay before them there was little cause for appre-
hension a skilled eye and a strong hand would overcome the difficulty

   presently for the first time rocky walls appeared now on one side now
on the other but they fell sheer to the water and gave no opportunity of
landing the atmosphere of the cavern was pure and fresh a fact not
readily accounted for since no glimmer of daylight was anywhere visible

   guy- began to grow sleepy a sensation which was shared by his compan-
ions for it was many hours since they had had any rest it was impossible
to tell how long or how far they had traveled all passage of time was lost
and the periods for eating and sleeping must be regulated entirely by their
own feelings instinct rarely goes wrong in such cases and there was little
doubt that the night had come

   a sharp lookout was kept on the shores but as the current swept them
past the same monotonous ledges without a break it began to look as though
they would be compelled to take turns at sleeping in the bottom of the canoes

   they were paddling close along the right shore when a sudden cry from
canaris who was almost abreast of the other boat and farther out in the
current attracted general attention and peering out on the river they saw a
dim object some yards awaj

   the current bore them past it but by dint of hard paddling the canoes
were headed diagonally up stream and a few moments later a landingwas
made on the lower end of a small spit of white sand ten or fifteen yards in
diameter

   it sloped gently to the waters edge and in the center was a cluster of
smooth water worn stones

   it was a perfect haven of refuge to the weary and exhausted voyagers
and with thankful hearts they hauled the canoes upon the strip of beach and
spread out the rugs in readiness for a few hours sleep

   they ate sparingly of crackers and dates for guy had assumed charge of
the commissary department and dispensed supplies with no liberal hand the
wisdom of which was readily acknowledged by all


the river of darkness

   the torch had been stuck end up in the sand and its cheerful glow threw
a radiance over all the little island aud caused the silvery white sand to
sparkle brilliantly

   they stretched themselves out on the rugs near the center of the island
and as soon as they were arranged comfortably guy rigorously extinguished
the torch and hunted his place in the darkness

   no thought of fear entered their minds on all sides was the deep and
rapid river from whence could an enemy come  in five minutes not a
man was awake even sir arthur was snoring profoundly dreaming per-
haps of the snug quarters in the residence at zaila from which he had been so
rudely ousted a few short weeks before

   guy was dreamiug too but far different were the visions that coursed
through his brain for the twentieth time he was living over again his
awful experiences of the previous year once more he was a prisoner in the
rajahs fortress and nana sahibs cannons were awaiting their victim on the
massive stone platform now he was being led out to die in the midst of his
companions the fiendish faces all about him the hindoos stood by the touch
holes with lighted torches now they were binding him the gaping muzzle
was pressing his back-

   then he woke and sat up trembling from head to foot the dank perspi-
ration standing in beads on his forehead thank god it wras only a dream
the rajahs fortress was thousands of miles away

   suddenly a faint sound reached his ear so indistinct that he could hardly
be sure he heard anything at all he listened a moment but it was not
repeated

     some of the fellows stirring in their sleep he muttered and giving the
matter no further thought he lay down again

   but as soon as his head touched the sand the sound was iepeated and this
time it was more definable-a steady rustling noise with an occasional low
splash that seemed to come from the water

   it was caused by none of his companions for they all lay on his left while
the alarming noise seemed to come from the right

   guy was a brave man but in his nervous condition resulting from the
recent dream this new alarm was too much and he felt a cold chill run down
his spine

   giving forbes wdio was next him a gentle shake he drew himself to his
feet and taking a match from his pocket rubbed it with a trembling hand
across the front of his trousers

   it struck fire instantly and as the sudden flare lit up the whole extent of
the island the match dropped from guys nerveless fingers and he started back
with a cry of horror that echoed horribly through the gloomy recesses of the
cavern

chapter xxiii-a wonderful escape

   guy had presence of mind enough to strike a second match and ignite the
torch which was fortunately within reach of his hand and as his companions
the river of darkness



roused from their sleep by his sharp cry of alarm sprang excitedly to their
feet the flaming glare revealed to their astonished gaze a monstrous serpent
coiled half on land half in the water at the edge of the island

   the flat ugly head with its wicked eyes was darting angrily to and fro
and the bodr was as thick as a mans leg above the knee

    great csesar its asea serpent   cried forbes making a dash for his
rifle while sir arthur with a dismal groan dropped down on his knees and
had to be dragged forcibly away by the colonel

   the glare of the torch seemed to anger the monster for it advanced a
yard or more up the island and spattered the water furiously with its great
tail

   a general rush was made for the canoes and it would have been no diffi-
cult matter to have slipped quickly away and left the hideous monster in
undisputed possession of the island

   unluckily forbes was bent on resistance he seized his rifle made sure
that it was ready for use and started forward just as guy hurried to his
assistance

    come away melton he cried  it will only make things worse if you
wound it

    but i dont intend to wound it replied melton  tin going to put
a ball through that ugly head stand back chutney  stand back

   as he spoke he advanced recklessly until the muzzle of his rifle wras
within two feet of the serpents head and taking a quick aim pulled the
trigger

   the stunning report shook the cavern and as forbes turned to flee the
enraged monster with blood streaming from a hole in his neck threw his
slimy coils forward in convulsions of agony and before the eyes of his horri-
fied companions melton was pinned to the ground

   he struggled to his knees fighting desperately to loosen the tightening
coils and uttering heartrending appeals for help

   then with a mighty hiss the serpent flapped wildly toward the water
dragging his victim with him and with a terrific splash and a resounding
slap of the great tail on the moist sand both disappeared in the gloom

   with a terrible cry guy ran to the waters edge and shouted again aud
again

   no response came back the black river flowed as smoothly and calmly
as before

    lost  lost he cried hoarsely and staggering backward he fell
heavily on the sand

   the colonel ran to his assistance and at that moment a single cry came
distinctly from a point below the island

    listen   exclaimed canaris  what is that  

    help  help   rang mournfully through the recesses of the cavern

   it was meltons voice surely and the familiar tones reached guys ears
and brought him to his feet in an instant

    its forbes   he shouted wildly  the canoe quick and snatching
the heavy craft he fairly threw it into the river and sprang in
lo

the river of darkness

    canaris leaped after him and seizing paddles they drove the canoe swiftly
toward the distant sound

    we are coming melton we are coming cried guy well save
you yet

    in their haste the lighted torch had been left behind but fortunately the
greek had matches and in an instant another torch was lit and flaring cheer-
fully over the water

    this way chutney came a feeble voice below them hurry up
im nearly exhausted

    a few rapid strokes of the paddle brought them within sight of a strug-
gling object on the surface of the water and as the canoe ran skillfully along-
side guy dropped his paddle and leaning out seized the drowning man by
the collar with almost superhuman strength he dragged him into the canoe
without assistance

    thank god   he cried  hes safe speak to me forbes are you
hurt

    but melton lay white and helpless in the bottom of the boat too exhausted
to reply

   hes all right said canaris dont make him talk take your
paddle chutney well have a struggle to make the island

   the greek was right far above them shone the flickering torch and
the current was bearing them further away

   i cant paddle and hold the torch at the same time said canaris
 we must be guided by the light on the island

    and they bent to the paddles with a will shouting from time to time to
encourage the colonel and sir arthur it was even a harder task than they
had feared-to force the canoe through that fierce rush of water and for a
time it seemed as though they were losing instead of gaining ground

    but at last the distant light grew brighter and soon their friends could be
seen standing on the edge of the island

    ten minutes more labor brought the canoe to the small eddy behind the
island and then the colonel hauled it gently upon the sand they climbed
wearily out and bore melton tenderly up the slope his clothes were foul
and slimy from the serpents embrace but he did not seem to be injured

    a few drops of stimulant would have had a good effect but as this was
out of the question they did the next best thing under the circumstances
his wet clothes were stripped off and wrung out then he was wrapped
snugly in three or four big rugs and laid in one of the canoes which was
emptied for the purpose this heoric treatment had a speedy effect and the
patient much to the relief of all recovered from his prostration and insisted
on sitting up

     no i dont think im hurt he said in response to guys inquiries

  it was the closest shave i ever had in my life though you may imagine
how i felt when the monster dragged me into the river i gave myself up
for lost at once he dived straight down and then shot through the water
like a streak one coil was still around my body and hard as i struggled i
couldnt tear loose my ears began to sing and i knew i would have to
the river of darkness

ir

drown then i felt the coil grow a little looser and with one desperate
struggle i tore away and came to the top the first thing i saw was the
light away up on the island and i shouted for help as loud as i could i
was terribly afraid you would not hear me and all the time i was growing
weaker and weaker and the current was dragging me farther and farther
away then i saw your torch almost beside me and that is all i remember
i would have gone to the bottom in another minute i know it was horrible
chutney it makes me faint to think of it and melton closed his eyes
with a little shudder

    there were tears in the eyes of all as they listened to this marvelous story
of his escape and a sterner realization came to them of the unknown and
unseen dangers that encompassed them

   further sleep was out of the question aud yet they could not well leave
the island until meltons clothes were partially dry

    suppose we try some fishing suggested guy  i have lines and we
can bait the hooks with bits of dried meat  

    that would be au agreeable change in our bill of fare said the colonel

  i second the motion  

    gentlemen i beg of you dont harass my feelings by talking of fish
protested sir arthur who was gradually recovering from his severe fright
 it makes me think of white bait dinners at greenwich i dined there two
days before i sailed for africa  

   and you will dine there again many a time replied the colonel

  only keep up your spirits ashby  

   i hope so im sure groaned sir arthur with a dismal shake of the
head that belied his words

   meanwhile guy had been preparing the lines and handing one to the
greek they cast them in the eddy below the island in less than five
minutes guy landed a trumpet a fish of a deep purple color a foot in length
canaris hauled one out at the same time and within an hour they had caught
more than a dozen all of the same species and of about the same length

    well take them along with us said guy  we may find driftwood
enough to build a fire and cook them  

    and if we dont find any cried canaris  we can cook them by hold-
ing them in the flame of the torch  

  chapter xxiv-sir arthur wakes at the right time

   at this point forbes positively insisted on getting up and in spite of the
slight dampness that still lingered about his clothes he pulled them on and
announced himself ready to start all were glad to leave the spot which
was connected with such a horrible event and soon the island was far in the
rear

   the second stage of the journey was monotonous and uneventful a
few slight rapids were encountered but for the most part the river was swift
and smooth

   the character of the shores now began to change and instead of the


the river of darkness

sharp ledges falling sheer to the water sandy beaches skirted the edge and
from the canoes they could make out gloomy holes and passages that pierced
the sides of the cavern

   they were strongly tempted at times to stop and explore these
unknown mysteries but the reflection that every moment thus wasted would
prolong their stay on this underground stream always checked their impulse

   a flat rocky ledge served for their next resting place it extended back
ten yards to a steep wall of rock and here in a hollow cavity canaris found
a mass of driftwood that was dry enough to burn

   the fish were cooked rudely over a fire but without salt they were
unpalatable and no one cared to eat them

   the luxury of a camp fire was enjoyed while they slept and although no
watch was kept the night-if night it really was-passed without alarm

   colonel carrington had managed to retain during his captivity a small
note book and pencil in this he kept a record of the journey jotting down
each night the incidents of the days cruise and a page from this diary will
convey to the reader a clear idea of the uneventful manner in which the first
week passed away-a week in long to be remembered contrast to the dread-
ful period that followed on its heels

   third stage-traveled all day on smooth water rocky shores camped on an
island could find no wood and slept in the dark

   fourth stage-today we passed rocky islands in great profusion once far over-
head we saw a single gleam of light shining in from a crevice so fax our calculation is
correct day is day and night is night

   fifth stage-nothing important ran a few rapids and camped on the right shore
on a sandy beach

   sixth stage-all goes well we are making many miles a day the current con-
tinues strong camped on flat rock in mid stream

   seventh stage-current still good river very wide and obstructed with rocks
narrowly missed an upset several times

    eighth stage-traveled rapidly camped on a big spit of sand on right shore vast
cavern behind us too sleepy to explore it

   here the peaceful monotony of the colonels record ended here on
this sloping sandy beach began the first of that string of fatalities which to
their last moment will send a shudder through those who participated in
them

   as the colonel stated they were so weary from the long days journey
that no investigation was made of the vast cavern that lay behind them

   guy advanced a few yards with his blazing torch

    it probably terminates with a rocky wall he said carelessly its no
use looking into it tonight  

   sir arthur suggested that it would be well to make sure that  danger
lurked in its dark recesses but when guy handed him the torch aud bade
him go satisfy himself he very promptly declined the honor

   a meager supper was eaten for already the stock of food showed a per-
ceptible diminution and by common consent guy began from that time to
serve out short rations
the river of darkness



   a quantity of driftwood had been brought in the canoes from a previous
camping place and with this a small fire was built in its cheerful flickering
glow they fell asleep and an hour later a faint gleam from the charred embers
was all that relieved the darkness of the cavern

   when sir arthur ashby turned uneasily on his rugs some time afterward
even this feeble light was gone the ex-governor was consumed with a
burning thirst he had an undeniable craving for champagne and iced
claret but in the unavoidable absence of these drinks water would have
to do

   as he sat up a faint noise reached his ears from the direction of the
canoes and supposing it to be canaris who had performed similar favors for
him before he called out loudly 

    my good fellow fetch me a drink will you im deucedly dry

   the noise instantly ceased and was not repeated though sir arthur
waited breathlessly for a full minute

   once he fancied he heard a slight rippling of water but that too ceased
at once

   then sir arthur uttered a loud shout which speedily wakened his com-
panions

   whats wrong cried the colonel anxiously did some one call
i surely heard a noise

    i want a drink thats all said sir arthur  i heard some one down
at the canoes and supposed it was canaris was it you carrington 

   no certainly not exclaimed the colonel now thoroughly awake
 here chutney forbes pass me a match quick i have none about me
they were all on their feet instantly and guy lost no time in lighting
the torch which he kept always by his side

   holding it over his head he led the way to the shore and the first brief
glance showed only too plainly what was the matter

      one canoe is missing   he cried despairingly

   what you dont mean it exclaimed forbes how can that be
possible   

its gone said guy blankly  no doubt of it here is the mark of
the keel leading down to the water thats not the worst of it though
half our provisions are gone with it and one lamp and an oil flask aswell  
 by jove chutney its that savage who has done this cried melton

  it can be accounted for in no other way we forgot all about the scoun-
drels presence in the cavern

     but how could he have lived all this time without food   

    i dont know answered melton  he must have managed it in some
way though these gallas are tough wiry fellows and can stand a good
deal of hardship  

   the circumstances all seemed to confirm meltons supposition unfortu-
nately the fact that this galla warrior was also making the cruise of the river
had been overlooked and now as a result of this negligence they had lost a
canoe and half of their supplies

   we have one thing to be thankful for said guy  if sir arthur


the river of darkness

had not wakened when he did we would undoubtedly have lost all his
shout scared the rascal and he did not wait to make off with the other canoe 
 yes here is the mark of a third boat announced the colonel who had
been making an investigation on his own account and footprints are visible
on the sand the scoundrel must have been here when we landed

    i warned you to make a search said sir arthur  but my advice was
disregarded you see the result

    prepare to start at once interrupted guy sharply  we must pursue
the thief and recover our canoe

   in less than five minutes they embarked and pushed away from the shore
 put out the torch said guy  if the rascal sees the light he can get
out of our way and we will pass him unperceived

    but how will we capture him in the dark   asked melton

   we must depend on our hearing was the reply  we will push
ahead quietly and listen at intervals for the stroke of his paddle

   under these circumstances the recovery of the canoe was very doubtful
but there was plainly no other course so they proceeded to carry out guys
plan as carefully as possible

    five paddles were all that remained one for each of them and with quick
noiseless strokes they moved rapidly down the river keeping the canoe
headed with the current as far as possible and pausing at times to listen for
any trace of the fugitive

   thus they journeyed for an hour or more but no sound of any kind
reached their ears and it began to look very much as though the galla had
been passed unseen in the darkness

      he could hardly have kept ahead of us for such a distance   said forbes
 im afraid we have missed him chutney

   guy made no reply the canoe at that instant grated harshly on some
obstacle and throwing out his arms melton discovered that the current had
carried them against one of the steep rocky shores he was about to shove
the canoe forcibly away with his paddle when guy whispered sharply 

    hold tight to the rock i hear something above us

chapter xxv-the journey on the lake

    in the deep silence all heard distinctly the low steady dip of a paddle

   be ready with a match whispered guy when the canoe comes
opposite light the torch and i will cover the fellow with my rifle

   the sound grew louder and plainer and meltons finger was already
trembling on the match when a terrific splash echoed over the water followed
instantly by a most awful and heartrending wail of agony that caused every
one to shudder from head to foot

   perfect silence ensued and the dip of the paddle was no longer heard
with nervous haste forbes lit the torch and the sudden light revealed an
empty canoe floating bottom up a few yards out in the stream

    they paddled quickly alongside and leaning over guy turned the drifting
boat right side up
the river of darkness



   it was empty of course the couteuts had gone to the bottom and near
the center the frail sides seen plainly in the torch light were actually crushed
inward like a shattered egg shell

   where was the occupant of a moment before  what tremendous force
had wrought this devastation 

   the current carried them on and on but no one spoke  no one dared
utter the thoughts that were in his mind

   at last guy said in faltering tones   nothing but a serpent could have
inflicted that injury to the canoe

   that was the meaning of the splash replied melton the huge
coils must have been thrown around it the poor fellow had only time for
one cry when he was dragged out

    then the serpent must have been following us down the river cried
the colonel   i supposed he was dead after that bullet hole in his neck  

    that serpent is dead said forbes solemnly  or i should never have
escaped from his coils this is another serpent the river must be the
abode of many like them

   this alarming statement was unfortunately only too likely to be true
sir arthur was terribly distressed and prophesied a speedy reappearance of
the monster and a fate similar to that of the poor savage in store for them all

   his anxiety was shared by his companions though not expressed as
openly and all possible haste was made to get away from the horrible spot

   a brief search was carried on in hopes of finding the lost provision bags
but with the exception of a single floating paddle nothing was picked up
the bags must have sunk with the lamp and oil flask

   nothing was seen of the other canoe-the one originally taken bjr the
savage-and they came to the conclusion that it had been purposely abandoned
farther up the river

   the balance of that day they traveled with a dread sense of impending
danger hanging over them the terrible scene so recently witnessed had
left an uneffaceable impression and by tacit consent they paddled in silence
afraid of the sound of their own voices

   the river had suddenly become narrow and ran with dizzy speed between
two rocky walls that reflected on both sides the glow of the torch which sir
arthur carried in the stern

   half a dozen times they dashed through brawling rapids but no mishap
occurred and as their increasing drowsiness warned them that night was
close at hand they succeeded in finding a landing place on the left shore
which offered some protection until morning

   a small quantity of wood still remained and with this a fire was kept
burning all night while they took turns at guarding the camp for after the
recent events they no longer dared to sleep unprotected and in utter darkness

   the scant amount of food now remaining was a source of great uneasiness
but chutney infused fresh hope into the party by the confident prediction
that if the present daily rate of speed was maintained the supply would last
until the end of the journey

   already the pure air of the cavern had done wonders for sir arthur and
i

the river of darkness

the colonel and they had nearly recovered their usual health and strength
the one canoe held them all very comfortably and they seemed to make
better progress than when they had been divided into separate parties

   that night nothing occurred to cause any alarm and they resumed the
cruise in fairly good spirits the river still continued narrow and the current
swift no dangerous water was encountered and everything was going on
swimmingly when guy suddenly shouted with all his might  back water 
quick  quick   and looking ahead they saw a steep rocky promontory
against which the current split and swung off into two channels one to the
right the other to the left

   in spite of their utmost efforts they continued to float down inch by inch

   which was the proper channel  it was a puzzling problem on which
perhaps hung life and death there was no time for consideration and
under the circumstances guy adopted the only possible course

    head the canoe straight for the center of the rock and let her drift he
cried   the current shall decide for us  

   this was instantly done and they drifted with perfect accuracy straight
for the splitting point in the stream

   for a moment it looked as though they would be flung against the rocks
and upset but as the canoe reached the turning point it trembled an instant
in the balance and then darted headlong into the channel to the right

    a good omen cried the colonel  the river juba lies on our right
this must be the proper channel

   it was a very narrow channel at all events and a very swift one too
for the rocky walls on either side were almost close enough to touch with the
paddles and they were moving at a dizzy rate of speed

    there are rapids below us said forbes  i can hear them dimly

   meltons hearing was unusually acute for as yet the rest could hear
nothing but in a few seconds the distant roar was audible to all and it grew
ominously louder with every second

   they grasped the sides of the canoe in anxious suspense-for it was use-
less to paddle-and the angry waters were almost in sight when sir arthur
dropped his torch and instantly they were plunged in total darkness

   no time remained to strike a fresh light the sullen crash of the waters
drowned the sound of their voices and the canoe blindly took its own course
and they felt the chill spray spattering their faces

    bump bump bump went the quivering boat grinding and crashing
on loose rocks and then with one terrific lurch that sent them sprawling on
their knees the violent tossing subsided and the choppy waves smacked the
bottom of the canoe

   with some difficulty guy lit a fresh torch and its light revealed a strange
condition of things

   no shore was visible on either side and overhead was empty space instead
of the low lying roof that always met their gaze

    we are no longer moving cried the colonel in astonishment

     impossible    exclaimed guy but on putting his hand in the water all
doubt was instantly removed the canoe was stationary
cupids net



   they paddled on to the right to the left in every direction but the dark
water calm and sluggish lay on all sides

    we are on a lake said guy  there is no doubt of it  a vast under-
ground lake

   there must be an outlet on the other side though replied melton
 all we need do is to paddle across and find it

    but which is the proper side   said canaris  are we headed straight
now   

    by jove i dont believe we are replied guy  im afraid we are
completely mixed up we will paddle until we reach the shore and then
follow it till we come to the outlet

    yes that will do very well said the colonel  the lake cannot be
so very large i wish we had time to complete a survey of it i should like
to make a report to the royal geographical society

    i wish the honorable members of the r g s could change places with
us said sir arthur with a groan  i have no doubt some of those luna-
tics would enjoy this beastly hole there is  accounting for taste
carrington

   the colonel made no reply he was keeping stroke with chutneys
paddle sharing with him the outlook ahead the minutes passed on but
still no signs of any shore

    its a pretty fair sized lake after all said guy

   and we are the first white men to navigate its waters remarked the
colonel solemnly  this is a wonderful discovery our fame as great ex-
plorers will be assured if we ever get back to england 

     land ahead    shouted guy suddenly and snatching the torch from
sir arthur he stood erect as the canoe shot gently towards a dim object that
rose from the gloom twenty yards distant amid breathless silence the keel
nicked the sandy beach and guy sprang out

   one brief second he held the flaming torch aloft

   then he turned and tottered with trembling limbs towards the canoe
he tried to speak but no words came and his face was pallid and horror
stricken

the bunkel mystery

how the robbery of the rival banks became a matter of strange coincidences-far reaching
and totally unexpected results of an act of gallantry-the battles on bunkel
island and the frustrating of carefully laid plans

synopsis of chapters previously published

    mr singerlay and mr barkpool are the two wealthiest citizens of montoban the former
is proprietor of the montoban mill and president of the montoban bank  the latter owns the
onongo mill and presides over the onongo bank they have long been enemies and their
quarrel is shared by their sons dolph singerlay and phin barkpool but both the latter are beset
by the same desire  to have a steamer of his own on the lake andy lamb is the son of mr
barkpools engineer and he rescues diana singerlay from the persecutions of tom sawder a
young hoodlum phin quarrels with him in consequence and the father is dismissed from the
barkpool employ only to be hired by mr singerlay meantime dolph and phin despairing of
getting steamers from their fathers rob the banks of which their fathers are the respective heads
they are surprised in their work by a professional burglar called poddy and his assistant tom
sawder who capture the two young gentlemen together with a hundred and fifty thousand dol-
lars and carry them off in a rowboat to bunkel island in lake montoban here they are kept
in a grotto effectually concealed from view while montoban supposes that the two banks have
been robbed by the sons of their respective presidents andy lamb however has his doubts
on this point and he tells rynon an officer who has been put on the case about a strange man
he has seen on bunkel island although rynon declares that this is no trail mr singerlay
insists that the island shall be visited which is done and while the fugitives are eating breakfast
in the cave poddy commands silence at the sound of voices outside

chapter xxvi-looking for the boys and not the man

tddy drew his revolver from his hip pocket when he heard the sound
of voices near the entrance to the grotto and looked savage enough to
shoot all his companions he suspended his trencher operations and the
others followed his example he was afraid that even the working of their
jaws might be heard by the intruders

    if one of you speaks or makes the least noise i will kill him   said
poddy in a low but very impressive whisper

   not one of them moved or ventured to utter a sound they all listened
and could hear talking and the tramp of feet on the rocks outside of the cave

    i tell you there is nothing here  and you are taking me on a wild goose
chase said one of the speakers outside  we want the boys and not the
man you saw

    i dont say there is anything here  and i dont see anything though
some one has been cutting down firs here added another voice

     come along  i am not going to fool away any more of my time chasing
a shadow added the first speaker who was at some distance from the open-
ing by this time

this story began in the april issue of the argosy the four back numbers will be
mailed to any address on receipt of  cents
the bunkel mystery



   this remark was followed by the tramping of feet on the rocks and it
was evident that the second speaker was leaving the locality for no further
sounds were heard poddy maintained silence for some time longer though
he resumed his trencher practice

   the meal was spread out on the platform which served as a bed at night
it was made up of cold dishes consisting of cold chickens sandwiches a
whole leg of ham a keg of crackers and plenty of bread and cheese only
the coffee was hot

   by the side of the table was a large basket which was well filled with
provisions all cooked and ready for use it was plain that the robber
had prepared for a long stay on the island though he could not have laid
in a stock for the two extra persons he had brought to the cave however
it looked as though they could all live on the supply for a week at least

    it was a late hour for breakfast and all of them seemed to be desperately
hungry not one of them spoke after the sound of the voices ceased to
reach them as it did not look as though they were likely to be disturbed
poddys savage expression softened to its former amiability but at least
half an hour elapsed before he spoke and the meal had been finished then
he looked at tom sawder some time before he said anything

    do you know who those men were that we heard outside tom  asked
the leader

     ill bet i do   exclaimed the hoodlum grating his teeth with wrath

    hush  do you want to call them back you blockhead   demanded
poddy as he raised the pistol in his hand though even tom might have
known that he did not mean to fire it as the sound of it would have brought
the visitors back to the vicinity cant you speak without bellowing
who were they  

    one of them was andy lamb  and i should like to get hold of him  
replied tom in a more reasonable tone

    nonsense  that fellow would thrash you every time as he did in the
boat  and you had better keep away from him added poddy

    thrash me  he cant do it  nor no other fellow in montoban  

    no matter about that now who was the other 

    the other was rynon  and he would like to get hold of me chuckled
tom  he took up the rest of our fellers but he couldnt find me

    rynon if that is his name says he wants the boys continued poddy
taking xio further notice of tom for whom he cherished a very decided con-
tempt   what does he mean by that   

   no one answered this question and no one seemed to be able to do so at
once but it was the subject of consideration to dolph and phin when the
silence had prevailed for some time poddy repeated the question

   they are looking for the boys and the officer dont take any stock in
the man that was mentioned said dolph

    i am that man added poddy with a smile  there can be no doubt
of that tom sawder very nearly gave me away  

    git out  i didnt do nothin of the sort   exclaimed the hoodlum
 i dont never give nobody away i aint no sech a feller


the bunkel mystery

   dont talk so loud tom said the chief sternly tom got into a
row with that other boy and got a thrashing to say nothing of being knocked
overboard  

     wait till i git hold of andy lamb  then you will see wholl git the
thrashing said tom

   we are willing to wait but we were speaking of what had been
and not what is to be though i shall bet on andy added poddy who
seemed to take pleasure in thorning his brutal assistant i was afraid tom
would get killed and i believe i showed myself to andy

    i didnt tell him to show hisself said tom addressing the prisoners

     then tom came on shore and wanted to borrow my revolvers i re-
fused to let him have them  but when he said he only wanted to scare andy
i yielded when i saw him blazing away at the sail boat with the young
lady in it i shouted to him and said  none of that   i did not mean andy
should hear me  but perhaps he did that is the way tom gave me away
for andy is looking for the man he saw

     rynon did not care anything about the man  he wanted the boys said
dolph  of course that means phin and me

    what makes you think so   asked poddy  he may have meant tom
and his crew

    but three of them are in the lockup now if they had meant tom
they would have said so and not spoken of him in the plural number
argued dolph

   tom thinks he is a host in himself though the officers probably dont
think so suggested the robber

    what time is it now mr poddy  asked dolph

     half past eleven replied the chief when he had consulted his elegant
gold watch  the forenoon is nearly gone  but we have nothing to do

    then everybody in montoban knows that both banks were cleaned out
last night the fact came out at nine oclock phin and i have been missed
and the keys have not been found to sum it all up phin and i have the
credit of having robbed both banks said dolph with some excitement in
his tones and manner

    you are both of you entitled to that credit for both of you intended to
do just that thing chuckled poddy

    now they are looking for us and not for you added the son of the
montoban magnate  my father never does things by halves and by this
time he has sent a description of me to new york and perhaps to every city
in the country

     very likely  and that will convince you that you are in the safest pos-
sible place in the whole world they will not look for you on this island  

   that ended the conversation without being a farthing better off than
he had been the evening before dolph realized that he was published all
over the land to the grief and shame of his family as a bank robber it was
a bitter thought and down to the deepest depths of his being repented that he
had ever harbored the wicked idea of robbing the bank

   when the breakfast things had been put away poddy opened the travel-
the bunkel mystery



ing bag and spent the next hour in counting his villainous gains as dolph
looked at him he thought of the schemes that had flashed through his mind
before he went to sleep he had better be shot than live branded as a bank
robber he could not determine how it was to be done but he firmly re-
solved to undo the mischief or attempt to do so

   when poddy was tired of looking at the immense mass of bank bills he
went to the entrance of the grotto little by little he removed the firs
from the mouth of the cave and then stepped out he cautiously looked
about him and then out upon the lake in the direction of the town

    all right  exclaimed he  they have left the island and now i am
monarch of all i survey that boat is a mile off and you can come out dolph
and phin  but you must not show youselves 

   that is the dragon my boat said dolph  our visitors have left
can we walk on the back of the island where we cant be seen from the
town   

   poddy gave his consent

   chapter xxvii-tom sawders bloodthirsty suggestion

     you will not show yourselves near the shore in any part of the island
said poddy after the prisoners had walked a few steps from the spot where
the robber stood at the entrance of the cave

   no one could see us from the main land said dolph

    some gunner or fisherman may be in a position to see you if you
please i prefer that you should stay where no one can see you added
poddy   i can keep you in the cave all the time  but if i am good natured
enough to let you take the air you must observe my directions

    very well mr poddy  we will do as you say returned dolph

    keep away from the west side of the island and you may go where
you please on the other side continued the robber as he returned to the
interior of the cave

   poddy was satisfied that it was simply impossible for the prisoners to
leave the island as there was no boat except the one in the cave the near-
est part of the main land was half a mile distant at the strait while the
channel was a mile and a half wide

   they were to keep away from the shore of the strait and no person could
see them across the channel the robber did not even think it wasneces-
sary to watch them though he was not likely to allow them to remain out of
his sight for any great length of time

   dolph led the way to the highest part of the island which was directly
over the grotto there were plenty of firs growing on the summit though
the sides were exceedingly rough the rocks lay as though a mountain of
them had been dumped in this place with a small proportion of earth mixed
in with them here and there a crevice sometimes amounting to what boys
would call a cave was to be found

   whats going to be the end of this thing asked phin as his com-
panion seated himself on a rock near the summit of the hill


the bunkel mystery

     that depends replied dolph looking earnestly into phins face

    depends upon what asked phin suddenly animated by the possi-
bility of a change in the current of their affairs for there was something in
the expression of his fellow prisoner which denoted the presence of activity
in his mind

     upon ourselves answered dolph in a low tone after he had looked
all about him to make sure that poddy was not near them

     what do you mean   asked phin in the same low tone

     it looks as though we might be kept here a week or perhaps a month 
and we may as well do something in the beginning as in the end added
dolph cautiously for he distrusted both the discretion and the pluck of his
associate  but it was because he knew less about him than of any other boy in
montoban

     what can we do   inquired phin to whom the idea of doing anything
was a new revelation

    one and one make two on one side  and one and one make two on
the other side replied dolph rather mysteriously though his looks expressed
more than his words

     that makes two on each side added phin who had no difficulty in
comprehending as much as this

     i see that you know what i mean

     poddy and tom on one side  you and i on the other

        j ust the idea  

    but-one and one make two again added phin

    what 

       revolvers  

     just so

     one plus one equals zero plus zero  bad equation

    two plus two equals two minus two change all the signs and the
value of the members remains the same

    but dolph had come to the end of his algebra and he had made a blunder
phin understood him however the other side had two revolvers and they
had none if they could get possession of both weapons the forces on the
two sides would be reversed

    dolph had ascertained that his hereditary enemy was willing to listen to
him  and this was all he wanted

     how to get the shooters continued phin

   take them replied dolph

     not easy

    can be done

      perhaps  

     hush  

    dolph rose from his sitting position and looked all around him then he
listened a very indistinct murmuring sound could be heard by both of
them dolph dropped upon the bit of earth under them and put his ear to
the ground for he had read indian stories enough to know how it was done
he listened for a few minutes and then rose from the ground
the bunkel mystery



   dolph was somewhat excited as the result of his listening phin could
not understand him but he lay down on the ground and listened he could
hear the confused sound of voices in a conversation carried on in a low tone

    in the cave said dolph in a whisper

    yes replied phin in the same manner

    say  more here added dolph  and phin nodded his assent to the
precaution

   but phin evidently had an idea though he had not overflowed with them
before without getting up he dropped on his hands and began to creep iti
the most cautious manner away from the spot when he had gone less than
a rod he halted at an opening in the rocks it was a rent not more than
three feet wide  and it looked as though a quantity of large pieces of the
boulder had been dumped into it

   at this aperture phin stopped and put his head down into the rent as far
as he could it was plain to him that the opening extended all the way
through into the grotto though it was not practicable for the passage of
even a small boy in its present condition if the loose rocks were removed
an entrance to the cave might be made

   phin pointed to the rent but he did not say a word  and dolph was pru-
dent enough to follow his example the latter had done some thinking in
the grotto while waiting for breakfast that morning there was a snapping
fire at the end of the cave at the farthest point from the entrance  aud the
thinker wondered that the subterranean chamber was not filled with smoke

   there was no smoke there and he had wondered how it escaped this
rent in the rocks explained the matter to his satisfaction as the fragments
of the boulder were large so were also the interstices between them at any
rate there was an effective chimney suddenly phin with his head in the
hole raised his hand and both of them listened

   the voices of tom and poddy could be distinctly heard and they seemed
to take no pains to stifle the sounds they had evidently been silent before 
and poddy did not seem to take any pleasure in the conversation of his brutal
companion of whatever crime he was capable the bank robber was a gen-
tlemanly villain though he was not a whit the better for that

    what you goin to do with them cubs poddy was the first sentence
which was understood by the listeners

    knock them on the head when i have done with them growled
poddy as though he did not care to talk with his companion

    you let em go about as though they hadnt no tongues in their heads
nor no legs on their carcasses added tom

    they cant get away

    i dunno about that theres lots of driftwood round the island and
they can make a raft

    it would take them two hours to get to the nearest shore and i should
see them before they got off replied poddy who was plainly considering
such a possibility as tom suggested

    the best way is to shoot em both and drop em into that hole added
the hoodlum


the bunkel mystery

    do you want your neck stretched  demanded the other

    stop the cave up and fill the hole with rocks then nobodyd never
find em

     we will do all that if it is necessary added poddy

   then tom wanted one of the revolvers  and the chief gave it to him
after he had shown his need of it

chapter xxviii-the desperation of the prisoners

   it was tom sawders idea that he might be put into a tight place if the
prisoners were allowed to roam about the island at their own pleasure they
might catch him alone and perhaps both of them together might get the
upper hand of him they could tie him to a tree and then fall upon poddy
when he was asleep or not on his guard

    his was the argument that induced the chief to surrender one of the
revolvers to his reckless companion phin and dolph were appalled at what
they heard even the gentlemanly villain proposed to  knock them on the
head  when he was done with them tom might fire at them at any time
and he was disposed to do so

   the hoodlum regarded the prisoners as a decided impediment he was
in as great a hurry to get away from the island as the sons of the magnates
his imagination was fired with visions of reckless dissipation in the great
city where his pockets would be filled with money

   as soon as the younger reprobate had obtained the revolver he alluded
to a division of the  swag as he called it for he had made some progress
in the rogues vocabulary under the tuition of poddy

    the prisoners on the island did not feel so much interest in this matter
and poddy evidently did not relish the topic and was not willing to discuss
it he promised to make a fair division of the money and this satisfied
tom for the time not another word was to be heard and very likely poddy
had gone to sleep

    phin raised his head from the trying position in which he had placed it
and moved away from the chimney of the cave as they afterwards called the
opening they continued to crawl until they had put ten rods between
themselves and the grotto phin had taken the lead in these last movements
and dolph followed him without making any objection

    phin rose to his feet and made a careful survey of the ground about him
he could see no holes in the rocks near him the surface was very irregu-
lar and the firs and savins were thick

    no cavities which could possibly contain a listener were to te seen in the
vicinity both of them were sure that no one could hear them

    it afterwards proved that they were mistaken

    we have nothing to hope for in the future said phin as he looked
dolph in the face  and both of them had a lugubrious aspect

    if tom sawder has his way we are not long for this world replied
dolph  he has a revolver now and he would use it on the slightest pre-
tense  
the bunkel mystery



    thatsso said phin solemnly  i agree with you now that we must
do something

     i am not going to be cowed down and trodden upon by such a vagabond
as tom sawder  i cant stand it lam not used to that sort of thing
added dolph his eyes snapping with wrath

    i am no more used to it than you are returned phin  but what
can we do in the face of two revolvers  

    we might as well be shot first as last

    i dont believe poddy will take the trouble to get us out of the scrape
said phin thoughtfully they cant stay on bunkel island forever you
know

    their provisions wont last more than a wteek even if they hold out as
long as that 

    then they must leave whether they stay here three days a week or
a month the time is sure to come when they must leave they are not
going to starve on this island even if they have to run a big risk in getting
away from it what do you think they are going to do with us when that
time comes   

    thats the question added dolph who could easily imagine the situa-
tion his companion described

     do you think they are going to encumber themselves with two fellows
who will be of absolutely no uge to them    asked phin with energy almost
giving way to weeping in despair over the fate that was apparently in store
for them

    of course they will not take us with them answered dolph  but the
difficult problem seemed to make him rave with anger rather than cry in
hopeless submission

    what are they going to do with us when that big time comes  de-
manded phin actually shaking with emotion

    i give it up   exclaimed dolph who was sorry to see his fellow pris-
oner choking with feeling and was inclined to lift him out of his despond-
ency if he could

     what can they do with us   asked phin

    they can leave us on the island replied dolph trying to laugh for
the benefit of his associate in misery

    will they do that  

    that is all they can do unless they adopt tom sawders cheerful sug-
gestion and blow our brains out replied dolph lightly though his manner
belied his feelings  they will have to leave us here since we agree that
they will not take us with them

    but how will they leave us  persisted phin who could not see any
possible bright side to the question

    they will launch their boat and leave us  thats the whole of it

    that is not the whole of it if they would do that i should not com-
plain we could build a raft as tom said and get to the main shore of
course we should tell the whole story as soon as we got back to montoban
and the wires of the telegraph would trip up the robbers before they got to


the bunkel mystery

a safe place reasoned phin  they are not going to leave us in any such
way

    as you seem to know phin how are they going to leave us  asked
dolph with a laugh for he was only anxious to bring his companion into
his own condition of mind

    they are going to tie us hand and foot and leave us in the cave   ex-
claimed phin with melodramatic earnestness  then they are going to
stop up the entrance of the hole with that big rock which lies near it  

   i think you are right phin said dolph in the most encouraging
tones   they are not going to leave us in a situation to start a pursuit of
them

    nobody in montoban has the least suspicion that we are on bunkel
island they are looking for us in new york city and elsewhere we
should starve to death in the cave  die a lingering death prolonged for
weeks perhaps said phin with a shudder

    you take a cheerful view of the end of the whole matter though it
seems to me that you are wholly right returned dolph  the robbers
cant do it in any other way they must either shoot us or tie us in the cave
so that we cant get out they are not going to take any risks of course
poddy has one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cold cash in his bag
aud he can be a count on the dake of como if he succeeds in making his
escape  

   we need not argue the matter any more for we agree perfectly added
phin who in some measure ascribed this result to his own logic and elo-
quence

    then all we have to do is to strike now   said dolph in a low tone
but with the most determined energy

   what do you mean inquired phin who had not got so far as his
companion

     we must change the signs in both members of the equation by getting
possession of the two revolvers  

   can we do that   asked phin amazed at the idea

    we can try  

      but we may be shot  

      that will not be half so bad as being shut up in the cave with our hands
and feet tied to starve to death   exclaimed dolph  better be shot than
starved but we have a good chance to succeed if you will take tom i
will take poddy when they are asleep we have more than an even
chance with them get the revolvers and then use them

    i dont think i could handle tom said phin

    not when you take him asleep 

    i will think how to do it added phin shrinking from such a contest
as was indicated

    i have thought of it all and you can do it as easily as you can tumble
down on the ice the first thing will be to hit him the heaviest crack on
the head you can with a club or a rock said dolph earnestly  i know i
can fix poddy the first time trying
r

the bunkel mystery	

    hush   whispered phin as he heard a sound near them and expected
to see tom sawder the next instant with the revolver ready for use

   but instead of tom andy lamb showed himself

chapter xxix-an obstinate and incredulous officer

   andy lamb on the morning of the robbery of the banks had been
obliged to remain at home later than usual on account of the absence of his
father who had gone to the montoban mill at three oclock to start the fires
under the boiler his sou had carried his breakfast to him at half past
eight for the engineer did not want to eat it till he had the mill in good
working order and had taken a little food when he left the house

   on his return shortly after nine andy heard of the robbery of the bank
he had almost j urnped up into the air when the news came to him he was
startled as everybody was aud the thought of the man he had seen on bunkel
island was his first consideration of course he could not say that the mys-
terious stranger he had seen was the robber though he felt almost sure of it

   he went to both banks and gathered all the news there was to be had
and then returned to the engine room of the mill to relate it to his father
mr lamb told him to go home with the pail and tell his mother what had
happened and by that time the officers would be ready to hear him for they
were busy then looking up the facts

   the engineer owned a very fine revolver which had been presented to
him by his associates in the shop when he left his former situation he
told his son to take this weapon for after the display of arms the day before
at the island he thought andy should be provided with the means of defense

   the young man had practised a good deal with this arm and he was
prudent and discreet so that he could be trusted with it it was rather
large but andy put it into his hip pocket and took a box of cartridges
on his return to the lower part of the town it had come out that dolph and
phin were missing and that each of them must have taken the keys of the
bank from his fathers house

   this discovery seemed to upset andys theory that the mysterious
stranger was the perpetrator of the robbery his father too was confident
that the two boys were the guilty persons andy was somewhat staggered
in his belief but it still seemed to him that the stranger must have had
something to do with the robbery what was he doing on the island
why had he taken so much pains to conceal himself if he was an honest
man  but the machinist told him to give his information to the officers

   andy left the mill and then he saw one of the policemen examining the
dragon he decided to see him and hastened to the boat house he felt
that half the strength of his case had been removed by the absence of the
boys but he cudgeled his brains to recall all the events at the island

   suddenly it occured to him that tom sawder was missing as well as
dolph and phin the hoodlum certainly had some connection with the
mysterious stranger he had conveyed a considerable raft of boards to bun-
kel which must have been for the use of the man he had seen then tom

      <L>
i

the bunkel mystery

must have obtained his revolvers from him the vagabond certainly had
some relations with him

   the stranger had said none of that   to tom when the latter fired the
pistol for the first time he would not have done that if they had not been
associated in some manner this reasoning -from the meager facts in his
possession strengthened him in his belief that the stranger and tom knew all
about the robbery

   he told his story to rynon the officer had his theofy and was not
willing to believe anything that conflicted with it it was only when mr
singerlay insisted that he would consent to visit the island rynon was sure
that the boys had robbed the banks and taken a train to some distant point
early in the morning

   the magnate told them to take the dragon for their visit to the island
the sail boat was provided with a small tender which dolph used when he
wanted to land where the water was shoal near the shore andy was in favor
of taking this tender with them and insisted upon doing so the magnate
had to interfere again in his favor before the policeman would yield the point

   rynon was far from enthusiastic in the mission he had consented to under-
take and he growled all the way to the island they looked it over in half
an hour and andy was forced to admit that he found nothing to justify his
confident assertions that tom and his associate were concealed there

   at the same time he asked rynon a few hard questions which the officer
could not answer tom had rafted a lot of boards from the town to bunkel
having probably stolen them where were those boards  not a splinter of
one of them could be found what had become of them  tom could not
have conveyed them back to montoban

   rynon could not answer any of these questions  he declared that it was
of no consequence what had become of the boards he would not take the
trouble to reply to andys suggestions he had been an officer for twenty
years and he was not going to be led by the nose by a boy he knew what
he was about and he did not want any advice

    you said that tom and the man went on in the boat at the time you
arrested bob rottle and the others mr rynon  said andy who had
another point to make with the officer before they left the island

      that is what i said  but it has nothing at all to do with the robbery of
the banks replied rynon very crustily if not angrily

    the man picked up the four boys who were hanging to the wreck of the
boat i think you said continued andy as pleasantly as he could speak
 where did he land them if you please  

   i dont know  i was not on the island at the time  but i found the
three boys i arrested over on the east side of the island they had been to
the landing rock in search of tom and the man they could not find them
or see anything of the boat

    if the boat had left the island it must have crossed the channel added
andy

     i suppose so for the boys would have seen it if it had crossed the strait
growled the officer
the bunkel mystery



    i think that is plain enough mr rynon for the boys went back to the
west shore after they had looked over the channel and you fouud them
there i contend that they could not have crossed the channel for it is a
mile and a half wide and the boys would have seen them if the boat had left
on that side of the island argued andy with a good deal of earnestness

    i dont care whether it did or did not  it has nothing to do with the
robbery committed by dolph and phin for neither of them were on the island
or anywhere near it answered rynon roughly we have looked the
island over aud there is not the ghost of a sign to show that the robbers are
here that is all i want to know  

    i am not satisfied yet said andy

    i dont care whether you are satisfied or not replied the officer as he
walked down to the landing rock  i did not come down here to satisfy
you but myself i know the robbers are not here and have not been here
and i am going back to town do you think after twenty years experience
i dont uuderstaud this sort of business better than you do  

   andy realized that it was useless to attempt to get ahead any farther with
such an officer as rynon  and he thought he could borrow a detective from
any ten cent novel who would have more shrewdness than his companion

    if it is all the same to you mr rynon i should like to remain here a
little while longer i will pull back in the tender when i want to go home
said andy for he could not think of leaving the island until he had made a
more thorough examination of the place for himself

   andy embarked in the tender and while the dragon was standing up
the lake on her way to moutoban he pulled over to the east side of the
island under oue of the cliffs he stopped to consider the situation he and
rynon had examined the island without finding the slightest evidence that
the man was still on the island the boards must be on the island and he
was determined to find them

chapter xxx-the conference on the island

   tom and the man if the had committed the robbery or had a hand in
it might have escaped in their boat to the main land and departed to parts
unknown  but they could not have taken the boards with them the
lumber or a part of it had been taken ashore to andys certain knowledge
now it had disappeared with the man and tom it was a mystery to say
the least whether or not it had any connection with the cleaning out of the
two banks

   andy knew of a place on the west shore where he could leave the tender
in safety for he was general enough not to trust himself  the island with-
out leaving open his line of retreat he could shove it in under the rocks
and then walk on a sort of shelf to an accessible part of the island

   he came to the lower level of the island just below the hill which lay
between the landing rock on the south side and his present position he
had hardly reached the plain as visitors called the lower part of the island
before he was sure that he heard footsteps on the side of the hill
io

the bunkel mystery

   as a matter of precaution he dropped upon the ground  and then as
another measure of the same kind he examined his revolver which was not
yet loaded such a weapon does not amount to much when its barrels are
empty though it is sometimes a very convenient bugbear

   if the persons whom he was to see soon were the man and tom an empty
pistol was not the thing for them and he charged all the barrels of the
weapon then he listened and he was not a little excited he did not
care even to meet tom sawder face to face for that would mean fight  but
he wanted to see where he concealed himself

   rrnon and andy had been all over the island without obtaining any
evidence that there was a human being on it andy had resisted the officers
conclusion and had almost quarreled with him now the sound of footsteps
whoever made it proved that he was right and he was bountifully encour-
aged

   the savins grew with their lower branches almost on the ground they
were to be found in groups and it was aii easy thing to obtain perfect con-
cealment at the place where he had halted and dropped upon the ground
three of them growing in the form of a triangle promised him the security he
desired at that moment

   andy continued to listen while he slowly and cautiously worked himself
into the clump of savins the footsteps were still to be heard in a few
moments he was satisfied that more than one person was descending the hill
whose rough side compelled them to move very slowly and carefully there
were two of them and they must be tom and the man

    the listener took out his revolver and held it in his hand for he feared
that he might be suddenly called upon to use it in a short time he heard
voices though they were not loud enough for him to distinguish what was said
if the two were talking one of them must be tom sawder though neither of
the voices sounded like his

   the persons who were approaching reached the plain they looked about
them as andy judged by the sounds then they came together quite near
the three savins which hid him but they had only searched in the open places
they seated themselves and having assured themselves that no one was near
they spoke out loud

   the first time one of them used his full voice andy was astounded and
bewildered it was neither tom nor the man who spoke  it was phin bark-
pool the listener could hardly believe the evidence of his own ears
then he heard the answer to the first remark in the tones of dolph
singerlay

   the sons of the two magnates of montoban were on bunkel island in
spite of the theories and the absolute certainty of rynon that they were not
there the telegraph was pursuing them all over the country and here
they were within three miles of the banks they had plundered  officers
were looking for them in the great cities but they were in sight of home

    it took some time for andy to realize the truth of this though his senses
gave him all the evidence he needed

    if the boys were here the vast sum they had stolen could not be far off
the bunkel mystery



andy was almost carried away at the idea of being instrumental in restoring
the money to the banks

   but dolph and phin did not wait for him to subdue his emotions they
went on talking about the situation and phin who had the floor painted a
terribly black picture of their immediate future he listened to the entire
conversation till the prisoners had decided to rebel against the fate in store
for them

   at this point andy crawled out of his place of concealment and walked
toward the spot where the conversation was going on

   of course he had received a new revelation from what he had heard it
did not appear that dolph and phin had robbed the banks they were
prisoners in the hands of some other persons who were doubtless the real
robbers

   how the sons of the magnates had been carried off if they were not
concerned in the crime was a jpuzzling problem which andy could not
solve and he gave it up for he had not a single fact to bear upon the
question

   as soon as he could crawl out of the shelter of the savins he stood up
with the revolver still in his hand the two boys heard his steps and were
alarmed

   andy lamb   exclaimed dolph as soon as he saw the son of the
machinist

    andy lamb repeated phin and it is safe to say that he felt none of
the malice he had nursed the last time they were together

   i did not expect to find you here replied andy looking from one to
the other   i have heard what you have said during the last half hour  

    then you know all about our situation added phin

    no i cant see through it at all i know that you are here-that you are
in danger of being shot or starved to death andy explained  i have not
the least idea how you happen to be here or who is going to shoot or starve
you i am utterly astonished to find you here for your father dolph has
telegraphed all over the country to find you

     that is what i supposed he would do   added dolph

    everybody in town is satisfied that you two robbed the banks and that
you have got away wtith all the money continued andy

    they are all mistaken  we did not rob the banks though i wont deny
that we intended to do something of that kind in a small way added dolph
hanging his head for he had made progress enough in his misery to be
ashamed of what he had tried to do

    who did rob the banks   asked the newcomer his wonder increasing

   a man that tom sawder calls poddy though i think from one of
toms slips of the tongue that his real name is ben podgate answered
dolph

     what has become of the money   

     it is in a traveling bag in the cave  

    in the cave  what cave   asked andy  i never heard of any cave
on bunkel island


the bunkel mystery

    i never did till we were brought here at about two oclock this morn-
ing it is under this hill

   both dolph and phin looked about them anxiously at this point of the
conversation for they had been absent over an hour from the cave and it
was time for one of the robbers to be on the lookout for them andy was
almost sure he heard a sound in the direction of the entrance to the grotto
but they could discover nothing either with the eye or the ear

   andy was burning with curiosity to hear more of the experience of the
two young magnates  in fact he thought it was necessary for him to know
more before he reported to leffwing who stood at the head of the police
force of montoban

   he conducted his companions to the shelf of rock by which he had
landed it was only wide enough for them to stand in single file  but there
he listened to the whole narrative of the robbery

    they were not more than three feet alcove the water and a northeasterly
wind was blowing with considerable force having greatly increased in vio-
lence since andys arrival the waves wet the trio as they stood on the shelf
and they could hear the tender in its place of concealment thumping against
the rocks

   dolph decided that they could not cross the channel in the tender and
he and phin decided to return to the cave so as not to excite suspicion

   chapter xxxi-andy shelters himself from the gale

    phin was the more timid of the two prisoners though he had a fair share
of pluck he had heard or thought he heard noises which indicated the
approach of one of their persecutors and they made him nervous if poddy
had thought they were absent too long he was more likely to send tom to
see where they were than he was to go himself

   if the hoodlum saw andy lamb with them he would be inclined to shoot
some one and the presence of a visitor might be a sufficient excuse for doing
so in the estimation of the leader but phin thought that a good excuse
would be little consolation after any one of the trio on the rocky shelf had
been shot he preferred to avoid the shooting and his companions agreed
with him

    it was a thing understood from the beginning of the conference that andy
should convey the prisoners back to montoban  but when they looked at
the lake they all agreed that it was impracticable to do so in the tender

    the little boat was quite as handsome as the sloop to which it belonged
but it was hardly big enough to hold more than two persons it was long for
its beam and would upset upon the smallest provocation it answered the
purpose for which dolph used it when the lake was reasonably smooth

   in the present rough condition of the water it would simply have been
suicide to attempt to cross the channel in so small a boat all three of them
agreed on this point it was necessary therefore for the prisoners to report
at the grotto

   andy could not arrange any plan with them for he was not willing even
the bunkel mystery

to trust himself alone in the tender he must remain on the island for the
present  but he would return to montoban as soon as the weather would
permit

   of course a force from the town would come to the assistance of the boys
as soon as the situation was made known there this was all the arrange-
ment that could be made until this could be done it would not be prudent
to allow the robbers to know that a visitor had been to the island

   phin had proposed that andy should work around the island in the tender
and cross the strait on the west side dolph however was sure that it was
even rougher in the narrow passage than in the wide one for it was more
exposed to the action of a northeast wind the only thing they could do
was to wait  and to boys this is the hardest thing in the world to do the
prisoners returned to the cave leaving andy standing on the shelf of rock

   the engineers son was quite as eager to do something at once as his late
companions had been but the weather was decidedly bad it had been
cloudy since nine oclock in the morning and the sky was blacker and more
threatening than it had been when andy arrived

   it looked like a storm and the wind was continually increasing the
waves broke against the rocky shores of the island for the wind had a sweep
of two miles and the rollers were heavy for a small lake

   andy felt as though his wheels had been blocked for he could do
nothing in spite of his good intentions he wondered if mr singerlay
when he wras told that he had been left on the island with nothing but the
frail tender would not send the dragon back for him the magnate must
see that it was impossible to return in the little craft when the wind was
blowing a stiff gale

   but mr singerlay was not likely to think of the boys peril at this time
he had enough to keep his mind busy but andy was sure his father would
think of him when night came and he did not return at the worst he
was satisfied he could stand it till the next morning though it was not
pleasant to think of spending the night out of doors on the island in a storm
from the northeast

   he had heard the tender bumping against the rocks in the water cave
where he had put it he was afraid it would be injured by the commotion
of the waves and he decided to go down and look out for it possibly he
could find a shelter during the storm under the rocks he had visited the
place many times before and he knew or thought he knew all about it

   the rocks as at castle hills and the bay of islands near them seemed
to have been shaken up by some convulsion of nature at an earlier period
if they had been rent and split up by an earthquake or a volcanic eruption
they would have been left very much as visitors found them

   they were pierced in every direction with crevices apertures and clefts
of all shapes and sizes there were half a dozen of these holes on the east
shore of bunkel island

   the one which andy had chosen on account of the shelf which afforded
a good chance to land on the island was an opening in the form of a shelter
tent he had been in it several times but he had never had any desire to
the bunkel mystery

examine it carefully he knew that the rocks were honeycombed with
openings as a load of large stone chips would be when dumped on the
ground from a cart

   andy had backed the tender into the cavern which was about ten feet
deep so that he could secure the painter on the shelf he drew the boat up
to his landing place and stepped into it letting go of the cord which held
it the tender immediately drifted back to its former position the stern
rested against an upright mass of rock

    the wind did not blow directly into the little grotto and the water in it
was sheltered by the abutment on the weather side andy shortened the
painter so that the tender should not hit the rock at the stern then with
a small line he found in the boat he rigged a stay on each side which he
attached to the rocks

   thus secured the boat pitched and rolled on the uneasy waters but it
was safely moored so that it could not strike the rocks at any point

   andy seated himself in the stern of the tender and put on the overcoat
he had brought with him in anticipation of rain for the air was quite chilly
he could hear the roar of the surging waves as they-beat upon the rocky
shore  but he felt quite comfortable

   in this easy position he began to consider the events of the preceding
night he found abundant occupation for his thoughts  but he had hardly
entered upon the subject when he was startled by the sound of a voice quite
near him as he thought

    the sound did not seem to come from the direction of the lakewhere the
only opening he knew anything about was situated the voice seemed to be
in the very heart of the rocks it appeared to come from some point over his
head though not directly above him

    he was alarmed not for his personal safety but because the security of
his position was threatened he looked about him  but except on the sur-
face of the water it was so dark that he could not make out anything

   andy was not a smoker but he made the fire in the cook stove for his
mother in the morning and he carried a tin box of matches in his pocket
he lighted one of them

    by the feeble light of the match he discovered that there was a consider-
able crevice on the south side of him casting off the stay on the opposite
side he moved the tender over to the aperture pieces of rock had fallen
from above and formed a rough platform just above the water

    it followed that if he could hear the persons above him they could hear
him if he made a noise he did not therefore deem it prudent to get upon
the platform

    as he reached over and put his head into the aperture which was like an
oven he could see gleams of light it was evident that the crevice in the
rocks reached to the summit of the hill though it was so crooked and irregular
that no direct rays of daylight could penetrate through it to the lower cavern
in which andy had sought shelter

    tom  tom   shouted the person whose voice andy heard  wake
up  i have called you a dozen times  
dolly gray



     wliat do you want    asked the well known voice of the hoodlum

    go out and see where tliose boys are they have been gone over an
hour  but dont bring them in till i tell you added the first speaker  and
atidy concluded that he was poddy

   nothing more was said and it was plain that tom left the grotto to obey
the order of the chief

   but audy heard other sounds and he gave his attention to them he
was sure the noise was nearer than the interior of the cave which he now
knew was above him but farther than his own grotto from the lake

   the sound was that of something descending the crooked shaft which led
to the top of the hill he looked in vain for a sight of anything for the
tortuous passage did not enable his vision to reach more than six feet he
was alarmed for poddy might be descending the crooked passage he took
out his revolver and prepared it for use

   the moving body whatever it was bumped from side to side in its
descent but it came nearer the water cave every moment it was not a man
and andy put up his weapon he was afraid to light another match lest the
glare of it should be seen by the bank robber above

   the object struck the rough platform then it was jerked up and down
several times and the observer could faintly discern a dark body floundering
about like a live animal

   when it ceased to move andy put his hand on it it was a large travel-
ing bag it was very heavy and his heart bounded when he realized that it
contained the money of which the two banks had been rifled

                                                                  oliver optic

the marvelous experiences that grew out of the lunar company limited-how the catch-
penny scheme of three adventurers was transformed into an extraordinary
contribution to the world of science-scenes and incidents
of a sojourn on the earths satellite

synopsis of chapters previously published

    messrs gryphins vogel and wagner three adventurers in melbourne australia start
the lunar company for the conquest and exploration of the mineral rielies of the moon
the control of the enterprise passes into the hands of norbert mauny a young french scientist
who has a plan of attracting the moon to the earth by erecting a series of powerful magnets
the bayouda desert in the soudan is selected as the site at suakitn mauny meets the
french consul m kersain and his daughter gertrude who decide to accompany him on a
visit to the mogaddem of rhadameh a local ruler whose favor must be obtained before the
transportation of the material across the desert can be made

    norbert secures the cooperation he desires and the reflectors are erected on the peak
of tehbali where work proceeds with gratifying success till messrs gryphins vogel
and wagner are detected in a conspiracy to turn the workmen against norbert they are
imprisoned and then norbert hearing that trouble threatens khartoum where m kersain
has been transferred determines to go thither and see if he cannot induce him and his daughter
to take refuge at the peak

    it is finally arranged that gertrude accompanied by dr briet her uncle and fatima her
maid accept the invitation

   meantime kaddour the mogaddems dwarf plans to destroy the work on which mauny
has built such high hopes but he is taken captive and placed in charge of virgil maunys
right hand man discovered in an attempt to win away the allegiance of the negro
guard he is condemned to be shot but swallows poison just before the execution is to take
place

    the magnets are working splendidly and by the sixth day the moon is so close and appears
so immense that norberts party are terrified one of them rushes to the tablet where the
knobs controlling all the motors are situated raises one and lowers another a fearful crash
ensues and all are thrown into insensibility

    when they come to again the astounding discovery is made that the whole mountain of
tehbali has been transferred to the moon as soon as he realizes what has happened nor-
bert hastens to close and hermetically seal all the windows in order that no air may-escape
as the moon being without atmosphere man cannot breathe there however he provides
respirators with which he and sir bucephalus coghill are enabled to start out on an exploring
trip during which they discover an opening into the crater of an extinct volcano which has
become filled with air from the earth

    on the return to the observatory the body of the dwarf is found exposed to view by the recent
catastrophe and perceiving certain signs of life in it dr briet sets to work and soon has kaddour
restored to life he having forced himself into a state of catalepsy he is kindly treated by all
and sensibly melts under these influences meanwhile petty thefts of food have been noticed
aud it is discovered that gryphins vogel and wagner are also on the moon

    on first beholding them kaddour becomes much excited and begs mauny to hand them over
to him for punishment for it turns out that they had kidnapped him when a boy and distorted
his body in order to fit him to fill the place of a dwarf who had died and whom they had been
exhibiting but norbert simply directs them to be placed in captivity again

    at the close of the moons night of two weeks the alarming discovery is made that seven out

                      mailed to any address on receipt of  cents

of the eight tons of chlorate of potassium used to furnish the party with oxygen have been
stolen by the captives it is finally discovered at the bottom of the crater and norbert is
strongly minded to put the culprits to death but decides to grant them a respite till they can be
brought before a tribunal on the earth he places them under kaddours surveillance who
declares that he will wall up all the openings of their prison leaving them only just space
enough for breathing purposes

chapter xliv continued-the stolen chlorate

   irgil and kaddour were not long in collecting materials wherewith to

      close up the prisoners breathing hole till it was no bigger than the
port hole of a vessel the prisoners looked on in horror terribly afraid that
they were to be buried alive

    my good friends said wagner in hurried accents  can it be possible
that you intend to wall us up alive 

   since we have only a ton of chlorate left said virgil  we must at
least take care to keep it all for our own use

   wagner and company looked at each other in dismay and conversed
apart in low tones

   we have not destroyed the chlorate explained wagner and we
are quite ready to indicate its whereabouts if we are only treated a little
better  

    indeed   replied virgil plastering on with supreme unconcern  you
are too late with that offer it just happens that we can do without your
chlorate  

   i am delighted to hear you say so said wagner whose countenance
denoted anything but unmixed satisfaction in that case you would surely
not punish a harmless offense so severely

    everything depends on the intention said virgil as he laid- his
first stone

    but surely you do not really mean to suffocate us   criedvogel more
and mor terrified

    what was your intention in taking away our air   retorted the alger-
ian soldier

   the rascals were so ill advised as to turn to kaddour

   sir said gryphius will you not intercede for us we have not
the pleasure of knowing you but we caunot believe that such an odious
crime will be perpetrated in your presence

   no   shouted the infuriated dwarf who up to this moment had kept
silence with diificulty out of obedience to norberts instructions no
you cannot believe that so odious a crime can be perpetrated such things
do happen though sometimes  have you never heard talk of a certain
child who was stolen from his family by two proprietors of a traveling circus
who walled him up for fifteen years in a steel corselet to prevent his grow-
ing  the story was related to me and i thought i had never heard its
equal for brutality shall i tell it to you peter gryphins and ignaz
vogel  

   the two wretches became perfectly livid  their eyes dilated and seemed
as if starting out of their sockets


a month in the moon

   shall i tell you my masters pursued kaddour  how this child was
sold by you to the viceroy of egypt how at cairo he lived the life of a
curious beast or domestic animal for twelve years  how he fled to the desert
where he instigated rebellion and incited the natives to war  how he subse-
quently found himself in the moon and how throughout it all one fixed
idea governed him-the determination to be revenged on you  but i need
not detail the history  you have recognized me and you know now what
to expect yes peter gryphins yes vogel it is i-midgy ex-general-in-
chief of the myrmidons of the sultan of batavia  i-whose flesh you
cramped and mutilated to sell it first to the gaping public then to a
viceroy i have grown a little-at least four inches-since you lost sight of
me the childs chin now bears a mans beard but it is i all the same
you scoundrels i have you at last within my grasp and i wont let
you go  

   kaddour might have gone on indefinitely in this strain  the unhappy men
had ceased to listen to his words beside themselves with amazement and
fear they had fallen oh their knees before him beseeching mercy

   but he would not even look at them maddened with rage he heaped
stone upon stone in feverish haste while virgil quickly worked the plaster 
and in a few minutes only a square aperture of a fewt inches in size remained
for the passage of air

chapter xlv-nearing the earth

   some minutes after the late terrible scene between kaddour and his old
tormentors virgil took provisions to them and reassured the unfortunate
men with the intelligence that the only penalty inflicted on them was to fetch
the chlorate back from the bottom of the crater rheticus

   they didthis with such alacrity that the chlorate was all restored within
twelve hours although this entailed enlarging the orifice of the crater going
down it and filling their sacks to take them to the observatory twenty seven
times in succession

   the fabrication of oxygen now proceeded rapidly while the machines
were set going to charge the electro-accumulators at the expiration of
forty eight hours the time fixed by norbert the preparations were com-
pleted

   the young scientist announced the welcome fact at breakfast time and
then proceeded quite calmly to establish contact

    now we start he said looking at his chronometer and making a note
in his pocketbook  we shall arrive in a hundred and fifty five hours and
eight minutes not counting the seconds

    arrive where   asked gertrude

     in the soudan i had a motive yesterday in hurrying matters so the
position of the earth at this moment is such that we have every chance of
descending on the desert of bajrouda had i waited one hour longer we
should have fallen on bengal or cochin china it was you see advis-
able to make as much haste as possible 
a month in the moon



    if you had asked me said gertrude pouting a little  i would have
preferred descending at khartoum

   believe me i should have been only too delighted to please you in
this respect murmured norbert  but there was one great difficulty in the
way

      what was that   

    we should have had to wait seventeen years longer  

   every one laughed on hearing this not excepting gertrude herself

   v and if some accident pursued norbert should have prevented our
departure at the precise minute the long delay would have been perfectly
useless  

    life in the observatory went on the same as before and it was difficult to
believe that they were on the move only their implicit reliance on the cal-
culations of the young astronomer led them to place faith in his assurances
that they had really started before retiring to rest however they per-
ceived a sensible difference in the diameter of the earth now in her last
quarter and norbert confirmed by micrometical measurement the fact of her
increased size

   the descent proceeded rapidly seventy hours after starting the earth
visibly increased in diameter appearing like a large ball of a uniform color
on which the continents stood out distinctly and were of a yellow hue while
the seas were steel gray

    the rotation was so plainly evident that the different regions of the globe
made each their separate entry at the eastern side of the disc passed like
light clouds over its face and disappeared on the other side

    it reminds one of the figures in a magic lantern said gertrude
 making their appearance to the right and their exit at the left corner

   it was in truth a fairy-like scene through the telescope they could
plainly discern mountain and forest snow tipping the summits and clothing
the polar regions while a line no thicker than a hair was guessed to be the
mississippi or the amazon and a black speck here and there was evidently
some large town

   towards the hundred and twentieth hour which corresponds to the fifth
day the interposition of the earth between the sun and the moon was suffi-
ciently marked to bring on a night of seven hours it could not be called an
eclipse for it was not a partial nor an instantaneous occultation of the solar
disc but its total disappearance behind a gigantic screen across all one
side of the horizon

   when the sun reappeared the clouds obscuring the earth parted for an
iustaut and norbert distinctly saw through the telescope a sea dotted with
vessels it was the mediterranean the waters were so limpid that they
did not hide the conformation of the ground intervening between sicily
sardinia and tripoli then the clouds closed agaiu

   the final moment was approaching and it was time to put the last
touches to their preparations aided by the doctor virgil and kaddour
norbert began by fitting the parachute on a large frame that had stood ready
for the past eighteen days in the middle of the esplanade


a month in the moon

   it was shaped like a triumphal arch and bore in front a steel arm that
turned freely on two well greased hinges from the arm hung the cord
that suspended the parachute and a small electric cable was wound round the
latter having direct communication with the terminal of the magnetic
mechanism

   close by hung a chopping knife in its sheath and by pressing a spring
this knife would cut the cord and electric cable clean through this would
at one and the same time set the parachute free and arrest the magnetic
action of tehbali

   no one but norbert knew the secret of this machinery and he fully
intended to keep it to himself and leave nothing this time to chance

   the parachute was thirty yards across it was made of the pieces of silk
prepared in the storeroom and pieced together by gertrude and fatima
under norberts superintendence the cords of suspension were passed
through a large hole in the center and it was held open by a steel frame like
an umbrella

   the car was hung by silken cords to the edge of the parachute and was
made of a slight circular framework two yards in diameter round this was
a silk netting at elbow level with eleven spaces left for the oxy gen respirators
that were subsequently to serve also for seats a basket of provisions a box
of clothing an aneroid barometer and a thermometer completed the contents
of the car

   the parachute had been ready for two or three hours when the sun dis-
appeared anew behind the terrestrial screen and deep night prevailed in that
part of the esplanade where the travelers were assembled it was darker than
any night they had ever seen for not only was there not the slightest stream
of starlight but the sky itself was completely gone-its place was occupied
by the terrestrial globe

chapter xivi-kaddour bars the way

   seated round a table on which burnt an electric lamp in the observa-
tory drawing room the castaways were silently awaiting norberts signal for
departure

   on a sudden norbert rose and turning to gertrude said 

    it is time we have been a hundred and fifty four hours on the jour-
ney in thirty eight minutes we shall be on the earth it is time to seat
ourselves in the car  

    i am ready answered gertrude rising at once  come fatima
led by the doctor they went out to the esplanade and took their seats
in the car of the parachute norbert who had accompanied them returned
to hurry sir bucephalus and smith

   there is no time to lose he added i have just ascertained that
the parachute is considerably out of the vertical position in a quarter of
an hour at most all must be finished  do you take your places virgil
kaddour and i will go and bring the prisoners  

   the baronet and his model domestic hastened to the esplanade while
a month in the moon

norbert proceeded towards the storeroom to choose some respirators for the
prisoners

   he had just reached the circular passage holding his electric lamp
when a sharp blow on the right shoulder knocked the lamp out of his
hand and two strong arms at the same moment seized him round the waist

   you were going without us were you but you shall not  cried a
voice that norbert recognized as wagners he struggled vigorously and
caught a glimpse between whiles of two more figures close at hand

     kaddour  virgil  help    cried norbert   the prisoners have
revolted  	

   happily kaddour and virgil were not far off they saw in the twink-
ling of an eye what had happened and each rushed upon his man norbert
with the energy of despair had mastered his assailant and held him pinned
to the ground by one knee on his chest it was peter gryphins

   with a well directed blow virgil knocked over wagner while kaddour
seizing vogel with his strong arms brought him down with a bump

   there you are all three  cried virgil scoundrels to behave so
just when we came to liberate you but how did they get here continued
he looking all round

   the electric lamp which had been deposited on the ground threw a ray of
light on the wall and made it evident that the stones had been quietly and
patiently loosened  so that it needed but a well directed blow to knock them
out and leave a great breach through which the prisoners must have pene-
trated into the circular gallery

   it was necessary however to come to some immediate decision had
the three visitors been armed there could be little doubt that they would
have summarily settled the matter but as it was they were at a loss how
to turn their victory to account

   fi master and kaddour could manage to hold this villain said virgil
 i can get some rope and have them all bound in a trice

   quite right answered norbert hand us over your charge and
make haste

   virgil did as he was bid seizing the already half strangled wagner by
the neck he brought him over to norbert and kaddour who gripped hold of
him without slackening their grasp of the other two

  take the lantern with you shouted norbert dont lose a
minute  

   virgil obeyed and disappeared into the storeroom the prisoners at
once struggled madly to escape but they reckoned without their host for
kaddour could easily have settled them all

    if you dare to move again i will throttle you he said squeezing their
throats and chuckling horribly the savage threat had the desired effect 
not one dared to move again

   virgil had already returned with a rope he cut off several lengths with
his pocket knife and in a few minutes the three prisoners strung together
in a row like sausages were placed standing against the wall the fight had
so exhausted them that they said not a word but submitted silently


love the magician

    quick now the respirators   said norbert

   then he continued 

    we will fasten them on their chests aud carry these rascals to the
parachute  

   what cried kaddour do you mean to take them after this
attempt of theirs  

    their attempt has nothing to do with the question replied norbert
these men ought to be judged and sentenced by a regular tribunal i
have vowed that the world shall know what they have done and i will keep
my vow come virgil bring the respirators and let us make an end of it
once and for all

   the algerian soldier obeyed with military promptness but kaddour was
not going to be silenced

   it is incredible   he said   when you have ready to your hand such
an easy way of punishing them how can you take the trouble to drag them
down to another tribunal  you shall leave them here have they not by
this last mean treachery lost all title to your indulgence  think you had
the tables been turned that they would have saved you  

    i do not model my conduct on theirs replied norbert coldly  not
another word kaddour  these men are to come with us it is true that they
are vile wretches the blackest villains ever seen perhaps but it shall never
be said that i took upon myself to leave them exiled on the moon with the
inevitable prospect of death from suffocation

   virgil came back with the respirators and fastening one on each pris-
oner put the mouthpieces over their faces

    take this one first said norbert pointing to peter gryphins

   virgil took him up but the dwarf did not move

    i suppose i must help you since kaddour wont said norbert stoop-
ing down to grasp the legs of the bound man	

   but the dwarf planted himself at the door and muttered hoarsely

    these men shall not go out from here  i will not have it  

a laurie

                         sing bird ripple rill
