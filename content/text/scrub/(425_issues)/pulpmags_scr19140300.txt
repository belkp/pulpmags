theodore roosevelt

         m if a hunt in a new wilderness
         i means a great deal more to col

                 bloodthirsty as he is painted the
                 naturalist is stronger in him than
                 the nimrod and he feels the spell
                 of scenery and atmospheric effects
                 as few men do he has hunted
                 the birds with a camera and he
                 knows the trees and the flowers
                 as an accomplished amateur in
                 his current writings he devotes
                 much more space to these things
                 than to the incidents of the chase

                   in this last outing he saw as usual
                   all that was beautiful in the flora
                   of the country and he noted every
                   bird that came within his range of

they ivho knock at our gates

     some twenty years ago there came to america an undersized
     underfed overworked little girl of twelve-one of a million
     steerage immigrants out of the limits of her native pale
     wherein the russian government sought to confine the
     hebrews of the district she came to show america to
     americans the law of the fathers in the march
     american magazine is the first of a new series of articles by

  mary antin

         author of the promised land

service to ii and ours and above
all the rich spiritual offering they
make to america

theres a swing and sweep and
power to her words that bespeak the
burning enthusiasm of cons-iction
mary antin shows us the faith of our
fathers-shows it to us fresh strong
mighty to save as it was in the first
days of the republic we need mary
antin to show us to ourselves-uit
we forget

there is a vision and purpose behind
these articles that reflect well the
vision and purpose of tkt american
magazine and just as they arc typ-
ical of its americanism so too arc
the lighter less serious contributions
in the march number

there is a triangle within a trian-
gleby edgar mien forbesin which

jimmy ohrien rises in the world
and learns the value of a clean shirt
there is an amazing story about a
negro preacher by james d cor-
rothers-himself a negro and an or-
dained minister grant noble is
the hero as great a  center  as har-
mount ever developed as a com-
ment on negro suffrage and as an
index to the negro character the
story is profoundly significant
the souli winning fight with
science by h addington bruce
shows that science is no longer at
war with mans belief in the immor-
tality of the soul

and by the way dont miss james
montgomery flaggs inside tale of
the american magazine office or
his picture of its three glum editors
as they listen to a really funny con-
tribution of his

when you have read these articles
you will know as you have never
known before what the immigrants
arc what they mean to us-they
who knock at our gates

cessor to the promised land

wiien vance wrote the brass bowl lie
drew aside the curtain of night and turned
the flash-light of his story-telling power
into a womans heart when the reading public
opened  the black bag they saw in its depths
the source of cupidity those who took the lid off
the bandbox found the story of vanity love
of finery hunger of jewels and the intrigues horn
of deceit it was a best seller in his   destroying
angel  he fashioned awoman whose lips seemed
a pool of poison and whose shapely arms were as
slaying scimitars whose favor meant failure and
whose kiss was the caress of death vance plays
upon the keyboard of human emotions with a
master hand in his new novel the lone wolf

the hero michael lanyard was a jncuil reared

in the brooding shadows through which slips the
mysterious seine the story opens with lanyard
as a boy a cub taught by pain and experience that
the stroking of kindly hands was as naught com-
pared with the fang of a single foe and so this
creature of the shadows in the beginning driven by
hunger though in the end stimulated by pride in
his art prowled from the slums of paris into the
very hnlls of the mighty at the zenith of his fame
something settled upon the lone wolfs
heart the wild look of hatred went out of his
eyes the snarl bred of pain died in his throat
in this story louis joseph vance discloses a
new angle of his powers it is the love story
in the life of the lone wolf that makes

there is still time for you to decide

you must have a general idea of the characteristics of the new
encyclopaedia britannica for it has been so much used anil quoted
and talked about that it is definitely classed as one of the greatest
achievements of our day but what you probably do not know is that it
is a different kind oj utility booh from any that has ever been published
different in get-up different in contents different in style different in
method of construction different and better suited to your needs in the
fact that it was built for service-for your service

you can decide how mucli the book

----- will mean to you

or to your family only after you have seen
the prospectus srnt free by mail or have
called at one of cur five offices to sec the
books themselves their beautiful bindings in
leather and the wonderful thin strong india

 the price	a few weeks hence

 to  more than at present-will not be an extravagant
price for the book  but it would be an extravagance for you to pay
it needlessly after neglecting this opportunity to pay less

on being alert



to be alert of mind docs not mean that
one must jump to a conclusion but that
when a conclusion has been formed one
must be in readiness to give instant effect to it
the word indeed comes from the old italian
all erta-go to the watch-tower  the
warning which in the eventful middle ages sent
lookouts to their post to see when rapid action
would be necessary

    the public hare shown alertness in recognizing the merits of the
new encyclopaedia britannica those who are alert enough to ob-
tain it now will he just in time to avoid the higher price which is
about to be chargcd for it that alertness has already been dis-
played by more than fifty-eight thousand purchasers

if you become aware today for the first time of the existence
of the new encyclopaedia britannica you could not decide whether
or not to purchase it without previously considering its merits but
you are not in that position the desirability of the book has been
demonstrated as the pictures on those pages amply prove

the inevitable change

tlit impending increase in the price
and the discontinuance of the monthly
payment system are of course regret-
table and if it had been financially
practicable to continue indefinitely the
sale mi the present terms no change
would have been made but the change
is inevitable because the low price tloes
nut yield a profit commensurate with the
large investment  which the
production of an eitlirclv new inventory
of all human knowledge necessitated
those who most wish to see the book in
universal use must accept the inevitable
and it is satisfactory to reflect that within
the next few weeks thousands of persons
will buy it and begin to make use of it who
might otherwise have remained irresolute

why many have waited

it lias been easy to say the book will
still be there if i find i want it but

that cannot much longer be said it will
not be there-in its present accessible
josition it will be where you can get
it if you pay  more than you need
pay today if you pay that higher price
in cash instead of paying the  which is
all you need pay in cash today

  the new price will not be prohibitive
it will on the contrary be considerably
less than the price  per volume at
which former edition- were published it
will be a low price as compared with the
price of other books and oilier articles
which can be compared with the ency-
clopaedia britannica in respect of their
intrinsic value based upon their cost of
production and of their usefulness anil
the pleasure which they afford but
from another point of view a price is
relatively high or low according to who
pays it and the new price will be a high
one for you to pay because you now
have the opportunity in pay so much lets

wlin uita among the  ruvers of an indispensable book
vy nu j yyiiu of universal utility	

it may safely be said that no buyer of the new
encyclopaedia britannica has purchased the work
without first having asked himself is this a good
book and then is it a book that i ought to buy either
for myself or my family

a farm laborer

a fireman

a traveling salesman

a bookkeeper

a retail groccr



a newsman

to the man-or woman-who may say

i do not need the new encyclopaedia britannica 

what will lie your loss if you should thus altogether refrain
from purchasing it

first the loss of available knowledge

il ix impossible by the use of any number of other boohs or
by uny other method of acquiring information to gain the i noidedge
-on ony one of a thousand subjects-of which the need crises
from day io day

second the loss of available pleasure

occasion may suggest your reading an article or answering a
question dealing with science sport art industry politics finance biography history
exploration varai or military operations or any other branch of human activity ard in
every ease a writer of the highest authority tells you a delightfully dear story

third the loss of available efficiency

whatever you are doing-whether it is worn or the pursuit of pleasure-you trill do it
better more satisfactorily and more confidently if you hare the assistance that the new ency-
clopaedia britannica is already gniug to more than fifty-eight thousand other people

you will be sure of making these gains and of avoiding these losses
by signing and mailing now the inquiry form found on the last page

an analysis of several thousand orders for the new encyclo-
paedia britannica shows iu a rough way the proportion of
buyers in different classes

far the largest class amounting to more than one-third of
the total i just above  per cent  is made up of members of
the professions-lawyers doctors clergymen authors etc a
small part of this class is wealthy the great majority of its
numbers are in moderate circumstances

the next largest class constituting more than one-firth
over  per cent is luuniifaclurers and traders large and
small wholesale and retail in this class the small manufact-
urers far outnumber the large and there are of course many
more retail than wholesale merchants

next in size and constituting nearly one-seventh  per
cent are persons iu small businesses or workers with com-
paratively small incomes-clerks bookkeepers stenographers
salesmen agents artisans farmers etc

very nearly as large nearly  per cent of the total i is the
class of universities colleges schools and libraries many being
institutions with small appropriations for books

one-ninth  per cent i of the total is made up of women-
mothers of families women in business or the professions now
so generally followed by women

about one-twentieth  percent of the total of this classified
subscription list is officials of government and public institutions
of these the greater part an- of course on small salaries

onc-tieciily-fourlh  per cent arc bankers and financiers

it is evident that the new encyclopaedia bri-
tannica is being sold not merely to bookish peo-
ple nor to men who have already achieved success
or fame but principally to people who have their
way to make in the world and who cannot afford to
do without it even though their incomes are small
because they recognize in it an aid to advancement

  theodore roosevelt will begin the account
of his experiences as a hunter-naturalist in
the brazilian wilderness in the april num-
ber with an article describing his journey up
the paraguay river to corumba he has long
since gone beyond into unexplored regions
and the result of his explorations and obser-
vations will be antici-
pated with great inter-
est by every reader of
the magazine in an
editorial about his pro-
posed journey theivew

better qualified to ex-
plore the wilds of
south america and to
describe its flora and
fauna and its savage
and tremendous sce-
nery with a sympa-
thetic and kindling
interest than theodore
roosevelt and this
very well expresses the
attitude of every one
who read his african
articles in this arti-
cle he gives a very clear
impression of the pur-
poses of the journey
of the geography of the
regions to be explored

men of the party

  the authors inter-
est in natural history
as is well known is not
confined to the pursuit
of the larger and dan-
gerous game only he is keenly alive to all
life he gives his impressions of the abundant
and varied bird life notes the variations from
the familiar types he knows so well at home
both in song and coloration the aspects of the
country along the river appeal to his sense of
the picturesque in the river teeming with life
he observes the fish among them the dreaded
piranhas the man-eaters the cannibals of the
finny tribe dangerous alike to other fish and

animals and to human beings who swim or
wade in the waters

  one of the most interesting personalities of
the expedition is the rev father zahm an old
friend of mr roosevelts and himself a noted
traveller mr roosevelts party is made up of
men of various types-and is typically american

  in its composition

realizes that though it is a turkish city it is
at the same time still greek in many of its
aspects greek traditions are evident on all
sides to a resident there for some months
the picturesque celebrations of  greek feasts
which will be described by h g dwight in the
april number are among the most interesting
experiences in the city on the bosphorus it
is as a religious community that the greeks
have remained separate since the conquest
through their religious observances they have
what is left them of a national life and assert
their claim to the great traditions of their race

  kenyon cox is everywhere known as one
of our foremost painters and teachers of art
and he is also known to a very large number
of readers as one of the clearest most informing
writers on art of modern times he always
has something of the first importance to say
and he says it in terms that are as easily com-
prehensible to the layman as the painter the

relations between artist and public have
been a subject for discussion since the begin-
nings of art but they have never been more
interesting than in these days of post-impres-
sionists cubists and other manifestations of the
shock-your-grandmother school mr cox
reviews the painters position in the past and
pays his respects with his usual incisiveness to
the faddists

  the enormous engine of modern publicity
has been discovered by these men they have
learned to advertise and they have found that
morbidity eccentricity indecency extremes
of every kind and of any degree are capital
advertisement if one cannot create a sound
and living art one can at least make some-
thing odd enough to be talked about if one
cannot achieve enduring fame one may make
sure of a flaming notoriety and as a money-
maker present notoriety is worth more than
future fame for the speculative dealer is at
hand his interest is in quick returns and
he has no wish to wait until you are famous-
or dead-before he can sell anything you can
do his process is to buy anything he thinks
he can  boom to  boom  it as furiously as
possible and to sell it before the boom col-
lapses then he will exploit something else
and theres the rub

a singer the public rehes solely upon its ear

   building and serving

  to build the best car possible to make
it give ihe greatest possible satisfaction

  that is the purpose of our company

  we state it because we believe it will
help us to gain and hold the favorable
opinion of the public as regards our car
and our methods

  our ideal is simple enough-to produce
the best to serve the best

  our policy of limited manufacture not
more than four cars a day is one of the
practical steps taken to accomplish loco-
mobile quality

  every locomobile employee is instructed
to carry out the company motto quality
instead of quantity he is working for
locomobile quality in production or service

  our phrase the best built car in
america is a purpose an ideal-not a
claim of superiority

  to accomplish our ideal we must supply
transportation of the highest quality

  the cunard line with its wonderful
record for both safety and speed does not
build its ships ordinarily the railroad
does not build its rolling stock the
locomobile is built in the locomobile
shops a plant designed for quality work
it is built from selected materials of the
highest prices and quality and it is made
by expert new england mechanics

  we create our car and father it in-
definitely during its use

  wc try to make the locomobile stylish
luxurious efficient and above all safe

  every part is tested every group of
parts every chassis every car is tested

   our idea in going to all this expense and
trouble is to make every locomobile like
every other locomobile down to the small-
est details that have to do with efficiency
comfort and safety

  a locomobile when delivered to the
owner is watched over by trainer men
employed in our  branches distributed
throughout the country these branches
dedicated to our owners are service sta-
tions as well as salesrooms

  the word service so far as we know
has never been defined we define it as
follows that effort expended by the loco-
mobile organization which produces the
continued satisfaction comfort and safety
of the owner with the least possible incon-
venience and expense

  our branch house system was inaugu-
rated in  our first year as an im-
portant part of our policy

  the information and experience result-
ing from the operation of these branch
houses has enabled us to better our car
and our service every year

especially for scripnkrs magazine

my sophomore year my
irst sea voyage by rare
ood fortune led me to
santiago de cuba of all the
itiesof the pearl of the an-
tilles the oldest and to me
the most beautiful during the war with
spain owing to san juan hill to colonel
roosevelts rough riders and to the fart
that at her harbor mouth our admirals
sank the spanish ships santiago became
famous but when i first visited that
city her history was only of buccaneers
and pirates and except in the secret hopes
of the cuban patriots she was in every-
thing-in tradition customs costumes
architecture - wholly spanish within
her walls the few americans were reimer
the american consul and the mining-engi-
neers of the juragua iron company ard it
was on one of the ore boats of that com-
pany i took my first voyage south the
late william wharton thurston was then
president of the company it was he who
in madrid had obtained from the queen
the concession to carry north the moun-
tain of ore that ten miles from santiago
rose from the sea at siboncy it was his
bribes of diamond rings his banquets-for
one of which in a steamer especially char-
tered he imported a cargo of flowers-his
tact and his manner of the great gentle-
man that won for the company the good
will of the spanish officials it was he
who obtained the loan of regiments of
spanish soldiers to work the ore

for the american company those were
the unhappy days it was the pioneer

vol lv-

period not only had the engineers to
make the dirt fly and clear the jungle to
build bridges barracks hospitals a rail-
road and an ore pier but with diplomacy
to overcome the prejudices and indolence
of a people who since velazquez led them
to santiago had never changed at the
mines from hese same engineers young
and eager and at la cruz in the casa el
presidente perched among royal palms
above the harbor of santiago from thurs-
ton i heard hourly the story of the ameri-
can company of its fight against the moun-
tains agains the indifferent and hostile
spaniard ten years later to that story
i added a love story placed the mines in
an imaginary republic in south america
and succeeded in getting the story which
was called soldiers of fortune pub-
lished in this magazine later it ap-
peared in book form still later the dean
of the american dramatists augustus
thomas turned the novel into a four-act
melodrama which ran successfully for two
years and in stock is still running

  and ten years after that hand in hand
mr thomas and i sailed to santiago
again to tell the same story this time
in a succession of moving pictures

  i am assured by the all-star feature
corporation who organized this expedi-
tion that it was one of the most ambitious
and best-equipped that as yet for the
single purpose of telling a story on a film
have sailed from the united states al-
ready the rights to the reels we shipped
north have been sold to moving-picture
palaces from st petersburg to rio janeiro

and to all of our united states where
each day three million people patronize
the movies some of these three million
may find in the way the pictures are pro-
duced some of the same interest they take

from a royal mail steamer dustin fnmum starts on it journey that
covers two mile of film captain uairett mr thomas
and mr davis bid hitn rood-by

in the pictures it is in that hope that
this is written

  a month before our expedition set sail
mr john h pratt had preceded us to
make the ways straight it was his duty
to secure for our enterrise the good will
of the people of santiago to obtain the
co-operation of the military the civil au-
thorities the juragua iron company
the spanish-american iron company the
police the customs officials to reserve
board and lodging for the twenty members
of our company to engage interpreters
carriages ponies launches and special
trains and in order to pick out loca-
tions as are called the scenes and back-
grounds of a moving-picture play to visit

all haciendas trails forts mines jungles
palm groves water-fronts and harbors
within a ten-mile radius of the city the
rest of mr pratts time was his own

  when one cold morning late last fall our
company sailerl out of new
york harbor it consisted of
three actresses sixteen
actors two camera men a
business manager a stagc-
dircctor our star m r dustin
farnum and mr augustus
thomas who besides being
the director-general of the
all-star coqioration was
also the author of the sce-
nario and two miles of film
in my ignorance for such an
undertaking our expedition
seemed inadequate i did
not then know that to the
moving-picture people all
the worlds a stage and men
and women merely actors i
did not then know that
through the energy of mr
pratt and the subtle and
diplomatic urgings of the di-
rector-general  volunteer
actors by the hundreds
would flock to our standard
that to assist us recruits
would enlist from the side-
walks from mountain passes
from the decks of ships from
the most conservative of
clubs and drawing-rooms i
did not then know that to
many people of all con-
ditions to appear upon a film to see them-
selves as they arc seen by others and to
have their friends see them is a tempta-
tion and an adventure  had not calcu-
lated on a human weakness on the vanity
that even in the heart of the congo leads
a naked wood boy to push in front of
your camera that he will never see the
photograph into which he has projected
himself does not deter him he desires
only that his features which he admires
may be perpetuated that they may attain
immortality even the brief immortality
of a strip of celluloid but whatever the
motive the fact remains that before we
left cuba by the addition of extra peo-
ple a few working for pay the great ma-
the canvas on the ground reflects the light in the face of the actor the numerals held in front of the camera
give the number f the scene about to be photographed

jority out of courtesy our cast of charac-
ters had grown from twenty to two thou-
sand of these were the soldiers of the
garrison at santi-
ago troops of the
guardiaruralesor
mounted constab-
ulary members of
the most distin-
guished of the cu-
ban families all the
spanish workmen
on the pay-roll of
the juragua iron
company with its
rolling-stock and
good-will thrown in
the santiago police
the american navy
and hundreds of
kindly strangers
who for one brief
moment passed be-
fore our camera and
out of our lives

the scenario
prepared by mr

thomas consisted of
two hundred and
thirty-three scenes

and inserts in	why didnt you bri

 pantomime these scenes tell the plot of the
 play later when they are thrown upon
 the screen they will cover ten thousand
 feet of film and in
 passing a given
 point consume two
 hours w here
 pantomime fails to
 make clear the plot
 an insert is used
 an insert may be
 the facsimile of a
 letter telegram or
 any written order
 or it may be a line
 of explanationsuch
 as the president
 grants the ameri-
 can engineer a con-
 cession to work the
 iron ore or it
 may be a bit of di-
 alogue or an excla-
 mation which will
 make clear to the
 audience what the
 actor is saying or
 thinking as i

breaking into the movies

  as mr thomas arranged his scenario
the business of each scene and the word-
ing of each insert were typewritten on a
separate page of cardboard there were
duplicate sets of these cardboards bound
in flexible-leather covers by adjustable
steel springs one set belonging to mr
thomas and the other to his assistant

would read president alvarez in num-
ber six his wife in number live it
sounded as though he were condemning
them to separate cells but by his sys-
tem thomas saved endless confusion as
soon as he had dccided what location
he would use it was necessary only to turn
to the page that called for that location

an impromptu dressing-room mr famum miss brownell mist luilrcll

and stage-director mr william haddock
each page was as neatly ruled and as
methodically planned as ships log each
gave the number of the scene and act
and the business of that scene and
blank spaces were left for recording the
time of day and the kind of sunlight by
which that scene was photographed in
double columns were the names of the
characters to appear in the scene and the
costumes each was to wear the cos-
tumes were described by numerals the
garments a man wore in the mines would
be numbered i his evening clothes
 and if to his evening clothes a belt
and revolver were added that was counted
as a new costume and described by a new
number at first it was confusing

  clay in number four mr thomas

and at a glance he knew what actors were
needed in what clothes they were to ap-
pear and what part of the story they must
carry forward

  in preparing a film play the scenes are
not produced in the order in which later
they appear upon the screen which
scene will be photographed depends upon
the location most available for exam-
ple we were at sea and the scenario called
for scenes on shipboard accordingly
for his stage-setting thomas borrowed the
decks of the royal mail boat on which
we happened to be passengers and for his
backdrop the atlantic ocean one scene
was on board a tramp steamer the other
 a passenger ship so for our tramp
we showed only the bow of the steamship
danube reserving her boat-deck for the
breaking into the movies



liner and as in each scene we needed a
ships captain and the same captain could
not appear on both vessels to the com-
mand of the tramp we promoted the
ships doctor

  captain barrett much to the horror of

  we left the danube at antilla and the
same afternoon arrived in santiago where
at the hotel venus on the plaza de ces-

a perfectly good captain but his actions
on the film are most misleading in real
life he does not beam upon passengers who
try to run his ship in real life to mount
to his bridge as did mr famum and de-
mand instantly to he placed ashore would
lead only to ones being placed in irons
but before the camera captain barrett
could not resist the impetuous gestures of
our star and for him manned a life-boat
and set him ashore at least the chief
officer lowered him as near to the water as
was necessary to escape the eye of the
camera there was a heavy sea running
and farnum clinging to the life-line and
trying to look as though he liked it twice

and the pleasure-seekers circling in the
plaza to inspire or distract us we mapped
out the work for the day to come pratt
had selected many locations and as san-
tiago is one of my home towns i was
able to suggest others so before he turned
in that first evening the director-general
had arranged his programme and hung
up a call for  for the legitimate
actors making their first appearance in
the movies and who regard an -
oclock call as an insult it was in every
sense a terrible awakening

of santiago this is the house that was

and which from the reign of thurston
to that of charles m schwab hus been

scenes in his play sometimes those in the
novel but whenever it was possible he
preferred for his backgrounds the exact
places the novel described so i had the
curious sensation of seeing characters that
had existed only in fiction but which had
been placed in a real setting now appear-
ing in flesh and blood in that real setting
wearing the uniforms or ball dresses i

bor three miles across and the red roofs
of santiago and beyond them a great
circle of mountains with shadows in the
valleys and white clouds resting on the
peaks and for our immediate needs
there were dressing-rooms shower-baths
wicker chairs a library of novels and
at disturbingly frequent intervals trays
loaded with the insidious daiquiri cock-

madnme alvarez and hope escape fnm the palace

had described and which charles dana
gibson had drawn walking in the same
avenue of palms making love in the same
corner of the veranda fortifying the same
iron gates with real machine guns issuing
the same commands to real american
bluejackets it was as puzzling as one of
those moments when you come upon some
spot you know you never have visited
before but which you feel in some other
existence or in a dream you already have
seen

  the manager of the iron company mr
t b whitaker made us welcome at la
cruz and few rehearsals ever were carried
forward under such conditions we were
surrounded by flowering plants and whis-
pering palms below us stretched the liar-

tail this latter is the creation of the
late jennings s cox for some time man-
ager of the iron mines and it is as genial
and as brimful of brotherly love as was
the man who invented it it consists of
barcardi rum limes sugar and cracked
ice and so long as it obtained rehearsals
never dragged and conversation never
flagged

  again i fear it reads like a picnic but
the actors did not find it a picnic for in
the out-of-doors drama one man in his
time plays many parts in the legitimate
drama the hero has only to read lines and
other lines inform the audience that he is
brave that he is daring that in every out-
of-door exercise he excels for the spec-
tators of the silent film such hearsay evi-

num who was mak-
ing his debut in
the film drama
illustrated this
when he played
lieutenant denton
in mr thomass
arizona every
one in the cast ex-
cept the villain told
the audience that
in all the cavalry
denton was the
finest officer and
most daring rider
all denton actually
did in front of the
audience was to
comb his hair
but in the out-of-
doors drama with
all out-of-doors to
work in thomas
did not give far-
num leisure to
comb his hair this
lime thomas could

  to them the actor not tell the spectators his hero was a
pantomime that he rough rider but on horseback sent him to
he must climb the jump precipices and scale ravines and
to be shown far- so proved it it was fortunate for our

star that he enjoyed
the strenuous life
we gave him his
share and when
we did not invent
work he improvised
in one scene he es-
corted the wife of
president alvarez
to the coast where
under a heavy fire
from revolutionists
a shore boat was to
row her to a war-
ship when the

around her what was more important  in new york when thomas engaged
yards of real film were being wasted far- me he explained  he said  i want you
num acted as the hero of a film drama to play mcwilliams its a small part
must act he lift-

ed the lady to his
shoulders and
with the water up
to his arm-pits
plunged into the
surf and carried her

made a far better
scene than the one
we had rehearsed
but if our hero

in which he ap-
peared leighton
stark who is a very
large man and who
cn and off is pos-
sessed with humor

grimly  its a

  one day i asked
him the meaning
of this cryptic ut-
terance

the death of stuart as shown by charles dana
jibson in the novel

but a good one
from that i got the
idea t would spend
most o my time
in cuba sitting
around the plaza
instead of which im
on in every scene of
the play it doesnt
matter whether its
a mining-camp or
a ballroom or a
mountain trail im
in it i have to
drive engines coup-

wear a dress-suit at

  on the other hand miss winifred king-
ston who was madame alvarez the part
played in the stage version by miss dor-

  miss kingston really had much more
to do than to register fear and did it well
but it seemed as though as she said she
always was escaping one would come
across her in lonely mountain trails in
the crowded streets of santiago in avenues
of arching palms with the driver of her

the death of stuart as shown by mr thomas in tile movies

othy donnelly complained that all she
had to do was to escape in a carriage and
register fear

  in the moving-picture language to  reg-
ister anything means to put it on record
on the film if in one scene an actor wears
a certain costume that costume is regis-
tered and once registered in not the
slightest detail may it be altered if a
character walks from a garden into a street
even though the two scenes are photo-
graphed on days a month apart in both his
clothes obviously must bp the same it is
not to be supposed that in passing through
a garden gate his tan shoes changed to
patent leathers and in the same vernac-
ular when a director wants an actor to ex-
press an emotion he tells him to  register 
indignation laughter remorse

state carriage always lashing his horses
while she looked back at imaginary pur-
suers and registered fear for some
time no one but thomas really knew from
just what she was escaping we were cer-
tain only that she was a long time about
it thomas finally explained she was the
wife of the president and was escaping
from the palace where had she remained
the disloyal troops would have shot her
a few days later i found her and her state
carriage in a dripping jungle entirely sur-
rounded hy mosquitoes and an atmos-
phere comparable only to that of a steam-
laundry she was in a ball dress with
arms and shoulders bare and against sev-
eral thousand mosquitoes was making a
hopeless fight

  if i had known she cried punctuat-
ss

breaking into the movies

ing each word with a vicious slap  that
escaping was like this id have stayed in
that palace and got shot

  but the part had its compensations in
her ball gown of blue satin and pearls
with a black-lace mantilla and a towering
crown of tortoise-shell the cubans and
spaniards easily found her the most inter-
esting member of our company that
except on match-boxes and bull-tight fans
no such spanish woman had ever existed

  had impressed me as they have thousands
of others and it was because he possessed
these sterling qualities that  supposed
he had been engaged  was wrong i
found that in choosing his star mr
thomas had considered only whether he
could or could not wear my clothes ev-
ery other leading actor in america had
been measured and found wanting far-
num had survived every test it was
proved that he alone was the man whose

president alvarw gives the signal fr his own evecition this is the actor
who played dead too realistically

did not lessen their loyalty one day she
was escaping at one location when she was
needed at another and i rode after her
carriage to bring it back at a cross-road
i asked a man if he had seen an american
woman pass that way as though still
questioning his eyesight he shook his head

  no he said doubtfully but the
queen of spain just went by

  when in new york  learned that
farnum was to be our star i was natu-
rally delighted as the cow-boy in the
 virginian the union officer in the
 little rebel as the hero of  arizona 
his manliness his force his charming good
humor and the naturalness of his acting

  head my hat would fit whose legs were at
ease in my riding-breeches whose hands
were not lost in my gloves so at enor-
mous expense they engaged him the
plot against my property developed at
the first location the director-general
said critically that coat is the sort of
coat a man would wear in a iniiiing-eamp
lend it to farnum-just for this picture
the next day they borrowed a sombrero
on succeeding days riding-boots leather
gaiters gauntlets coats of khaki coats
of pongee gray flannel shirts white flan-
nel trousers tan shoes tennis-shoes my
riding-whip my raincoat my revolver
and when to cover my nakedness i
in the patio of a private house the hostess and her friends watch rehearsals for the movies

begged that any part of my clothing be
returned i was greeted with exclamations
of amazement and reproach

  impossible they cried every-
thing you own is registered

  by that time i had learned that to get
back anything that has once been regis-
tered is as easy as to take the crown jewels
from the tower of london there was
one saving clause having been told he
was to play a mining-engineer who spent
his time either on a horse or in the mines
farnum had brought with him perfectly
good evening clothes and a high silk hat
so i was still able to go about at night

  before we arrived in cuba there was a
rumor we were coming to reproduce the
battle of san juan hill and that we wished
to use the soldiers of the garrison to repre-
sent american and spanish troops it
took some time to make it clear that the
soldiers were to represent an army which
existed only in a novel and on the stage
when thanks to the diplomacy of mr
thomas and of our consul mr r e
holladay this was understood nothing
could have been more courteous and

friendly than the attitude of the cuban
government as represented by the min-
ister of foreign affairs in havana and of
colonel w i consuegra commanding
the garrison of santiago province and of
his chief-of-staff major cucro at the
disposition of our director-general they
placed as many of two thousand infantry-
men and of the mounted guardia rurales
as we needed they stipulated only that
the soldiers should not appear under any
other flag than that of cuba to meet
this very proper condition thomas in-
vented a lag of his own submitted it to
colonel consuegra and on its receiving
that officers approval issued it to the
troops and if the cuban troops light
under their own flag as they fought for
us under the green-and-white banner of
olancho their enemies had best keep
away from cuba they fought so well
that at what we called the battle of
obras tubiica two were wounded and at
the battle of el guao three more were
sent to the hospital that the list of cas-
ualties was no larger was not due to any
caution on the part of the lighting men

they were told to charge the gates of	selves were excellent actors they quick-

the public works which for the time be-	ly understood and moved with spirit and

ing represented the gatesof the presidents	with never a glance at the camera only

palace we meant they were to charge	once were they embarrassed that was

the palace guard who were holding the	when a firing squad that had been told

gates to drive them back and then to	off to shoot john santoplis as president

to mr thomas md the camera man all the worlds a stage even
the deck uf a ship

open up so that the cavalry could pursue
but in an excess of realism the palace
guard before they fled bolted the gates
we feared our picture was ruined we
did not know the discipline of the cuban
soldiers they had been told to take
those gates-so they took them mount-
ing on the shoulders of their comrades
they flung themselves across the sharp
iron spikes and while some were impaled
others with the butts of their rifles drove
the gates open at that moment the
troopers eager to get into action charged
at a gallop and rode them down i
thought at least a dozen men had been
injured and the only moving picture i
foresaw was an exceedingly moving one
of thomas and myself in the dungeons of
morro castle but the more our sham
battles approached the real thing the
more the soldiers enjoyed them and
whether led by their own officers or by the
actors in our play they fought marched
and drilled like veterans they them-

alvarez thought they had killed him al-
varez was placed with his back to a cem-
etery wall and by dropping the handker-
chief with which they had tried to bind his
eyes gave the signal for his own execution
as the rifles cracked he crumpled up
pitched forward and fell face downward
he supposed the camera would show the
firing squad reform and inarch auay so
he remained motionless the tiring squad
did not march away but with increasing
concern waited for alvarez to come to life
the prostrate figure did not move min-
utes seemed to pass and to every one came
the terrible thought that the men had
been served with ball cartridges and
then to the delight of the firing squad and

	answer to the excited appeals of the
americans santoplis rose leisurely and
brushed the dust from his trousers

  on another morning a soldier played
with such realism that he nearly lost us
a valuable actor the soldier had been
rehearsed to shoot george stilwcll who
breaking into the movies



played captain stuart he stood with-
in three yards of stilwell and thomas
warned him not to aim at the actor but
at a pencil-mark which thomas scratched
on the wall when the moment came the
soldier could see in stuart only the enemy
and banged at him point-blank and all
that saved stilwell was thomass flag
which was floating at his side and which
received the wadding and powder as it
was for some time after he came to life
stilwell insisted that the top of his head
was missing sometimes an accident
gave thomas a scene he preferred to the
one he rehearsed sam coit as the
american consul had to ride a donkey
into the presence of an officer command-
ing a united states war-ship and demand
protection frantically working spurs
and whip sam approached at a gallop
but just as he reached the officer the
donkey in disgust threw out his front legs
and sent the american consul hurtling
through space it was a better entrance
than the one prepared and appreciating
this coit while still on his knees began
to beg for a war-ship

  the hon josephus daniels believes by
methods that are legitimate in adding if
that be possible to the popularity of the
navy and it was owing to him and to
his generous point of view and to the fact
that with the present administration mr
thomas is persona grata that we were per-
mitted to show in our pictures american
war-ships and bluejackets indeed the
use we might make of them seemed so un-
limited that i wanted to take a moving
picture of our sailors marching into the
city of mexico but on looking through
his scenario thomas said he could find
no such incident instead i had the priv-
ilege of watching cuban soldiers and our
own bluejackets marching in the same
column they were under the green-and-
white flag of olancho when last i had
seen them together they were allies and
fighting under flags of a very different
color

  should a company of actors of any for-
eign country come to new york and pro-
pose to use central park as a battle-
ground and fire volleys across madison
square you can imagine the permits the
mayor the police the bureau of combus-
tibles the park commissioner and the
vol lv-

fire department would require of them
it also followed that when we invaded
santiago we were not at once given a free
hand our purpose at first was mis-
understood and often in our ignorance
we neglected to apply for permits to the
proper authorities difficulties arose that
as strangers we could not foresee and the
first week of our visit was spent in cabling
and telegraphing in visiting high officials
and in obtaining credentials if during
that same week our legation in havana
handled as many international questions
as diplomatically as did augustus thomas
at our end of the island it should be
elevated to an embassy i admit mr
thomas is our leading dramatist i grant
he honors the gold medal of the insti-
tute of arts and letters but i feel that as
a playwright his genius is wasted any
man who in a foreign country can com-
mand the loyal services of the army of
that country of his own navy of the de-
partment of state as represented by our
legation consul holladay and vice-
consul morgan of the street-car lines
the electric-lighting company the police
and the roman catholic church should
be a general or an ambassador if any
one questions this conclusion i refer him
to the battle of the plaza aquilera on
that occasion under the orders of mr
thomas two thousand soldiers and civil-
ians acted before his camera the tac-
tics and strategy of the battle itself were
worked out by thomas and the cuban
officers on many maps and as methodic-
ally as for a real attack street-car lines
were tied up all traffic was halted and
among those present were the highest
officials of the church army and state
and the first families of santiago who for
days before had reserved windows and
balconies and when the battle finally
came off they greeted it as they always
did our out-of-door performances with
the most courteous applause

  as a matter of fact all of our perform-
ances were out of doors this was pos-
sible only because the action of the play
was laid in spanish america where the
indoor life of the people is largely spent
in the patio or the court around which
the house is built and which lies open
to the sky and sun not once were we
forced to build a scene or use studio


breaking into the movies

locations our interiors were just as
solid and real as our palm groves and
mountains and jusl as beautiful for
when the good people of santiago under-
stood that we wished to photograph their
houses and gardens because we so greatly
admired them with the most charming
courtesy they invited us to photograph
what we pleased in twenty years of
visits to santiago it has been my priv-
ilege to know some of the cuban families
and these made us known to others
from one we borrowed a background or
a fountain from another a pair of marble
stairs from the roof of another a view of
the harbor in this way our presidents
palace spread over half the city senor
batelle graciously gave us the use of his
patio senora schumann the ornamental
entrance gates herman michaelsen the
german consul the garden the san
carlos club loaned us one of the most
beautiful ballrooms on this continent-it
is entirely of marble and our rear en-
trance we stole from the public works
the black stallion with his saddle of silver
ridden by our star was loaned us by senor
prudencio bravo and that was the least
of his many courtesies

  when we made use of a private house
our host and hostess as a rule telephoned
their friends and as a result we rehearsed
before a large and interested gallery one
gentleman who had loaned us his garden
had built a chapel in memory of his father
which on the morning we visited his house
was consecrated with high mass his re-
turn from that ceremony was so abrupt
that one of his friendscommented upon the
fact our host shrugged his shoulders

  any time i can say my prayers he
explained but i seldom can see a man
murdered in my own patio

  under these unusual but charming con-
ditions rehearsals took on a social aspect
which was demoralizing our paid assist-
ants and interpreters were ousted from
their jobs by the gilded youth of santiagos
four hundred and when the young ladies
of the company were called to rehearse a
ride for life they were found at afternoon
tea

  after one has watched rehearsals under
these conditions the traditions and mys-
teries that surround those held in the
theatre seem rather silly have you ever

tried to get word to a man who is directing
a rehearsal or when you were directing a
rehearsal have you had the members of
your family your best friend a man who
is trying to pay you money hurled from
the stage-door or permitted to approach
you only on his tiptoes

  when the lady who is sweeping out the
auditorium lets fall her mop have not you
heard the star and the author and the
stage-manager all shriek my god how
can we work in all this tumult i re-
called the holy calm the awful secrecy of
those rehearsals behind closed doors when
 saw thomas and the company bowing
and picking their way among the first
families and murmuring no se mueva
usted or in the street dodging trolley-
car automobiles and sun-stroke while
our fifteen policemen struggled with a
mob of five or six hundred people

   amidst all this riot there was one figure
that remained calm even the imper-
turbability of our director-general could
not surpass his poise he was the man
behind the camera while actors inter-
preters policemen fretted and perspired
he coldly waited for no matter what the
others may plot the only thing that counts
is what he registers and the last word
always is his he is all-powerful he can
cut out the love scene of the hero to
cut in a messenger approaching on
horseback or follow him as he climbs the
mountain or as he gallops at right angles
to the camera pan him to pan is
to make of the picture a panorama some
think nothing is required of the camera
man but to turn the handle were that
so the ideal camera man would graduate
from a street-organ he must be much
more than a motive power he should
have three hands to keep the film evenly
unrolling to swing the eye of the camera
left or right to elevate or depress it he
must possess a mind that acts faster than
can any number of humans and animals
an eye to follow every object in the radius
of his finder the patience of job and the
nerve of a chilled-steel safe we had such

is easy enough to lose ones
haracter but sometimes
ery hard to get rid of a well-
leserved reputation so
lcter sanders discovered
he had abdicated his
throne as king of american gamblers rather
than recognize the suzerainty of district at-
torneys he could never have been con-
tented to rule in a small way or to evade by
craft a show of force on the part of powers
which had a standing army of police at their
command when diplomacy failed he had
elected like other wise monarchs of recent
days to live in dignified and opulent re-
tirement for some years he had enjoyed
the immunity from care and the absolute
leisure that all ex-kings who do not plot to
regain their thrones know to the full

  for nearly the same length of time how-
ever he had found both his retirement and
his leisure too absolute he had chafed
at his complete idleness and his complete
isolation plans cherished in busier days
for self-improvcmcnt when he should have
time for it somehow came to nothing and
partly because he was so much thrown back

on his own society in his enforced wan-
derings he could read only the books at
hand and he lacked the stimulus of intel-
lectual companionship with the instincts
of many another scholarly gentleman just
passing middle age for a solitude tempered
with the choicest distillation of society he
found himsel condemned to associate ei-
ther with sharpers or with his valet in a
philistine world he seldom came upon a
man sufficiently unscrupulous or fearless of
evil report to treat him civilly whose con-
versation was not extremely dull he ab-
horred the fraternity of gamblers now that
he had no business with them and henry
was no adequate substitute for a circle of
cultivated men and women

  he had made a few excursions in respect-
ability but tentative and furtive excur-
sions which had ended in some sort of
disaster or other a cynicism bred by watch-
ing his victims in other years had been in-
tensified by observing the efforts of the
righteous to avoid the moral contamination
of his presence yet he knew by experi-
ment that just so long as his name and con-
sequently his reputation were hidden the


experience

people whom he liked liked him it had
all been very discouraging

  more to pass the time than with any
hope of escape from himself he took pas-
sage one april from new york to ply-
mouth he wished to attend a book auc-
tion at sothebys on the th but he had
no plans beyond that he was drifting
and the currents not infrequently swept
him to the other hemisphere he escaped
reporters when he boarded the sardonic
by the expedient of having entered his name
on the passenger list as p smith esq
monarchs are objects of public interest even
in exile and must travel either much her-
alded or incognito mr sanderss quiet
taste preferred the latter course aboard
ship he avoided publicity by keeping to his
very comfortable state-room on the prome-
nade deck and well forward or to his chair
in a sheltered spot close by where henry
could unobtrusively make him quite un-
recognizable with two rugs and a woollen
cap

  during the first two days at sea however
mr sanders did not need to avoid inquisi-
tive fellow passengers by studied seclusion
for he was a bad sailor when he ventured
 deck the third morning he was still too
miserable to care whether he was recognized
or not revived by the sun-tilled atmos-
phere and accustomed at length to the
steady lope of the racing steamer he began
by afternoon to watch with some interest the
procession of promenaders from his cov-
ert of rugs he could review the endless
chain of chattering persons which wound by
as if impelled by the throbbing engines
mr sanders was still bilious and a little in-
clined to resent the superabundant health
that was evident in the free gait of the care-
fully veiled women and in the reddening
cheeks of the men he wondered how they
had the heart to ignore so completely the
rise and fall of the deck he himself felt so
unnerved and miserable that their vigor
seemed to him mere bravado

  yet he liked to watch them after all he
felt a queer happiness in being so near to
them even though he was doing his best to
evade recognition lie found as always
was the case on shipboard an odd pleasure
in making part of a company which during
several days must suffer perforce the same
fate as he they were the comrades of
peter sanders though the majority of them

would have done anything in their power to
escape the possibility of such an infamy
that he knew and he hated the thought of
it he wished to be upright and he fell
himself to be in all essentials the equal in
virtue of these people of good repute who
had their friends and their expectations
of friends their freedom to come and go
without restriction in the circles of which
they made a part he was frankly envious
both of their animated health and of their
companionships though the cynicism of ex-
perience made him sure that most of them
had guilty secrets of their own

  one young woman he observed with es-
pecial interest for an hour or more she
passed and repassed his chair at regular
intervals she did not bounce along like
so many of the women she was quietly
dressed slender and dark she was a wel-
come relief to a critical eye that disapproved
of all jews and of most representatives of
other races she seemed to be more than
twenty though the upper limit of her possi-
ble age he could not guess perhaps she
was twenty-five

  there would be  excuse mr sanders
felt for venting his misanthropic scorn upon
this girl he could not imagine her to be
the guardian of any family skeleton or the
prey of any improper desires he would
like to talk with her if he were well enough
to talk he wondered who she was and
where she camc from every time she cut
the lines of the railing in front of his chair
he opened his pursy eyes a little though he
lay quiet all the while with the deathlike
stillness of the seasick she had for him
the charm of real refinement and utter re-
spectability with her rapid even step
her eager face bent seaward half the time as
if she were some wild thing with kinship
to the deep she seemed to peter sanders
the embodiment of romance and youth

  the afternoon was waning and the chill
of the north atlantic began to penetrate his
covers he suspected that they were going
to run into fog the damned siren will
keep me awake all night he reflected
he grunted two or three times to mark
his emergence from his day-dreams san-
ders youre a fool he said to himself
that girl wouldnt talk to you if we were
shipwrecked on a desert island and you
know it he welcomed the coming of his
valet
experience



  shall i help you in sir asked henry
the first gong has rung

  reclining in his luxurious state-room mr
sanders ate his dinner of recovery after
many hours of sleep he woke the next morn-
ing quite rehabilitated and able to enjoy the
clean sunlight of mid-ocean lie took an
early breakfast in his own room for he had
no mind to expose himself to ihe people and
the stuffiness below or to the service of any
one less skilful than henry he liked his
breakfast and afterward while the deck
was still comparatively deserted he took a
walk it was about the middle of the morn-
ing when henry brought him with a cup
of bouillon specially prepared his opera-
glasses

  excuse me mr sanders said the
man but theres a rather large steamer
approaching off the starboard bow 
thought it might amuse you to look at her
as she passes sir

  thanks henry replied mr sanders
sipping the bouillon  it will be highly ex-
citing perhaps you think that id better
try a game of shufile-board too or turn a
few handsprings to avoid ennui

   im sorry sir said henry in a tone
from which even his faultless breeding was
unable to keep a trace of injured feeling
 but i thought as youd been in bed so long
sir-

  you are quite right as you imply im
a beast as a matter of fact i shall lie glad
to look at the steamer only youre never
ill so you cant appreciate the difficulty of
being both seasick and polite you may
take the cup now

  assisted by henry who forthwith disap-
peared mr sanders rose mechanically
he adjusted the glasses and steadying him-
self by the rail gazed at a small passenger-
steamer which trailed a line of dirty smoke
not far off to starboard he was profound-
ly uninterested but felt that courtesy to his
valet demanded a show of concern one
did not have so excellent a servant with im-
punity

  he had just decided that it made no dif-
ference to what blanked line the steamer
belonged-it looked even more disgusting
than the sardonic-when he was startled
by a rather sharp voice which evidently
was addressing him  i beg your pardon
can you tell me what she is

  he turned and recognized with amaze-

ment the girl he had watched the previous
afternoon she stood quite unabashed
awaiting his answer he on the other
hand was unable to conceal his embarrass-
ment and both blushed and stammered

  i-im very sorry-not to be able to
tell you w-would you look my eyes
are not what they were

  she acccpted the glasses readily with
an interjected word of thanks while she
stood gazing at the boat which was now
directly amidships she gave him an excel-
lent opportunity to observe her he liked
her even better at close range and motion-
less than lie had the day before he didnt
see how her appearance could have been
altered for the better she was trim and
admirably clothed she carried herself
well her small features were cut for beauty
no less than for intelligence he liked the
upward llash of her dark eyes as she re-
turned the glasses

  i cant make it out either the fun-
nels are red and black but shes not a
cunarder

  perhaps i could find one of the offi-
cers suggested mr sanders tentatively
he had recovered his self-possession and
with it his ordinary courteous suavity of
manner

  it doesnt matter really-it was the
idlest impulse that made me ask you
please dont bother i had no right to
trouble you with my question and it isnt
precisely good manners to be talking with
you of course

  it is a great pleasure to me i assure
you said mr sanders with reassuring
gravity i was feeling rather lonely
then you have no friends aboard
the young lady made her speech half com-
ment and half question that must be
rather stupid im not overwhelmed with
acquaintances myself i know two old la-
dies and the elderly banker who sits next
me at table but im with my aunt

  you are more fortunate than i he
answered  i suppose youre never lonely
she laughed ought i to be you
see how easily i scrape acquaintance when
i wish but ordinarily i assure you im
much more conventional than this

  i am the more honored by the excep-
tion said mr sanders with a bow but
isnt it perhaps dangerous to make ex-
ceptions particularly on an atlantic liner
experience

you see im an old fellow and dont pre-
cisely know the limits of convention nowa-
days

    deserve the reproof she answered
smiling at him frankly  but i think youre
paying me an undeserved compliment in
supposing that i need to be chaperoned
every minute one doesnt go through
college quite for nothing one gains at least
the confident belief of the world in ones
abiliy tu look out for oneself

  but youre not- mr sanders did
not conceal his genuine surprise ive
never had the pleasure before of talking
with so learned a lady at least not to my
certain knowledge im not even a college
graduate myself but that was a mistake
a mistake

   in the arrangements of nature i ought
to have gone to college i should have had
a more interesting life

  but you must have done interesting
things thats a perfectly conventional
thing to say-she spoke protestingly-
only i mean it

   oh business is i suppose always busi-
ncss answered mr sanders with a curi
ous shrug of his- fat shoulders

   but big deals and that sort of thing
youve surely made them or-or you
wouldnt be travelling with a man servant
i saw him leave you just now she endec
with a laugh and crossing her arms on the
railing looked up at him little-girl-fashion

  yes lie admitted doubtfully ive
been in some deals ive managed some
pretty big ones but they dont interest
me id rather have your knowledge thar
my experience

  how absurd she exclaimed have
you still to discover that experience not
knowledge is what one goes to college for
nowadays  

  he gasped a little not to get learn-
ing boys and girls both  what kind of
experience

   oh of life she made merry over his
evident bewilderment  they dont know
anything about life and most of their pro-
fessors dont either so the- all learn from
one another its extraordinarily simple
dont you see

   i see said mr sanders that you are
making fun of me which is very wrong of
you please remember that im an old
man who hasnt been to college and so

hasnt any experience of life and dont
forget that ive never talked with a lady who
had a college education before i met you

  but you havent met me she re-
sponded a little uneasily  i dont know
why i should go on talking with you like
this-except that i like it seriously you
must have had a great deal of experience
with people

  with some kinds but mostly with
men lie had somehow the feeling that
he was being pushed by her innocence that
he was on the verge of damaging revela-
tions what would the aunt say if she
knew that her niece had fallen into conver-
sation with the notorious peter sanders
despite his rebellion against the code that
made him an outcast he couldnt help feel-
ing responsible for the reputation of this
young creature who was so carelessly talk-
ing with him he wondered with bitter
irony why the olvicers didnt post a warning
against gamblers in the ladies cabin as well
as in the smoking-room he caught only
the end of the girls next remark

  -so much better worth while men
who can talk at all always have something
to say

  im afraid you flatter us he answered
at least most men cant talk at all and
most women can talk always do you
happen to remember juvenals wicked de-
scription 

  cedunt rrammatici vincuntur rhetores om-
        nis

   turba tacet    verborum tanta cadit vis

  im afraid that i dont said the girl
opening her eyes very wide i dont
even know what it means but perhaps
thats an advantage

   it means returned mr sanders with a
grave face that whatever woman says is
right to the mind of any gentleman that
is why it is wicked

  i dont believe i do understand she
said looking very much puzzled like
all my kind i suppose i still have the super-
stition of academic training we are sur-
prised when we hear a gentleman quote
latin particularly if he says that he never
took a college degree

  on your own showing you see i
didnt go to college so i may be permitted
to know something-a very little-about
books ive had time
experience

  but you said you were in business

  i was but im very idle now i cum-
ber the ground and sometimes read by
the way you cant have been through col-
lege long he felt that he was very bold
but he had the excuse of her questions to
him

   oh almost a year she answered  i
got my degree last june

  not so long as ive been through with
business ive had more time than you to
grow wise only  dont know how very well
there ought to be a new kind of college for
old men with nothing to do but improve
their minds

  what an amusing idea commented
the young lady  what would they teach 
 lessons in the conduct and associations
of life i suppose ive just thought of the
plan nobody admitted under fifty-five
from what you tell me i judge that a course
in human experience would be the best in-
centive to the study of books the lec-
turers would be recent graduates of colleges
particularly of womens colleges which
would be very pleasant indeed for the old
gentlemen who attended dont you think
it a good idea

   i think youre making fun of me now
answered the young lady  but im not sure
but what i like it one doesnt often have
such a conversation as this she bent
forward and looked over the rail at the bub-
bling water as she made the avowal turning
her head quite away from her companion

  he laughed one would suppose you
had led a very arid and unadventurous
life he said whereas im sure you cant
have got beyond chaperons without need-
ing them

  life is very dull she countered with
the easy cynicism of the very young but she
blushed vividly

  i usually find it so but not this morn-
ing said mr sanders you are very
exciting-to a recluse anyway

  a rcclusc she was clcvcr about
leading the conversation away from herself

  every person in retirement is a recluse
a hermit doesnt need to have any of the vir-
tues you know cxcept the ability to hold
his tongue im not a very good hermit i
admit but ordinarily i talk to no one ex-
cept henry-my man i mean

  and you find me more exciting than
henry is that a compliment too she

laughed in turn having recovered her self-
possession

  thats the kind of compliment that re-
cluses pay yes theyre not clever people
or they wouldnt be hermits he beamed
for he felt that he was acquitting himself
very well

  she beamed also i stick to it that
youre extraordinarily interesting to talk
with im going to do it some more if youll
let me i must go back to my aunt now or
shell think ive fallen overboard im go-
ing to be unconventional again-i warn
you you see my name is paula smith
she held out her hand  what is yours

  it was one of the few occasions in his life
when peter sanders lost his wits miss
smiths appalling frankness broke down
his guard unhesitatingly unthinkingly
quite as though he had no scandalous past
he took her hand and answered im
very glad to have met you now and he
added the fatal name sanders

  he was panic-stricken at once where
would she run to cover would she go
trembling to her aunt or to the captain
she would certainly turn in flight from the
horror of the revelation so self-conscious
was he about his reputation that he could
not immediately grasp the meaning of her
reaction lie bad jiol believed such inno-
cence possible she tightened her grasp
of his hand momentarily and said as she
withdrew it it has been such a nice
morning air sanders ill see you again
soon good-by

  with a gay nod she disappeared into
a doorway down the deck leaving air
sanders much shaken and utterly at a loss
to explain the encounter

  what in h-heavens name does it
mean he murmured

  lie was surprised on entering his state-
room to find henry making ready to re-
ceive the luncheon-tray he could scarcely
believe that the morning had so far gone
but he had enjoyed himself the pity was
that the experience couldnt be repeated
now that he had revealed his name she
would soon find out and the whole ship-
load as well who he was the wonder
was that she had not taken in the full enor-
mity of the situation at once he should
see her again only at a distance it was a
pity though he realized that he had no rea-
son to expect anything else
s

experience

  he was quite as much mystified by the
young ladys conduct moreover as lie was
disgusted by his own awkwardness he
was not so witless as not to see that her first
question about the steamer had been merely
an excuse for addressing him but he was
very far from fathoming why she wished
the excuse though his experience of wom-
en was the slightest he was not so fatuous
as to suppose himself in any way attractive
to the boldest young person he was almost
an old man he recognized and he was ap-
proaching both obesity and baldness be-
sides he could not fail to see that his young
lady was in every particular a nice girl
irreproachable as his own conduct toward
the other sex had been throughout a sensa-
tional career he had known for thirty-five
years the ear-marks of feminine impropri-
ety lie was an elderly galahad who
could not be deceived by the most perfect
counterfeit of virtue he would take a
thousand to one on this girls being what
she seemed and she seemed to him a
charming young lady as interesting as she
was pretty in only one particular could
he wish her different her voice was un-
modulated and to his critical ear rather
shrill that was part of her americanism
he supposed he had heard the kind of
voice lie liked in woman-he quoted lears
phrase to himself-even though he had
seldom talked with any one who used it
otherwise she was perfect a joy to all the
senses and to the most delicate standards of
taste

  what puzzled peter sanders was the diffi-
culty when you considered her admirable
qualities of finding any reasonable explana-
tion for his conversation with her obvi-
ously she hadnt known who he was else
she would never have addressed him just
as clearly she was not the kind to address a
stranger without excuse she had not been
interested in the steamer and she couldnt
have felt any interest in him between the
two horns of this dilemma he was tossed
uneasily all day long he pondered the
chances and spent himself in trying to work
out a solution just as many of his victims
had in other days vainly attempted to find
a system that should impoverish him
the odds were all against him now he
realized that he did not understand the
workings of the game at last he gave up
tle problem altogether concluding that an

inscrutable providence had given him an
opportunity for which he should be thank-
ful he had talked on equal terms for
once with a kind of human being such as
before he had never known

  lie did not see miss smith again that day
even at a distance if she walked she
walked on the other side of the ship when
henry after dinner asked his master if he
would go out again to see the moonlight on
the water he was astounded at the reply
which accompanied a whimsically melan-
choly shake of the head

  no henry its no use i fear it has
been the dark of the moon for me since mid-
day

  i beg pardon sir said henry

  the disappearance of diana ex-
plained mr sanders but you wont
understand i fear since youve never taken
the trouble to get up your mythological as-
tronomy

  very good sir henry answered with
equal gravity for there were things that he
never tried to understand then i think
perhaps youd better be got to bed sir

  the following morning mr sanders sat
reading yet not greatly absorbed when he
saw his diana wandering aimlessly along
the deck to his astonishment she nodded
to him in the friendliest fashion as she
approached some feeble aftermath of
youthful pride made him dislike to get out
of his chair in her immediate presence
he struggled wildly to release himself from
his covers it was not easy for a person so
rotund as he to rise gracefully from a steam-
er chair with all his efforts he was in the
act of it a struggling mass of rugs and
ilesli when she came opposite she could
not fail to notice the spectacle but she
showed her good breeding by ignoring it
and greeted him demurely

  do you feel like taking a turn mr
sanders she inquired  if you do wont
you join me

  if i may he answered and took his
place at her side greatly wondering at his
good luck and a little doubting the propriety
of his conduct it was awkward he cer-
tainly didnt wish to make the girl conspicu-
ous by exhibiting himself in company with
her but he couldnt in decency decline her
invitation

  my aunt is in her state-room with a
headache this morning she volunteered
he lei his heavy eyes close till uey were the merest slits and made an answer that he recognized as inane -page a

 vol lv-	
experience

i have been told that the kindest thing i
can do is to stay away till lunch-time so im
particularly grateful to have some one talk
to ne

  and i am particularly grateful to be
humbly serviceable to you he returned
with heavy-handed gallantry

  by the way remarked miss smith  i
looked for your name in the list of passen-
gers and it seems not to be there have
you noticed 

  i confess i havent seen the list an-
swered mr sanders with an effort im
a bad sailor you see and have my meals
brought up here theyve probably made
some mistake about my name its not
uncommon he was taking care not to
repeat his blunder of the previous day

   perhaps theyve set you down under my
name said the girl lightly theres a
mr p smith aboard who was assigned a
seat at the table with us but he hasnt come
to the dining-room at all

  perhaps they have  he replied glad to
be furnished with so reasonable an expla-
nation that would be odd wouldnt it 
i must look into the matter

  both of them laughed and the conversa-
tion drifted off through a discussion about
errors in names ami cases of secondary
personality to a variety of other topics of
equal interest mr sanders forgot both his
fears and his scruples and kept in mind
only his desiie to make the girl so far reveal
her tastes and experiences that he might
discover her reason for making friends with
him he had no difficulty in persuading
her o tell what she knew of books and pic-
tures she gave her opinions frankly ex-
pressing her preferences and dislikes with-
out any trace of self-consciousness her
rcticcncc began only when the talk fell on
themes that might betray her family con-
nections and personal life she did not
even reveal the name of her college though
references to it were frequent mr san-
ders was too fearful about overstepping the
boundaries of decorum to question her he
had the instincts of a gentleman without
the habit of talking with well-bred women
he learned that she preferred rossetti to
byron but he did not find out whether she
had been reared in town or country he
had the impression every time the conver-
sation veered to himself just as he had got
it on the previous day that he was being

prodded a little to reveal his own expe-
riences as well as his attitude to things in
general though by no word or play of
feature did she indicate that she had any
suspicion of his identity with the peter
sanders of shameful eminence she seemed
to think that he must have a fund of inter-
esting stories at command

  he would have been glad to saisfy his
companions wliini except that he could
think of few experiences that seemed proper
to relate if he told her how he succeeded
in ousting dick harris from the ccntrol of
plutocratic gambling she would be shocked
and go awav though the struggle had been
exciting if he sketched the most approved
methods of lleecing young gentlemen of
fortune she would think him horrid
his life and his craft seemed singularly ill
fitted to be subjects of conversation with a
delicately nurtured young lady besides
they didnt interest him in the very least
he preferred to appear an elderly nonentity
rather than a celebrated rascal she was
too inexperienced he felt sure to make
allowances

  it all came to a head at length as they
halted in a sheltered sunny corner behind
the bridge and sat down on the edge of
some kind of glazed arrangement for light
and ventilation

  i wish she said hesitatingly you
would tell me-you said yesterday that
youd put through some big deals-which
one of them interested you most my
world is singularly lacking in chances for
adventure and i have to get romance at
second hand

  though she put it in such a tentative
fashion a horri jle suspicion shot through
mr sanderss mind that she might have
guessed his guilty secret it was  course
absurd she wouldnt have come back
if she had divined she was probing the
sore quite innocently and in the ruthless
way that innocents have he did not know
how to reply without being impolite and he
needed all his experience of many years to
keep from showing what he felt he let
his heavy eyes close till they were the merest
slits and made an answer that he recog-
nized as inane

  romance  suppose is always what
somebody else has certainly im as pro-
saic a person as ever was fat men like
me dont have adventures
experience

  fortune doesnt take account of the
figure does it she responded smiling
you admit that youve made a fortune
yet you are shy of instructing my igno-
rance about the strange ways of it noth-
ing seems tome more romantic than making
ones fortune

   its grubby while youre doing it he
replied all businesses are pretty much
alike youve got something or you can
make something that other people want
and you sell as much as possible of it every
day thats the whole game

  not when you make deals i should
suppose-big deals the girl suggested
that must be much more thrilling
not a bit less grubby anyhow he
was evasive and he chose his words care-
fully chance plays a big part and-
well-being willing to take advantage of the
other fellows disadvantages

    it must be great fun though she said
reflectively clasping her knees with her
hands to stake everything on a single
moment to plunge in and hope to get out
somehow

  mr sanders shrugged his shoulders
 only a fool does that and he loses almost
every time he always loses in the end
the man wins who has calculated the
chances most accurately and who squeezes
hardest

  you make it sound like a combina-
tion of mathematics and football she re-
marked laughingly

  thats not such a bad description i
had a good string of-houses before i re-
tired but t never stood to lose more than
i could afford and whenever a man got
in my way i kicked him out does that
sound brutal

  a little perhaps but i suppose it was
necessary she seemed absorbed by his
words a picture of uncritical innocence

  my business was like everybodys he
went on i had to do it or go under
finally i had to quit-but thats another
story it hasnt been a romantic career
you see

  that depends altogether on the cir-
cumstances i should say how you took
chances and why you quit

  oh i was forced out the public
didnt want what i had to give-or pre-
tended not to at any rate they got rid
of me he ended with the air of having

completely unbosomed himself and lie felt
satisfied with his performance

  somebody kicked you out do you
mean you got in somebodys way
the young lady demanded an even more
explicit statement or did the business
decline im afraid youll think me shock-
ingly inquisitive mr sanders but im
really interested to learn how things go
in a world from vchich im barred out i
like the element of chance-the gambling i
suppose it is there are disadvantages

about being a woman

  mr sanders laughed easily in my
opinion he said you dont lose anything
youre not barred in at any rate as ive
been for a good many years as to the cir-
cumstances of my retirement all ive said
is true the business did decline at least
my business did and i was forced out
i dont mean that other concerns dont
keep on thats why im bitter about it
though i long ago ceased to feel any interest
in the business a man doesnt like to have
his game blocked thats all

  of course not said the girl one
understands that but you make the whole
thing sound dreadfully prosaic somehow
dont you think youre a little unkind to
prick the bubble that ive blown if no
good business mar really plays a gambling
game what am i going to do for romance  
with a comical tilt of her little head she
looked up at her companion and sighed

  she made him feel that he had been awk-
ward and unkind though she spoke of it
lightly he was persuaded that she suffered
from the shattering of her dream he
knew little about children but this young
creature seemed to him a child really in
spite of her college degree and according
to his code the man was a brute who dark-
ened the sky for a child even momentarily

  im dreadfully sorry miss smith he
said with sincerity youve come to the
wrong shop for romance im afraid but
you may be sure that it exists and that
it will find you sometime you deserve it
and i never have

   oh i dont mean that she exclaimed
with a sudden catch of the breath not
that at all i want the romance that men
are supposed to find in life even if i can
get it only at second hand she laughed
a little uneasily

  as to that he answered gravely i
i jn nils iforgiwft-j- fingg

good lord  lie muttered to himself  what a incss the world is-page 
experience

cant give you much information you
see

  for some seconds she did not speak but
looked at him questioningly i won-
der she said at last i should think
that there would be romance-real adven-
ture-in professional gambling even if not
in what they call legitimate business i
should like to meet a real gambler and have
him tell me about it

  mr sanders pulled himself together with
an effort it seemed to him that his per-
turbation must be visible outwardly he
remained calm and managed to arrange a
dry smile as he shook his head you
wouldnt like it when it came to the case in
hand he remarked  youd find the
gambler vulgar and his adventures sordid

  thats what people always say she re-
turned personally i dont see why a
professional gambler shouldnt be a gentle-
man for certainly many gentlemen are
gamblers and why is the excitement of
the game more sordid than anything else
your deals for instance

  oh i said they were grubby mr
sanders felt himself caught ironic as the
situation might be it had clearly become
his duty to point out to the young lady the
danger and wickedness of gambling anti it
was impossible to indicate himself as a
horrible example though that would have
been his most effective line of argument he
had never lacked courage as even his ene-
mies admitted forced into the odd role
he accepted the duties of it without flinch-
ing his chief difficulty was in finding
something to say

  you dont understand he began or
i dont believe you do the difference be-
tween fighting in the open and fighting
behind trees i suppose the reason why the
old buccaneers are romantic figures is just
because they sailed up and scuttled ships by
main strength i must say i think modern
war wculd be more attractive if the soldiers
ever saw the other army the trouble with
a lot of business and even more with gam-
bling is just this it isnt aboveboard a
man cant get much feeling of adventure
about laying a trap for another fellow to
fall into at least my own experience is
that the game gets tiresome though its
better than idleness besides i give you
my word of honor that ive never met more
than two or three professional gamblers
vol lv-

who were at all interesting i dont ex-
plain very well but ive had a good deal of
experience

   with gamblers questioned the girl in
evident amusement how interesting
oh any man meets a lot of queer peo-
ple mr sanders replied the situation
was getting too much for him he rose
feeling that in retreat lay his only safety
in reality they werent interesting at
all he said if you wish my advice-
which im going to give anyhow-i may
sav that voud better avoid them not
 

that they are likely to cross your path

  she rose in turn  i suppose not she
remarked laughingly but i wish one or
two really good specimens might your
picture of them doesnt frighten me t
think- she stopped and stood with her
hands clasped behind her like a little girl -
 i think they might be as nice as you arc
im coming back to talk with you again
good-by for now

  she floated off down the deck leaving
mr sanders to make his way thoughtfully
to his state-room he shook his head a
little as he went it was a pity he reflect-
ed that so charming a young lady should
be so deceived about life her college
ought at least to have enabled her to dis-
tinguish between the tinsel of adventure
and the real thing mad about meeting a
gambler perhaps the sooner she discov-
ered with whom site had been talking the
better it would be for her that would dis-
abuse her of her foolish notions she would
understand then how little romance had to
do with gambling or gambling with ro-
mance he chuckled at the notion that
anybody could conceive of him as a figure
of adventure but he grew grave again
his business had been as good as anybodys
 doubt but it lied been sordid as for
the girl it was to be hoped that some young
man would fall in love with her soon and
woo her well he almost wished that he
were twenty years younger and a reputable
citizen

  henry he said as he reclined on his
sofa and took up a volume of ferrero  i
have had a very exhausting conversation
and i need a drink scotch please wom-
en are hard to understand

  yes sir answered the man imperturb-
ably  in a tall glass i suppose mr san-
ders i never did understand my wifesir
experience

  mr sanders smiled and began to read
though he found that the face of miss smith
sometimes obscured the lineaments of ju-
lius cicsar

  the afternoon and evening passed un-
eventfully mr sanders kept to his state-
room partly because he wished to avoid the
temptation of again meeting miss smith
and partly because he was afraid that she
might seek him out conscience and poli-
cy alike dictated the severest seclusion he
could not properly expose her to further
danger from his society and ho was unwill-
ing to run the risk of being exposed to her
scorn when she learned that he was a mr
sanders whom she must abhor the peter
sanders of diabolic fame luckily the
voyage was nearing its end he was to
land the following afternoon the inci-
dent was closed

  but fortune the goddess whom peter
sanders had worshipped so long spun her
wheel once more faithless in all else she
did not neglect to take vengeance on her
recreant votary while the sardonic was
steaming up the channel under clear skies
and in a fresh land breeze he left henry to
finish packing and stepped out on deck it
was two oclock the bustle of landing al-
ready pervaded the ship in a couple of
hours the sardonic would discharge those
of her passengers who were landing at ply-
mouth as he caught the smell of earth
again and refreshed his eyes with the green
and white of the sunlit coast mr sanders
suddenly remembered that one obligation of
the trip was not yet discharged he certain-
ly had not given henry money to pay a very
modest bill for the weeks supply of wine
and whiskey he stepped back into his
state-room to consult the valet

  im exceedingly sorry mr sanders
said henry but i supposed sir that a
steward had brought the bill in my absence
i will go at once and rectify the matter

  never mind answered mr sanders
who saw that the man was unwarrantably
disturbed by his lapse from perfection of
service  youre busy packing ill get a
smoking-room steward to look out for it
thats the easiest way

  with a trace of self-consciousness he en-
tered the smoking-room he did not fail
to notice that interested glances were cast in
his direction by men whose appearance
made clear their knowledge of peter san-

ders and all his ways he feared a little that
some old acquaintance might accost him
quite brazenly however he made his in-
quiry to his astonishment the steward
returned in a few minutes with the informa-
tion that the purser had  bill against mr
smith

  but he has exclaimed peter sanders
whose honesty had always been meticulous
even if warped  ill go down and see him
myself

  very good sir said the steward pock-
eting a coin thank you sir ill show
you his office

  so mr sanders descended into depths
that he had hitherto avoided and con-
fronted the twinkling blue eyes of a rubi-
cund officer in a mahogany frame

  you must be mistaken  think mr
smith the purser said your bill has
been paid

  but i tell you it hasnt answered mr
sanders who forgot gentle manners in the
face of such invincible stupidity as this  i
havent paid it and my man hasnt and i
want to pay it now

  im sorry to dispute you returned the
purser rather brusquely but you owe
nothing the bill was paid this morning
its entered here p smith state-room
- 

   i must say your book-keeping seems to
me rather shocking remarked mr san-
ders now thoroughly annoyed  ive never
in my life had so much trouble about pay-
ing a bill my room is  not 
huh grunted the purser looking in-
terested and consulting another document

  this is odd  see two ladies have
 and one of them is miss p smith im
very sorry indeed sir the bill must have
been presented to her

   what roared mr sanders and she
paid it how much is it i know the
young lady what a dreadful imposition 
it is very regrettable said the officer
who looked seriously concerned the bill
amounts to  i will apologize to miss
smith personally and at once perhaps-
eh-would you mind helping me explain
since the lady is a friend of yours its
deucedly awkward you know

  he appeared so much disturbed that mr
sanders had no choice but to lend his aid
since lie had been so foolish as to acknowl-
edge himself a friend of miss smiths he
experience



could not well explain that it would be in-
convenient he paid the bill and unwill-
ingly accompanied the officer on the up-
per deck a stewardess was despatched
with the pursers apologies to request the
ladies in state-room  to grant him a mo-
ments interview

  they emerged at once miss smith and
an older woman who might have been her
mother except that so obviously she had
never married they looked a little wor-
ried and miss smith both blushed and
started when she saw mr sanders

  im exceedingly sorry miss smith
began the purser-i never knew such a
thing to happen before-but we have been
so stupid as to have rendered you a bill
that should have gone to this gentleman
in your haste you seem to have paid it with-
out protest i have the sum here-
mr smith as a friend of yours has been
good enough to come with me to help ex-
plain

  thank you said miss smith weakly

  paula put in the older woman with
some heat what does it mean why
didnt you tell me instead of paying  what
was it for

  for liquors said mr sanders firmly
it was merely a mistake madam which i
regret quite as much as any one

  yes-indeed yes protested theolficer
placing the money in miss smiths hand
which closed over it mechanically i
hope you will pardon me-it was a quite
shocking blunder-and pardon me if i go
back to my office now  mr smith will tell
you the circumstances im sure i am very
busy

  he took the license of the occupied and
hastily disappeared leaving mr sanders to
cope with the disagreeable situation alone
it was grossly unfair to him but he was
helpless

  paula continued the older lady in-
exorably  i wish you would explain what
this means i wish you would say some-
thing

  there isnt anything to say the girl
replied miserably she was a picture of de-
jection

  then i wish you would introduce this
gentleman said her aunt since he seems
to be an acquaintance of yours perhaps
he will tell me what it all means

  mr sanders felt that by all the laws of

courtesy he must save miss smith from her
embarrassment but he felt very nervous

  the mistake was due to the similarity
of our names-a quite natural mistake you
see- under the aunts diaspproving
gaze he spoke with increasing confusion
i mean it was quite natural you see
im mr sanders mr peter sanders

  in a flash he realized with utter horror
the thing he had done he did not need
the frozen look in the older ladys eye the
perceptible recoil of her body to show him
how he had blundered

  what she exclaimed how dared
you paula you will explain this instant-
ly or i shall cable your father from ply-
mouth

  in the stress of the moment mr sanders
found his wits again his very disgust
calmed him he whose nerves had stood
the shock of a thousand turns of fate had
gone to pieces first before a maiden and
then before a maiden aunt  i am the only
one to blame he remarked smoothly  i
am a lonely old man and foolishly permitted
your niece to talk with me on two occasions
i think she has taken no harm from it but i
apologize to you most abjectly i had as-
sumed the name of p smith for the voyage
and they seem to have confused us in the
pursers office you need feel no further
alarm

  but peter sanders exclaimed the
lady whose distress made her forget all
courtesy oh paula how could you
what would your father and mother say

  im altogether to blame repeated mr
sanders miss smith had no notion of
course that she was talking with a person of
-of my repute inadvertently i told her
my true name she did not even know that
i was using the name smith

  but i did i did cried the girl i
knew all the time-i knew everything i
recognized you from your pictures as soon
as i saw you on deck and-and i asked the
steward when mr p smith didnt come to
table i wanted to see what you were like
she was on the verge of tears but she turned
bravely to her aunt its i who ought to
ask mr sanderss pardon and i do-most
abjectly

   i see said mr sanders gravely he
was too greatly astonished to say more

  oh paula ejaculated the older lady
utterly overcome


in the high hills

  i thought it would be a lark went on
miss smith  fancied youd be a sort
of civilized pirate i didnt see how it could
do any harm in one way youve been a
great disappointment to me

  what do you mean queried mr
sanders in whom amazement and confu-
sion began to give way to amusement he
had leen played by this little girl-he who
had measured himself successfully against
the sharpest wits in america-as if he were
a lad fresh from the country he enjoyed
the novelty of the situation

  i expected you to seem romantically
wicked i suppose miss smith confessed
shamefacedly

  oh paula exclaimed the aunt again
but whatever possessed you to pay mr
sanderss bill it is too dreadful
yes answered her niece it is i
knew mr sanders didnt know what i was
up to and when the bill ramo to me i
thought he would be still more mystified
if i paid it i didnt suppose he would find
out there never was such a little fool as
i am

  the aunt nodded that is quite true
quite true my dear she said

  mr sanders smiled and turned to the
older lady i cant quite agree with
cither of you im afraid your nieces
folly cant match mine for i have cut my-
self off from everything i like best but i
hope you will at least allow me to shake her
hand in parting i shall have one pleasant
recollection the more

  the girl looked up bravely and took his
hand  please forgive me she said  
has been a great experience for me any-
how

  good-by said mr sanders dont
forget that all the newspapers have said
about me is true the devil is just as black
as he is painted you must never play with
lire again-i warned you it was dangerous 
i wont said miss smith good-by
 i wish to shake hands too put in the
mini  youre not what t should havr ex-
pected good-by mr sanders

  with a low bow peter sanders turned
away good lord he muttered to
himself what a mess the world is

was a cold dawn in late
vpril at biskra the car-
ge long and heavy with
-ee horses abreast stood
the door ali a sturdy
ab young but with no
look of youth wound ii a gorgeous red
sashsat on the box and as i settled in
my place hamet the guide followed me
gravely and sat down beside me and at
a word from him we were briskly off on
the long uneventful drive to tougourt
over the desert route of about a hundred
and thirty miles southward to be covered
in two days travel we were soon beside
the sleepy silence of the oasis and passed
the old yellow slope that was once a for-
tress to guard it on the edge of the sands
we dipped along by little fields of fresh
green barley and rose on the steppe of the
bois a tangle of low undergrowth scarcely
waist-high of twisted and almost leafless
shrub that clothes the desert there with
its characteristic dry rough tortured and
stunted but hardy vegetation a few
arabs were to be seen in places cutting
it for fire-wood camels too far away
in almost any direction loomed up soli-
tary and ungainly as harbor-buoys on a
windless morning tide on all sides lay
the sharp hlack outlines of oasis-clumps of
palm-trees distinct single solid each a
distant island with miles to cross before
one should land on its unknown shore
and behind us the range of the aures
seemed to block out the world with the
wild beauty of its precipices which made
one cliff of all the north as if to shut out
europe it was like a wall of the world
all about us was the desert everything
seemed cold and gray and distant life-
less in the pallor of the morning but
with every mile the whole world bright-
ened and warmed desert air intoxicates
me every breath of it is wine not so
much to my blood or my nerves but to
vol lv-

my whole being of man and long before
we reached bord saada the first halt i
was keyed to the day it was a glorious
day cloudless and blue and drenched
with sunshine and radiance and warmth
pouring on vast spaces and the bordj
a disused military post a sort of large
stockade for refuge and defence standing
solitary on its high ridge was an old
friend and a place of memory for me
there once i had turned back and now i
was going on there was excitement in
the moment in the look ahead and so it
was only as we swept round the curve
down into the valley of oued djedi and
crossed its dry channel that i felt myself
embarked as it were  my first true des-
ert voyage i had coasted the sahara for
a thousand miles here and there like a
boy in a boat but now i should be at last
out of sight of land

  we were rjuite happy voyagers the
three of us ali on the box sang from
time to time some cadenced stave careless
as a bird in a world of his own indeed the
drive was an adventure to him for as i
afterward found it was his first going to
tougourt and had not hamet almost as
soon as we started liftingone intent burn-
ing glance straight in my eyes-it was the
first time i had really seen him as a per-
son-told me that i had brought him
good luck for that night his wife had
borne him a boy he was content a
fine figure too was hamet he answered
as no other guide but one i ever had to
the imagination he filled my dream of
what ought to be a mature man rather
thick-set with a skin so bronzed that in
the shadow it was black with the head of
a desert sheik noble powerful when he
moved he seemed still in repose so sculp-
tural were all the lines of his figure such
dignity was in every chance attitude he
seemed more like some distinguished aid
to attend me than a guide ilis white bur-
noose fell in large folds and as he threw it
partly over me in the first cool hour he

                          


tougourt

disclosed some light white underdress over
whose bosom hung low a great gold chain
wih beads under a revolver swung in a
leather case rather tightly drawn below
his right breast with a strap over the shoul-
der white stockings and slippers com-
pleted his garb we talked ol trifles and
the conversation was charming not too
fluent-talk of the road but what i re-
member is my pleasure in finding again
what often seems to me that lost grace of
a tine natural demeanor in men it is of
less consequence to me what a man says
than is his manner of saying it and speech
is not of the lips only but of the whole
man and in my experience it is the un-
learned who are also unspoiled that all
in all say things best and ever as we
talked or were silent the horses went on
the brilliant bare line of the aures sank
slowly down and round us was the waste
of rock with its fitful tangle of tamarack
and drin the sea of sand with its ridged
breadths the near or distant horizon-lines
as the track rose and fell and with the
hours the panorama of the road began to
disclose itself

  the road was really a broad camel-
trodden route on which the carriage-way
winding about found going as best it
could the railway that will sometime be
had been surveyed along it and the tele-
graph-poles that already bore the wire far
beyond tougourt into the desert were sel-
dom far away on the earlier part of the
journey the going was excellent in that dry
season it was not a lonely road though
for long stretches it was solitary over
the brink of a rise suddenly would spring
up a half-dozen human figures sharp out-
lines on the blue sky and a flock would
come tumbling after as if clotted about
their feet and there might be a donkey or
two it was a bedouin family on its north-
ern migration to the summer pasturage
what an isolated fragment of human life
it seemed flotsam tossing about with the
seasons as little related to anything neigh-
borly as seaweed yet spawning century
after century living on with the milk of
goats in such a waste and how infinitely
fresh was the simple scene one or two men
a boy women children and goats tramp-
ing in the desert toward water and green
food a type of humanity for ages-and
it was such a wretched subsistence but

what a bodily vigor what a look of inde-
pendence what a sense of liberty there
was there too now it would be two or
three camels with the canopy in which
women ride with flocks too and more
men and boys more warmly clad with
more color and importance-some wealth-
ier headman with his family going the
same northward journey or as the car-
riage crested some ridge we would see
miles ahead a long line creeping on toward
us-a trade caravan and after a while it
would pass the camels pouting in high air
under the loads of balanced boxes or bales
laid across them lumbering dumbly along
in the great silence like convicts as it al-
ways seems to me from another sphere of
existence

  many creatures give me vividly this im-
pression of having haplessly intruded into
a state of being not meant for them the
turtles in the swampsof my boyhood lean-
ing their sly and protruded heads out of
their impossible shells the fish that have
great staring eyes in aquariums frogs and
toads and all centipedal sea creatures are
to me foreigners to life strays misbirths
moving about in worlds not realized
and all grotesque forms of life-even
human deformity when it becomes gro-
tesque-wake in me something between
amusement and pity that they should be
at all i feel like saying as a guide wish-
ing to correct a friend of mine once said
 monsieur you are a mistake but of
all such creatures the camel fills me with
the most profound and incurable despair
he is the most homeless-looking of all
creatures he has been the companion
and helpmate of man from the dawn of
human life and our-debt to him through
uncounted ages and in places where the
human lot has been most penurious and
desperate is untold but man has never
been able to enlighten him  he looks on
all occasions and under all circumstances
hopelessly bored with existence unutter-
ably sick of humanity there is a suicidal
mood in animal life and at tunes one can
see glimpses and intimations of it surely in
the eyes of animals the camel embodies
it like a stare i wish they were all dead
and when i see their bones in the sand as
i often do i am glad that they are gone
and have left the ribs of their tabernacle
of life behind them by the wayside every
tougourt



desert traveller writes a little essay on the
camel this is mine i will not modify
it even for the sake of the mc-haris that
come down the route overtaking us from
biskra they are the racers that have just
competed in the yearly trial of speed from
tougourt-aristocrats of the species they
have a clear gray tone and slender deli-
cacies of flank and skin all day they will
be speeding ahead and dropping behind
us the desert is their cloth of gold and
they its chivalry-splendid beasts they
are as native to this blown empire of the
sand and the sun and the free air as a bird
to the sky-and they lift their blunt noses
over it with unconquerable contempt it
is amazing how the creature supercilious
or abject refuses to be comforted there
is no link between him and man if you
seek a type for the irreconcilable find it
in the camel

  it is said that one meets his enemy
in every place and every traveller expe-
riences these surprising encounters that
prove the smallness of the world but i
better the proverb for it is a friend i meet
in the most solitary places on the lone-
liest road of greece a passing traveller
called out my name in the high passes of
algiers i came face to face with a school-
mate and however repeated the expe-
rience never loses its surprise surely i
had seen that gaunt figure pressing up
on a stout mule from the head of the
fresh trade caravan that was just ap-
proaching that face like a bird of prey
that predatory nose before the high fore-
head and bold eyes-yes it was yussef
my guide of years ago with welcome all
over his countenance and quick saluta-
tions to his old companion he was a
caravan-man now for the nonce and com-
ing up from the souf how natural it
was to meet on the desert with the brief
words that resumed the years and abol-
ished the time that had sped away and re-
newed the eternal now but we must fol-
low the meharis slim forms on the horizon
ahead and we went on to overtake them
at ain chegga a mere stopping-place
where there was on one side of the way a
sort of desert-farm and a relay of horses
waiting for us and on the other a small
lonesome building by itself where we
could lunch from our own stores the
sun was hot now and ihc shade and rest

grateful but we had a long way to go
with thoughtless generosity we gave our
fragments of bread to some adjacent boys
and started off rapidly with the fresh
horses on the great plain

  the road was lonelier than in the morn-
ing hours the solitude began to make
itself felt the silence of the heat the en-
compassment of the rolling distances the
splendorof the sky therewas hardlyany
life except the occasional shrub the drin
i saw a falcon once and once a raven but
we were alone as if on the sea then the
sahara began to give up its bliss-the un-
speakable thing-the inner calm the sense
of repose of relief the feeling of separa-
tion from life the falling away of the bur-
den the freedom from it all in the freedom
of those blue and silent distances over
sandy and rock-paved tracts full of the
sun how quiet it was how large and what
a sense of effortless elemental power-of
nature in her pure and lifeless being it
is easy to think on the desert thought is
there so near to fact-a still fresh imprint
in consciousness thought and being are
hardly separate there and there nature
seems to me more truly felt in her naked
essence lifeless for life to her is but an in-
cident a detail uncared for unessential
she does but incline her poles and it is
gone taken in the millennial aons of her
existence it is a lifeless universe that is
and on the desert it seems so this is the
spectacle of power where man is not-like
the sea like the vault of heaven like all
that is infinite what a repose it is to
behold it to feel it to know it-this elimi-
nation not only of humanity but of life
from things the desert-it is the truth
how golden is the sunlight how majestic
the immobile earthhowglorious the reach
of it-this infinite and one falls asleep
in it cradled and fascinated and careless
flooded slowly by that peace which pours
in upon the spirit to lull and strengthen
and quiet it and to revive it changed
and more in natures image purged-so
it seems-of its too human past

  it was late in the afternoon hamet
roused himself as we passed down to oued
itel and crossed its dry bed and ali ceased
from his vagrant music as the horses
breasted the slope beyond we came out
on a high ridge it was a magnificent
view the long valley of the great chotts
tougourt

lay below us transversely like a vast river-
bottom far off to the northeast glittered
pale and white the chott melrir like a sea
of salt and before us the chott merouan
stretched across like a floor streaked with
blotches of saltpetre and dark stains of
soil the scene made the impression on
me of immense flats at a dead low tide
reaching on the left into distances without
a sea it was a scene of desolation of un-
speakable barrenness of the waste world
its dull white lights were infinitely fantas-
tic on the grays and the blacks and the
lights in the sky were cold the solitude of
it was complete but its great extent its
emptiness its enclosing walls of shadow in
the falling day crinkling the whole upper
plane of the endless landscape round its
blanching hollows and horizontal vistas
below stamped it indelibly on my eyes

i	was not prepared for it it was an en-
largement a new aspect of the world
this was the southwestern end of the chain
of chotts or salt wastes that lie mostly be-
lov sea-level and are the dried-up bed of
the ancient inland arm of the sea that
washed this valley in some distant age
they stretch northeasterly and touch the
mediterranean near gabes and the sug-
gestion is constantly made that the sea
be let into them again by a canal thus
flooding and transforming this part of the
sahara it may some time be done but
there is some doubt about the lay of the
levels and whether such an engineering
feat would not result merely in stagnant
waters meanwhile it is a vast barren
basin saline and in the wet season dan-
gerous with quicksands unsafe ground a
morass of death for man and beast the
ride where i stood commanded a long
view of this sterile and melancholy waste
but i did not feel it to be sad i only felt
it to be it had such grandeur

  we went down by a rough descent and
began the crossing of the chott before us
m trouan on its westerly edge the road
ran on flat ground often wet and thick
with a coating of black mud and there
was the smell of saltpetre in the air the
view on either side was merely desolate
night was falling it began to be chill and
by the time we reached the farther side
the stars came out it was a darkened
scene when we rode into the first oasis of
young palms without inhabitants which

belonged to some french company it
was full night when we emerged again on
the sands a splendor of stars was over
us and utter solitude around it was long
since we had seen any one and as the sec-
ond oasis came into view it looked like a
low black island cliff on the sea and as de-
serted we drove into its shadows by a
broad road like an avenue with the mo-
tionless palms thick  either side as in a
park there was  sign or sound of life
it was like night in a forest heavy with
darkness anc silence except where the
stars made a track above and our lights
threw a pale gleam about this oasis
which was large also seemed uninhabited
and we passed through it  the straight
road which was cut by other crossing
roads and came out on the desert by the
telegraph-poles the going was through
heavy sand which after a mile or two was
heavier our hubs were now in drifts of it
iiamet took the lights and explored to find
tracks of wheels and the horses drew us
with difficulty into what seemed a route
in ten minutes it was impracticable we
crossed with much bumping and careering
to the other side of the telegraph-poles
and that was no better forward and back
and sidelong with much inspection of the
ground we plied the search we were off
the route

  we drove back to the oasis thinking we
had missed the right way out and on its
edge turned at right angles down a good
road at the corner we found ourselves in
the dunes-there was no semblance of a
route we returned to the centre of the si-
lent palm grove where there were branch-
ing ways and taking another track were
blocked by a ditch and avoiding that
coasting another and ruder side of the
grove again at the upper corner of the
oasis struck the impassable so we went
back to our starting-plaee hamet took
the lanterns and gathered up his revolver
and set up apparently to find the guard-
ian  if there was one it was then ali told
me he had never been to tougourt before
hamet was so experienced a guide that it
was thought a good opportunity to break
in a new driver these french oases
arross the old route with their new roads
were confusing and hamet had not been
down to tougourt of late the silence of
the grove was great not wholly unbroken
tougourt



now there were animal cries insect buzz-
ings toolings noises u a wood and every
sound was intensified in the deep quiet the
strange surroundings it was very late
we had spent hours in our slow progress
wandering about in the sands and the
grove in the uncertain light hamet was
gone quite a long time but at last we saw
his waving lantern in the wide dark avenue
and drove toward him he got in said
something to ali and off we went on our
original track but turned sharply to the
right before issuing from the wood down a
broad way we were soon skirting the west-
ern edge of the oasis branches brushed
the carriage the ruts grew deep the track
grew narrow the carriage careened we
got out the wheels half in the ditch horses
backing hamet threw up his hands it
was midnight we would camp where
we were the route was lost whatever
might be our state and i did not wonder
for as nearly as i could judge wc were then
heading north by east if i knew the pole-
star we were on the only corner of the
oasis we had not hitherto visited the spot
had one recommendation for a camp-it
was  very out-of-the-way place the
horses were taken out and each of us dis-
posed himself for the night according to
his fancy it was intensely cold and i
rolled myself in my rugs and sweaters and
curled up on the carriage-seat and at once
fell fast asleep

  an hour later i awoke and unwinding
myself got out it was night on the desert
ali was asleep on the box upright with
his chin against his breast hamet lay in
his burnoose in the sand some little dis-
tance away the horses stood in some
low brush near the ditch the palm
grove impenetrably black stood behind
edging the long low line of the sky there
was a chorus of frogs monotonously chant-
ing and before me to the west was the
vague of the sands with undistinguishable
lines and obscure hillocks overlaid with
darkness only the sky gave distance to
the silent solitude-such a sky as one does
not see elsewhere magnificent with multi-
tudes of stars bright and lucid or fine and
innumerablemelting into nebulous clouds
and milky tracts sparkling and brilliant
in that keen clear cloudless cold all the
horizon round i was alone and i was
glad it was a wonderful moment and

scene hamet stirred in his place and i
went back la my post and slept soundly
and well

ii

  i woke at the first streak of dawn two
beautiful morning stars still hung large
and liquid in the fading night but the
growing pallor of daybreak already dis-
closed the wild and desolate spot where we
had fortunately stopped drifts of track-
less sand stretched interminably before us
the young palms showed low and forlorn
in the gray air the scanty brush by the
ditch was starved and miserable every-
thing had a meagre chill abandoned look
as soon as it was light we reversed our
course and re-entering the oasis hailed
a well-hidden group of buildings with a
koubba that hamet seemed to have dis-
covered the night before an old arab
gave us our bearings we were seventeen
kilometres short of mraier the oasis which
we should have reached and now making
the right turn-off we saw in another di-
rection over the sands the black line of
palms toward which we had gone astray
we soon covered the distance to mraier
which was a large oasis with a consider-
able village and a caravanserai whose
gates were crowded with camels here we
got a very welcome breakfast but we did
not linger and were quickly out again on
the desert on the long days ride before us

  since we passed the chott we were in
the valley of the oued rir along which is
strewn a chain of oases like a necklace as
far as to tougourt and beyond we were
really on the crust of what has been well
called a subterranean nile formed by the
converging flow of two saharan rivers the
oued igharghar and the oued mya whose
underground bed is pierced by wells and
the waters gathered and distributed to
feed the oases there are now forty-six
of these palm gardens that lie at a distance
of a few miles oik from another spotting
the arid sands with their black-green isles
of solid verdure making a fantastic and
beautiful landscape of the rolling plain of
moving sands with many heights and de-
pressions stretching with desert breadth
on and  under the uninterrupted blue of
the glowing sky the district has long
been a little realm by itself sustaining


t ougourt

with much toil the meagre life of its people
and periodically invaded and subdued by
the great passing kingdoms of the north
its prosperity however really dates from
the french occupation at that time the
oases were dying out under the invasion of
the unresting sands that slowly were bury-
ing them up the french almost at once
with their superior skill sank artesian
wells and the new hood of water brought
immediate change the number of the
inhabitants has doubled the product of
dates which are of the best quality has
increased many-fold and new oases of
great extent and value have been planted
by french companies this is one of the
great works of public beneficence accom-
plished by france for the native popula-
tion and evidence of prosperity was to
be seen on every hand all the way

  the route for the most part was sandy
with occasional stretches of rock often a
beautifully colored quartz whose brilliant
and strange veins harmonized well with
the deep-toned landscape but the eye
wandered oft to the horizon and drifts of
sand as the heavens began to fill with
light and the spaces grew brilliant in that
vacancy and breadth every detail grew
strangely important and interesting a
single palm a far glimmer of salt a herd
of goats would hold the eye and as the
day grew on the deceptive atmosphere
gave a fresh touch of t he fantastic playing
with the lines and forms of objects we
passed from mraier leaving these island
oases on the horizon as the route threaded
its way more or less remote from them
and at intervals we would touch one-a
palm grove on the right and the village
by itself on higher dry ground to the left
two of these villages of considerable size
were entirety new having been built with-
in two years they were constructed of
the sun-dried mud commonly used but
they did not have the dilapidated look of
the ksar they were clean and fresh a new
home for the people who had abandoned
the old unhealthy site that they had for-
merly occupied and had made a new town
for themselves and hamel who told me
this said other villages had done the same
and he seemed proud of their enterprise
and prosperity

  we went on now - through heavy sand
at times-and always there was the broad

prospect the gray-and-brown ribbed dis-
tance the blue glow-a universal light a
boundless freedom the desert solitude of
the dry soft air cest le vrai sahara
said hamet content for myself i could
not free my senses of the previous days
impression of the great chotts as of the
shore of a world and the landscape con-
tinued to have a prevailing marine char-
acter i do not mean that the desert was
like the ocean it was not but the out-
looks the levels the sand-colored and
blue-bathed spaces were like scenes by the
sea-shore only there was no sea there
the affluence of light the shadowless bril-
liancy the silences the absence of human-
ity and human things as again and again
they dropped from us and ceased to be
were ocean traits but there was no sea-
only the wind-sculpture of the sands beau-
tifully mottled and printed and delicately
modulated by the winds breath only a
blue distance an island horizon even
the birds-there were many larks to-day
-seemed sea-birds so lonesomely flying
but there was never any sea it was the
kingdom of the sands

  here not far from the route i saw what
was meant by the invasion of the sand
the oasis on its farther side toward the
desert was half blown over with the white
drifts of it that made in like a tide the
trunks of the palms were buried to a third
of their height in it the whole garden was
bedded with it and as we drew away from
the place looking back the little oasis
with its bare palm-stems resembled a
wreck driving in the sea of sands else-
where i saw the barriers fences of palm-
leaves and fagots raised against the en-
croaching dunes where the sand was
packed against them like high snow-drifts
the sand grew heavier now and as we
came to ourlana about which palmerais
lay clustering in all directions the horses
could hardly drag through the deep loose
mass up to the low building and enclosure
where was our noon stopping-place the
resources of the house were scanty only an
omelet but an excellent one and coffee
bread too and i had wine the family a
small one with boy and girl whom choc-
olate soon won to my side was pleasant
and there was a welcome feeling of human
society about the incident but as i lit a
cigarette and watched the fresh horses put
tougourt



in-for here we found our second relay
that had been sent ahead some days be-
fore-i saw that if the population seemed
scanty it was not for any lack of num-
bers a short distance beyond our en-
closure and on a line with it in the same
bare sandy waste stood another long
building with a great dome evidently a
government structure and at right angles
to it before the door was forming a long
line of young children it was the vil-
lage school-these were the native boys
marching in to the afternoon session for
all the world like an american school at
home i had not expected to see that on
the sahara i photographed it at once
-a striking token of modern civiliza-
tion and i saw no happier sight than
those playful little arabs going to school

  we dipped ahead into the oasis by the
long lines of palms lifting their bare stems
far overhead and fretting the sky with
their decorative border of tufts here
and there were fruit-trees and occasion-
ally vegetables beneath but as a rule
there were only the palms rising from bare
earth cut by ditches in which flowed the
water there wras no orchard or garden
character to the soil only a barren under-
ground but all above was forest silence
and the beauty of tall trees it was
spring and the trees had begun to put out
their great spikes and plumes of white
blossoms in places and the air was warm
and soft a palm fascinates me with the
beauty of its formal lines where two or
three are gathered together they make a
picture a single one in the distance gives
composition to a whole landscape this
was notwithstanding the interludes of
the oases a continuously desert ride and
i remember it mostly for its beauty of
color and line and a strange intensity and
aloofness of the beauty there was nothing
human in it it seemed to live by its own
glow in a world that had never known
man the scene of some other planet
where he had never been there was
too over all the monotony and immobility
of things a film of changefulness a waver
of surface a shifting of lights and planes
it was full of the fascination of horizons
the elusiveness of far objects and the feel-
ing of endlessness in it like the sky was a
deep chord never lost it was beyond
ourlana that i noticed to the southwest

a mile or two away three or four detached
palms by a lake their tall stems leaned
through the transparent air above a
low bank over a liquid mirror-like belt
of quiet water-a perfect oriental scene
it was my first mirage and two or three
times more i saw it that afternoon-the
perfect symbol of all the illusion of life
how beautiful it was how was its beau-
ty enhanced framed there in the waste
world how after a while it melted away

  oasis after oasis dropped from us on the
left and the right and in the late afternoon
we were clinging a sharp rise through the
deepest sand we had yet encountered so
that we all got out and walked to relieve
the horses and ourselves toiled up the
slope and soon from the ridge we saw a
broad panorama like that of the day be-
fore but instead of that salt desolation
here the eye surveyed an endless lowland
through which ahead ran a long dark clus-
ter of oases one beyond another like an
archipelago and hamet pointing to one
far beyond all on the very edge of the
horizonsaidtougourt wedescended
to the valley passing a lonely old gray
mosque or koubba of some desert saint
by the way-very solemn and impressive
it was in the failing light far from men
and we rolled on for miles over land like a
floor as on a western prairie and the
stars came out and at intervals a dark
grove went by and we were again in the
sands and another grove loomed up with
its look of a black low island and we
passed on beside it i thought each as it
came in view was our goal but we kept
steadily on it was nigh ten oclock when
we saw some miles away the two great
lights like low harbor lights that are the
lights of the gate of tougourt ali was
perceptibly relieved when we made sure
of them for they were unmistakable at
last

  then in that last half-hour i witnessed
a strange phenomenon the whole sky
was powdered with stars i had never seen
such a myriad glimmer and glow thicken-
ing filling the heavenly spaces innumer-
able and all at once they seemed to inter-
link great and small with rays passing
between them and while they shone in
their places infinite in multitude light fell
from them in long lines like falling rain
down the whole concave of night from
tougourt

the zenith to the horizon on every side
it was a niagara of stars the celestial
dome without a break was sheeted with
the starry rain pouring down the hollow
sphere of darkness from the apex tc the
desert rims no words can describe that
sight as a mere vision still less can they
tell its mystical effect at the moment it
was like beholding a miracle and it was
not momentary for half an hour as we
drove over the dark level obscure silent
lonely i was arched in and shadowed by
that ceaseless starry rain on all sides round
and as we passed the great  win lights of
the gates and entered tougourtand drew
up in the dim and solitary square it was
still falling

itt

  i emerged the next morning from the
arcaded entrance of the hotel which was
one of a continuous line of low buildings
making the business side of the public
square and glancing up i saw a great dog
looking down on me from the flat roof
there was little other sign of life the
square was a large irregular space which
seemed the more extensive owing to the
lew level of the adjoining buildings over
which rose the massive towerof the kasbah
close at hand on the right and diagonally
across thehighdomeof the french bureau
with its arcaded front beneath filling that
eastern side a fountain stood in the
midst of the bare space and beyond it was
a charming little park of trees and still
farther the white gleam of the barracks
through the green and on either side
closed the vista to the south the mo-
resque architecture which the french af-
fcct in the desert with its white lights and
open structure gave a pleasing amplitude
tothescene and the same stvlewas taken

                                             

up by the main street straight down my
left whose line was edged by a long arcade
with low round arches and the view lost
itself beyond in the market-square with
thick tufts of palms fringing the sky a
few burnoosed figures were scattered here
and there

  hamet joined me at once still content
he held in his hand a telegram from his
new boy or those who could interpret for
him we turned at once to the near cor-
ner by the kasbah where was the entrance

to the old town and the mosque-a pre-
cinct of covered streets narrow tortuous
ways with blank walls dim light there
were few passers-by occasionally there
was a glimpse of some human scene but
the general effect though the houses were
often well built was dingy pobr and mean
as such an obscure warren of streets must
seem to us and there was nothing here of
the picturesque gloom and threatening
mystery of figuig i remember it as a
desert hive of the human swarm it was a
new strange dark mode of mans animal
existence this was a typical desert town
an old capital of the caravans it had
been thus for ages and my feeling as i
wandered about was less that of the life
than of its everlastingness

  we went back to the mosqueand climbed
the minaret it was a welcome change to
step out on the balcony into the flood of
azure the true sahara stretched round
us-the roll of the white sands motion in
immobility and all about as far as one
could see the dark palm-islands in the
foreground and on every horizon the ter-
race roofs of the old town lav dark under
our feet off there to the west in the sand
were the tombs of its fifty kings eastward
the palm gardens bordering and over-
flowing into the new quarter with its mod-
ern buildings lifted their fronds and near
at hand the tower of the kasbah and here
and there a white-domed koubba rose in
the dreaming air and the streets with
their life were spread beneath tougourt
at the confluence of the underground
streams is the natural capital of the rir
country a commanding point on the
north and west it is walled against the in-
road of the sands south and east is a more
smiling scene but thewhitesand lies every-
where between like roads of he sea it is
the queen of the oases and one under-
stood in that sparklingairwhv it was called
a jewel of the desert i went down to the
gardens where there were fruit-trees and
vegetables among the palms but for the
most part there was as usual only the bar-
ren surface of earth fed with little canals
and crossed by narrow raised footways
over which sprang the fan-shaped or cir-
cular tufts of sworded green on that
side too was a native village-dreary
walls of sun-dried earth with open ways
they seemed merely a new form of the
tougourt



naked ground shaped perpendicularly and
squared-windowless sealed forlorn i
entered one or two indeed i went every-
where that morning for the distances were
short

  in the afternoon i sat down by a table
near a cafe in the market-square and 
remained there for hours over my coffee
watching the scene all arab markets
are much alike but this was prettily
framed on my right a palm grove rose
over a low wall on the left across the
broad space the low line of shops with a
glistening koubba dome in their midst
broke the blue sky and all between in
front was the market-place in the fore-
ground were a few raised booths or tables
and at the near end by a group of three or
four palms was a butchers stock in trade
the carcasses hanging on the limbs of a
dead tree farther off to the left squatted
a half-dozen bedouins round little fagots
of brushwood spread on the ground and
beyond them a group of animals huddled
in the centre on the earth one behind an-
other into the distance were many little
squares and heaps of country goods each
with its guardian group as at a fair-veg-
etables grains cloths slippers ropes caps
utensils-that together measured the scale
of the simple wants of the desert the
place though not crowded was well filled
with an ever-moving and changing throng
gathering into groups here and there-tur-
baned people of every tint and costume
young and old poor and prosperous pic-
turesque alike in their bright colors or worn
rags but the white or brown flowing gar-
ments predominated there were arab
and berber faces of purer race but in the
people at large there was a strong negroid
character showing the deeper infusion of
negro blood which one notices as he goes
south of the atlas all the afternoon the
quiet but interested crowd swarmed about
and round me at the close tables were sol-
diers and arabs who seemed of a more
prosperous class drinking and talking
playing at cards chess and dominoes and
some were old and grave and silent at
our table there was always one or two who
came and went to whom flamet would
perhaps present me a thin-featured cadi
a burly merchant - and we talked a little
but i left the talk to them and watched
the scene and from time to time snapped

my camera a caravan came down the
street with great boxes strapped on the
camels and i thought the first two would
sweep mecamera tableand all out of the
way but the long line got by at last un-
gainly beasts with their pawing necks and
sardonic mouths at tougourt one was
always meeting a caravan as  stood at
a later hour in a lonely corner by the wall
outside the gates one was just kneeling
down on the great sweep of the sand-hill
to camp in the melancholy light that was
falling from the darkening sky-a sombre
scene and when i came out of the hotel
at night i found another sleeping humped
and shadowy on the public square the
camel was as omnipresent as the palm and
belonged to the same dunes and sky and
as i sat watching there through the un-
eventful and unhurried hours the market-
place was a microcosm of the desert world

iv

  i spent the evening in the cafe maure
of the ouled-nails they are la femme
of the sahara daughters of a tribe whose
centre is at djelfa not far from laghouat
leagues away to the west and thence they
are dispersed through the desert adept
dancing-girls who perform in cafes and
in that primitive society it is said no re-
proach attaches to their modeof life which
yields them a dowry and brings them at
last a husband the custom is not pecul-
iar to the sahara i have read of its exist-
ence in japan and in the north of scotland
in the eighteenth century i had met
with them before and was familiar with
their figures but always in a tourist
atmosphere here they were on their own
soil and an nalurel and i expected a
different impression

  the room was rather large with the fur-
nace and the utensils for coffee in the
corner near the entrance fouror five musi-
cians on a raised platform were discours-
ing their shrill barbarian art but it pleases
me with its plaintive intensity and rapid
crescendos in its savage surroundings a
bench went round the wall and there were
tables at one of which hamet and i sat
down and coffee was brought there
were not many in the room-a sprinkling
of soldiers mostly in the blue of the ti-
railleurs arabs old and gray-bearded or
tougourt

younger and stalwart like ali whom i had
lost sight of and now found here much
more attractive than i had thought pos-
sible with a desert rose in his mouth and
a handsome comrade a few women with
the high head-dress and heavy clothes they
wear were scattered about close behind
me and to my left was a wide entrance to
the dark shadows of the half-lighted court
whose cell-like rooms i had inspected in
the morning and men and women were
passing in and out singly and in groups
all the evening for a while there was
no dancing-only the music but at some
sign or call a full-grown woman who
seemed large and heavy began the slow
cadence and sway of the dance i had
often seen the performance but never in
such a setting at biskra and in the north
it is a show here it was a life she fin-
ished and i beckoned to a young slip of a
girl standing near she came leaning her
dark hands on the table with those un-
thinking eyes that are so wandering and
unconcerned until they fill with that liquid
superficial light which in the south is so
like a caress i offered her my cigarettes
and she smiled and permitted me to ex-
amine the bracelets on her arms and the
silver ornaments that hung from her few
necklaces she was simply dressed and not
over-ornamented she was probably poor
in such riches there was no necklace of
golden louis that one sometimes sees but
there were bracelets on her ankles and she
wore the head-dresswith heavy twisted
braids of hair a blue star was tattooed
on her forehead and her features were
small but fine with firm lines and rounded
cheek and chin she was too young to be
handsome but she was pret ty for her type
and she had the pleasant charm that youth
gives to the children of every tint and race
she stood by us a while with a little talk
and as the music began she drew- back and
danced before us and if she had less mus-
cular power and vivacity thantheprevious
dancer she had more grace in her slighter
motions she used her handkerchief as a
background to pose her head and profile
her features and form and all through the
dance she shot her vivid glances that had
an elasticity and verve of steel at me
she came back to tak  our applause and
thanks and talked with hamet for her
simple frenchphrases were exhausted

there was nothing meretricious in her de-
meanor rather an extraordinary sim-
plicity and naturalness of behavior she
seemed a thing of nature the room be-
gan to fill now three women were dan-
cing and she went over to the bench by the
wall opposite and  noticed a young boy
of eight or ten years ran to sit by her and
made up to her like a little brother there
were three or four such young boys there

  the scene was now at its full value as
a picture not that there was any throng
or excitement and to a european eye it
might seem only dull provincialrude the
rather feebly lighted room was obscure in
the corners and the walls were naked the
furnace corner however was full of dark
movement the sharp music broke out
afresh the dance was almost sombre in
its monotony seen mechanically and with-
out any apparent interest by the arabs
wrinkled and grizzled banked together or
leaning immobileon the bench by the wall 
and the cavernous shadow of the court
behind me made a fine background to
the figures or groups that disappeared or
emerged or sometimes stood stationary
there in the semi-obscurity to my color
and shadow loving eye it was an interest-
ing scene and its rudeness enhanced its
quality i noticed many a slight thing a
tall negro stalked along the opposite wall
with a handful of candles which he offered
to a woman and found no welcome for and
he went away apparently exceeding sor-
rowful and i sat there long in the midst
of it thinking of striped tents by the city
wall in the sand near the graves of streets
in the orient and the north where the
women sit by the door-post like idols and
especially reconstructing in imagination
the scenes of a romance by an arab which
i had lately read depicting the life of an
oulcd-nail along these very routes where
i had been passing a book full of desert
truth-khaled it is called toward
ten oclock we rose to go and i caught the
eye of the young girl i had talked with
and had a smile for good-by

v

  the horses stood at the door early the
next morning for a drive totemacinsome
thirteen kilometres south we were soon
out of town travelling beside an oasis on
tougourt



the left and going in the open desert a boy
joined us from the oasis and excitedly
struggled to keep up with the carriage no
difficult task for the route was heavy with
sand two other boys on donkeys ahead
were having a race and the route had
always some touches of travel the open-
ness of the view was boundless and i
had not seen finer sands stretching away
in long rolls and ridges and mounded
into splendid dunes with palms here and
there for horizon-lines there were always
groups and little strings of camels isolated
but living in the expanse over which the
eye roamed we passed from time to time
within view of clumps of lost palms little
oases buried and left in the sands half-
submerged derelicts now there were
bedouin tents low striped shelters by
ones or twos pitched on the sterile waste
looking infinitely solitary at a distance
from a small village or a ridge that itself
seemed a heap of ruined and ribbed walls
left abandoned the morning was hot
the sun beat down and every line and
tracery of the wind was visible on the
sand the surface of the dunes was
beautiful-light and full of the spirit of
fantasy the modulation was exquisite
ribbed and fretted furrowed in lines and
touched all over with little disks and
curves like the imprint of small shells
and their mottled and wavy surfaces
broke the monotony of the vast slopes
and dunes like an infinite enamelling of
nature it was the land of the blue dis-
tance the simple in the grand the apothe-
osis of paucity in the means of poverty in
the substance elemental abstract superb
the glory of the desert i never so felt it
as on that morning i watched the slen-
der film-like far-off minaret of temacin
take body and height as we drew nearer
and nearer and saw plainly and distinctly
at last the boldly perched irregular ob-
long of walls and roofs that topped a rising
ridge of the sands with its minaret like a
dark mediaeval tower standing in heaven
with a lance-like solitude its top was
bordered with a broad frieze of colored
tiles and capped with a pyramidal head or
balcony pierced with slim moorish arches
there were men working under the wall
but the town looked marvellously silent
and alone dark and withdrawn like an
impenetrable earthern ruin incommunica-

ble it rose as if made of the earth itself
with the dilapidation of old earthworks
forbidding and melancholy with no touch
of life except the gleam of its tiled mina-
ret  in all that sun it seemed sunless-ruin-
ous decadent infinitely old soon after
we passed another heap of earth-walls on a
sand-mound a small village and came
almost at once to tamelhat the zaouia
which we had set out to see

  high walls surrounded the enclosure
which was extensive tamelhat is a holy
village a chief seat of the religious or-
der of the tidjania and daughter of the
mother-zaouia at ain madhi near la-
ghouat with which it shares the devotion
of this important brotherhood one of the
most influential of themoslemassociations
in north africa the zaouia is a sort of
monastery or abbey but i was not pre-
pared to find it so large an establishment
we left the carriage at the gateand passed
in to a second gate and i was struck by
the ornamental work and texts on them
and on the walls a straight avenue led
down to an open space where the mosque
stood on the right side of the street as we
turned shaqily upon it three square win-
dows set in little ornamented arches in
the centre broke the broad white space of
the wall and there were other windows
irregularly placed a little to one side was
a heavy door with a double row of faience
set over its square top and descending
on beautiful onyx pillars an octag-
onal dome tipped with a shaft of three
golden balls completed the building above
it was a pretty exterior with a touch of art
in the line of windows and as i passed into
the interior by the lovely onyx columns it
seemed like a reminiscence almost a renais-
sance to find before my gaze the familiar
blue and green tiles plaques of wrought
plaster in arabesque pretty bits of faience
adornment-forms of the ornament and
color so delightful to me the interior
was roomy with good spaces and lofty
above in the main fore part a palanquin
was in one corner and a few tombs were
placed here and there but the shrine the
tomb of the marabout who founded the
zaouia stood in the space to the left
directly under the dome as in a chapel it
was heavily covered with stuffs as usual
and overhung with many banners a grill
ran round it and outside of that a wooden
tougourt

rail the tomb also bore arabian texts
the whole effect notwithstanding the
bareness the few elements the uncostly
materials had the grand simplicity of the
moslem faith  it was impressive-impos-
ing to a simple soul but beyond the rest-
ful sense of the neighborhood of beautiful
and sacred things in that far and desert
solitude what pleased me most and the
feature  carried away to be my memory
of it was the ample lights in the cool
spaces by the open windows above the
tomb toward the street where the birds
were continually fluttering in and out un-
frightened and undisturbed as if this was
their quiet home

   thanked the arab sacristan who stood
looking at me with old and tranquil eyes
and we went out and walked up the street
which seemed like a long cloister there
were grilled windows on the well-built
walls at intervals a few men sat here and
there on benches along the way it seemed
a place of peace the street which was
quite long and straight ended in a large
court near which was the dwelling of the
marabout hamet asked me if i would
like to see him and i gladly assented
after a brief interval an arab came to us
to whom i gave my coat and what things
i was carrying and leaving them below
he guided us up an irregular stairway as
in an old house and took us into a rather
large high room plainly plastered and
bare the desert saint-such he was-
was seated on the floor in the middle of
one side by the wall on a rug he was o d
and large white-bearded with a heavy
look as if he were used to much repose
and was aged he gave me his hand as
i stooped down to him and after a word or
two invited me to be seated at a plain
i able before him in the middle of the room
and attendants silently brought food
there was already in the room the caid
of temacin a stout and prosperous-look-
ing arab to whom hamet presented me
and the three of us sat down to what
turned out to be a hearty breakfast two
or three other tall arabs apparently be-
longing to the family sat by the wall to
my left as i faced the marabout and at
a doorway in the corner on the right stood
a group of different ages younger with
one or two boys intelligent and bright-
eyed the caid and myself talked in low

tones and no one else spoke except from
time to time the marabout gave some
direction to the attendants apparently of
a hospitable nature as each time it re-
sulted in fresh dishes there was pastry
that resembled rolls and after a fev mo-
ments served in another form hot with
sugar it resembled pancakes but i dare
say it was something quite different and
the marabout urged it upon me there
was another combination that reminded
me distantly of doughnuts with which
the hot food ended but there was a des
sert of french cakes almonds and dried
aromatic kernels like peas and much to
my surprise there were oranges that must
have come on camel-back from liiskra
there was coffee too with a curious pot
and sugar-bow  and the whole service was
excellent the attendants kindly and press-
ing though very quiet it appeared after-
ward that  one ever sees the saint eat
his food is brought and left and he takes
what he likes alone i observed him
through the meal and occasionally he ad-
dressed a sentence of inquiry or interest to
us the impression he made on me was
one of great indolence as if he had never
done anything lor himself and also of
what i can ony describe as a somnolent
temperament heavy and rousing himself
at times but it may have been only age
the profound silence and atmosphere of
awed respect were remarkable the lew
words spoken were hardly above a whis-
per and the caid and i used low tones it
was a hospitable and generous breakfast
however and the manner of it wholly
pleasant and friendly and as i again took
the old marabouts large soft hand and
expressed my pleasure and thanks for hav-
ing been thus received he seemed to me
very cordial and kind and for my part i
was glad that i bad found the unusual ex-
perience of breakfasting with a saint so
agreeable the caid and i parted below
and i walked back through the tranquil
street and by the mosque with the bird-
haunted windows and the onyx portal well
pleased with my morning in such a place
of peace and good will

  we drove back through the hot horizons
of a burning noon by sombre temacin
with its far-seen tower old watcher of the
desert by the distant western oasis with
its two gleamirg koubbas that seemed to
tougou rt

dissolve between the sands and the blue
by the bedouin tents crouched in the long
drifts below the brow of the earthen ruin
whose walls gaped on the hill with fissure
and breach we passed a bevy of bright-
colored bedouin women hurrying in their
finery to some marabout to pray the long
slopes and mounded dunes had not lost
that wonderful enamel of the breath of the
wind all nature seemed to stretch out in
the glory of the heat it was spring on the
desert it was a dreaming world  lc vrai
sahara said hamet half tohimself and
slowly over the palmy plain beyond the
lost oasis the tower and minaret of tou-
gourt slim lines on the sky grew distinct
in their turn and solic and near and we
drove in through the garden green as over
a threshold of verdure it was a great
ride

  the day ended lazily i had the pleas-
ure of a few courteous words withtheagha
of tougourt to add to my hospitable
distinctions he is an arabian prince
said hamet proudly as we walked away
along the arcade i saw a jew seated cross-
legged with his back to the jamb of his
shop he held a heavy folio volume on his
lap and seemed to peruse it with grave
attention that was the only time i ever
saw a native reading a book in north
africa and i looked curiously at the fine
venerable face the boys were playing
leap-frog before the hotel as i came back
from my walk they had thrown off their
haiks or jackets or whatever their upper
garment might be how they played
with what strong young sinews and vi-
vacity of rivalry and happiness though
the children of the street seemed often
poor destitute and with faces of want i
photographed two of these bedouin boys
with whom i had made friends in the
evening i sat outside and watched the
camp-fires burning by the camels in the
square i thought of the massacring of
the french garrison here forty years ago
and of the protests that a military inter-
preter fernand philippe records from the
lips of the soldiers when a year or two
later the government contemplated with-
drawing from this advanced desert post

it was a place of homesickness of fever
and of utter isolation but the soldiers
wished to stay-withdraw never-and
all this peace and prosperity that i had
witnessed was the french peace

vi

  it was three oclock in the morning
when i went out to start on the return
under the stars the streets were dark
and silent as we drove out but the heav-
ens were brilliant and the twin lights
of tougourt shone behind us like light-
houses as we made out into the sandy
plain a few miles on we passed a com-
pany of soldiers convoyinga baggage-train
-strong fine faces above their heavy
cloaks marching along in the night the
stars faded and day broke quietly-a faint
green a dash of pink a low black band of
cloud and the great luminary rolled up
over the horizontal waste the morning
hours found us soon in the heavy sands
of the upland with the old gray mosque
and stretches of the bois the desert drin
and we descended into the country of
the marine views the land of the mirage
mirror-like waters shoaling on banks of
palm dreaming their dream  and now it
was ourlana and the school fresh horses
and an early arrival at mraier and sleep
in the caravanserai amidhorsesandcamels
and passing soldiers a busy yard the
chotts looked less melancholy as we passed
over the iowlard in the bright forenoon
and again there shimmered the far salt-
the ocean-look where there was no sea
near marine views and there was much
mirage and we climbed the ascent and
glided on over the colored quartz and the
range of the aures rose once more above
the horizon beautiful and calling and ain
chegga seemed a familiar way-station
fresh horses and the last start and bordj
saada seemed a suburb and as we drove
into biskra with its road well-filled with
pedestrians and carriages it seemed like a
return to europe-so soon does the trav-
ellers eye become accustomed to what at
first was  rich and strange and hamet
went to his baby boy
the ghost on the stairs

by mrs w k clifford

i

dawley sat on the
ids leaning a little for-
rd watching the great
ves that came nearer and
arer foaming and roar-
j at their highest then
spending themselves on the shore only
to be followed by others that were higher
and louder and came nearer still as if
they were trying to force her back up
the steps and along the pathway to the
little house at the end of the terrace in
which she lived her secluded life

  she had gone down to the sea when the
early post brought its news to think the
past years over holding in her hand the
while a gold cross on a slender chain
which she wore round her neck it had
been given her in rome some years be-
fore a parting gift from a catholic friend
who was about to take the veil con-
cealed in it was a little photograph of
leo xiii leo xiii had blessed it the
friend told her and said wear it day
and night it will keep the evil one from
you she pressed it against her face now
while gradually she realized what the news
meant just this that the man she had
loved best in the world was lying dead
not here but in london she had sup-
posed that all feeling for him had ended
that he was nothing-nothing to her but
those three lines had made her heart leap
and then grow cold as if an icy hand had
been laid on it she had risen to her feet
and stood for a moment dazed then read
the notice again and again and told her-
self that it was true-true he was dead
it was all over everything in the world
was over for him-never never would she
see him again and  god dear god
how did it fare with him

  it was impossible to stay in the house
the whole weight of the ceiling of the roof
itself seemed to be on her head she
dragged herself out along the garden
path to the road to the little gate and


down the steps to the bay which was al-
ways deserted in the early morning it
was the one place in which she might be
able calmly to think the sands looked
soft and yellow the sea was blue the sky
was blue the sunshine was everywhere
the great waves seemed to mock her-all
nature seemed to mock her she felt afraid
and lonely an alien in the world for a
moment she almost lost count of her own
identity and wondered aimlessly how she
came there and thought again of the man
she had loved he was lying dead she
imagined his face and wondered if he had
thought of her in that last hour and if he
had known that the end was coming

  she had been married to him when she
was twenty-two he was infatuated with
her for three weeks before he proposed
and for a hurrying month after he was ac-
cepted well content for half a year of
marriage then he cooled down he
was incapable of being constant to any
one woman long and rather despised the
men who were he thought it showed a
lack of enterprise and too much satisfac-
tion with existing conditions which he
told her with a laugh he held to be fatal
to the advancement of the world in gen-
eral and the exhilaration of man in par-
ticular two years later she had di-
vorced him and was living alone at st
ives for a time she was utterly miser-
able then the thought of the other woman
of his desertion-his desertion for that
woman-had tilled her with a shivering
anger and repulsion she imagined that
she had learned to hate him now it was
all swept away and she thought of theday
she had met him first of the mad infatu-
ation on his part and her own calmer
deeper love for him it struggled to come
back and the tones of his voice the sound
of his laughter filled her ears

  the waves frightened her they seemed
to know-they did know-she felt it
heard it they came nearer and nearer with
their message they drove her at last into
her own room to lie face downward  the
the ghost on the stairs



bed and think lionel was dead and the
other woman had watched beside him
what could he have seen in her a free
lance she had been called probably be-
cause she lived alone smoked-and drank
too much it was said-painted little daubs
of pictures and had a studio at chelsea to
which she gathered a bohemian godless
set i

  those last two words made edith daw-
ley stop and shiver again she was a re-
ligious woman and she didnt believe that
a serious thought had entered his heart or
brain since the day he made his marriage
vows only to break them she had talked
to him of their solemnity once he had
looked rather amused and said  all right
my dear i dont believe in hell you
know and if there is one i dont expect its
such a bad place after all now per-
haps he was standing at the bar waiting
for judgment how had he lived these
last few years how had he died had
any one prayed beside him when he was
ill did any one kneel by him now that he
was dead the old tenderness had stolen
back into her heart but with it there
came a paralyzing fear an awful dread

  she looked at the times again-on the
th this was the ioth he was probably
lying in the front room over the first floor
in connaught square the house he had
removed to after the divorce she fel
that she would give everything she pos-
sessed to see him once again to see his
dead face-even to be near the house in
which he lay still and cold would be some-
thing

  she got up hesitated and with weary
eyes looked round the room then took
a time-table from a little shelf over the
bureau in the corner the london train
started at -three-quarters of an
hour hence as if at the bidding of a
dream she put on a long black cloak and
hat tied a thick veil over her face gath-
ered a few things intoahand-bag and with
a word or two of explanation to the soli-
tary servant went down to the station

  a long weary day the train stopped
at all the little cornish places despair-
ingly she stared at them at the station-
master gossiping with the guard at the
few passengers country folk mostly carry-
ing baskets or bags leisurely taking leave
of those who had come to see them off

the start again was slow and reluctant
but after plymouth the engine seemed
to shake itself free and rushed on the
carriages rocking with relief behind it
across the quiet west country past sleepy
villages and their blurred name-boards at
the stations till with a shriek of exulta-
tion they were in sight of exeter-the plat-
form was crowded with people but the
train only gathered speed as if to avoid
some signal that might delay it

  all the time in her thoughts she fol-
lowed a scared and silent procession of
men and women who went through the
gate of the world and on in the mist and
blackness toward a shining road-for the
stars were its landmarks and a distance
that was saturated with light and mys-
tery away from it stretched a pathway
dark and dank it looked darker-darker
till blackness hid it she shuddered with
dread as they came near and went past her
-the ghostly men and women she could
see them plainly their worn faces were
marked with care and pain and remem-
bered deeds their shadowy robes and out-
stretched hands would have touched her
but for the screening glass she watched
their noiseless feet that had not power to
hesitate or stop going on-and on o
merciful god was lionel among them
and what would be his sentence when it
was given out which way would his
feet turn suddenly she remembered be-
ing told that the semitic races believed
the soul did not leave the body till the
third day perhaps even yet there was
time with her whole heart with pas-
sionate intensity she prayed-as she sat
there silent motionless in the railway
carriage-pleading his carelessness his
charm and good nature his lack of
strength to do right and of intention to
do wrong and his happy generosity for
he had given all he possessed carelessly
enough

  she arrived at paddington in the eve-
ning and waited till the twilight came
then leaving her hand-bag in the cloak-
room she put down her veil and walked
slowly to connaught square it was just
a little way-she knew the house well for
long ago she had gone to parties next door
to it

  the blinds were down there were lights
in the dining-room probably she-the
the ghost on the stairs

other woman-was having dinner edith
dawley shrank back and drawing her
cloak round her walked by on the other
side and looked up the windows were
open a little way in the room over the
drawing-room it was as she thought
   while she hesitated at the corner a
servant opened the door and whistled for
a cab a woman came out and drove
away-the woman who had supplanted
her and the dead man was left in the
house if only she could get in and see
his face once more but she had no cour-
age to knock no excuse to give she
walked round the square again the shad-
ows of the calm night hesitated to shroud
it but gradually they were blurring ard
hiding and beautifying everything with
their grayness as she drew near the
house again a postman went there and
knocked twice she was ten yards off she
saw him give in a letter and a paper which
the servant leaving the door open evi-
dently went away to sign without con-
sidering what she was doing she went up
the steps and entered the house the
postman seeing her blackness thought
she belonged to it the servant had not
returned

  she went softly up-stairs to the room
the electric light had not been turned on
but enough twilight lingered to let her see
the way the door was locked but the
key was there she turned it and went in
it felt very still and cold and everything
was white the whiteness showed plainly
through the gathering darkness between
the windows she could see dimly that for
which she was seeking for a moment
she shuddered and hesitated on a little
table outside she had vaguely noticed a
candlestick and a box of matches she
went back for the matches took them into
the room and shut the door for a mo-
ment she stood still while gradually the
room revealed itself to her and the silence
struck icily at her heart a sheet was over
him she drew it back and softly lit a
match shielding it with her figure so that
its radiance might not fall on the door and
show from without then she saw his
face it was grave and very sad-she felt
her whole being reach out to him with

yearning love with pity and dread o
god what did his closed eyes see what
was he hearing-what surprise had come
to him  she lighted another match care-
fully smothering the little sound its strik-
ing made another long look an uncon-
scious entreaty to all the unknown im-
mensities-then with her left hand she
pulled the gold cross from her neck and
pushed it into the white folds next his
heart if its true what they believe
she thought it will help-it will bar the
downward way she drew the sheet
back over his face the ends of the
matches were in her hands she clutched
them tightly the last one burned her
palm but she did not even feel it

  the closed door was between them
again she turned the key and keenly
listening with the sense of a hunted woman
leaving forever all that was left of what
had once been dearest life she went slowly
down

  there was no light on the staircase but
as she passed the first floor she rould see
that a door was open the room beyond
was still and dark her dress made a little
swishing sound against the banister-a
smothered cry-a sound of fright within
the drawing-room-a movement and then
a halt from sheer horror-she knew it was
her chance and quickened her steps in
a minute she was at the street door she
closed it noiselessly but a scream met her
ears-the sudden isolated scream of fear
luckily the house was near a comer she
turned it and disappeared

  she went back to cornwall by the night
mail desolate miserable but shiveringly
shudderingly thankful it will bar the
way she said to herself again and again
perhaps i have done that for him
in the darkness without the faces of
thwarted fiends shaped themselves and
pressed against the windows they mocked
and mouthed at her she covered her face
with her hands   

  three months later in a letter from a
friend she heard that the house in con-
naught square was empty it vas said
to be haunted by a woman in black who
in the twilight went up and down the
staircase
the fete of msieur bob

small fair man whose
scholarly forehead was set
into child-like curls not
very gray yet at sixty-five
in his dressing-room his
careful morning toilet al-
most completed fresh in fine linen and
well-cut tweed he fingered a razor with
a considering manner he moved the blade
this way and that through the closed
door came the sound of his valet in his
bedroom the man turned a glancc to-
ward the door reflectively then with a
shruglowered the razor  such a mess
he muttered and proceeded quietly to
put on his coat

  it was the self-contained gentleman to
whom the valet was accustomed who
gave a crisp order two minutes later
the electric in half an hour stebbins
in exactly half an hour as he walked
through the door of his house another
younger man was stepping along the side-
walk this one stopped a smile lighted
his face

  im delighted to see you back mr
schuyler he said

  schuylers greeting was calm a bit aus-
tere yet there was pleasure too in his
manner he nodded toward the brough-
am and the chauffeur at the curb wont
you drive down with me

  walter morgan hesitated i meant
to walk he said its hard to get ex-
ercise but i want to hear about the
canadian fishing you nad a wonderful
time he began as the car slid away
and how are you a lot better
schuyler shrugged his shoulders as
to that-but the fishing was very fine i
took a large number of salmon one of
them kept me busy two hours by the
clock the only reason i killed him and
he didnt kill me is that i had a flask
and he hadnt he weighed thirty-seven
pounds

  ah said morgan enviously id
    vol lv-

like a chance like that ive never taken
salmon

 you should have come i wanted
you

  i wanted to go answered morgan
 but i must work for my living at times
instead of going fishing its hard lines
he slewed about and regarded the older
man its done you good i hope he
asked again a month of fighting sal-
mon ought to do good but his tone
was uncertain as he gazed at the worn
face with its reserve with the tell-tale
sadness in the large eyes

  peter schuyler millionaire banker art
amateur collector expert fisherman met
the gaze the blue eyes which with the
carved features and short fair curls had
given him in his heyday the title of the
most beautiful boy in new york-the
old blue eyes knew how to guard against
impertinent looks he had been stared at
all along his life but he did not meet
walter morgans gaze with the usual
chilling courtesy he was fond of this
man the mask was dropped and mor-
gan looking saw a lonely soul in trouble

  then schuyler laughed not mirthfully
to tell the truth i didnt have such a
tremendous spree up there by myself i
got a bit depressed a man isnt in high
spirits after a bout of nerves you were
lucky in not going with me

  i would have given a great deal to
go morgan threw back if i could
have helped you at all it would have been
an added pleasure

  youre very goodsaid schuyler in a
colorless tone and morgan felt that he
had somewhere overstepped the line and
the talk drifted swiftly to commonplace

  a week later the younger man ap-
peared on a morning at peter schuylers
office although nearly july there were
doings in the world of affairs which made
necessary his presence there morgan
got through the suave clerks and secre-

                          v

the fete of msieur bob

taries who guarded the throne  i have a
scheme he began

  something in the joyous friendly man-
ner of this man always touched schuyler
with a shock of pleasure

  you have he threw back and
smiled as few people saw him smile

  morgan went on you remember
that ive told you about our camp in the
club in canada

  certainly

  its a rough log camp you know but
its a great lake country and the trout
are thick and big would you consider
coming up there with bob and me for a
month

  the great blue eyes regarded the other
man with a startled expression a flush
crept across morgans fresh color

  i quite realize mr schuyler he
said that you have any number of at-
tractive things to do always i feel i hat
its rather presuming to suggest this my
idea was-he hesitated a little and went
on with a winning sincerity my idea
was partly that the simplicity of the thing
might be a change after the way you get
amusement generally my young broth-
er bob is uncommonly good company
loo im pretty sure youd find him good
company and then-it would be such a
pleasure to bob and me my wife has
gone to england with her sister for au-
gust bob and i are off by ourselves on
july th i believe youd enjoy it do
come

   my dear fellow said the banker and
laid his hand on morgans hand lying on
the desk my dear fellow he re-
peated and stopped a second enjoy
it youve given me the best moment
ive had for months merely in asking me
im so pleased to think you want me i
didnt know-he stopped im get-
ting old he said and his voice broke as
the hidden soreness of his soul crept into
it im old-and sick those things
are not attractive young strong peo-
ple dont want detrimentals then
quickly giving no chance for an answer
he went on with calm dignity again  i
cant quite tell morgan may i let you
know in a few days i may have to-be
somewhere else at that time

  morgan was gone peter schuyler sat
at his desk with the door locked he

stared down at the litter of papers for
moments he sat so staring then in a
flash he was alert a gleam came into the
blue eyes he drew a bunch ol keys from
his pocket and chose one and opened a
drawer out of it he lifted a small
bright affair and turned the barrel to-
ward him he looked into it half long-
ing half curious

  peace down there he whispered
peace locked up-i think i think its
peace shall i turn the key and let peace
loose into my brain

  he lifted and cocked the pistol and
pressed the cold ring of the end of it
against his forehead his finger was on
the trigger

  one easy movement and this unbear-
able life would be over he was whis-
pering aloud again god knows what
next ive a right to see havent i
why havent i its my own life he
was arguing now against some ghostly ad-
versary

  with that he sighed suddenly wearily
he lowered the pistol put it at half-cock
laid it back in its drawer and locked the
drawer

  not yet he spoke i cant leave
loose ends to other men

  he whirled in his swinging chair and
stared from the high window over new
york bay the june sunlight poured and
broke across millions of wave-tops ships
moved with leisurely swiftness sail-boats
fled before the wind like irresponsible
playful big birds away down there the
tall goddess lifted her torch eternally over
the eternal ocean it seemed as he looked
at it a glaring happy planet with no cor-
ner in it which needed him his wife was
dead his children were grown and mar-
ried and rich  he had more money than he
could use there was no point in piling up
more still he was ill he was growing old
what dignity was there in a life with no
work to do so he reasoned and clear
of brain as he was never saw his fallacy
a disgust of the whole useless round of his
days seized him as he sat at the wide win-
dow of the nineteenth story of the great
building and looked over the teeming june
world he would not stay about this
place earth and finish out an ever-sillier
life of twenty or thirty more years in
september when his business should be
the fete of msieur bob	

so arranged that he might leave it with-
out giving too much trouble here in his
office he would take out the little steel
affair and retire from life the time be-
tween must be got through

  with that he was aware of a subcon-
scious pleasant thought and dragged the
thought out the morgans had asked
him to their camp fora month hewould
go it would be an agreeable taste for his
last mouthful of life with a brighten-
ing face the man who had decided on sui-
cide drew a sheet of paper toward him
and wrote   

  many happy returns bob

  the eight-oclock sunlight of the au-
gust morning poured full on the lake
dancing twenty feet away in the woods
it was cool a light breeze was stirring
schuyler moving through sun-spotted
shadows down the trail from the big tent
which was the guest-room came in range
of bob morgan on the log step hovering
over an assortment of articles he sprang
up a big young american in a gray flannel
shirt and towered above the small el-
derly gentleman in his dapper woods togs

  thank you mr schuyler good
morning sir i want to thank you a lot
for this stunning reel its a wonder
said bob i never saw one like it and
im clean crazy about it it sure was
nice of you he shook hands with a
smile like the morning and a grip that
made schuyler wince

  good said the older man heartily
with a throb of satisfaction  youve got
a good bit of loot i see

  you bet-i mean ves indeed
agreed bob walter gave me these
cunnin things and he dangled a huge
pair of canadian botles sauvages cari-
bou moccasin boots and margaret
my sister-in-law sent this princely fly-
book and my mother some silk socks
which i cant wear with the hunting-
boots and my unclc donated this shot-
gun walter bought it for him isnt
that a beauty he handed it over for
inspection and ive got other things
-an electric torch and books and a sub-
scription to country lift-a lot of stuff
see

 youre a lucky fellow said peter
schuyler he thought of his sons and

the automobiles and checks which cele-
brated their birthdays and of the satiated
appetites which needed that and more to
stir them he considered the pleasure of
bob in his presents and found him lucky
youre a fortunate lad he repeated
wheres your brother

  bob turned his head and lifted his hand
shaving he whispered hear out
of the other side of the camp issued
sounds as of measured wailing indian
medicine-men over a victim might chant
such music thats his shaving-song
explained bob it dies down when hes
in action-hear hes finished now lis-
ten to that loud and steady the wails
swelled triumphant through the camp
window

        i want to be an angc-eye-el
        anfl with th ange-eye-els stand

       a crown upon my fore-eye-hcad
       a harp within my hand-hand-hand
       a harp within my-

   bobby you young cuss wheres my
trewsies holy moses bob youve
coopered my trewsies and i havent got
the wherewithal to appear in society and
how-

  bob sent a big laugh crashing into the
everlasting hills  cut it out yvallie he
shouted ill bring the trewsies-left
em in my room to dry he explained cn
passoit as he dashed inside and then
came swinging out his tall head bent in
the low doorway with the cherished rai-
ment

  schuyler watched him as he went leap-
ing like a giant young rabbit down the
wide gallery of the camp bobs strength
and youth never made him feel old and
quiet as that of many youngsters it
seemed rather that youth and strength
were in the air and he himself likely to
catch them from the other side of the
camp came now a chastened song of joy

  every night i used to hang my trewsies up
  on the back of tte bedroom door

warbled morgan far far out of harry
lauders tune bob swung moccasin-
footed around the corner grinning

   hell be ready in a minute sir hun-
gry for your breakfast

  and schuyler now he came to think of
it was hungry the guides camp and
the dining-room and the kitchen were a
	the fete of msieur bob

hundred yards away through the woods
the procession of three filed down a
brown thread of trail deep in forest
shades bright with drops of sunlight fil-
tered shaken through the birches and
spruces the breeze blew the tall ferns
and the ferns nodded a broken contin-
uous good-morning and brushed them
softly as they passed a brown partridge
ran across the brown earth by an old
log and fled clucking up the hillside up
there one heard the ring of an axe
and knew that the garons the younger
guides were after firewood the lake
sparkled through the tree-trunks like a
mammoth tossing field of jewels and
with that the dining-camp was in view
godin the butler stood smiling a pleas-
ant crackling of wood a flash of flame a
sputtering of hot butter in the frying-pan
an appetizing smell of homely good things
to eat such as bacon and trout and coffee
met them full coming around the moss-
set trail they sat down on backless
plank benches about a table covered with
white oil-cloth and breakfasted from
enamelled-ware plates and the roof above
their heads made all the dining-room there
was yet that is a misstatement for the
walls of their dining-room were a pano-
rama the lake twenty feet from their
feet lapped two sides of the knoll shadowy
with spruce trees across the lake green
hills crowded to the water and beyond
them tops of higher hills rolled into the
blueness of t he oldest mountains on t he
planet the laurentian range

  gosh remarked bob later and pat-
ted his lungs  ive et plentiful and
godin carried away the last pociee of
flapjacks untouched the butler here
served flapjacks in the frying-pan and
with that godin stepped forward and
presented morgan with a pile of envel-
opes

  la posle msienr he said the
mornings mail and rippled a laugh

 morgan put them in his corduroy
pocket with a grave thank you and
led the way over the trail back to camp
there one proceeded to sit on the step of
the wide log gallery facing down the lake
to the damned little river two miles
away and read the letters there were
five in various forms all unconven-
tional jean godin josef vezina jacques

alouasse zoetique vezina and josef go-
din accepted an invitation from monsieur
morgan for the fete of his brother mon-
sieur robert morgan on the afternoon of
august  from four to six oclock

  we always do it this way explained
bob we send them each a solemn
note the day before and they accept it
solemnly in a note apiece the morning of
my birthday they cant all write but
they worry out the answers among em
theyre a good lot of fellows lie add-
ed with a manner of protecting gentle-
ness over the labored ill-written papers
and walter indorsed him

  theyre nice fellows all of them he
said heartily

  josef godin thats blanc explained
bob further heres his note mr
schuyler it makes me well sort of
ashamed to have had all the chances
and peter schuyler putting on his gold-
rimmed eye-glasses read blancs note

 monsieur

   i josef vezina present my respectful
compliments to monsieur with a thou-
sand thanks for my invitation to the fete
of monsieur bob and i will come with all
that there is of pleasure monsieur will
be good enough to pardon my writing and
also the spelling because one has not had
very much of instruction

   monsieur i am

 voire scrvilair

josfk vezina

  he is a good fellow schuyler re-
peated and was aware of a queer feeling
which warmed him interiorly

  im going across to lake harlan an-
nounced bob then its getting too
blamed beaverish over there zoetique
and i tore down the dam yesterday and
if those blessed beasts have built it again
im going to hang up a handkerchief
soaked in tar oil to smell em away
want to come mr schuyler id be de-
lighted to paddle you across and its a
nice walk to harlan

  there was a quality in bobs doing of
things which made the things he did seem
desirable schuyler was suddenly anx-
ious to know personally if the beaver had
rebuilt their dam which flooded the lake
and ruined it for hunting
the fete of msieur bob	

  id like to go he said and-and
id rather like to paddle too

  sure sir said bob and presently
the bright long morning was gone and
then lunch was over

  now weve got to get ready for the
festivities said walter morgan and
schuyler at lirst looking on and wonder-
ing found himself shortly helping with
his whole soul wiping perspiration from
his brow he stood back an hour later
and viewed with deep satisfaction the re-
sult of his labors

  i think ive got those prizes pretty
well arranged he announced and re-
garded a miscellaneous labelled lot of
small articles spread on a box cover on
the gallery bench with interest and
pride

  there was a package of cigarettes la-
belled first potato race there was a
box of letter-paper labelled  first axe-
throwing there was a necktie not from
budds marked first obstacle race
and four cigars which said first shoot-
ing other lirst and second prizes of
much the same ilk were there on the
writing-table inside where one might
reach through the window and serve
them were refreshments punch brewed
of good ingredients in the thermos bot-
tles candies brought from new york a
box of sweet wafers unknown of guides
that was all-except cigars which were a
crown of glory to these pipe-smokers

  at four oclock sounds of desultory con-
versation and a little chopping and a little
sawing of wood were heard back of the
camp the morgans grinned at each
other

  youll have to lep into the high-and-
by-ways and lug in the party said bob
they always lose their nerve at the last
minute and fuss around in the woods he
explained to schuyler and shortly mor-
gan was heard genially adjuring his guests
from the wings in his own peerless
french

  venez godin el zoctique et jacques
el loules personnes le bal champetre som-
nes pret nous attendait pour vons tout
somvies pret venez avec moi

  and around the corner he led his sheep
clean and scrubbed they were in fresh
cotton shirts and no coats and conspic-
uously suspendered the sheep were

sheepish they shook hands shyly with
pretty french politeness as if they had
not met for weeks with bob and mr
schuyler receiving and with that the
bal champetre began

  there was a shooting-match first and
the men who never wasted a cartridge be-
cause of expense were given schuylers
english magazine rifle and cartridges ga-
lore and everybody shot in turn jacques
alouasse won schuyler looked at him
curiously as he swung forward hand-
some nonchalant as full of grace as a
wild animal to take his prize of cigars

  jacques was an indian unlike the
others who were french-canadian broth-
ers and cousins from the riviere sainte
anne the ancestors of jacques were
those hurons who had been chased from
what is now central new york state by
the iroquois and had found asylum and
made a little village still called indian
lorette beyond quebec here they live
to-day a tiny colony in a foreign land
pure-blooded indians yet and manufac-
ture canoes and moccasins and do guid-
ing schuyler looked at jacques not
only was the historic background a setting
for the lithe and vigorous figure but his
personality was interesting he was here
in the morgan camp to fill a vacancy
accepted here only because guides were
scarce yet he was probably the best
guide in the club untiring willing pow-
erful capable

  just that one thing against him said
walter morgan but its enough you
can never tell when hell turn up wild
drunk

  it was said that he was now deliber
ately drinking himself to death and no
one could give a reason why his dark
face was a mask of stolidity but a smile
flashed and was gone as he took the cigars
from walter morgan with a deep-toned
merci msicur a herons feather
stuck in his hat gave a dramatic touch to
his old clothes a scarlet bandanna was
around his straight throat his shoulders
were broad and his waist small and he
moved springily as if every muscle played
joyfully he was lean and not too tail a
perfect figure of an athlete a beauti-
ful creature thought schuyler regret-
fully as jacques turned away

  the games went on and each guide
the fete of msieur bob

threw his heart into each event no one
ever had more delightful guests they
were interested in every moment consid-
erate eager to help quick to understand
peter schuyler the world-worn the blase
forgot that he was either forgot to remem-
ber himself at all he roared with laugh-
ter as blanc driven by bob with long
strips of red cotton for reins in the blind-
fold race charged whole-heartedly into a
spruce-bush he presided with keen inter-
est over the tableful of seventeen odds
and ends which the men were to try to
catalogue after ninety seconds study and
he marvelled with the appreciation of a
trained brain at the high percentage
which these brains of home-made training
could remember he entered like a boy
like bub morgan into the entire primi-
tive festivity

  then the laughing happy frenchmen
had said their au revoirs with shy grat-
itude and t hanks repeated over and over
and each with his load of two-penny pre-
cious prizes each crowned with a bright-
colored paper cap out of the snappers
that were a wonderful novelty to these
children of the remote world had gone
oil down the little trail into the forest
with fainter and fainter sound of gay ex-
cited voices and schuyler as he turned
with a sigh of pleasure toward the broth-
ers suddenly realized that he too had
been happy unused nerve connections
were tingling atrophied muscles were
aching deliciously from laughter and ex-
ercise and he was conscious of push-
ing aside impatiently the familiar thought
of his own wretchedness to get room for
the thought of the pleasure of a handful
of french habitants

  by jove he exploded ive had a
remarkable afternoon what fellows they
are-what a joyful lot and what gra-
cious manners  never had a party with
such guests ft makes me feel like going
home and shovelling cart-loads of things
to give them

  walter morgan shook his head you
mustnt spoil them mr schuyler you
could do it you know their life runs
in narrow grooves theyre contented
inside those grooves and mostly theyve
got to stay inside and schuyler de-
ferred to the man who knew them

  but id like to do something for-or

to-that fellow jacques alouasse he re-
flected aloud  does any one know why
- and behold here was godin slipping
noiselessly back a brown figure out of
brown afternoon shadows wouldmsieur
speak to him a moment and as mor-
gan went down the portage bob grinned
theyre going to surprise me he
stated just wait sir-its going to be
awfully pretty youll see

  as they went through the twilight
woods to dinner schuyler saw when they
turned the corner of the trail toward the
dining-camp suddenly all the forest of
canada was dancing with many-colored
lights high in the darkness low and
near and far they hung and swung and
sparkled red and green and yellow they
were and ringmarked and speckled one
cannot believe till one has seen what a
magic earth fifty paper lanterns can man-
ufacture with a lake reflecting manyfold
their broken brilliancy

  as they came to the camp all the
guides stood at the fire smiling pleased
with the great fete gay yet with the after-
noons pleasure sitting at the table to
trout and bacon and fried potatoes was
feasting in fairyland and the mens fig-
ures moving about serving topped with
the mad-shaped colored-paper head-
dresses were as unreal as a story of ger-
man elfs and then when one had de-
voured corn bread and llapjacksand other
delicacies at the last came godin emer-
ging from a secret place bearing in state a
large frosted cake blazing with candles
one for each year of bobs great age and
one to grow on and the guides in
their bright caps trooped respectfully be-
hind godin for one did this each year-
one knew what was expected

  the cake was set in front of the hero of
the day and all the bright head-dresses
bent about the table around the mes-
sieurs seated there and blew mightily to
see who should be the last one married
and with great laughter it was judged to
be bob himself who proceeded to knock
out the pretty pink candles brought from
new york and cut open the cake to give a
slice id each one the little regiment
stood under the gay japanese lanterns

odd and picturesque in their white and blue

and crimson and orange caps and each
one held his plate with its huge slice of
the fete of msieur bob

fruit-cake and munched a bit slyly and
searched surreptitiously for what might
he found till godin discovered a thim-
ble amid much laughter for godin was
an old bachelor a vieux gart-on and
then promptly zoetique had a silver ten-
cent piece and blanc a ring and jacques
alouasse had found a toy watch for the
one who should live the longest a light-
ning gleam flashed across the immobile
indian face

  crais quc non-i think not said
jacques alouasse and swiftly he had
laughed and was saying his deep-toned
merci msieur to bob

  when the messieurs went home lan-
tern-guided through the velvet darkness
the night was so warm and the lure of the
starlit lake so strong that they strolled
down twenty feet to the dock and then
bob shoved a canoe into water and the
three stepped in and floated into the dim-
ness between sky and sea to the silent
pushes of a paddle and behold as hey
rounded a point toward the guides camp a
miracle the black mass of canadian woods
was all alight and the lake gave back en-
chantment redoubling the elusive sparkle
of the lanterns in the rippled water
there seemed no end of the lights all the
woodland was en jele it might have been a
casino at newport or narragansett pier
one listened for the music of an orchestra
for sounds of revelry instead there
came voices and laughter of the guides
out of the clump of spruces where the flame
of candles told of the dining-table ex-
cited words floated to the three on the
lake

  msieur bob-crais-but he fell hard
in the potato race-crais que ouil and
much laughter then an animated dis-
cussion of the eating of the biscuit and
smoking of cigarettes in the obstacle race
but the biscuits there were dry-but
yes me i choked on the second and
thou blanc i saw thee gobble a whole one
at a bouchee-a mouthful i saw it
shouts of laughter again at blancs ex-
pense the men simple-hearted as chil-
dren were going over the events of the
fete of msieur bob the great day of
the summer

  schuyler an hour later lying  his cot
inhaling the balsam through his tent-door
stared out at the dark rim of moun-

tains across the lake back of which a six-
foot golden moon was slowly lifting and
wondered what was the hidden magic
which had made this day a landmark in
his history

  the fete of msieur bob he spoke
half-aloud in the dark the fete of
msieur bob i wonder why it has been
such a beautiful day and was asleep

  he woke to the scolding trill of a squir-
rel and a cannonade of pine cones on his
tent he laughed the squirrel whisked
into a tree-top and schuyler lay and
basked in a peace which passed under-
standing noiselessly across the tent
roof wove a dance of breeze-blown
branches reflected inside the tent walls
the light and shade of the lake waves
played unendingly one heard birds in the
tree-tops and silver lapping of water
against the pebbled shore far off dreamily
one heard the slow ring of an ac schuy-
ler looked at his watch half an hour yet
before it was time for the dash to the lake
and the swim in the shaqi sweet water
he lay still and thought

  the fete of msieur bob was still his
consideration how had it been possible
to construct hours of genuine delight out
of a dozen or two paltry jimcracks whose
total value would not have exceeded five
dollars out of association with a number
of ignorant peasants it sounded to this
man of opportunity paradoxical yet it
had happened he had felt it slowly as
he considered it came to him more or less
unphrased that perhaps all people even
though they do not know it enjoy giving
themselves-that yesterday every one
had given the best that was in him to all
the others that consequently-perhaps
consequently for this was only a theory
to peter schuyler-each one had enjoyed
himself hugely that might be it with
that came the memory of a dark young
face masked in stoic calmness of a re-
served dignity which schuyler fell akin to
something in himself the two thoughts
fused if it was so delightful an amuse-
ment to do things for some one why
should he not try the trick with this fel-
low who attracted him jacques alouasse

  about four that afternoon armed with
the last thought in a four-ounce rod with a
fly-book de luxe and the general sporting
outfit of a dandy who was yet a sport


the fete of msieur bob

schuyler stepped into the bow of a canoe
which alouasse held he took his place
facing the stern and watched with fastidi-
ous satisfaction the perfection of the
guides movements as he slid the boat to
the end of the dock and sprang into the
flying stern effortless and sure down
at the tele tin lac in a bay was a hole
which was in shade early with short
strong strokes as the canadian woodsman
paddles alouasse brought the canoe to
this place and schuyler as they came
trailed his leader and his flies to take the
curl out of them then he cast carefully
he was conscious of doing his best for the
knowledge in the dark watchful eyes he
was conscious of a desire to win the good
opinion of an indian guide who was drink-
ing himself to death he was an expert
fisherman and he cast to-day as even
jacques had seen few people cast the
nine-foot thread of light which was the
leader lifted folded back into space
ausedand with a single movement of the
orearm shivered forward out and out in
a clean loop till it hung straight till sev-
enty-five feet away the tail fly touched
then the second and then the hand fly
the three bright spots flecked the water
in a line scientifically zigzagged not too
slow and not too fast it was perfect cast-
ing and schuyler knew it and knew that
jacques knew it a truly indian grunt
at the third cast spoke approval but no
fish rose to break the brown surface with a
flash of white and the whir of the reel and
the glory of the fight were not forthcom-
ing

  after ten minutes of exhibition casting
go somewhere else jacques ordered
schuyler and jacqucs twisting his pad-
dle under water had the boat about in
forty-five seconds and shortly they were
lancing at the portage up the riviere a la
pote

  there is probably  sweeter spot on
earth the spruces lean over the after-
noon water in a dark canopy back of them
are silver birches and a shadowy trail up a

slope above the river spins and whirls a
sliding mass in crests of foam in pol-
ished dangerous pools ovar and around
and through great gray rocks tossed
about as if giant children had been at
play there is a gentle murmur all about
one and under that one detects the swift

rush of strong water and under deep un-
der all is the hollow booming beat of the
heart of the rapids one is drowned in a
luxury of rich sound of keen fragrant air
of pervading dim greenness

  schuyler after walking the half-mile
portage to the pool above was disap-
pointed to find it still partly in sunlight

  one must wait said jacques alou-
asse philosophically and squatted at a
civil distance and filled his pipe

  schuyler sat down on a log and fol-
lowed his example it was a good
party yesterday jacques he inquired
the fete of msieur bob eh

  but yes msieur said jacques and
said no more

  schuyler wished the man to talk
you have been here before at such
times he went on

  but no msieur said jacques and
fell into another pool of silence this
time however he was moved to climb out
alone  i have wished to be here for
that fete jacques volunteered one
has heard much of it in saint ray-
mond where i worked at boat-building
last winter they spoke of the fete of
msieur bob the men had told of it
and it was wonderful to the people of
saint raymond they could hardly be-
lieve that such things could happen in the
woods

  schuyler gasped was this naivete
possible but jacques was perfectly seri-
ous his enthusiasm had carried away
his reserve he went on

   me i wished to see such an affair i
asked the steward of the club msieur de-
mers to say a good word for me if msieur
should wish another guide and he did

  a sudden thought flashed to schuylers
mind to his lips

  everybody is ready to say a good
word for you jacques in every way ex-
cept one said schuyler

  a silence the older man felt his pulse
quicken as he thought now ive spoiled
it all now he will think he is to be lec-
tured and go back into his shell

  jacques spoke ah i get drunk
he agreed with quiet dignity

   yesschuylernodded  whatmakes
you

  jacques visibly hesitated and schuyler
in the pause was conscious of a feeling
drawn t-y phiiif it qpoilwin

he roared with laughter as lilanc driven by ijob	charged wliule-heariedly into a spruce-bubh iagc j

vol lv-	
the fete of msieur bob

which most people all people surely who
have what is called temperament have
known a few times it was the feeling
that between this man and himself there
stretched a definite bond of comprehen-
sion perhaps no intangible proof is
stronger than this that we are all rather
literallymembers one of another that
under all our small personal manifesta-
tions of life lies the universal linking life
which is god neither schuyler nor
jacques had any such formulated thought
yet both felt the unmistakable glow and
opening of spirit which is the thing meant
the mask seemed to drop from the in-
dian face the dark bright eyes met
schuylers wistful troubled schuylers
heart warmed to the look

  msieur would like to know about
me  asked jacques and msieur briefly
indicated that he would

  so jacques in bare sentences told a
curious mediaeval tale he had been
wild he had drunk whiskey and gotten
en fete he had played tricks on the
chiefs at lorette he had been absent from
mass many times and one sunday morn-
ing while so absent he had fought a bear
and killed him without a gun when he
had gone back in high glee with his game
the priest pere augustin had made him
come into his house and had told him that
it was the devil who had helped him to
kill that bear-that he was no doubt
possessed of the devil pere augustin
liad gone farther he had told jacques that
there was no doubt that for his many
sins he was now damned to all eternity
also that if marie gros-pierre should
marry him she also would be damned
jacques had come out from that inter-
view a desperate man he had gone to
marie and freed her from her promise
but marie would not be freed she
would marry jacques if he were a los soul
or not she would go to hell with him if
that must be he was hers she would
not leave him for heaven or hell

  jacques squatting by the brown lap-
ping water laid down his pipe and gazed
at peter schuyler from dark eyes filled
with the tragedy of a race what then
can one do  he demanded  me i can-
not let marie be damned i cannot re-
fuse to marry her so i kill myself it
is all the way i can think of  is more

trouble to my people and to marie if i
shoot myself so i drink i drink very
much i am strong so it go more slow
but i kill me in one year maybe maybe
more it is a good way msieur thinks
so

  m sieur did not m sieur stared speech-
less for a moment and then found ener-
getic speech jacques listened atten-
tively

  but msieur he reasoned gently
the good god had doubtless told pere
augustin that i was damned in fact he
said so

  the good god never told any one any
such thing peter schuyler answered
hotly tie good god is ready to help
you out of the mess you are in the minute
youre ready to try to get out schuy-
ler marvelled as he heard his own voice in
this unmistakable sermonizing but he
was too eager to think about lhat

  jacques shook his head i thank
you msieur it would be agreeable to
believe msieur but the priests know
that is their metier he repeated

  schuyler considered he thought of
the saintly priests whom he had known
of the church to which jacques belonged
of shepherds of little flocks such as this
huron fold at lorette and their kindly
guidance and lifelong examples of self-
sacrifice and loving-kindness he thought
of priestly orators swaying masses of ig-
norant souls to better things he thought
of busy earnest years of unselfish men
threading in their worn black clothes the
close streets of crowded cities he thought
of father jogues and the martyrs who
had counted their lives as nothing for the
souls of other indian people three hundred
years ago and then he marvelled that the
poor little village had somehow missed the
multitude of good men and fallen into the
hands of a rascal for rascality will hap-
pen in any calling and a sacred one is no
exception

  then schuyler squared himself to ar-
gument had jacques meant to be
wicked why no jacques answered not
at all he had been foolish he had per-
haps wished to be more daring than
others but that was all would jacques
himself forgive a person who had done
these things schuyler asked why cer-
tainly jacques said then threw back
the fete of msieur bob



schuyler what sort of a god would it be	-with a shrug-take the punishment

who would not be as generous as jacques	also- an arrow of light glittered from

alouasse who would send a young fel-	the black eyes-also i hate the good god

low to eternal torture for foolishness	and i hate pere augustin

why reasoned he dragging out long-neg-	i dont wonder agreed schuyler
lected teachings why even if a man were a and then  why do you hate him 

all i lie biishl heatl-drcses bent about ihe table around the
iiti-ssit urs seated ihere and blew mightily  see win
should be the last otic married - page -

criminal the wickedest man on earth the
good god was so great and so kind that he
would gladly forgive him the moment he
tried to do better

  a gleam of grim amusement lighted
the tragic black eyes msieur doesnt
know god very well suggested jacques
msieur agreed to that

  we are not instructed of him like that
in our village jacques went on  pere
augustin has taught us that if one does
not do as pere augustin says god will give
him the stick one way or another it is
probably well for us to believe so mostly
it makes a person careful me i have a
feeling here-he tapped his broad chest
- that if god is unjust to me like that i
will not do his way but my own and

   because when i am dead he will force
marie to marry his nephew his nephew
achille will give him maries money
marie is rich she has nine hundred dol-
lars which her father left her me-and
he lifted his head haughtily-me i do
not want maries money i want marie
and any one listening would have known
that he spoke the truth

  schuyler meditated he formed amen-
tal picture of a greedy plotter exploiting
the poor little village he followed the
windings of the sordid plan jacques
the difficult black sheep driven to suicide
marie bullied into marriage with achille
his tool and maries money absorbed un-
der some pretence by himself then pere
augustin with his wealth of nine hundred
	the fete of msieur bob

dollars might leave indian loretteandgo
afield for a career

  jacques spoke schuyler youmake
a mistake to kill yourself

  jacques shrugged his shoulders french-

y-

  that makes nothing i go to hell in
any case god is bad he send me to
hell no matter what i do now

  with that schuyler argued again as to
the inevitable charactcr of a good god
jacques listened even more attentively

  msieur is there another god than
the god of pere augustin he asked
hopefully

  and schuyler considering thought how
each of us in his groping to find out
shapes that great unknowable after his
own feeble pattern very gently he tried
to tell the man listening breathless to the
tale of wonder how the reality must be
kinder stronger than any vision of any of
us your life is a part of him ex-
plained schuyler  it is for that you have
no right to cut it short-and was aware
with a jump that his words applied to
others than jacques yet he thought
hurriedly it was most different jacques
was young strong at the beginning he
himself was ill and growing old nearing the
end it was another question also he was
capable of judging jacques was not he
went on

  do you think you are a brave man
jacques the troubled eyes met his
with a glance like a blow

  i have not the habit to be afraid
msieur

  then if you are brave why should
you act like a coward 

  schuyler had a glimpse then of how the
forebears of jacques only a few genera-
tions ago had looked on the war-path
but jacques said nothing schuyler went
on to live our lives here is a battle
many creatures suffer to make a life pos-
sible we come here through suffering
the poor beasts suffer whose flesh we eat
and whose skins and fur are our clothing
isnt it honorable that we should suffer
something in return for all this innocent
pain also isnt it the part of a brave
man to stay in the fight till the fight is
ended or-or-schuyler stammered
a bit-or as good as ended you are
just beginning it would be like a cow-

ard to throw down your bow and arrow
and run out of the battle and how do
you know what is coming it may be
good things it may be honest work and
a mans place in the world prove that
pere augustin is wrong take up your
life and live it well god will not damn
you because any one says so

  wont he inquired jacques sur-
prised

  schuyler brought down his fist on the
old log with a force that sent loose bark
flying  you have a better chance for
heaven t han pere augustin its damned
nonsense and malice the game is in your
own hands stop drinking live the best
life you know how and youll get to
heaven in spite of pere augustin

  ah said jacques with a shadowy
smile i thank msieur and with
that a largefish jumped and the case rested
for this sitting

  there were other sittings paddling
in the gleaming hill-set fastnesses of the
riviere a la poele floating down the west
side of lac noir deep in afternoon
shadow casting the long light-ray of the
leader over the dark bay at the head of
the lake fishing the lightning river amid
murmuring waters one held seances
one discussed heaven and hell when the
fish difl not rise schuylers blood was
up he would save this fellow more and
more he grew to like him he threw the
force of his trained brain into the com-
bat and he began to see that he scored
jacques was intelligent the wall of
prejudice was sapped from within while
it was battered from without

  msieur is very clever the educa-
tion of msieur coiltail cher-cost much
he asked wistfully one day twisting the
canoe deftly to a better position he
wanted to believe in this strange new
hope

  and schuyler went to work half-smil-
ing half with tears in his eyes to set
forth the expense of sending a boy to
groton to yale to oxford and around
the world jacques was impressed to
speechlessness it was apparent that the
brains of schuyler translated into cash
were more than the brains of pere au-
gustin so translated schuyler saw the
blind faith of years crumbling before this
battering-ram of dollars yet the argu-

you have a belter chance fur heaven than he-page 


one discussed heaven and hell when the fish did not rise-page 

ments which fetched jacques in ihe end
were better arguments than this the
mind behind the keen black eyes was a
thinking mind once stirred schuyler
drag-netted his brain for the reading of
years back and put it in battle-array and
so jacques who did not know how to
write came to be fairly well informed in
the broadest modern views of philosophy
and religion

  then on a day the gargbjis came back
from a two-daystrip to the club with mail
among the letters was one for schuyler
from the daughter whom he loved the
best of his children

  cant you pick up a trustworthy in-
teresting guide for little peter wrote
mary van rensseller from her adiron-
dack place he reads too much and i
cant get him excited over paddling and
woodscraft as a boy should be our
guides are too old for him i think and
not one is dramatic enough to appeal to
little peter who is greedy for a cooper
king arthur robin hood incarnation
can you lay hands on such father he
needs it physically

  and schuyler recognized the letter as a
crisis in a life not that of little peter

  the water was high that afternoon the
foam lay in mounds of whipped cream
under the bushes of  the sauvage which
overhung the shores of the riviere a la
poele the frying-pan river the water
being so high it was not good fishing but
yet it was worth while to paddle to the
wide mouth of the stream sentinelled
with bowlders with grouped serene spruce-
spires pointing upward to the sky re-


fleeted downward in the lake it was
worth while to cast across cold brown
water and know lhat big trout lay hidden
there and might by chance rise to the fly

  jacques said schuyler when after
fifteen minutes no trout had risen
jacques would you like to go back with
me and guide for my little grandson
the black velvet eyes glittered with a
swift light jacques said nothing schuy-
ler briefly stated the case

  msieur jokes inquired jacques
msieur made it clear that he did not
joke there was a silence schuyler
waited out of the black-green depths
of a spruce wood on the hillside an hour-
bird a hermit thrush sang his liquid
lingering four notes and stopped the
earth was deep peace

  msieur knows my affair that i am a
drunkard  jacques asked

  i know your affair answered schuy-
ler

  msieur would trust the grandchild
which msieur loves the little chief to a
drunkard

 you are wrong said schuyler
the man to whom i would trust my
grandchild would be a man who has got
through with drink forever

  then he wailed rather breathlessly
jacques sucked in a long breath

  msieur would trust me the outcast
with a child dear to him

  i would trust you schuyler an-
swered

  it was the crucial moment neither of
the two men missed the largeness of the
four words to schuyler a vision of little
the fete of msieur boh	

peter rose and he shivered a bit who
was this wild indian that for his salvation
he should hand over the safety of that be-
loved cropped head and those priceless
bare brown legs yet some force held
him to his bargain as he stared at the
wild indian concerned he was aware with
a start of embar-
rassment that the
brilliant black
eyes were staring
back through a
mist two drops
rolled on the lean
dark cheeks of
jacques

  msieur said
jacques  my life
is not good enough
to give you but
i will give it to
you for it is all 
have

 three years
after this peter
schuyler waited
on a day at a lit-
tle country sta-
tion in the far
northern part of
new york state

his great-grand-
father had owned
a tract of land
thereabouts be-
fore the revolu-
tion and much of
it had come down
to him he had
lately installed a
new superintend-
ent trained for

the purpose over the farms and their in-
dustries and he was interested in the
young mans success the young man
had gone away to get married and schuy-
ler at the little station on the road to
canada sat in his touring-car and waited
to meet him and his bride

  far down the rails a whistle tooted dis-
tantly a locomotive slid into the gap be-
tween the great hills raced screaming
toward him stopped the train had ar-
rived schuyleron theplatform watched
a dark lithe young man spring out with

he turned and helped
prettiest dark girs
ever

a free grace a bit incongruous with his
middle-class new clothes ho turned and
helped to alight one of the very prettiest
dark girls whom schuyler had ever seen
and then in a moment the two had spied
him and the mans black eyes were ablaze

  tt is my wife-it is marie gros-

                         iierre jacques
cried eagerly
sweeping the slim
figure forward
and looked proud-
ly from one to
the other and
schuyler took the
girls hand and
said friendly
things with a gra-
ciousness which
many high-born
ladies had never
known from him
and with that
marie gros-pierre
was having the
first motor-drive
of her life and
schuyler was won-
dering more and
more ashe talked
tohernotshynot
forward spark-
ling with happi-
ness responsive
to every kind
look at the per-
fect breedingwhich
nature gives to
some of her chil-
dren lree gratis
he had made
plans for marie
gros-pierres well-
being for years to come before the car
drew up at the stone farm-house in the
deep valley by the stream

  but msieur it is a palace said
marie gazing awe-struck at her home
jacques and i we can never deserve it
but yet we will try and she went to
get supper in her palace

  two hours later as marie rattled
dishes happily schuyler and his superin-
tendent talked outside in the scented june
darkness first practically of crops and
machines and money then as the pipes

to alight one of the very
whom schuyler had
seen
the fete of msieur bob

burned low jacques in his deep vague
tones resonant yet of forest streams and
still hills thanked schuyler straightfor-
wardly for giving him life and god and a
career and his wife there is nothing
of the great things i have this night which
i do not owe to msieur jacques said
and schuyler laying his pipe on his knee
had no answer yet after a time he
spoke

  jacques said schuyler i owe you
as much as you owe me

   me msieur  jacques was surprised
msieur owes me anything msieur
jokes

  so schuyler seeing of jacques only the
light of adoring black eyes talked for a
few minutes as if to his own soul he told
of his illness his loss of interest in the
world his dread of old age he told of the
little steel affair in his desk and of his re-
solve to use it that september of his
going to canada to fill in the interval he
told how the simple joy of living of the
morgans had given him a manner of happy
shock how he had found himself with
his resolve of suicide still unbroken feel-
ing oftener and oftener inconsistently
contented then he told how with this
preparation he had grown interested in
jacques himself how he had come to feel
it vitally necessary to save him how in
reasoning against jacquess self-murder
he had reasoned against his own and how
at last the keen interest in another life had
undermined the morbid desire to end his
own he told how it had come to him as
an illumination as world-old truths often
come that the one thing which keeps a
life fresh is that it should like a stream
continually spend itself these inmost
soul-secrets schuyler the reserved the
haughty who could not have said such
things to his brother or his son these
things he expounded to an indian guide
his faim-si perintendent it is likely that

when a soul gets down to bottom real-
ity it talks if talking is done to a soul
without regard for race creed or color
jacquess soul was a strong one and de-
veloped by suffering and given once for
all with indian finality to the service and
worship of schuyler also now of a new
god introduced by schuyler jacques
listened and understood

  when the older man had finished and
the quiet june night had closed about his
voice and laid over it two or three soft
moments and built it into the great wall of
things past then jacques answered with
a liquid hollow depth of tone which had
often made schuyler think of the rapids
on the riviere a la poele booming dis-
tantly at midnight

  msieur jacques said and his eng-
lish still carried a strong accent and an ef-
fect of translation  i am an ignorant
man but i see more clearly than  did
formerly it appears to me msieur that
if a mans life is for himself he becomes
rather sick of it cmmye msieur and
sometimes would like to end it because it
is tiresome but if it is for others which i
believe is the better arrangement and
which is msieurs way-and schuyler
in the dark felt ashamed and contented-
then it is clear that a man has no right
to end his life for how can one tell at
what moment one may be of use to those
others-anybody-everybody one can-
not tell therefore one must live on and
keep the lookout to be of service for that
is what living is for also that way is
more amusing ncst-ce pus msieur
you are undoubtedly right jacques
answered peter schuyler calmly  i be-
gan to see that point of view on the day of
the fete of msieur bob

  ah jacques was smiling in the dark-
ness the fete of msieur bob it was
a day of good luck for me that day
and for me agreed schuyler
sardis and the american excavations

by howard crosby butler

he excavations which have
been in progress at ancient
sardis during several
months of each year for the
past four years are the first
work of the kind on so large
a scale that has yet been undertaken
by americans in greek lands the place
which after the first season was pro-
nounced by competent scholars on both
sides of the atlantic to be the most im-
portant of all the ancient sites in asia
minor has already yielded scientific re-
sults far beyond the expectations of those
who were most interested in it a temple
to artemis one of the largest erccted in
greek antiquity has been completely un-
earthed hundreds of objects large and
small objects of beauty as well as of
archeological interest have been brought
to light and many inscriptions in greek
one of them of great historical importance
have been discovered but the discovery
which stands out by itself and which would
make the whole undertaking worth while
if nothing else had been found is that of
a large body of inscriptions in lydian a
new and unknown tongue together with
two keys which promise eventually to
open this entirely new store of historical
information thus archaeologists and his-
torians as well as philologians and epig-
raphists both at home and abroad are
looking with the keenest interest toward
this new field for research but an article
which is to describe in a popular way
the work being done at a place so little
known as sardis must begin with excur-
sions into geography and history and
some brief descriptions of the country and
its present inhabitants may serve to give
a fresh and living setting to a theme de-
voted to the resurrection of a long-dead
city

there is a river which flows northward
eastward and northward again finding its
hazardous way through the rugged moun-
tains of ancient lydia in asia minor its
vol lv-

waters now scant and limpid now volumi-
nous and turbid are poured at length into
a larger and more sluggish stream which
fed by a hundred other snow-born foun-
tains that descend from the almost per-
petually snow-clad mountains on the
south flows westward in its turn through
abroad and fruitful plain and then through
a narrow defile to lose itself and its yel-
low hue at last in the clear expanse of the
bay of smyrna which at this point rep-
resents the yegean sea the smaller
river is the ancicnt pactolus-the gold-
bearing stream of classical legend and
song-in which mythical midas washed
to cleanse himself of the golden touch
and from which historical croesus washed
his wealth by the simple process known
as placer mining for croesus was no
other than the last king of the ancient
lydian nation and the pactolus cut in
halves the market-place of no less a city
than sardis his capital the greater
river was anciently the hermus beside
its banks the armies of xerxes and of
alexander encamped it made cf the
plain of lydia a great nations granary
and garden but it did not appeal to the
poets and the builders of legend as did
its little mountain arm with the sands of
gold the snow-capped mountain was
tmolus to the greeks its rugged fast-
nesses saw the birth and youthful sports
of pan thus in a few words we may
place tne setting of this story on the
ancient geographical chart and in the
mythology and legends of the ancient
greeks

on the east bank of the pactolus just
above the point where that stream enters
the plain to join the hermus rises a sharp-
crested precipitous-sided crag some six-
hundred feet high composed of reddish
hard-packed clay shot through with
rounded pebbles there is a thin line of
green along its summit and straggling
wisps of pine and broom cling to its al-
most naked sides as they rise abruptly
from lower slopes that are thick with

                                      


sardis and the american excavations

scrub-oak thorn and oleander this shaft
of red clay with its spear-point crest-
for it is hardly more than a shaft-is all
that remains of the famous acropolis of
ancient sardis and if you look care-
fully you will see two fragments of mass-
ive wall balancing themselves below the
crest if you were to climb the shoulder
of the acropolis you would seo several
hundred feet of this wall still holding it-
self in place by some acrobatic feat of
statics which the beholder is powerless to
explain

  at the foot of the acropolis quite near
the rivers eastern bank two ionic col-
umns of white marble for years on end
have been the only monument to mark the
last resting-place of the older sardis the
lower city of the lydians and the greeks
beside these columns in the month of
march iqio a party of american exca-
vators pitched their tents prepared to
begin the unearthing of the ancient city
and since the two ionic shafts were the
only visible signs of a building of un-
doubted antiquity that might or must be
buried below it was natural that the ex-
cavators should choose to begin their
operations in the neighborhood of these
two guide-posts rather than on the far-
ther side of the acropolis hill where there
are remains of a roman sardis or out
toward the plain where crude and un-
sightly masses of broken wall mark the
site of the town of byzantine days

  a moderately practised eye could see
that columns of such massive girth and
so disproportionally low could be show-
ing hardly more than one half of their
original height they stood over six feet
in diameter and only a little over thir-
ty feet high they were undoubtedly
greek and in the ionic style and the
correct proportion of height to diameter
should be nearer nine times than five
limes thus one could reason that the
building to which these columns belonged
allowing for the platform upon which such
a building might be presumed to stand
must be buried from thirty to forty feet
deep at this point to the south and
west the level of the ground fell off
toward the river whose banks were not
more than fifteen or twenty feet high
but to the north and east the present
level gains one or two feet with every

  rod so that the city in these directions
from the columns must lie fifty sixty
even seventy feet under ground every
intelligent visitor who stands beneath
these columns and looks up to the scanty
remnants of the fortifications on the
sharp peak above them asks the same
question how did a city as great as
sardis is believed to have been a cily
which must have had many and large
buildings ever become so completely and
so deeply buried and such as have
read their polybius as a few visitors do
in preparation for a visit also ask how
in the world were a great fortress one of
the most impregnable of antiquity and
numerous large buildings enough to com-
pose an upper city ever perched upon
that knife-bladc and what has become
of them all surely they were not buried
the answer to one question is answer to
the other it involves an explanation
that the hill we now see is not the hill of
croesuss stronghold not the acropolis so
gallantly defended by achseus in the
third century b c but only a small
fragment of it the remainder of it lies
below burying the ancient lower city in
its debris look at it now tiny ava-
lanches of sand and pebbles are coming
down under the tread of every venture-
some goat with the flap of an eagles
wing against its sides it is falling every
moment or better creep up toward
the base of one of those cliffs on a winter
morning when the sun first strikes it
after a night of frost hear that bang and
rattle like artillery see that pinnacle
topple and fall while the eagles the
hawks and the owls which have their
nests in its pitted surface fly screaming
from their nooks this is a country of
earthquakes it is written down in his-
tory that a great one destroyed sardis
in the year  of this era in the reign
of tiberius cai-sar we shall never know
how much of the acropolis fell down on
that occasion nor how much has fallen
in the earthquakes which have shaken it
during the nineteen hundred years since
but the fragments of walls which we see
up there are not the walls of lydians or
greeks not even of the romans they
are the building of the latest of the by-
zantine defenders even turkish perhaps
but not an inch of the hilltop now visible
sardis and the american excavations



could be seen when alexander the great
stood upon it these parts were probably
near the core of the acropolis in those
days

  i cannot leave alexander standing upon
the top of the acropolis without giving
some description of the splendid pano-
rama that spread out before him look-
ing then very much as it does now for
although the pedestal on which he stood
and its base have changed much the
outlying hills being of more enduring
stuff the plain the river the lake and
the glorious expanse of sky have altered
only as light and shade and the vary-
ing clouds can change them beyond
the vast expanse of whitened housetops
and marble-tiled temple roofs beyond
the massive walls ard the city gates be-
yond all these things that are no more to
the north and far around toward the
rising sun spreads out the sumptuous
plain divided and subdivided into squares
and rectangles of golden yellow green and
reddish-brown-the wealth of lydia in
various stages of development through
the midst runs a stream of molten silver
winding in broad majestic curves near
the river a mighty assemblage of tents
marked the camp of the macedonian
army the plain was dotted with more
and better-looking villages but the
squares and rcctanglcs which change ihcir
colors with every moon were there as
they are now beyond the plain straight
to the northward on a long low ridge
rises a vast array of cone-shaped mounds
of varying sizes some as large as the
great pyramids others no bigger than
a thirty-foot tent all regular in form
and smoothly overgrown with grass if
aristotle had schooled him thoroughly in
herodotus as well as in plato alexander
krew that these mounds were the famous
tombs of the lydian kings even before
his attendants informed him of the fact
the great one toward the east is the tomb
of alyattes the next one is king gygess
tomb the others have no names and
the smaller ones were probably not royal
tombs at all unless the kingdom of lydia
lasted much longer and had many more
kings than we have any reason to sup-
pose the turks now call the ridge with
its tumuli bin tepc - the thousand
mounds the background of the tomb-

hills is a broad expanse of burnished steel
-the lake of gyges beyond this range
above range purple and azure rise the
distant mountains which form the north-
ern boundary of the plain the faint blue
peak which seems to pierce the sky is
said to be the summit of the moesian
olympus in all other directions far
and near mountains and hills snowy
crest and beetling crag tufted forest
slope and black cavernous ravine com-
pose a prospect of wild splendor to the
east loom the towering masses of mount
tmolus crowned and streaked with
white to the south rises a mighty pine-
clad mountain wall cleft with deep and
shadowy gorges through which wild
mountain torrents roar and leap from
cataract to cataract cutting their way
through barriers of glistening marble un-
til white precipices rise sheer on either
hand to the westward gaunt and bare
the red-clay hills stand carved by wind
and rain into a thousand fantastic shapes
like the spires and pinnacles of gothic
architecture and beyond more fair blue
hills reaching up to mountain height
then at the northwest the eye once more
rests where the plain and mountain meet
again below the steep wall of mount
sipylus where still weeps niobe that
huge pathetic figure in stone

  but what was there inquires again
the intelligent visitor to make a town
like sardis shut up between two moun-
tains on the edge of a plain that was no
richer than many other plains so im-
portant in antiquity surely it was not
merely the wealth of crccsus and what
is there about sardis now that makes it
worth while to spend so much money and
so much labor in excavating it

  the two questions are perfectly fair
but it would make a very long story to
answer them fully and i doubt if i have
the knowledge to answer them in de-
tail giving justly balanced weight to the
claims of every reason for these things
but brief answers which may be satisfy-
ing for the moment can be given offhand
by any of us who have the work here in
our hands it certainly was not simply
the wealth of croesus that gave sardis its
ancient importance although in a sense
that played an important part crcesuss


sardis and the american excavations

great fortune may have been in part at
least a myth-he might rank to-day only
as a third or fourth rate millionaire but
let us consider that fortune as a symbol
of things more significant than the treas-
ure of one man gold was found in the
bed of the pactolus-it was easily ob-
tained the lydians and crcesuss royal
predecessors for generations had been
growing rich from this source but it is
more important to remember that the
lydians were the first nation to coin gold
crcesus made his coinage in such values
that it was easily exchangeable in the
east and west he became one might
say a great exchange banker and the
position of his kingdom midway between
the oriental world and the greek world
helped his business and this brings us
to a consideration of the second question
sardis is important as a site for excava-
tion just because of her position at a
point where east and west met she
moreover commanded the terminus of
the greatest of all the trade-routes of its
day-the royal road-which coming
straight through asia minor carried the
converging commerce of all the peoples
of the east into her warehouses and sent
it forth again westward to the seaports
imagine what tolls and customs duties
sardis could have exacted from this com-
merce imagine what a power she had as
a disseminator of oriental goods in the
west and of occidental goods in the east
a power of exchanging thoughts arts in-
dustries between the two-this made her
important

 there are many people nowadays
many scholars in fact who believe that
the civilization of the greeks their re-
ligion and their art did not spring wholly
and independently from the soil of hellas
eastern civilization was older eastern
art had been longer did they affect the
civilization and the art of greece and if
so to what extent this is an important
question for to a high degree it bears
upon the origins of our own civilization
though few realize this until their atten-
tion is called to it and how much we
hear of origins in these days since dar-
win wrote his origin of species what
mines of wealth what labors of the brain
wiiat regiments of lives have been de-
voted to the study of origins the study

of history and of art no less than that
of the natural world must be treated
by the evolutionary method and these
sciences are no longer sciences without it
now it safely may be assumed that if
there is any ancient site which holds
secrets touching the origins of greek civ-
ilization that site for reasons given
above is sardis sardis had a long his-
tory longer than the unbroken history of
greece she was great powerful and
progressive yet all that we know about
her is to be gleaned from a few sentences
of the great greek historian this can-
not be all there is to know the lyd-
ians had a language of their own writ-
ten in characters of their own devising-
a highly developed language which they

  in the middle of the sixth century
ii c sardis was the capital of an old and
powerful independent kingdom and one
of the great cities of the wrorld her his-
tory must have been a long one though
how long we cannot say owing to the
scantiness of our present information
crcesus the last and perhaps the great-
est of the lydian kings was himself a
phil-iiellene but he was undoubtedly
not the first to encourage greek culture in
lydia the sixth century was a time of
greek expansion and of greek coloniza-
tion in all parts of the mediterranean
basin greeks had come to lydia and
had settled in sardis bringing their cul-
ture with them long before the famous
visit of solon then came the persian
war-that great war of invasion from the
east-and crcesus who had done so
much to save hellas from the invaders
lost his throne and was carried away a
captive to the persian capital sardis
became the western capital of the persian
empire the seat of a persian satrap and
a persian garrison became a fixture upon
the acropolis for over two hundred
years the city remained under persian
sway but she did not become persian-
quite the contrary for the seeds of
greek civilization already sown grew up

bore fruit increased and multiplied so	cities of asia sardis was rebuilt after the

that the conquest was in effect one for	great earthquake of the year  a d and

the greeks when alexander arrived	flourished as a metropolis for a few cen-

before the gates of sardis they were	turies longer she was among the earlier

thrown open to him he was welcomed as	cities to harbor a community who had

the columns before the excavations were begun march 

a deliverer and without delay he made
sardis a free greek city on a footing
with the ionian cities of the coast from
this time whatever still survived of the
old lydian life and custom was merged
in the common hellenistic civilization
that had begun to cover the then known
world lydia and her capital after two
stormy centuries under the successors of
alexander like all the ancient kingdoms
of asia were engulfed in the maw of rome
holding an honored and more or less
independent position among her sister
vol lv-

embraced the newly preached tenets of
christianity and was the seat of one of
the seven churches of asia although
saint john in the apocalypse is not san-
guine of the condition of the sardian
church in the first century it remained
an important centre of christianity long
after the early struggles of the infant
church were over and passed as a city
of the later roman and byzantine days
sardis seems to have lost much of her
pristine power and eminence she fell to
the turks in the eleventh century and
the excavations in april 

acropolis tents ol the excavators and columns of the temple of artemis pactolus in the foreground

met her final destruction at the hands of
timour lenk tamerlane in the year
 a d

  the task of excavation was begun to
the westward of the columns so often re-
ferred to above at the river-bank where
some flood had cut a perpendicular face-
a practical cross-section-of the accumu-
lated debris that buried the city the
first cutting was carried down to a level
or stratum of clay almost as hard as
rock which seemed to be a natural and
undisturbed formation but this lowest
level was soon abandoned for one about
five feet higher where a large paving-
block of marble apparently in place gave
the first sign of human handiwork ex-
cavation was carried rapidly eastward on
this level by means of a cutting one hun-
dred and fifty feet wide for several weeks
until an ancient building oblong with a
flight of steps on its long western side
and preserved to a height of from six to
ten feet was unearthed it was evident
that the building was very early it was


tentatively called the lydian build-
ing and the level was called the lydian
level later discoveries established the
correctness of these titles about the
walls of this lydian building and in two
rows on either side of it stood rectan-
gular marble bases with sockets in their
tops to receive the bottoms of tall in-
scribed slabs or stela one of these
stelse was found having fallen forward
from its elevated base it contained a
long and well-engraved lydian inscription
all the other stela had been carried away

  but scarcely had these interesting re-
mains of lydian civilization come to
light when farther advance on this level
was checked by the finding of heavy walls
of huge roughly finished blocks of white
marble perfectly fitted together immedi-
ately cast of the lydian building these
were soon found to be the foundations of
the great temple the eastern end of
which was represented by the two tall
columns standing over three hundred
feet away this discovery at once gave
proof that the temple was one of the
the temple from lie north march 

largest of greek antiquity and necessi-
tated the temporary abandonment of the
lydian level for that of the temple plat-
form about ten feet above it the orig-
inal cutting was then widened and the
force of laborers was increased to about
one hundred men before the end of
the first season the foundations of the
western quarter of the temple had been
exposed and progress eastward had
carried the excavations into the western
chamber of the temple that is to say the
treasury with every few yards advance
the temple was found in a better and
better state of preservation the west-
ern portico preserved only the founda-
tions of columns in large blocks of marble
but the north wall of the treasury cham-
ber was found to be standing to a height
of about seven feet above its foundations
and here on the inner face was found a
long inscription beautifully cut in small
greek letters which was found to be a
mortgage given by one mnesymachos to
the stewards of the temple of artemis a
most interesting and important document

in itself which gave the first incontest-
able proof that the building was the tem-
ple of artemis the inscription is to lie
dated by internal evidence in the closing
years of the fourth century b c ionic
capitals of unusual beauty and a number
of highly finished lluted-column drums
together with fragments of carved-col-
umn bases and other details which were
recovered during the first season indi-
cated that the temple was begun early in
the fourth century

  with the second campaign a further
widening out of the original cutting was
accomplished in addition to the principal
work of digging continually eastward in
the direction of the columns but even
with the introduction of a de couvillc sys
tem of railway and an increase in the
number of laborers to two hundred men
the eastern progress was slower than it
had been during the previous campaign
this was due in part as had been an-
ticipated to the rapid increase of the
depth of soil to be removed but prin-
cipally to the increasing number of fallen

                                      
	sardis and the american excavations

building-stones and architectural details	buried in thirty feet of debris as the

which were encountered drums of col-	excavations progressed it became more

umns and blocks for the walls weighing	and more apparent that the western end

from five to seven tons to say nothing	of the temple had been exposed or only

of a block of the architrave of twenty-	little buried during the byzantine pe-

five tons weight suspended in soft earth	riod and that the ancient building had

general view of the excavations in june a

high above the bottom of the excava-
tions constituted an ever-present dan-
ger to laborers working near them and
caused constant delays until these huge
obstructions could be removed to per-
manent places of safety the end of the
season however saw the clearing out of
the cclla-the main chamber of the tem-
ple-the exposing of the foundations of
a long line of columns on either side of
the building and the unearthing of the
bases of two columns at the southeast
angle including one of the standing col-
umns which was thus converted from a
short thick shaft to one of unusual height
and slenderness about twenty-five feet
having been added to its length the
remainder of the eastern portico remained

served as a quarry at least from the
sixth century onward on the level upon
which much of this breaking up had been
carried on among a heap of intentionally
broken blocks of marble we found a
hoard of two hundred and seventeen
bronze coins of the sixth century which
probably represented the savings of sone
laborer engaged in the work of destruc-
tion it was further evident that the
temple was preserved only in proportion
as it had been buried and that more
than two thirds of the edifice its walls
its columns and entablature even its
roof of marble tiles had been broken up
and converted into lime at least twelve
hundred years ago fortunately the
foundations had been spared even at the
sardis and the american excavations



unfortunate west end in the middle of
the cultus chamber was disclosed a mass-
ive platform composed of two layers of
coarse purple sandstone blocks evidently
belonging to a structure far older than the
fourth-century temple and presumed to

plete unearthing of the temple and the
discovery of a large body of lydian in-
scriptions together with a key in the
form of an aramaic translation of one of
them in addition to the almost daily
 finds of greater or less importance but

the little church from the north

be the basis for the great cultus statue of
artemis at a point where one of the
later marble-column foundations had
been joined on to this ancient construc-
tion in the vertical joints between the
two a collection of large greek coins in
silver was found fifty-five in all tetra-
drachms of philip alexander and sev-
eral of the earlier successors of alexander
all in a perfect state of preservation and
most of them as fresh as they were the
day they came from the mint in an-
other similar position a mass of copper
coin of the same age was found and be-
tween the layers of the basis a silver
coin of crcesus

the third season was most interesting
and spectacular for it witnessed the com-

the fourth season the campaign just
closed was the most satisfactory of all
for it saw the temple brought up as it
were out of a pit and set in a broad open
space more as it was of old it equalled
the preceding season from a scientific
standpoint by producing a bilingual in
lydian and greek and it surpassed all
previous seasons in the field of the history
of art the four campaigns have com-
prised but eighteen months of actual work-
ing-time since it has been possible to
carry on the work only between the end
of january and the beginning of july of
each year owing to severe weather con-
ditions in the winter and the demands of
the crops upon the laborers in the late
summer and autumn months but in
sardis and the american excavations

this brief space of time a sloping barley
field with two columns and a heap of
fallen column-drums clustering about
them has been converted into a vast pit

dred feet wide twelve feet dee at one

ess ot rebuilding doubtless as the result

end and fifty feet deep at the other
with four lines of railway on either side
running on four different levels and
spreading out toward the west over the
great ilat brown dump which now al-
most fills the broad river-bed at this point
in the midst of the excavation stands the
temple its every outine at the far end
marked out by marble foundations against
the brown earth its middle section out-
lined by walls standing at a height of six-
feet or more and its east end rising ma-
jestically in highly finished walls fifteen
to twenty feet high and thirteen huge
columns still preserving twenty-five to
thirty feet of their original height in ad-
dition to the two original columns which
tower almost sixty feet above the plat-
form all this marble is now a soft yel-
lowish-brown rapidly turning to an ivory
white by the natural washing of rains and
intentional washing with a hose-pipe
the columns almost seven feet in diam-
eter create an impression of egyptian
massiveness which is relieved by the
graceful curves and the rich and varied
ornament of their bases only two of
these eastern columns are fluted though
all the others show bands and lines for
the guidance of the stone-cutters who

overwhelmed and abandoned all the
fragments of columns at the opposite end
of the building are in a finished state with
deep and well-cut ilutings at the west-
ward of the temple and on a level well be-
low it is the ancient lydian building at
the east end near the southeast angle
and on a level five feet above the column
bases is an early christian church crudely
built of brick with its walls and the half-
dome of its apse all intact and the little
altar standing as it stood at the close of
the celebration of its last mass behind
the little apse is a half-ruined one that
belonged to a still earlier period at the
very close of the third campaign directly
in front of the tpmple of artemis the ex-
cavation of which had just been com-
pleted we found a tall stele with a fine
greek inscription of one hundred and
ihirty-eight lines one of the longest in-
scriptions that have been found in asia
minor which contained a letter from the
emperor augustus and gave us the wel-
come information that the temple of zeus
is in the same sacred enclosure with the
temple of artemis owing to the con-
ditions of the site this temple must be
near at hand buried in from fifty to
seventy feet of soil if like the other
sardis and the american excavations



temple it is preserved in proportion as it
is deeply buried we should find it a very
well-preserved building and if it is the
temple of zeus referred to by arrian it
stands upon the ruins of the palace of
crcesus

  it is almost startling even to those who
have watched the work day by day to
reflect upon the miracle that has trans-
formed the barley-held into the site of a
splendid building it is the next best
thing to the creation of a great work of
art to dig it out of the earth most of
the credit for the rapidity of this trans-
formation is due to the skill and the untir-
ing energy and patience of the engineers
who have had the work in charge but
we cannot pass without a tribute to the
quality of the laborers which good for-
tune has placed at the disposal of the ex-
cavators good fellows they are mostly
turkish peasants farmers from the plain
and shepherds and woodmen from the
hills with an occasional cretan moslem
or a greek from one of the neighboring
towns strong of back and limb tract-

able and hard-working and to an aston-
ishing degree interested in their work and
devoted to their foreign employers they
make as satisfactory a body of workmen
as could be found anywhere in the world
they have learned that the excavators
are not in search of treasure in their ac-
cepted sense of the word and in their de-
sire to please lake great pains with the
digging out of bits of carving or inscrip-
tions and seem many of them to be
truly interested in what they are doing

  the most important discovery from a
scientific point of view namely that of
the collection of lydian inscriptions and
the lydian-aramaic bilingual key was
not made at the temple where to be sure
several good inscriptions in this new lan-
guage and the lydian-grcck bilingual
have been found but at the tombs across
the river where excavations on a small
scale have been in progress simultane-
ously with those at the temple i say a
collection of lydian inscriptions for
the reason that most of them were found
not in place but built into a compara-

i it the cast poich of the temple j artemis
the eaii end of the temple

lively late wall which itself had become
deeply buried they had stood original-
ly in front of the entrances to tombs and
after the dead whom they commemo-
rated had been forgotten by generations
that could not read lydian had been col-
lected and used in the construction of the
foundation walls of some greek or roman
monument a remarkable hoard of docu-
ments they proved to be large marble
slabs with long and beautifully written
inscriptions perfectly preserved as in-
scriptions in many cases and as clear as
the day they were written the- had
been tall stela with rich anthemion crest-
ings and all of them had been broken into
two or three pieces to render them more
useful for building puqioses but few of
the inscriptions had been injured and
others which had been broken were found
to fit together without injury to the writ-
ing and the flowery crests of two of them
were easily reset in place among them
was the bilingual with two long docu-
ments one line of the lydian part miss-

    

ing but supplied in the translation that
the one was a translation of the other
there could be no doubt for a slight emen-
dation of the writing had been made at
the same point in both the first line of
the aramaic translation gives a date for
it names the day and the month and the
year in the reign of king artaxerxes in
which it was written this extraordi-
nary document even with the aid of the
lydian-greek key of course does not
solve the whole problem of the reading of
the lydian tongue but it gave the first
surely right turn in an intricate combina-
tion lock

  the tombs already referred to above
form a great necropolis which honey-
combs the steep clay hills across the river
opposite the temple they are pretty
much of one type and are arranged in
tiers each tomb consisting of an entrance
passage leading to one or more chambers
with raised shelves or couches on either
side and at the end all hewn out of the
hard clay and for the most part still well
the excavations as they are to-day

preserved though full or nearly full of
earth and completely concealed from view
by the surfacc earth that has been carried
down over them

  the objects found in these tombs are
the usual furnishings of sepulchres in
greek lands-pottery of the highest in-
terest vessels of bronze and silver botles
of alabaster and of figured glass personal
ornaments in gold and stones which were
precious to the ancients engraved seals
and odd objects connected with the caily
life of those who have passed away ob-
jects too numerous and too varied to be
described in an article of this kind no
effort was made on the part of the ancient
lydians to preserve the bodies of their
dead only a few bones remain and these
usually crumble at the touch the dead
were in most cases brought to the tombs
on wooden biers and laid upon the simple
hewn-out couches though a considerable
number were placed in large terra-cotta
coffins and a few bodies were laid in huge
sarcophagi of limestone unornamented

these were the tombs of the ordinary
well-to-do citizens and it is plain that
while some of the dead were entombed
with objects of intrinsic value others
even in the same chambers were buried
with little or nothing of this worlds
wealth a sarcophagus of terra-cotta or
of stone is no indication of wealth for
some of the most valuable articles are
found upon simple couches and many of
the sarcophagi contain nothing but bones
and dust

  the lure of the gold is as in all excava-
tions irresistible but the jewelry found
at sardis is particularly attractive be-
cause it is all of a most delicate refined
and careful workmanship which suggests
the best etruscan work there are neck-
laces of many forms with pendants of
rare beauty earrings of fascinating de-
signs some large and some small finger-
rings in many charming forms plaques
with delicate moulded designs to be sewn
onto garments and beads and trinkets of
many varieties with the jewelry may

                                       
sardis and the american excavations

be counted the engraved gems which as a
collection are among the most beautiful
and interesting of all the finds a few of
these are greek including a fine large
chalcedony with
an intaglio of athe-
na and hermes set
in a gold bracelet
but the majority
belong to an older
period and are of a
very rare style
which has been
known as greco-
persian but which
we now believe to
have been lydian

they are for the
most part cut in
chalcedony carne-
lian or rock crystal
and of conoid form
and many still pre-
serve their mount-
ings of gold or sil-
ver which provide
rings by which they
were attached to or
suspended from a
girdle or perhaps
a necklace the
technique of the cutting is exquisite the
subjects are decidedly oriental and sug-
gest many persian prototypes such as
kings lighting with lions or griffins en-
throned kings lions and bulls in combat
single lions two monsters facing each
other and similar scenes which are often
connected with early persian art the
most interesting of all represents an ar-
chaic artemis holding two lions aloft at
arms length precisely lik the artemis
of a bronze relief found at olympia which
is usually dated as of the seventh century
b c and which may possibly have come
from sardis some of these intaglios arc
cut in carnelians of scaraboid form set
in rings of gold one was executed on a
cylinder which still has its gold mounting
while in other cases lions and human fig-
ures are engraved with rare beauty of
technique on plain gold rings which are
mycenaean in shape

  early in the third campaign a find of
unexpected interest was made in a tomb
the outer chamber of which had collapsed

and the inner chamber had become filled
with earth as the earth was removed it
was found that there were two terra-
cotta sarcophagi on the double couch at

 the end of the inner
 chamber these
 were carefully
 cleared of earth and
 thecoverof the first
 was lifted off to dis-
 close a small skele-
 ton rapidly falling
 to dust with an ala-
 baster bottle beside
 either shoulder
 two bright and
 beautiful earrings
 like little clusters of
 berries lay one on
 either side of the
 head where the
 breast had been
 were a mass of gold-
 en beads and pend-
 antsof lovely design
 that had composed
 the necklaceon the
 finger-bone of one

teirs-colia nsj	hand was aseal-ring

                     of gold about the
foot of the coffin
were clusters of gold beads that had prob-
ably been sewn onto the bottom of the
garment a physician happened to be
visiting the excavations at the lime he
was called among the first to examine
the body he pronounced it to be the
remains of a young girl of sixteen or
seventeen she had probably died as a
bride and had been buried in her wed-
ding garments and jewels the coffin
next to this probably that of the hus-
band who may have died many years
later contained nothing but bones less
sentiment had been shown at his fu-
neral

   it is a source of regret even of disap-
 pointment  might say to many of those
 interested in these excavations that there
 is small likelihood of any of the objects
 discovered at sardis ever coming to en-
 rich the collections of american museums
 in spite of the fact that american funds
 are being expended and that the work
 is being carried on by americans the
 turkish law covering these matters like
sardis and the american excavations



those of greece and of italy provides that
all movables shall go to the national
museum one may find satisfaction
however in the reflection that by this
arrangement all objects of all kinds will
be kept together and can be observed
and studied in their mutual relations it
is further satisfaction to know that the
imperial ottoman museum at constan-
tinople is rapidly becoming one of the
most important of the art museums of
europe a well-administered institution
where all these things will be well cared
for and well displayed

  of course the sole right of publication
both of the ruins and of the various kinds
of objects belongs to the american ex-
cavators it has to be borne in mind that
in these days all archological investi-
gation in the ottoman empire in greece
or in italy must be undertaken on purely
scientific grounds without hope of tan-
gible rewards just as expeditions to ob-
serve an eclipse or to find the poles of the
earth are undertaken

  we may hope that i his undertaking
among the many supported by generous
and disinterested americans who are in
a position to do these things will not be

permitted to become crippled or to lan-
guish and die for lack of funds an
american enterprise it has had the good
fortune to secure a site for excavations
which in the opinion of many of the most
distinguished archaeologists and histori-
ans of this and of other nations is the
most to be desired in asia minor or per-
haps in the world of the ancient greeks
and which has remained so long unexca-
vated solely on account of the difficul-
ties and heavy expense entailed by the
great depth of the soil in which the city
is buried the returns after eighteen
months of work have far exceeded the
highest hopes of the excavators and the
expectations of scholars who have been
interested in the work from the beginning
thus far the undertaking has been sup-
ported by the private subscriptions of a
small number of lovers of art one can-
not but believe that the spirit of idealism
in the united states will see it through to
a position of efficiency and accomplish-
ment which will make the excavation of
sardis the first great american monu-
ment to the science of archeology and
history in its broadest sense as well as to
art as a living subject

to my fees i cant afford the luxury and
anyhow its a rose arbor madeira isnt

it would smell as sweet by any other name

to say about the per-rose arbor

  the per-rose arbor havens contin-
ued ought to be on the edge of the cliff
over there to the left with a stone balus-
trade broad enough to sit on and watch the
ships in the harbor and be glad you didnt
have to go away

  and it must join on to the dining-
room

  by all means is there soil enough for
roses do you think

  plenty mrs havens poked the point
of her parasol deep into the heavy loam
that brings forth llowers that have no peers

dodendrons and-and radishes everything
that begins with an  r it will be a dream
of a place jim

   a dream of a place he assented and
looked for a long time down upon the roos
of funchal jasper against the jade and sap-
phire of the bay a steamer had just
rounded to under the wide sweep of the
point opposite and the brief rattle of her
anchor-chain came to them mellowed by
distance to an almost musical cadence

  she rose and stood beside him leaning on
her parasol

  a dream she mused do the best
ones ever come true

  theyre the only kind that do he
replied

  they walked slowly away from the cliff
and through a tangle of bushes and vines
to the road where jose and the mules
awaited them and then rode downward
through the unreal dusk to funchal

   it was their last night on the island to-
morrow the liner would call at the port on
her way to new york and madeira would
be but the mecca of another year as it had
been the nirvana of many a spring his
friends called him the hardest-working
architect on manhattan island he had al-
ways in his office two or three impecunious
young men whose goal was the beaux-
arts and whom he instructed variously in
drawing and french he spent almost as
much time advising them about heir de-
signs as he did on his own ideas and did
not lose sight of them even when they had
left him and gone to paris he always
spent the summer in his office week-end
parties along the sound welcomed him and
his wife for their good-fellowship and their
thousand whimsicalities at several places
it was probable that some one would speak
of madeira  the mention of the island would
induce no incriminating comment from
either jim havens or his wife

  oh yes weve been there a beau-
tiful spot

  no more than that only a few of their
intimates bad certain knowledge that every
spring for the last ten years they had gone
to the island and seen the flowers freshen in
the ocean-softened air and heard through
the smooth night the theme of old and pure
romance-the vagrant thrumming of a
guitar the lilt of a murmured song the
light laugh from a balcony veiled in rose
and bougainvillea keenly analytical in
most of the relations of life havens took
madeira for granted just as in his child-
hood he had accepted fairy-tales and later

                                     
the stuff that dreams are made on

stories of buried treasure his feeling for
the island was vital to him and yet so deli-
cate a thing that he never spoke of it
clients found him an eminently practical
architect who never attempted to shoe-hom
a fifteen foot load of hay through a highly
ornamental stable door twelve feet high
contractors were unable to circumvent him
or to put him off with excuses acquaint-
ances of his collegc days from whom he had
grown apart wondered at the change the
world had wrought in him his friends
marvelled that he had never changed he
had only put on a surface for the daws to
peck at a shell for the soul behind his eyes

 jim havens and mrs jim had dis-
covered madeira on their wedding-trip
they had meant to stop over one steamer
and had stayed on for two months three
years later when their child had died he
had taken her back to the island and they
had spent the spring there after that at
first every two or three years and then
more frequently they had returned to the
island and had found new beauties in it
at every visit the quarantine boat had
never quite cleared the ships gangway be-
fore manoel dressed in fresh while dunga-
rees to do honor to their arrival-manoel

she served them on the first evening next
year the senhor and the senhora will have
their own house on the cliff

 who knows havens always an-
swered next year is-next year anita
anita usually vanished at that and re-
turned presently with an old old bottle
wherein lay such nectar as ganymede was
wont to put aside for his own consumption
when jove wasnt looking

what vintage this lime anita
sixty-three if the senhor pleases
the senhor always did please and the
senhora also to the extent of one glass
sipped slowly more would have been a

desecration they paid for these things
in the bill or anita thought they did she
charged them the equivalent of two dollars
a day and lived for the rest of the year on
the proceeds of their visit

  they were never without occupation in
madeira sometimes they sailed with ma-
nocl when he went fishing sometimes
they took his boat for the whole day and
visited the little villages that melt into the
flowery shores of unknown coves or cruised
to the furrowed cliffs of las desertas-
vo man knows what is on top of them
senhor thence they would come back
in the level sunlight and sail under the
stern of some newly arrived vessel to sec
what her name was while the passengers
looked down upon them in the inquisitive
and superior manner that is characteristic
of passengers and so through the high surf
where half-naked boys caught the boat by
the gunwales and rushed it up the beach on
the crest of a roller

   and to-morrow manoel alwaysasked

   we shall not want the boat to-morrow

  the mules perhaps

  not to-morrow

  from the wharves they would wander in-
land through the clean pebbled streets to
their dinner of soup with sweet peppers
baked fish and a spanish omelet of the
finest lopped off with a glass of the sixty-
three thereafter they sat among the roses
on the balcony or strolled into the botan-
ical gardens and watched the popula-
tion of funchal parade in the half-light un-
der the palms and rhododendrons here
mrs havens kept calling jims attention
to this and that and the other person-to a
slim dandy with a malacca canc to the play
of long-lashed eyes between a mantilla and
a fan every night is a festa to your right
madeiran a time for the making of love
and the superficial bruising of hearts and
every new senhorita the loveliest of the year
the havenses watched it all and some-
times when the moon was large summoned
jose and the mules and rode out to their
point to see how it looked when every rock
was tarnished silver

  on certain-or rather uncertain-morn-
ings jose came for them before the sun
was up and they drank their morning
coffee to the jingle of shaken head-stalls
and the stamp of impatient little hoofs in
the street below
the stuff that dreams are made on

  we shall begone three days senhor

  yes jose the kit is packed and the
food 

  in the alforjas senhor-as you di
rected

  in proof he always lifted a corner of a
tarpaulin while havens glanced beneath
it there was no need for closer inspec-
tion manoel the father of jose never for
got any necessary thing they would jog
inland past the vines and villas that the
tourist knows and up the long ravine that
he looks down upon from the hotel on the
heights even the children seemed pret-
tier on the mountain farms and vineyards
the griminess of them was less evident-no
more than a contrast to their red cheeks
there were woods also and mountains to
he clambered over and at night a grove of
live oaks by a stream in which to sling their
hammocks their excursion over they
would return to funchal a little torn on
havenss part a little unshaven but not in
the least bored or wear of the island

  they never had enough time to do all
they wanted to do almost every day some
hour would find them on the point which
in defiance of the portuguese admiralty
they had christened simply havens and
they could never decide which of its many
aspects they liked the best days there
were when the woolly sea fog glistened upon
the rocks dripped from the leaves and
shut them into a world twenty feet in diam-
eter other days when it hung low over
the bay and the sun touched the billows
of it with fairy argent and the topmasts
of ships pricked through it like the lances of
a giant cavalry there were days when
the seas pounded at the foot of the cliffs
when the spindrift bit like hail and the
orange-trees leaned before the storm more
often the ocean stretched calm to the hori-
zon in a tinted harmony of blues and grays
and greens the nights were as various as
the days-now intensely and caressingly
dark now cameo-cut in contrast of silver
and sable shadows there were dawns also
and sunsets

  the house which they meant to build had
ihanged its shape with a protean whimsy
in the first years but of late it had taken
on a permanent form and only details were
altered it never grew much larger than
they had at first conceived it however
but remained a miniature-small and per-

fect six or eight weeks out of the fifty-
two were all they could spend in madeira
but those weeks restored havens as nothing
else could have done and sent him bac k to
his office a new man six or eight weeks
vacation-it was none too much for jimmy
havens said those who knew him they
wondered how a man of his physique
got along with so little and did so much
they wondered also why he took it in the
spring and whether lie always went to
madeira many accused him of a peri-
odical and uncontrollable liking for ccr
tain vintages and of very great selfishness
in keeping them all to himself for all their
exploratory badinage they got nothing save
a conclusive repartee

  coombe however got a little more lie
came one raw march day into havenss
inner draugluing-room and found havens
busy on the plans for a house

   hello nelson said the architect look-
ing up for a moment from the drawing-
table want a house or a cigarette

  coombe chose a cigarette and busied
himself with examining the elevations and
floor plans upon which havens was work-
ing

    i want a house lie said at length lean-
ing on his elbows over a finished drawing
why are all these measurements in mi-
tres 

  i asked you if you wanted a house or
a cigarette answered haven sketching
in the bowl of a fountain  vou cant have
both he sat back cocked an eye at the
drawing and added pig

  coombe came around the able and
looked over havenss shoulder

  more than that he said  i want this
house

  you cant have it responded havens

   what multimillionaire has monopolizer 
it

  a fellow called havens said the other
and he isnt even an unprefixed million
aire

  so thats it commented coombe
madeira  suppose it looks as if it
belonged on a rugged coast thats the
reason  wanted it-maine you know
tell me about it

  youve been to madeira nelson
coombe nodded then you must re-
member the long high point on the eastern
side of funchal bay thats where ive
the stuff that dreams are made on

bought land the open side of the pa-
tio-he indicated the plan-faces the
west

  coombe leaned forward in interest  ha-
vens went over the sketches one by one with
the detail of an enthusiast

  helen insists on railing that a pergola
he concluded  what do you think of the
place

  helens right as usual asserted
coombe he looked appreciatively at the
outline of the patio spanish rather-
concrete and red tiles as good a house
as youve ever designed how appropri-
ate that you have to build the cellar first
even in madeira

  it is the most important part  knew
that you would come and visit me you
see

  why did you select madeira

  havens laid aside his pencil clasped his
hands over one knee and leaned back
against the pull of them looking out over
the roofs of the lower office buildings to-
ward the hudson just visible in the dis-
tance

  there are many poets he said slowly
and somewhere in their poems you find
the reasons for most things-this among
others

    clod gave all men all earth to love

       but since mans heart is small

    ordained for each one spot should prove
       beloved over all

madeira attracted me first because it was
an island the name meant romance to me
even when i was a small kid though i
didnt call it romance in those days then
helen and  went there on our wedding-
trip and found that it was beautiful a few
years later we found it was more than that
-consolatory and-and soothing ships
call there too on their way to all the im-
probable ports in the world and you get
to know them and hail them as old friends
its an improbable place is madeira just
as venice is it seems to be the only piace
where  can really rest and get acquainted
with myself after a year in new york i
cant explain my feeling for it very well
its more as if the island was a person i
was very fond of do you see

  i see said coombe after a few min-
utes no wonder you wouldnt duplicate
the house when will it be done

  a year from now were sailing this
week to get things started

  there it is said mrs havens a year
later handing the binoculars to jimmy

  yes he said not taking them there
it is

  manoel look charge of them as usual
only instead of going to his aunts they
took a carriage out along the upland road
to havens manoel had seen to every-
thing old anita cooked and served their
dinner that evening

  there is a cook she said haughtily as
she brought coffee to them in the patio
but i wished everything to be well to-night
is everything well senhora

  quite well anita answered mrs
havens

  manoel came later cat-footed through
the dark and to him also they said every-
thing is well

  good night senhora and senhor
  good night manoel

  he vanished into the house and the low-
ered hum of his voice and anitas came to
them from somewhere in the rear

  last year said havens throwing
away his cigar they would have sat here
and told us the gossip the latest cure of
that old witch maria and who had had chil-
dren and who had married whom

  they dont want to intrude on the first
night said mrs havens

  but they did not bring their budget
of island news on the next night or on
any following night once when havens
made manoel sit on the parapet and talk
to them the portuguese was so evidently
uncomfortable and so stiltedly communi-
cative that havens took pity on him and
let him go it was the same though to a
less degree in manoels boat and even the
mercurial jose stood at a low temperature
on the inland excursions they were land-
owners now and guests no longer the
old intimacy of their humble friends gave
place to a certain aloofness the men
bowed to them with bent shoulders and
not standing upright as heretofore and the
women swept a lower courtesy they en-
joyed their excursions as much or nearly
as much as formerly but their property
had brought them an undesired standing
in the community there was a shadow be-
tween the old life and the new one the
my first years as a frenchwoman



gossamer of their dreams had given way to
the coarser thread of reality

  its a jewel of a spot mused havens
but-

  but what asked his wife

  damn said he

  exactly said she reflecting his smile

 one morning manoel brought them a
wireless message coombe would arrive
that afternoon a year ago even coombe
would have been almost an intruder now
his imminent arrival made them eager
they went out to the steamer for him in
manoels boat during the drive out to ha-
vens   they kept stopping the carriage to show
him a typical view or to point out a charac-
teristic group of madeirans in the vineyards
somehow his coming had in some degree
revived their old childish delight

  anita who firmly believed that she alone
of all the islanders knew what things tick-
led the palate had come voluntarily to
havens and had for the second time
ousted the regular cook she outdid sav-
arin that evening after dinner the three
of them sat in the pergola-even havens
called it that now-and breathed inthefused
odors of the night and watched the lights
in the harbor below and luxuriated in the
sensation that there was nothing to do in
the morning coombe rose as the coal of
his cigar burned near his lips and leaned
on the broad parapet

  i dont wonder at yu at all he said
 i dont wonder

  all the same said havens if you
still want a house like this on seguin
island ill build you one

iii-m waddington as prime minister



illustrations from photogkai-hs and drawings

here had been a respite a
sort of armed truce in po-
litical circles as long as the
exposition lasted but when
the chambers met again in
november it was evident
that things were not going smoothly the
republicans and radicals were dissatis-
fied every day there were speeches and
insinuations against the marshal and his
government and one felt that a crisis was
impending there were not loaves and
fishes enough for the whole radical parly
if one listened to them it would seem as if
every piefet and every general were con-
spiring against the republic there were
long consultations in ws cabinet and i
went often to our house in the rue bu-
mont-durville to see if everything was in

   w here and throughout these articles refers to mme
waddingtons husband m william waddington

order there as i quite expected to be back
there for christmas a climax was reached
when the marshal was asked to sign the
deposition of some of the generals he ab-
solutely refused-the ministers persisted
in their demands there was not much
discussion the marshals mind was made
up and on the th of january  he
announced in theconseil des ministreshis
irrevocable decision and handed his min-
isters his letter of resignation we had a
melancholy breakfast-w count de p
and i-the last day of the marshals presi-
dency w was very blue was quite sure
the marshal would resign and foresaw all
sorts of complications both at home and
abroad the day was gloomy too gray
and cold even the big rooms of the min-
istry were dark as soon as they had
started for versailles i took baby and
went to mothers as i went over the
my first years as a frenchwoman

bridge i wondered how many more times
i would cross it and whether the end of
the week would see me settled again in
my own house we drove about and had
tea together and i got back to the quai
dorsay about six oclock neither w
nor count de p had got back from ver-
sailles but there were two telegrams-
the first one to say that the marshal had
resigned the second one that grevy was
named in his place with a large majority

  w was rather depressed when he came
home-he had always a great sympathy
and respect for the marshal and was very
very sorry to see him go-thought his de-
parture would complicate foreign affairs
as long as the marshal was at the elysee
foreign governments were not afraid of
coups detat or revolutions he was also
sorry that dufaure would not remain but
he was an old man had had enough of
political life and party struggles-left the
field to younger men the marshals let-
ter was communicated at once to the par-
liament and the houses met in the after-
noon there was a short session to hear
the marshals letter read by grevy in the
chamber of deputies and the two houses
senate and chamber of deputies were
convoked for a later hour of the same
afternoon there was not much excite-
ment two or three names were pro-
nounced but every one felt sure that
grevy would be the man he was nom-
inated by a large majority and the re-
publicans were jubilant-thought the re-
public was at last established on a firm
and proper basis grevy was perfectly
calm and self-possessed-did not show
much enthusiasm he must have felt
quite sure from the first moment that he
would be named his first visitor was
the marshal who wished him all possible
success in his new mission and if grevy
was pleased to be the president of the re-
public the marshal was even more pleased
not to be and to take up his private life
again there were many speculations as
to who would be charged by grevy to
form his first cabinet-and almost perma-
nent meetings in all the groups of the left
ws friends all said he would certainly
remain at the foreign office but that de-
pended naturally upon the choice of the
premier if he were taken from the more
advanced ranks of the left w could not

possibly stay we were not long in sus-
pense w had one or two interviews
with grevy which resulted in his remain-
ing at the foreign office but as prime min-
ister w hesitated at first felt that it
would not be an easy task to keep all
those very conflicting elements together
there were four protestants in the minis-
try w leon say de freycinet and le
royer jules ferry who took the minis-
try of public instruction a very clever
man was practically a freethinker and the
parliament was decidedly more advanced
the last elections had given a strong re-
publican majority to the senate he
consulted with his brother richard wad-
dington then a deputy now a senator
president of the chamber of commerce
of rouen and some of his friends and
finally decided to accept the a ery honor-
able but very onerous position and re-
mained at the foreign affairs with grevy
as prime minister if i had seen little of
him before i saw nothing of him now
as his work was exactly doubled we did
breakfast together but it was a most
irregular meal-sometimes at twelve
oclock sometimes at one-thirty and very
rarely alone we always dined out or
had people dining with us so that family
life became a dream of the past we
very rarely went together when we dined
out w was always late-his coupe
waited hours in the court i had my car-
riage and went alone after eight or ten
days of irregular meals at impossible
hours we often dined at nine-thirty i
said to count de p ws chef de cabinet
cant you arrange to have business over
a little earlier it is awful to dine so late
and to wait so long to which he replied
ah madame no one can be more desir-
ous than i to change that order of things
for when the minister dines at nine-thirty
the chef de cabinet gets his dinner at ten-
thirty we did manage to get rather
more satisfactory hours after a lit tie while
but it was always difficult to extract w
from his work if it were anything impor-
tant he became absorbed and abso-
lutely unconscious of time

  the new president grevy installed
himself at once at the elysee with his wife
and daughter there was much specu-
lation about madame grevy-no one
had ever seen her-she was absolutely
my first years as a frenchwoman



unknown when grevy was president
of the national assembly he gave very
pleasant mens dinners when madame
grevy never appeared every one of all
opinions was delighted to go to him and
the talk was most brilliant and interest-
ing grevy was a 
perfect host very
cultivated with a
marvellous mem-
ory-quoting pages
of the classics

french and latin

 madame grevy
was always spoken
of as a quiet un-
pretending person
-occupied with
domestic duties
who hated society
and never went
anywhere-in fact
no one ever heard
her name men-
tioned a great
many people didnt
know that grevy
had a wife when
her husband be-
came president of
the republic there
was much discus-
sion as to madame grevys social status
in the official world i dont think grevy
wanted her to appear nor to take any part
in the new life and she certainly didnt
want to nothing in her former life had
prepared her for such a change and it was
always an effort for her but both were
overruled by their friends who though a
woman was a necessary part of the posi-
tion it was some little time before they
were settled at the elysee w asked
grevy once or twice when madame wad-
dington might call upon his wife-and he
answered that as soon as they were quite
installed i would receive a notice one
day a communication arrived from the
elysee saying that madame grevy would
receive the diplomatic corps and the
ministers waves on a fixed day at five
oclock the message was sent on to
the diplomatic corps and when i arrived
on the appointed day early as i want-
ed to see the people come in and also
thought i must present the foreign ladies

there were already several carriages in the
court

  the elysee looked just as it did in
the marshals time-plenty of servants in
gala liveries-two or three huissiers who
knew everybody-palms flowers every-
where the tradi-
tions of the palace
are carried on from
one president to an-
other and a perma-
nent staff of serv-
ants remains we
found madame
grevy with her
daughter and one
or two ladies wives
i suppose of the
secretaries seated
in the well-known
drawing-room with
the beautiful tap-
estries-m ad am e
grevy in a large
gold armchair at
the end of the room
-a row of gilt arm-
chairs on each side
of hers-mademoi-
selle standing be-
hind her mother a
huissier announced
every one distinctly but the names and
titles said nothing to madame grevy
she was tall middle-aged handsomely
dressed and visibly nervous-made a
great many gestures when she talked it
was amusing to see all the people arrive
i had nothing to do-there were no intro-
ductions-every one was announced and
they all walked straight up to madame
grevy who was very polite got up for
every one men and women it was rather
an imposing circle that gathered around
her-princess hohenlohe german am-
bassadress sat on one side of her-mar-
quise molins spanish ambassadress on
the other there were not many men-
lord lyons as doyen of the diplo-
matic corps the nuncio and a good many
representatives of the south american
republics madame grevy was perfectly
bewildered did try to talk to the ladies
next to her but it was an intimidating
function for any one and she had no one
to help her as they were all quite new to

jules fcrrv


my first years as a frenchwoman

the work it was obviously an immense
relief to her when some lady of the official
world came in whom she had known be-
fore the two ladies plunged at once into
a very animated conversation about their
children husbands and various domestic
matters-a perfectly natural conversation
but not interesting to the foreign ladies

  we didnt make a very long visit-it
was merely a matter of form lord ly-
ons came out with me and we had quite
a talk while i was waiting for my car-
riage in the anteroom he was so sen-
sible always in his intercourse with the
official world quite realized that the po-
sition was difficult and trying for madame
grevy-it would have been for any one
thrown at once without any preparation
into such perfectly different surroundings
he had a certain experience of republics
and republican manners as he had been
some years in washington as british min-
ister and had often seen wives of ameri-
can statesmen and ministers fresh from
the far west beginning their career in
washington quite bewildered by the
novelty of everything and utterly igno-
rant of all questions of etiquette-only lie
said the american women were far more
adaptable than either french or english
-or than any others in the world in fact
he also said that day and i have heard
him repeat it once or twice since that
lie had never met a stupid american
woman   

  i have always thought it was unneces-
sary to insist upon madame grevys pres-
ence at the elysee it is very difficult
for any woman no longer very young to
begin an entirely new life in a perfectly
different  milieu and certainly more dif-
ficult for a frenchwoman of the bourgeoisie
than any other they live in such a nar-
row circle their lives are so cramped and
uninteresting-they know so little of so-
ciety and foreign ways and manners that
they must be often uncomfortable and
make mistakes it is very different for a
man all the small questions of dress and
manners etc dont exist for them one
man in a dress coat and white cravat looks
very like another and men of all con-
ditions are polite to a lady when a man
is intelligent no one notices whether his
coat and waistcoat are too wide or too
short and whether his bools are clumsy

  madame grevy never looked happy at
the elysee they had a big dinner every
thursday with a reception afterward
and she looked so tired when she was sit-
ting  the sofa in the diplomatic salon
making conversation for the foreigners
and people of all kinds who came to their
receptions rhat one felt really sorry for
her grevy was always a striking per-
sonality he had a fine head a quiet dig-
nified manner and looked very well when
he stood at the door receiving his guests
i dont think he cared very much about
foreign affairs-he was essentially french
-had never lived abroad nor known any
foreigners he was too intelligent not to
understand that a country must have for-
eign relations and that france must take
her place again as a great power but home
politics interested him much more than
anything else he was a charming talker
-every one wanted to talk to him or
rather to listen to him the evenings were
pleasant enough in the diplomatic salon
it was interesting to see the attitude of the
different diplomatists all were correct
but most of them were visibly antago-
nistic to the republic and the republi-
cans which they considered much ac-
centuee since the nomination of grevy
the women rather more so than the men
one felt if one didnt liear the criticisms
 the dress deportment and general
style of the republican ladies

  we saw a great many english at the
quai dorsay queen victcria stayed
one or two nights at the british embassy
passing through paris  her way south
she sent for w who had never seen her
since his undergraduate days at cam-
bridge he found her quite charming
very easy interested in everything she
began the conversation in french he
was announced with all due ceremony as
monsieur le ministre des affaires etran
geres and w said she spoke it remark-
ably well-then with her beautiful smile
which lightened up her whole face i
think i can speak english with a cam-
bridge scholar she was much inter-
ested in his beginnings in england at
rugby and cambridge-and was evi-
dently astonished though she had too
much tact to show it that he had chosen
to make his life and career in france in-
my first years as a frenchwoman

stead of accepting the proposition made	french minister-everything about him

to him by his cousir waddington then	was so absolutely english figure color-

uean of durham to remain in england	ing and speech

anc continue his classic and literary	many old school and college experi-

studies under his guidance when the in-	ences were evoked that year by the vari-

jules grvy reading marshal macmahons letter of resignation to the
chamber of deputies

terview was over he found the queens
failiful scotch retainer john brown
who always accompanied her everywhere
waiting outside the door evidently hop-
ing to see the minister he spoke a few
words with him as a countryman-w
being half scotch-his mother was born
chisholm they shook hands and john
brown begged him to come to scotland
where he would receive a hearty wel-
come w was very pleased with his recep-
tion by the queen lord lyons told him
afterward that she had been very anxious
to see him she told him later in speaking
of the interview that it was very difficult
to realize that she was speaking to a
vol lv-

ous english who passed through paris
one night at a big dinner itl llic british
embassy i was sitting next to the prince
of wales late king edward he said
to me  there is an old friend of your hus-
bands here to-night who will be so glad to
see him again they havent met since
he was his fag at rugby after dinner
he was introduced to me-admiral glynn
-a charming man said his last recollec-
tion of w was making his toast for him
and getting a good cuff when the toast fell
into the fire and got burnt the two
men talked together for some time in the
smoking-room recalling all sorts of school-

my first years as a frenchwoman

sir francis adams first secretary and
counsellor at the british embassy
when the ambassador took his holiday
adams replaced him and had the rank
and title of minister plenipotentiary he
came every wednesday the diplomatic
reception day to the quai dorsay to
talk business as long as a secretary or
a huissier was in the room they spoke
to each other most correctly in french
as soon as they were alone relapsed into
easy and colloquial english we were
very fond of adams-saw a great deal of
him not only in paris but when we first
lived in london at the embassy he died
suddenly in switzerland and w missed
him very much he was very intelligent
a keen observer had been all over the
world and his knowledge and appreciation
of foreign countries and ways was often
very useful to w

  all the autumn of  was very agi-
tated we were obliged to curtail our stay
at bourneville our country home even
though the chambers were not sitting
every description of political intrigue was
going on every day w had an immense
courrier and every second day a secre-
tary came down from the quai dorsay with
despatches and papers to sign telegrams
came all day long w had one or two
shooting-breakfasts and the long tramps
in the woods rested him the guests were
generally the notabilities of the small
towns and villages of his circumscription
-mayors farmers and small landown-
ers they all talked politics and w was
surprised to see how in this quiet agricul-
tural district the fever of democracy had
mounted usually the well-to-do farmer
is very conservative looks askance at the
very advanced opinions of the young rad-
icals but a complete change had come
over them they seemed to think the
republic founded at last upon a solid
basis supported by honest republicans
would bring untold prosperity not only to
the country but to each individual and
many very modest unpretending citizens
of the small towns saw themselves con-
seilleurs generaux deputies perhaps
even ministers it was a curious change
however  the whole the people in our
part of the world were reasonable i was
sorry to go back to town i liked the last

beautiful days of september in the coun-
try the trees were just beginning to
turn and the rides in the woods were de-
lightful the roads so soft and springy
the horses seemed to like the brisk canter
as much as we did we disturbed all the
forest life as we galloped along-hares and
rabbits scuttled away-we saw their white
tails disappearing into holes and when we
crossed a bit of plain partridges a long
distance off would rise and take their
crooked flight across the fields it was so
still always is in the w-oods that the
horses feet could be heard a long way
off it was getting colder all the coun-
try folk predicted a very cold winter and
the wood lire looked very cheerful and
comfortable in my little salon when we
came in

  however everything must end and w
had to go back to the fight which promised
to be lively in paris we found people
wearing furs and preparing for a cold win-
ter the house of the quai dorsay was
comfortable well-warmed caloriferes
and big fires in all the rooms and whenever
there was any sun it poured into the rooms
from the garden i didnt take up my of-
ficial afternoon receptions the session
had not begun and as it seemed extremely
unlikely that the coming year would see us
still at the quai dorsay it was not worth
while to embark upon that dreary func-
tion  was at home every afternoon after
five-had tea in my little blue salon and
always had two or three people to keep
me company prince hohenlohe came
often settled himself in an armchair with
his cup of tea and talked easily and
charmingly about everything he was
just back from germany and reported
bismarck and the emperor i should have
said perhaps the emperor and bismarck
as rather worried over the rapid strides
france was making in radicalism he
reassured them told them grevy was es-
sentially a man of peace and as long as
moderate men like w leon say and
their friends remained in office things
would go quietly yes if they remain
i have an idea we shant stay much
longer and report says freycinet will be
the next premier he evidently had
heard the same report and spoke warmly
of freycinet-intelligent energetic and
such a precise mind if w were obliged
my first years as a frenchwoman

to resign which he personally would re-	chambers continued to sit at versailles

gret he thought freycinet was the com-	he would be obliged to establish him-

ing man-unless gambetta wanted to he	self there which he didnt want to do

premier he didnt think he did was	many people were very unwilling to make

not quite ready yet but his hand might be	the change were honestly nervous about

      i lllluhration -cbiutry tj 

m jule grevy elected proidcnl if the rcnublic by the senate and chainbci  deputies meeting as the

national assembly

forced by his friends and of course if he
wanted it he would be the next president
du conseil he also told me a great many
things that blowitz had said to him-he
had a great opinion of him-said he was
so marvellously well-informed of all that
was going on the nuncio mgr czaski
came too sometimes at tea-time he was
a charming talker but i always felt as if
he were saying exactly what he meant to
and what he wanted me to repeat to w
i am never quite sure with italians there
is always a certain reticence under their
extremely natural rather exuberant man-
ner mgr czaski was not an italian by
birth-a pole but i dont know that they
inspire much more confidence

  the question of the return of the par-
liament to paris had at last been solved
after endless discussions all the re-
publicans were in favor of it and they were
masters of the situation the president
grevy too wanted it very much if the

possible disturbances in the streets and
though they grumbled too at the loss of
time the draughty carriages of the par-
liamentary train etc they still preferred
those discomforts to any possibility of
rioting and street fights and the inva-
sion of the chamber of deputies by a paris
mob w was very anxious for the change

  he didnt in the least anticipate any
trouble-his principal reason for wanting
the parliament back was the loss of time
and also to get rid of the conversations
in the train which tired him very much
he never could make himself heard with-
out an effort as his voice was low had
no  timbre and he didnt hear his neigh-
bors very well in the noise of the train he
always arrived at the station at the last
minute and got into the last carriage
hoping to be undisturbed and have a quiet
half-hour with his papers but he was rare-
ly left alone if any deputy who wanted
anything recognized him he of course got
mv first years as a frenchwoman

in the same carriage because lie knew he
was sure of a half-hour to state his rase
as the minister couldnt get away from
him the chambers met after a short va-
cation in november at last in paris and
already there were so many interpel-
lations announced on every possible sub-
ject so many criticisms on the policy of
the cabinet and so
many people want-
ing other peoples
places that the
session promised
to be very lively-
the senate at the
palais du luxem-
bourg the depu-
ties at the palais
bourbon

  the end of de-
cember was detest-
able we were  en
pleine crise for
ten days every
day w went to the
chamber of depu-
ties expecting to be
beaten and every
evening came home
discouraged and
disgusted the
chamber was mak-
ing the position of
the ministers per-
fectly untenable-all sorts of violent and
useless propositions were discussed and
there was an undercurrent of jealousy and
intrigue everywhere one day just be-
fore christmas about the th w and his
chef de cabinet comte de p started for
the house after breakfast-w expecting
to be beaten by a coalition vote of the ex-
treme left bonapartists and legitimists
it was insane policy on the part of the
two last as they knew perfectly well they
wouldnt gain anything by upsetting the
actual cabinet they would only gel an-
other one much more advanced and more
masterful t suppose their idea was to
have a succession of radical inefficient
ministers which in the end would dis-
gust the country and make a savior a
prince which one or general possible
how wise their reasoning was time has
shown i wanted to go to the chamber

t hear the debate but w didnt want
me he would be obliged to speak and
said it would worry him if i were in the
gallery listening to all the attacks made
upon him it is rather curious that i
never heard him speak in public either in
the house or in the country where he
often made political speeches in election

times he was so
sure that the min-
istry would fall
that we had al-
ready begun clean-
ing and making
fires in our own
house so on that
afternoon as i
didnt want to sit
at home waiting for
telegrams i went
up to the house
with henrietta
the caretaker had
already told us that
the stock of wood
and coal was giv-
ing out and she
couldnt get any
more in the quar-
ter and if she
couldnt make fires
the pipes would
burst-which was
a pleasant prospect
with the thermom-
eter at i dont remember how many de-
grees below zero we found a fine clean-
ing going -doors and windows open
all over the house-and women scrubbing
stairs floors and windows rather under
difficulties with little fire and ittle water
it looked perfectly dreary and comfortless
-not at all tempting all the furniture
was piled up in the middle of the rooms
and ws library was a curiosity books
and pamphlets accumulated rapidly with
us as w was a member of so many literary
societies of all kinds and packages and
boxes of unopened books quite choked up
the room h and i tried to arrange things
a little but it was hopeless that day and
besides the house was bitterly cold it
didnt feel as if a fire could make any im-
pression

as we could do nothing there we went
back to the ministry no telegrams had

come but kruft our faithful and efficient
chef du materiel was waiting for me
for last instructions about a christmas
tree some days before i hud decided to
have a christmas tree about the end of
the month w ther thought the minis-
try would last over the holidays the
treve des confiseurs and was quite
willing i should
have a christmas
party as a last en-
tertainment he
had been too occu-
pied the last days
to think about any
such trifles and
kruft not having
had any contrary
instructions had
ordered the pres-
ents and decora-
tions he was
rather depressed
because w had
told him that morn-
ing that we surely
wculdnot beat the
quai dorsay on
the th the day
we had chosen for
our party how-
ever i reassured
him and told him
we would have the
christmas tree all
the same only at my house instead of the
ministry we went to look at his presents
which were all spread out on a big table in
one of the drawing-rooms he really was
a wonderful man never forgot anything
and had remembered that at the last tree
the year betore one or two nurses had had
no presents and several who had were not
pleased with what was given to them
he had made a very good selection for
those ladies-lace scarfs andrabatsand
little tours de cou of fur-really very
pretty i believe they were satisfied this
time the young men sent me up two tel-
egrams rien de nouveau-ministere
debout

  w came home late very tired and much
disgusted with politics in general and his
party in particular the cabinet still lived
but merely to give grevy time to make
another w had been to the elysee and

had a long conversation with grevy he
found him very preoccupied very unwill-
ing to make a change and he again urged
w very much to keep the foreign office
if freycinet should succeed in making a
ministry that w would not agree to-
he was sick of the whole thing he told
grevy he was quite right to send for frey-
cinet -if any man
could save the situ-
ation lie could
we had one or t wo
friends political
men to dinner
and they discussed
the situation from
every point of
view always end-
ing with the same
conclusion that
w was right to go
ilis policy wasnt
the policy of the
chamber i dont
sayof thecountry
lor  think the
country knew lit-
tle and cared less
about what was
going on in parlia-
ment hardly the
policy of all his
own colleagues
there was really
no use to continue
worrying himself to death and doing no
good w said his conversation with
grevy was interesting but he was much
more concerned with home politics and
the sweeping changes the republicans
wanted to make in all the administra-
tions than with foreign policy he said
europe was quiet and frances first duty
was to establish herself firmly which
would only be done by peace and pros-
perity at home  told w i had spent a
very cold and uncomfortable hour at the
house and i was worried about the cold
thought i might perhaps send the boy to
mother but he had taken his precautions
and arranged with the minister of war to
have a certain amount of wood delivered
at the house they always had reserves
of wood at the various ministries we
had ours directly from our own woods in
the country and it was en route but a

flotilla of boats was frozen up in the canal	ws presence at the foreign oflice during

de lourcq and it might be weeks before	the last year had been a help to the re-

thc wood could be delivered	public-said also he didnt believe his re-

  we dined one night at the british em-	tirement would last very long it was

bassy while all these pourparlers were go-	frightfully cold when we came out of the

her majesty queen victoria about 

ing on  en petit comite all english lord
and lady reay lord edmond fitz-mau-
rice and one or two members of parliament
whose names i have forgotten both lord
and lady reay were very keen about
politics knew france well and were much
interested in the phase she was passing
through lord lyons was charming so
friendly and sensible said he wasnt sur-
prised at ws wanting to go-still hoped
this crisis would pass like so many others
he had seen in france that certainly

embassy-very few carriages out all the
coachmen wrapped up in mufflers and fur
caps and the place de la concorde a sea
of ice so slippery i thought we should
never get across and over the bridge i
went to the opera one night that week
got there in an entracte when people
were walking about and reading the pa-
pers as i passed several groups of men
i heard ws name mentioned also that
of leon say and freycinet but just in
passing by quickly i could not hear any
my first years as a frenchwoman

comments i fancy they were not fa-
vorable in thatmilieu it was very cold
in the house-almost all the women had
their cloaks on-and the coming out was
something awful crossing that broad
perron in the fact of a biting wind

end on the th of december and the next
flay the papers announced that the min-
isters had given their resignation to the
president who had accepted it and had
charged m de freycinet to forir a cabinet
we dined with mother on christmas day

  i began my packing seriously this time
as ws mind was quite made up lie
had thought the matter well over and
had a final talk with freycinet who would
have liked to keep both w and leon say
but it wasnt easy to manage t he new ele-
ment that freycinet brought with him
the new members were much more ad-
vanced in their opinions w couldnt
have worked with them and they cer-
tainly didnt want to work with him
the autumn session came to a turbulent

a family party with the addition of comte
de i and one or two stray americans who
were at hotels and were of course delighted
not to dine on christmas day at a  table
dhote  or cafe w was rather tired the
constant talking and seeing so many peo-
ple of all kinds was very fatiguing for as
long as his resignation was not official an-
nounced in the journal officiel he was still
minister of foreign affairs one of the last
days when they were hoping to come to an
agreement he was obliged to come home
my first years as a frenchwoman

early to receive the mission from mo-
rocco i saw them arrive they were a
fine set of men tall powerfully built their
skin a red-brown not black entirely
dressed in white if rum turbans to sandals
none of them spoke any french-all the
conversation took place through an inter-
preter notwithstanding our worries we
had a very pleasant evening and w was
very cheerful - looking forward to our
italian trip with quite as much pleasure
as i did

  w made over the ministry to freycinet
on monday the th the transmission
des pouvoirs freycinet was very nice
and friendly regretted that he and w
were no longer colleagues he thought
his ministry was strong and was confident
he would manage the chamber w told
him he could settle himself as soon as he
liked at the quai dorsay as we should go
at once and would sleep at our house on
wednesday night freycinet said mine
de freycinet whom i knew well and liked
very much would come and see me 
wednesday and would like to go over the
house with me i was rather taken aback
when w told me we must sleep in our
own house on wednesday night the
actual packing was not very troublesome
as i had not brought many of my own
things from the rue dumont-durville
there was scarcely a van-load of small
furniture and boxes but the getting to-
gether of all the small things was a bore-
books bibelots music cards and notes
these in quantities lettres de condolc-
cuice which had to be carefully sorted as
they had all to be answered the hotel
of the quai dorsay was crowded with
people those last two days all ws
friends coming to express their regrets at
his departure some very sincerely sorry
to see him go as his name and character
certainly inspired confidence abroad-and
some delighted that he was no longer a
member of such an advanced cabinet-
some said de cet infect gouverne-
ment when he was obliged by his mere
presence to sanction many things he didnt
approve of lie and freycinet had a
long talk on wednesday as w naturally
wanted to be sure that some provision
would be made for his chef de cabinet
and secretaries each incoming minister
brings his own staff with him freycinet
offered w the london embassy but he

wouldnt take it had had enough of
public life for the present  didnt want
it either i had never lived much in eng-
land had not many friends there and
was counting the days until we could get
off to rome there was one funny re-
sult of w having declined the london
embassy admiral pothuau whom w
had named there and who was very much
liked came to see him one day and made
him a great scene because freycinet had of-
fered him the london embassy w said
he didnt understand why he made him
a scene as he had refused it  hut it
should never have been offered to you over
my head  perhaps but that is not my
fault i didnt ask for it-and dont want
it if you think you have been treated
badly you should speak to freycinet
however the admiral was very much put
out and was very cool with us both for a
long time i suppose his idea was that be-
ing recalled would mean that he had not
done well in london which was quite a
mistake as he was very much liked there

  we dined alone that last night at the
ministry and sat some time in the window
looking at the crowds of people amusing
themselves on the seine and wondering if
we would ever see the quai dorsay again
after all we had had two very happy in-
teresting years there-and memories that
would last a lifetime some of the last
experiences of the month of december
had been rather disillusioning but i sup-
pose one must not bring any sentiment
into politics in the world it is always a
case of donnant-donnant and-when
one is no longer in a position to give a
great deal-people naturally turn to the
rising man comte de p chef de ca-
binet came in late as usual to have a last
talk he too had been busy as he had a
small apartment and stables in the hotel
of the ministry and was also very anxious
to get away he told us all the young
men of the cabinet were very sorry to see
w go-at first they had found him a little
cold and reserved-but a two years ex-
perience had shown them that if he were
not expansive he was perfectly just and
always did what he said he would

  the next day madame de freycinet
came to see me and we went over the house
she didnt care about the living-rooms as
they never lived at the quai dorsay re-
mained in their own hotel near the bois de
my first years as a frenchwoman

boulogne freycinet came every day to
the ministry and she merely on reception
days-or when there was a party just
as she was going madame de zuylen wife
of the dutch minister a great friend of
mine came in she told me she had great
difficulty in getting up as  had for-
bidden my door
but my faithful
gerard i think
i missed him as
much as anything
else at first
knowing we were
friends thought
madame would
like to see her

she paid me quite
a long visit - i
even gave her
some tea off gov-
ernment plate
and china-all
mine had been al-
ready sent to my
own house we
sat talking for
some time she
had heard that
w had refused
the london em-
bassy was afraid
it was a mistake
and that the win-
ter in paris would
be a difficult one
forhim-he would
certainly be inop-
position to the government on all sorts of
questions-and if he remained in paris he
would naturally go to the senate and
vote i quite agreed that he couldnt
suddenly detach himself from all political
discussions must take part in them and
must vote the policy of abstention has
always seemed to me the weakest pos-
sible line in politics if a man for some
reason or another hasnt the courage of
his opinions he mustnt take any po-
sition where that opinion would carry
weight i told her we were going to it-
aly as soon as we could get off after the
holidays

  while we were talking a message came
up to say that the young men of the cab-
inet were all coming up to say good-by to
me i had seen the directors earlier in the

day so madame de zuylen took her leave
promising to come to my christmas tree
in the rue dumont durville the young
men seemed sorry to say good-by-i was
too i had seen a great deal of them
and always found them ready and anx-
ious to help me in every way the comte

dclasteyrie who
was a great friend
of ours as well as
a secretary went
about a great
deal with us w
called upon him
very often for all
sorts of things
knowing he could
trust him abso-
lutely he told
one of my friends
that one of his
principal func-
tions was to ac-
company mine
waddington to
all the charity
sales carrying a
package of wom-
ens chemises
under his arm
it was quite
true that i oft-
en bought poor
clothes at the
sales the ob-
jects exposed in
the way of screens
pin-cushions ta-
ble-covers and in the spring hats made
by some of the ladies were so appalling
that i was glad to have poor clothes to
fall back upon but i dont remember his
ever carrying my purchases home with me

  they were much amused when suddenly
francis burst into the room having es-
caped a moment from his  nonnon who
was busy with her last packing his little
face flushed and quivering with anger be-
cause his toys had been packed and he
was to be taken away from the big house
he kicked and screamed like a little mad
thing until his nurse came to the rescue

 made a last turn in the rooms to see that
all trace of my occupation had vanished
francis half pacified was seated on the
billiard-table an old gray-haired huissier
who was always on duty up-stairs taking

care of him the huissiers and house-
servants were all assembled in the hall
and the old pierson who had been there
for years was the spokesman and hoped
respectfully that madame would soon
come back    w didnt come with
us is he still had people to see and only
got home in time for a late dinner

  we dined that night and for many
nights afterward with our uncle lutte-
roth who had a
charming hotel
filled with pic-
tures and bibe-
lots and pretty
things just
across the street
as it was some
little time before
our kitchen and
household got
into working or-
der again the
first few days
were of course
very tiring and
uncomfortable-
the house seemed
so small after the
big rooms at the
quai dorsay i
didnt attempt
to do anything
with the salons
as we were going
away so soon-
carpets and cur-
tains had to lie
arranged to keep

the cold out but the big boxes remained in
the carriage-house-not unpacked we
had a procession of visitors all day-and
tried to make ws library possible-com-
fortable it wasnt as there were packages
of books and papers and boxes everywhere

  i had a good many visits and flowers
on new years day which was an agree-
able surprise-lord lyons orloff the
sibberns comte de segur m alfred an-
dre and others andre an old friend
of ws a very conservative protestant
banker was very blue about affairs
andre was the type of the modern french
protestant they are almost a separate
class in franee-are very earnest religious
honorable narrow-minded people they
give a great deal in charity and good works

of all kinds in paris the protestant co-
terie is very rich they associate with all
the catholics as many cf them entertain
a great deal but they live among them-
selves and never intermarry i hardly
know a case where a french protestant
has married a catholic i suppose it is
a remnant of their old huguenot blood and
the memories of all their forefathers suf-
fered for their religion which makes them so

          intolerant the
          ambassadors had
          paid their usual
          official visit to
          the elysee-said
          grevy was very-
          smiling and ami-
          able didnt seem
          at all preoccu-
          pied we h a d a
          family dinner at
          my uncles on
          new year snight
          and all the family
          with wonderful
          unanimity said
          the best wish
          they could make
          for w was that
           would see
          him out of poli-
          tics and leading
          an independent
          if less interesting
          life

             an interesting
life it certainly
was hearing so
many questions
discussed seeing all sorts of people of all
nationalities and living as it were be-
hind the scenes the chamber of dep-
uties in itself was a study with its
astounding changes of opinion with no ap-
parent cause one never knew in the morn-
ing what the afternoons session would
bring for as soon as the republican party
felt themselves firmly established they be-
gan to quarrel among themselves i went
back to the ministry one afternoon to pay
a formal visit to mme de freycinet on her
reception day i had rather put it off
thinking that the sight of the well-known
rooms and faces would be disagreeable to
me and make me regretperhaps the past
bu i felt already that all that old life was
over-one adapts oneself so quickly to dif-

ferent surroundings tl did seem funny
to be announced by my own special liuis-
sier gerard and to find myself sit tin in
the green drawing-room with all the palms
and flowers arranged just as they always
were for me and a semicircle of diplomats
saying exactly the same things to mine
de freycinet
that they had
said to me a few
days before but
i fancy that al-
ways happens in
these days of
democracy and
equalizing edu-
cation and that
unrler certain cir-
cumstances we
all say and do ex-
actly the same
thing i had
quite a talk with
sibber  the
swedish minis-
ter who was
very friendly and
sympathetic not
only at our leav-
ing the foreign
office but at the
extreme discom-
fort of moving in
such frightfully
cold weather

he was wrapped
in furs as if he
were going to
the north pole

however i assured him we were quite
warm and comfortable gradually set-
tling down into our old ways and i
was already looking back  my two
years at the quai dorsay as an agreeable
episode in my life i had quite a talk
too with the portuguese minister men-
des leal he was an interesting man
a poet and a dreamer saw more i fancy
of the literary world of paris than the
political blowitz was there of course
was always everywhere in moments of
crisis talking a great deal and letting it
be understood that he had pulled a great
many wires all those last weeks he too
regretted that w had not taken the lon-
don embassy assured me that it would
have been a very agreeable appointment

m c fi
after a phoio-apli

in england-was surprised that i hadnt
urged it i replied that i had not been
consulted many people asked when they
could come and see me - would  take
up my reception day again  that wasnt
worth while as  was going away so soon
but i said i would be there every day at five

                         oclock and al-
                         ways had visits

                     one day ma-
dame sadi car-
not sat a long
 i m e with me
her husband had
been named un-
der secretary at
the ministry of
public works in
the new cabinet
and she was very
pleased she
was a very charm-
ing intelligent
cultivated wom-
an-read a great
deal was very
keen about poli-
tics and very am-
bitious as every
clever woman
should be for her
h u s b a n d a  d
sons i think she
was a great help
socially to her
husband when he
became pres-
ident of the re-
public he was
a grave reserved man didnt care very
much for society i saw her very often
and always found her most attractive at
the elysee she was amiable and courteous
to everybody and her slight deafness
didnt seem to worry her nor make con-
versation difficult she did such a charm-
ing womanly thing just after her hus-
bands assassination he lay in state for
some days at the elysee and m casi-
mir-perier his successor went o make
her a visit as he was leaving he said
his wife would come the next day to sec

-pray do not el her come she is young

wouldnt for worlds that she should have

must hangover the palace as long as the	wanted to put order into his papers be-

to come to the elysee only when all traces	changes at the quai dorsay m des-

of this tragedy have gone-and to have no	prey directeur de la politique a post

he had occupied tor years was named
ambassador to rome in the place
of the marquis de gabriac i dont
think he was very anxious to go
his career had been made almost en-
tirely at the foreign office and he
was much more at home in his cabinet
with all his papers and books about
him than he would be abroad among
strangers he came to dinner one
night and we talked the thing over
w thought the rest and change would
do him good he was named to the
vatican where necessarily there was
much less to do in the way of social
life than at thequirinal he was per-
fectly au couranof all the questions
between the vatican and the french
clergy-his son secretary of embassy
would go with him it seemed rather
a pleasant prospect

   w went onceor twice to the senate
as the houses met on the th or th
of january but there was nothing
very interesting those first days the
chamber was taking breath after the
holidays and the last ministerial crisis

at the door told me mine grevy was
 un peu souffrante would see me up-

sad associations- the contrary with the
prospcct of a long happy future before her

who ushered me into mine grevys bed-
room it looked perfectly uncomfort-
able-was large with very high ceilings
stiff gilt furniture standing against the
wall and the heat something awful-a
blazing fire in the chimney mme gre-
vy was sitting in an armchair near the
fire a gray shawl on her shoulders and
a lace fichu  her head it was curi-
ously unlike the bedroom  had just
left i had been to see a friend who was
also souffrante she was lying under a
lace coverlet lined with pink silk lace
and embroidered cushions all around her
flowers pink lamp-shades silver flacons

 w went the two or three fridays we
were in paris to the institute where he
was most warmly received by his col-
leagues who had much regretted his en-
forced absences the years he was at the
foreign office he told them he was go-
ing to rome where lie hoped still to
find some treasures in the shape of in-
scriptions inedites with the help of his
friend lanciani the days passed quick-
ly enough until we sta-ted it was not
altogether a rest as there were always
so many people at the house and v
my first years as a frenchwoman

everything most luxurious ancl modern
the contrast was striking mine grevy
was very civil and talkative-said she
was very tired the big dinners and late
hours she found very fa-
tiguing she quite under-
stood that i was glad to get
away but didnt think
it was very prudent to
travel in such bitterly cold
weather-and rome was
very farand wasnt iafraid
of fever i told her i was
an old roman-had lived
there for years knew the
climate well and didnt
think it was worse than any
other she said the presi-
dent had had a visit from
w and a very long talk
with him and that he re-
gretted his departure very
much but that he didnt
think  monsieur wadding-
ton etait au fond de son
sac grevy was always a
good friend to w-on one
or two occasions when
there was a sort of cabal
against him grevy took
his part very warmly-and
in all questions of home
policy and persons w found
him a very keenshrewd ob-
server-though he said very
little-rarely expressed an
opinion i didnt make a
very long visit-found my
way down-stairs as well as
i could-no servant was
visible either on the stairs
or in the hall and my own
footman opened the big
doors and let me out

   we got off the first days of february-as
up to the last moment w had people to see
we went for two or three days to bourne-
ville-i had one or two very cold tramps in
the woods very dry which is quite un-
usual at this time of the year but the
earth was frozen hard inside the woods
one was well sheltered but when we came
out on the plain the cold and icy wind was
awful the workmen had made fires to
burn the roots and rotten wood and we
were very glad to stop and warm ourselves
some had their children with them who

looked half-perished with cold always in-
sufficiently clad but they were quite hap-
py roasting potatoes in the ashes i was
so cold that  tied a woollen scarf around

rodney and the
li country committee
ie toronto board of
e came to haileybury
e same june day the
littees special train
steamed in from cobalt to the little sta-
tion on the hill ten minutes before rod-
ney fell from the van of a freight that
had been scorched in two bush fires on its
way southward from the porcupine gold
camps in those minutes haileybury had
welcomed its important visitors with a
fearful brass band and started them on
a steamer chartered to keep them out on
the silver waters of lake temiskaming
while the ladies aid society stacked up
the evenings banquet in the big hockey
rink every man in the town except the
bishop the habitants the bartenders and
maclaren who was supervising the ban-
quet preparations was at the dock the
habitants already drawing the lines of the
approaching elections kept to their own
part of the town disdaining to notice the
coming of the party from southern onta-
rio and so with the rest of haileybury
missing the reappearance of rodney usu-
ally the signal for the rise of the curtain
on some wild adventure

  rodney must have felt the omission of
the half-laughing half-jeering welcome
the depot crowd was wont to give him for
he stared a little uncertainly around the
deserted platform before he found a har-
ing announcement in red-and-yellow that
flaunted the more sombre bulletins of the
railroad he rubbed his fire-smartened
eyes to read its grandiloquent phrasing of
the haileybury commercial clubs invi-
tation to the public to attend the after-
dinner speeches in the rink he nodded
to express his acceptance of it before he
strode down the hill to the nearest saloon
for john rodney was drunk and bent on
getting drunker

  by the time he reached the bar of the

    

hotel near the lake he had succeeded so
well that maclaren just over from the
rink suggested to the few stragglers in the
room that rodney be put in jail until after
the guests from the south had departed
hes so varry noticeable the little
scotchman argued with his size and
record that hell shame the city the
board of trade ii never be knowing that
hes just drifted in from the porcupine
with the desire of tearing up our town
but his record and his size were the fac-
tors that saved john rodney from the
haileybury jail not even the sergeant
of provincial police cared to approach the
big man without more urgent cause than
maclarens civic pride

  with his arms set solidly  the brass
rod of the hotel-bar the man from the por-
cupine defied maclarens diplomatic ef-
forts to take him out of the place that
would be the area of the spotlight as soon
as the steamer brought the board of trade
men back to the town he had arrived at
his most joyous mood of rollicking good
humor he reeled off talc after tale of
other mens splendid deeds in his inimita-
ble narrative manner he recalled odys-
sean wanderings and hectorean combats
john rodney had taken to every big gold-
camp the world has erupted in the last
twenty years his gift of dropping a plumb-
line into the heart of every man he met-
when he was sober drunk he drama-
tized his wanderings and his vision ings in
vivid flashes of brilliant prose that seldom
failed to surround him with avidly inter-
ested listeners but to-day although
men kept coming to and going from the
room no one but maclaren paid any
heed to his monologue and after a time
maclaren went warned by the shrill
whistle of the returning steamer then
rodney addressed himself to a statue of
robert burns that decorated the bar

  there was a time in dawson bobbie
burns he confided to the gray plaster
the bravest s m



image of the poet when men came in
from the trails to hear john rodney
big men they were too men who sent the
fame of the klondike ringing around the
span of this lit-
tle old earth

l a d u e and
maccormack
and henderson
and old juneau
the first of them
all and they
vowed theyd
rather hear
john rodney
tell a habitant
story than find
a new strike

but theyre
gone all gone

he shook his
head at the
statue lugubri-
ously then
his arm swept
out in orator-
ical circling

and down in
the diamond
townhe cried

he used to
play to bigger
crowds than ev-
er bernhardt
drew dukes
and earls and
little knights
sought to know
him there ce-
cil rhodes used
to listen to him

and laugh at him but you cant lauh
at me old timber-toes he blazed out
at a lumber-jack who made hasty re-
treat after his mistake of the questioning
smile that had called rodneys attention
to him do you see that he drew
from the pocket of his blue flannel shirt a
shining bit of metal on a red ribbon that
he swung before the uninterested watch-
ers do you know what that means
his contemptuous scorn leaped over every
man in the place it means a thing you
cant understand he sneered at them re-
placing the ribbon and its dangling bau-
ble swiftly in his pocket but ill tell yau

lie rubbed his fire-smartei ed eyes to read  the haileybury
commercial clubs invitation to the public-iaje joo

something you will understand he
whirled his back against the bar nd faced
the little group of loungers defiantly
youll have to build an empire before

you can laugh
at me he
boasted

   no one took
his challenge
for a moment
while the room
was so still that
the chugging
of the steamer
sounded close
the raucous
tones of the
band arose in
the strains of
the maple-
leaf forever
rodney catch-
ing the tune
hummed it for
three bars then
shifted his song
to one of the
plaintive melo-
dies of the hab-
itants on the
quebec side of
the lake al-
most asquickly
again with the
mimetic facility
that made him
the fame and
the game of the
north country
hehadlaunched
into the swing
of mandalay just as maclaren re-
turned the scotchman was puffing fu-
riously holding to the edge of one of the
swinging doors your husky dog he
trumpeted to rodney the brute you
brought with you from the fretful porcu-
pine is eating the head off the episcopal
ministers bulldog if youd see a grand
fight jack rodney youll find it going on
near llie church at the top of the hill
he could not wait to see the effect of the
inspiration that had come to him from an
urchins rumor for the steamer was com-
ing against the pier and as he ran toward
the dock he looked back fearful lest rod-
the nun watched the tns-le for a time with apparently concentrated interest

ney should follow him rather than climb
the hill to the promised entertainment
but haileybury was safe for the time
rodneys great figure was vaulting over
shorts cuts to the sentinel spire that
marked the scene of bitter conflict

  it was a good fight that john rodneys
husky and the ministers bulldog waged
against each other on the haileybury hill
the pup was gamely fighting a losing bat-
tle when rodney came close enough to see
its progress the man watched the tussle
for a time with apparently concentrated
irterest but he did not interfere till his
husky began to show the wolf in his breed
then rodney called off the brute and ad-
dressed himself to the yelping bulldog
with maudlin philosophy

  blood tells he said solemnly and
if the fights in you it stays but that
wolf of mine would have killed you if i


hadnt stopped him for lies the concen-
trated essence of all thats wild in the
north but never mind doggie he as-
sured the aggrieved but none the less com-
bative victim youll gel your chance to
fight again arc thats no more than any
of us gel he whistled the husky to him
and with the wolfish creature at his heels
sauntered loiteringly along the street

  at the first intersecting avenue he
paused looking down on the crescent
of the town that sloped out to the gleam-
ing twilight beauty of the great lake of
the voyagers from the farther purple
shore of the quebec province dusk was
rising softly looming over temiskaming
and drifting in to the harbor where the
white steamer lay close to the long pier
on the northern horizon against the black-
ness of the bush blazed the line of one of
the fires rodney had come through  his
the bravest son



way down from the porcupine to the
southward along the track of the railroad
cobalt had already lighted the beacons of
her welcome to the men coming in from
the silver mines good old cobalt
said rodney ill see you later he
waved a promising hand to the sweeping
headlight of an electric car that rushed
along the ridge between the towns an
arc light over his head sizzled into flame
with a hundred others flinging long lines
of brightness and shadow over haileybury
down at the shore the great building of
the hockey rink suddenly blazed into a
hulk of lavender light the banquet to
the north country committee of the
board of trade had begun

  some recollection of the red-and-yellow
invitation to the public must have flick-
ered nebulously across rodneys brain for
the illumination sped him down the ave-
nue toward the rink but at the next cor-
ner chance again aided maclaren the
pink door of a little green-and-white sa-
loon stood open rodney attracted to-
ward the doorway by the sound of fid-
dling saw a lithe little frenchman who
wore the sash of the riviere quinze voy-
ager dancing with gay abandon to the
accompaniment of an old mans violin
the dance was one that the watcher fa-
miliar as he was with habitant steps had
never seen and he moved nearer to ob-
serve it a shout of welcome greeted him
from the dozen men within calling him to
their revelry to their yarns to their dance
to their cherry brandy he joined them
in all making himself one of them in
speech and in act echoing their political
sentiments against his own peoples party
-for in the north racial difference had
come to be the line of political cleavage
-with a bitterness none of them knew
and amusing them with his mimicry till
twilight had run into darkness before he
came out of the pink doorway

  the sound of the band led his wavering
steps through the quiet streets to the rink
the music was coming to a sharp stop as
he paused under the great open windows
fluttering echoes of applause were rising
as he shoved his husky into a corner by
the threshold and went blinkingly for-
ward into the brilliancy of the improvised
banquet-hall

  on the floor of the rink the tables had
     vol lv-

been shoved back so that the diners might
cluster around the board from behind
which the speakers of the evening faced
their hearers there was a long line of
speakers and many of them had already
spoken overlong the hosts of the occa-
sion vividly alert to the opportunity of
instructing their guests in the magnitude
of the north country had set no time-
limit on the speeches of glorification the
men of the board of trade listened with
polite interest but the crowd packed
closely behind the netting that separated
it from the rink floor had come to the
point of restive weariness maclaren
watching the men there with the nervous-
ness of a little man who tries to shoulder
the atlean burden of his world was the
first to see rodney he signalled to old
man parr the big englishman whose bore-
dom had led him into heavy pacing of an
imaginary line at one side of the tables
while he puffed furiously on a thick black
pipe watch rodney ordered mac-
laren

  old man parr changed his pacing to a
line that brought him close to the pillar
where rodney stood rodney grinned at
him sleepily got on the boiled shirt
havent you grandad he inquired geni-
ally saw it out on the line this after-
noon great occasion eh

  old man parr nodded ponderously he
expressed his dominating idea that of the
greatness of the british empire by solem-
nity of personal demeanor particularly
in the presence of rodney who always
seemed to him a personified mockery ol
certain ideals he held sacred

  what are they playin rodney in-
quired peering through the rising cigar
smoke toward the tables  playin hock-
ey grandad

  no said parr

 not hockey rodney went on
 nother old game then know it now
you scratch my back and ill scratch
yours we used to call it in the service

  hush commanded the other

  for a silence had fallen on the restless
crowd the president of the board of
trade chairman of the committee and
honored guest of the evening had risen
amid the applause of the haileybury men
and was standing in readiness to make
answer to the celebrating welcome their
s

the bravest son

north country hosts had given to him
and his fellows there was in his wail-
ing a quality of authority that held the
crowd before he began to speak when
he spoke he drove in his words incisively

  you have a wonderful country he
said raising his hand to hold back the out-
break of self-gratulatory cheers a coun-
try that has impressed us in every way by
its vast resources by its impelling beauty
by its magnificent power but i pass over
these glories without comment you
yourselves have been telling us of them
showing them to us may i speak of
something that ive found for myself

  it is always true that new countries
draw the best and the worst of men
they have a way of tempering the best
and of making over the worst so that in
the long run the new countrys excellence
lies in its men there is no new land
without its heroes but it has always
seemed to me that no point of the com-
pass has ever drawn so many brave men
as has the north i do not know by
what magic the north draws to itself the
splendid men of the earth  only know
that it is the magnet for the braver ad-
venturers

   little lajeune in frenchtown makes a
bet ter speech  m u ttered rod ney talks
for laurier too

  keep still rumbled old man parr

   i am sure that i should have remarked
on the men of the north country the
speaker was saying  even without the co-
incidence of discovering that my own par-
ticular hero was now in this part of the
world when i chanced to see in one of
your newspapers the mention that this
man of whom i had not heard in ten
years but whom i have held in my heart
as the standard-bearer of a true ideal of
heroism was in the porcupine camp i
realized how truly was the north mag-
netic to men of his quality

   i never met this man i heard of him
only as tens of thousands of others did at
a time when an empire thrilled with the
tale of his courage the president of the
board of trade dropped his voice to
the conversational level with the ease of
the practised orator  ten years ago he
said  i was in london when the news of
the taking of bloemfontein flashed across
the world i was dining in one of the ho-

tels with three english merchants when
the boys on the street began to cry the
news of a great fight on the south afri-
can veldt we had the papers brought
searching them for the special tale of how
our men had broken the cordon that held
bloemfontein so long one of us began
to read jerkily phrases that set our blood
on fire we grasped our own papers to
leap past his reading to the heart of the
tale

  oh its great one chap cried out

  thats fightin some one banged

  glorious splendid theyrethe
boys went it alone that chap all
around us men at the tables were crying
out in praise of some one whose deed
shouted from the black-and-white of the
print

  one of your countrymen the man
who was dining us cried to me a dozen
men circled me  dye know him they
were asking one of us a boy declared
as english as we are god bless him

  i couldnt find the part theyd been
reading and the boy read it to me i dont
know what it said there were burning
words trying to picture the story of how
one mans courage under fire had inspired
the army behind him till he had swept
them into driefontein the key to the city
of the siege how many men do they
make like him over in your land they
asked me and never in all the days of
my life have i known such a thrill of glory
as i had in the joy of knowing that the
hero of the great battle of the boer war
was my countryman i was as proud of
him that night in london as you have oc-
casion to be proud of him to-night for that
captain of canadian scouts who won the
victoria cross for continued repeatedand
glorious bravery on the battle-fields of
africa is one of you one of the men of
your north country the greatest of your
iliad of heroes i give you canadas
bravest son captain john rodney

  the president of the board of trade
raised high his glass the members of
the committee came to their feet with
courteous haste but for a full instant
there was a pause of hesitation among the
men of haileybury then a score of them
rose stragglingly the others following in
silence they drank the toast while along
the benches back of the netting there ran
the bravest son

s

a snickcring laugh jack rodney
the derisive inquiry pierced the space be-
tween the benches and the pillar where
rodney stood

  the braves son rodney was repeat-
ing who was he grandad

  old man parr removed his thick black
pipe from his mouth and looked contemp-
tuously at the lounging figure  he was
you he said then he turned his back
on him and crossed to the tables

  rodney stared after him with the dawn-
ing of resentment rising to his flushed face
a feeble hurrah was forming amid the
crowd on the benches where some one had
recognized the hero of driefontein rod-
ney caught the beginning of the cheer he
pulled himself up standing erect and fac-
ing the speakers table with arm uplifted
for attention hooraw he shouted
 vive laurier vive reciprocity vive la
france

  the president of the board of trade
peered down under the lights at rodneys
vivid pose the voyagers have started
their electioneering he inquired smil-
ingly

  the cheer of the crowd halted by rod-
neys daring shout took life again as the
men on the benches caught the full humor
of the situation jeers were volleying into
roars when maclaren gave frantic signal
to the band loud and louder shrilled the
strident brasses into bars of martial music
dinning cheers and jeers alike and rous-
ing the man who stood alone at the back
of the rink to some recollection of times he
had listened to more stirring strains fie
squared his shoulders clicked his heels
raised his hand to his hat in an officers sa-
lute to his men and turned to the door
the haileybury band was playing rule
britannia  as captain john rodney went
out of the banquet-hall

  all the way up the street the music fol-
lowed him its dinning insistence must
have irritated him for he pushed from the
narrow sidewalk the husky that came to
his heels and paced on in dejected slouch-
ing to where the electric car stood waiting
for passengers from the lake town to co-
balt  we dont go to-night till the crowd
comes the conductor told him as he
shoved through the rear platform rod-
ney disdained answer slouching through
the car to the front where he took his

stand beside the motorman been at
the banquet  asked the man at the lever
no said rodney shortly peering ahead
toward the lights of cobalt

  for the sting of old man parrs con-
tempt was corroding its way through his
befuddled senses he fumbled in his coat-
pocket for a worn wallet that he opened
with over-cautious care to find a news-
paper clipping in the dim light of his
post he read it dazedly man at the
table was right he said as he replaced the
bit of worn paper  did all of it years an
years ago the motorman gave him a
curious glance yes i did he reiter-
ated time when i was rodney of the
scouts ar rodney of the scouts won
the victoria that was i with the
phrase the toxin of old man parrs slur
struck the canker of the mans vanity
 did he mean that i couldnt do it now 
he cried to the astonished motorman
did that old grandad mean that im not
brave any more just you wait he
promised  wait till i get another chance
and ill show him

  sure you will said the motorman
soothingly he looked at his watch then
back into the car weve our crowd
he said as the conductor gave him the sig-
nal fie had been about to order rodney
back from the platform but a look at the
suddenly disclosed ugly lines around the
mans mouth deterred him  you can stay
here if you keep quiet he compromised

  as the car whirled along the high ridge
to the silver camp rodney standing mo-
tionless tried in vain to reconstruct a
mental picture of the scene in the rink he
felt vaguely that the speakers words the
shouts the toast the braying of the band
had all concerned him but he could not
give them visual reality whenever the
key-thought came close to the lock of real-
ization some laughter in the car dispelled
it once he had groped into nearness of
the meaning of the scene in which he had
been the semiconscious actor but just
when he was about to enter it again the
blazing headlight of the car illuminated the
rails with so vivid a likeness to a memory
rodney held of a night run in an armored
train across the african veldt toward
wolvespruit that he lost thought of in-
tervening time and circumstance and was
living again through those days of war
s

the bravest son

  before he came from his drowsy dream-
ing the car had swung into cobalt and
had stopped with a jerk at the first street-
crossing most of the crowd had alighted
and rodney seized by a sudden impulse
opened the door at the front and dropped
down to the road across the track not
fifty feet away rose the workmens shacks
of the right-of-way mine a score of
men from the car were coming toward him
on their way there the track was clear
as the motormans gong clanged and the
car shot forward

  then-and to rodney it seemed a scene
in a moving picture so flashing so graphic
and so unreal that he gazed at it without
emotion-the headlight found just in front
of the shacks the running figure of a boy-
a child who stopped in sudden terror tried
to turn stumbled arose stumbled again
and fell upon the rail as the car slid over
him there came the racking sound of
grating brakes the cries of the men on the
road and rodney had plunged beneath
the car before the man at the lever could
bring it to pulsing stillness

  ten seconds later the men of the crowd
surrounded him as he knelt over the poor
crushed body of the boy he raised to
them a face so white that no one of them
knew him i was too late he told
them hes dead

  the conductor held a shaking lantern
over the bright curls of the dead boy a
sob strangling unforgettable rasped in
the throat of one of the watchers  he
is my little boy he said and he was
waiting for me in the wavering circle
of light rodney looking up saw him and
knew him for one of the company with
whom he had spent the twilight in the
gay little saloon of the pink door

  could no one save him the man
moaned

    could have saved him rodney said
if-if i hadnt beer drunk

  for john rodney was sober now he
turned to the men who stood by take
his father away he ordered get a
track-jack he snapped out his com-
mands with the abruptness ot his officers
training men stumbled to do his bid-
ding driven by the mastery in his tone no
less than by their awe of the pitiful trag-
edy for long dragging minutes he held
the helm of his grewsome task directing

advising commanding till the moment
came when he rose with the limp little
body in his arms and stood revealed in the
flare of the futile headlight

  half-way up to the shacks from the
rails he paused wheres his mother
he asked a man in the trailing group
dead some one answered there
was just him and his father they came
from the quebec side

  whos his fathers buddy rodney
demanded

  i am a grimy miner stepped out
from the others

  youll look after him

  yes captain the other promised

  with martial certainty rodney went
up the grade to the central shack hold-
ing his burden tenderly close to him with
martial peremptoriness he set his rule
within the shack in spite of the coming of
the mining companys superintendent and
doctor he was the one who thought of
all that should be done for the dead boy
and his father and who ordered its accom-
plishment without question of conve-
nience or courtesy and he was the one
who after all others had gone folded the
maimed hands over the rough coat and
drew the sheet over the bright hair of the
child then he lighted the candle on the
table and went out into the night

  below the ridge where he stood the
lights of cobalt beckoncd in welcoming
friendliness their promise of evasion of
that law which forbade the sale of liquor
in the mining-camps of the north coun-
try with a heavy relaxing sigh of relief
he turned his steps toward them his ut-
ter exhaustion cried for stimulant after the
hour of strain that had left him clammy-
cold he groped through his pockets to
find a handkerchief to wipe the dampness
from his forehead then remembered that
he had used his own for the boy who died
still searching he thrust his hand in the
pocket of his flannel shirt his fingers
closed on something colder than they a
sharp-pointed bit of metal on a worn rib-
bon they clutched it brought it out and
dangled it before his gaze and as john
rodney saw it for what it was he clenched
it in his fist till the points drove themselves
into his flesh for the man who had won
the battle of driefontein was holding the
badge of his courage his victoria cross
the bravest son



  before him the lights of cobalt dimmed
to vagueness as there swung in their stead
a wider range a dry parched veldt rolling
for illimitable miles under the blazing sun-
light of africa gigantic scene of gigantic
conflict once more the man on the hill
was one of the army sweeping forward to
meet another army of daring determined
lighters once more he was hearing the
sharp ping of mauser bullets once more
he was dodging the flying lyddite once
more he smelled the smoke that came roll-
ing toward him once more he heard the
call to the charge once more he spurred
out in front of his men once more he
was riding over the plain all athrill with
the joy of knowing that he had no fear
he had dashed down the man who sought
to hold his bridle as the dark shape rose
from the grass he felt the blood trick-
ling down after the sharp sting had pricked
his arm he had known that he was fall-
ing and falling he had seen the colors of
his regiment going down as the color-
bearer sank from the mans hand he
had caught them up he was rushing
on there was film coming over his eyes
a roaring was in his ears a burning in his
nostrils but he was going on across the
veldt to where the low kopje of driefon-
tein seemed to be falling toward him he
was climbing the hummock breasting it
shouting yelling sobbing cursing in his
fury he was battling now with a black-
bearded boojer whose hand clutched the
standard while the two of them rocked in
conflict he had flung him over and he
stood alone on the kopje the splendid tar-
get of the whistling bullets the weight
of the standard was piercing his arm like
a thousand needles and the pain driving
up to his brain maddened him but men
he knew not whether they were friends
or foes were sweeping toward him he
braced himself on the summit as darkness
filmed over his eyes then an arm stead-
ied his shoulder and a familiar voice his
colonels voice rang out over the yells and
the cries and the singing bullets and the
shrieking artillery youre in jack
youre in weve taken driefontein

  as a dreamer slipping without tran-
sition through times and places of his
dream john rodney watched the ghosts
of his time of glory passing across the
stage of his memories there had been

hundreds of men to give him praise for
his deed men of power and position and
authority but of them all he remembered
only the colonel whose belief in him had
been justified kitchener who had shaken
hands with him on the day the army en-
tered bloemfontein and who had written
him down for the decoration and the
great rhodes who had laughed when he
said to him youre as quick to lead an
army as you are to tell a tale eh for
after bloemfontein had come the time
when thousands of the service men pointed
him out as the panther of the scouts the
man whose daring dash had won a great
battle only to-night over there in
haileybury had come an echo of those
days in the speech of that man who re-
called how london had thrilled at the
story of a mans courage

  and he john rodney had been that
man

  now less than a hundred feet away a
little bright-haired boy lay dead because
the man whose plunging quickness of
brain had won a momentous battle for an
empire had not been quick enough to
save him the thought piercing to rod-
neys soul more deeply than the points of
the cross in his clenched hand cut into his
flesh corroded there in bitter festering
through the years in which he had been
slipping down into degradation john rod-
ney had not lost faith in himself the
mirage of driefontein had shone for him
across deserts of discouragement gleam-
ing in promise that if need of courage
should come again he would be ready to
meet it lie had laughed at his own vices
balancing them against equally flagrant
virtues boasting to himself that no emer-
gency should find him ungirded on the
raft of that belief he had weathered the
storms of ten useless drifting years and
now that faith was gone john rodney
saw himself for what he was a roystering
drunkard of the camps comrade of other
besotted drifters the butt of scorn of men
he had once thought to scorn

  his fingers unclasped themselves slowly
from the medal he looked at it tensely
as if he would read in the darkness the in-
scription i thought he said that
id keep you till i died but ive lost the
right to you-and so-

  he caught his breath sharply as he
the bravest son

raised his arm to fling the bit of metal
from the ridge across his whirling brain
there raced another scene trivial absurd
in its setting of mightier thoughts the
recollection of the fight his husky had
waged that afternoon with the little bull-
dog but rodneys memory of it went
past the mere picturing of its details go-
ing to the heart of its lesson as he had
once gone to the thick of battles that
dogd be fighting yet if i hadnt pulled off
mine he thought he set his jaw hard
and held his arm taut by god- he
cried if the pup could hold on so can
i once again his fingers closed over
the points of the medal before him the
lights of cobalt still blinked in their beck-
oning gone was the vision of the veldt
the thrill of glory the fires of courage
but in the ashes of self-respect of honor
of bravery there leaped a tiny flame  so
help me said john rodney  ill prove
up and he put back his cross in the
pocket of his shirt

  unsteadily uncertainly he stood in
waiting on the crest of the ridge his de-
cision mocked by his knowledge that every
street in the camp held for him the temp-
tation of old haunts of his visits there
but back of him lay that boy who was
dead because he had not reached him in
time the morbid horror of repassing the
shack daunted him while he hesitated
a lithe figure swung down the dark road
toward him when the stranger came
near he spoke msieu  capitaine
he asked of rodney he struck a match
to light a cigarette and by its sputtering
flame rodney recognized him as the voy-
ager who had danced in the haileybury
saloon when rodney failed to answer
he held the light close enough to see his
face instantly with the camaraderie of
the river men for the captain who had
crossed the barrier of race to make him-
self one of them he drew from his wide
sash a flask of brandy msieu is ill
he inquired with solicitude

 no said rodney his eyes de-
voured the flask he kept wetting his
parched lips with his tongue his hands
trembled as he put them behind his back
no he repeated and he strode back
along the ridge to the shack where the
dead boy lay

  all through the night he kept vigil there

the red of dawn was rising in the east
when he went out into a gray world turn-
ing his back on cobalt daylight blazed
its blue through the iridescent mists of the
lake when he came to the little station on
the haileybury hill the special train of
the board of trade committee was holding
the right of way to the north but on the
siding the engine of the freight on which
he had come down yesterday puffed in
waiting for its return trip he swung
himself up to the van a sleepy brake-
man looked up from his bunk when rod-
ney opened the door thought we just
landed you he said did you forget
something

  rodney did not answer

  what are you going back for asked
the brakeman curiously

  for something i lost said rodney

  well turn in said the man too
accustomed to rodneys eccentricities
of conduct to interest himself further
help yourself to a blanket weve all
day and a new fire ahead of us before we
strike the junction he turned on his
side and was asleep again before rodney
had huddled himself on the narrow bench
and sunk into the stupor of utter exhaus-
tion from which he did not wake until the
freight ran by the side of the junction
platform the accommodation train for
the western branch toward the porcupine
camps was pulling out as rodney clearing
the platform at a bound almost knocked
from his feet the provincial policeman who
had just completed his search for contra-
band liquor in the luggage of the porcu-
pine pilgrims no use searching you
rodney the officer called after him
you never had enough for your own
use but rodney gave him no more heed
than he seemed to give the crowd within
the coach after he opened the door and
dropped down into the nearest seat pull-
ing his hat down over his face he pretend-
ed to sleep but the crowd numbered
men who had been at the hockey-rink men
who had rioted and rollicked with rodney
and to whom the idea of rodney as a hero
was deliciously satirically funny all af-
ternoon on the way north from haileybury
on the express that was overtaking the
freight the topic of the speech about rod-
ney had engrossed them out of their talk
of gold now with rodney at their mercy
the bravest son

they directed their batteries of heavy sar-
casm upon him

  slouched in the corner of the seat rod-
ney listened to every word of their goad-
ing ridicule from men he had called his
friends came the most biting sneers baits
to catch him in speech that they might
find amusement in his self-defence know-
ing their purpose rodney held his self-
control with the apparent impassivity of
a greek but when a boy just in the
camps that summer from a jerkwater col-
lege sprang to his seat with arm up-
raised and the laughing cry  i give you
canadas bravest son john rodney
threw aside his mask of sleep his eyes
blazed terribly as he flung off his hat and
drew himself up to his great height his
face was drawn into hard lines of bitter
determination and white with the fury of
garnered rage in the aisle he towered
over the seats as slowly surely he made
his way toward the boy the crowd see-
ing his anger and knowing his strength
fell back the boy jumped to the floor
bringing his left arm before him for de-
fence but his eyes were shadowed by fear
as they saw the flaring fires of rodneys
rage he gave a swift signal of appeal to
the men who had started the baiting he
had climaxed but all of them were wait-
ing for rodneys action no one in the
car moved but rodney advancing with
the springing step of the panther lie had
once been likened to and a thin blond
englishman who alien to the crowd had
been seated behind the boy just as
rodney came abreast of him the man
thrust out his arm captain rodney
he said and the sharp note of authority
in his voice brought to the raging man
the insistent memory of obedience to its
mandates an officer does not engage in
common brawls

  for an instant rodney glowered as if he
would veer his attack upon him they
know you can fight the man went on
he tossed a disdainful glance at the gaping
crowd let them alone he ordered

   let me alone yelled rodney  for
the honor of the service im going to
teach that kid

  for the honor of the service asked
the man between him and the frightened
boy why dont you teach yourself
whats it to you cried rodney

  the man smiled the unexpectedness
of it startled the crowd more than had his
interference i flattered myself that
youd recall me he said  i was kitch-
eners aide at bloemfontein hurst you
know do you remember me now
his hand went out to rodneys but
rodney stepped back his hand rising to
his forehead in salute captain hurst
he said im fighting yet when ive won
the first battle ill meet you man to
man as suddenly as he had risen from
his place he turned his back on the men
who watched him and went to his seat

  some one in the crowd laughed but
the boy rodney had come to fight spoke
i want to apologize he said and
there came no more laughter

  after that no one spoke of rodney or
to him when the train came to the
frederick house river the englishman
went toward him but rodney only nodded
to him as he swung off across the girders of
the railroad bridge on his fifteen-mile walk
to golden city

  through the night as he strode along
the right of way under the diamond-
clear stars of the north john rodney
strengthened his decision by a determined
plan of seclusion from his old haunts and
his boon companions he would not lin-
ger in south porcupine filled as it would
be with men whose invitations were so
hard to resist he would go out on the
wallaby track that road through the
bush to the greater mines strung along to-
ward the mattagami river directing his
prospecting from the river camp but
when he had crossed the lake from golden
city to south porcupine the next day he
found that he had made his decision in
vain he would have to wait a week for
the coming of his supplies

  he was hardly in the hotel before a
half-score of men had invited him to drink
with them taking his refusal with careless
amusement by noon the forelopers of
the crowd from haileybury had brought
to the camp the news of the scenes in the
rink and the car by night the tale of
how rodney had failed to fight the boy
who jeered at him had become a story of
a mans rank cowardice under insult by
the next day the game of trying to break
down rodneys determination to keep
from drinking had become the amusement


the bravest son

of his old companions of the town all
that saved rodney from having to defend
his resolve in physical combat was the gen-
eral recognition by the men who plied him
of his superior physical strength but
they took their revenge in other ways
every man whom rodney refused chose
to regard the refusal as a personal affront
and disdained to speak to him on the occa-
sion of their next meeting with the bet-
ter element of the camp rodney had never
associated having chosen from the begin-
ning the easier way of finding his com-
radeships below his level hurst new to
the camp though he was drifted in with
the more reserved of the men there by
virtue of his letters and his personality
and of him rodney saw nothing by the
end of the week john rodney was an exile
in the camp he had pioneered

  while he waited impatiently for his de-
layed supplies rodney took to long ram-
bles out in the bush along the wallaby
track out there a half-dozen times he
noted smoke from forest fires that aroused
his alarm had he been talking with his
old comrades he would have warned them
of the danger he believed was threatening
once indeed he essayed to speak of it to
the hotel clerk but the latter had laughed
it off  that bush has been smoking ever
since i came here he declared

  and itll be smoking after youre
gone said rodney ominously but he
spoke to no other of his dread he
watchcd the smoke however with the
uneasiness of a ranger calculating chances
of fire-fighting and throwing aside every
feasibility in the face of his knowledge of
the devastating swiftness of a bush fire
and the while he watched he was obsessed
by the desire to go back to his old crowd
in his old way the sound of the phono-
graphs in the speak-easys as he passed
them at night on his way back to the hotel
maddened him with a thirst for compan-
ionship rather than for liquor through
the thin wooden walls of the hotel room
he could hear the slamming of cards  the
tables the murmur of voices the echoes
of laughter and he cursed himself for a
fool for holding away from the thing he
most desired but his dogged strength of
decision held him to the keeping of his
promise until the morning when he met
hurst

  he had gone on a needless errand to one
of the mines southwest of the town and
wearied by the heat was sitting on a fallen
log smoking furiously while he watched
the wavering smoke-cloud toward the
river when he heard voices on the trail
coming down the corduroy were four
men hurst and three others rodney
raised his hand in salute to the english-
man but the four passed without even a
look in his direction long after they had
disappeared he sat there watching the road
then herose  hell he said whatsthe
use and with the old dare-devil glint
in his eyes he started back to the town

  as he walked the heat seemed to grow
more oppressive he took off his coat
and flung it over his shoulder he tried
to whistle the tune of tommy atkins
but a curious dryness in his mouth halted
the attempt the bush seemed to be
growing darker but rodney slouched on
heedless of everything but his own reck-
less intention of flinging away the weeks
of self-denial until the curiously pun-
gent odor that a bush prospector never
forgets when it has once come to him
struck his nostrils in the middle of the
road he wheeled looking back toward the
mattagami

  less than a mile away the smoke hung
its scudding messengers of gray obscur-
ing the sun into a distant and lightless
ball of red a great wind was rising
whirling before it the leaves from birches
that stood in ghastly whiteness against the
darkness of the smoke-palled forest a
rabbit rushed from cover down the cor-
duroy a pack of huskies ran a roar
growing with the wind came to rodneys
ears just as his eyes sighted the leaping
pillars of flame in the cloud he put up
his hand to feci the direction of the wind
then flinging his coat to the ground he
turned his back on the fire and ran to-
ward the town

  as he ran he seemed to lose all sense
but that of sight becoming only a mov-
ing machine wild creatures passed him
in their panic rush from the mines on
either side of the track the shrieks of
whistles summoned men to action or to
flight down the trails men ran some
bearing grotesque burdens others with 
thought but that of immediate safety
one of them struck at rodney as he went
the bravest son	

by keep your head rodney called
after him youll need it later every
moment the roar of the fire grew louder
tie smoke grew denser rodney loping

lire kept steadily to the road only once
did lie pause an old man had been
thrown to the ground by the shock of one
of those dynamite explosions that kept de-

liut kudncv stepped back his hand lisinx i hi forehead in saline captain hurt

lie said-page jy

along with the steady swing of the trail-
blazer kept looking back over his shoul-
der mechanically at intervals calculating
the distance between him and the fore-
runners of the flames those pyramids that
flashed here and there through the trees
squinting ahead he measured the distance
to the lake that showed itself a haven of
refuge well make it boys he cried
to the others

  into the clearing between the bush and
the town men and women came from
north south and west stumbling over
slumps in their rush to the lake rodney
muttering to himself his bitterness for
having failed to heed the signals of the
vol lv-

tonating the approach of the fire to the
mines the crowd heedless of anylliing
but its goal would have trampled  him
had not rodney waited to pick him up

  at the outskirts of the town the mob
grew denser rodney wondered vaguely
where the men and women who thronged
the streets in their rush to their one chance
of safety could have come from at the
doors of offices and stores men appeared
begging the runners for aid in taking out
their goods but the men from the mines
passed them careless of the less vital pre-
dicament knowing that in the face of the
flames life was the one issue

  when he had come to the dock rodney


the bravest son

stood calculating with mathematical pre-
cision his exact chance of escape and de-
ciding that his ability to swim in any water
assured it to him as he unlaced his great
boots he let himself watch the drama on
the shore where a thousand people were
huddled beseeching the boatmen to take
them out of the danger zone already
hundreds were taking to the water stand-
ing up to their waists in its wash and ready
to plunge deeper overweighted boats
tossed on the waves that the wind from
the fire was churning at the foot of the
dock a canoe jammed with twice the num-
ber it could carry went down as some one
sprang into it from the pier a man near
rodney kept shouting to some one on a
row boat to come back fora little girl who
was crying piteously rodney had time
to be lad lhat he was responsible for no
one but himself as he saw a gasolene-
launch chugging in put the women on
it came the shout just as there swept
from the street a maddened crowd of hun-
garians from the mines pushing shoving
lighting in desperation to win their way to
the end of the dock rodney kicking off
his boots certain now of his safety in-
stinctively turned to drive back the fren-
zied men who threatened the only chance
the others had for life then why
should   he asked himself  what arc
they to me but one of the hungarians
passing him in his crazed rush drove his
elbow into him the shock of the impact
galvanized him to awful rage his hand
went to his hip-pocket in an instant he
was on the dock driving his way to the
foot through the wall of men towering
above them all forcing himself inch by
inch to the place where he might face
them

  stand back his cry clamored on
the fearful stillness that held the crowd
ominously only the sound of the motor-
boat broke in on his command the
women arc going in that boat he shout-
ed his staccato utterance thudding down
on the upraised white faces and if one
man dares to crowd up here im going to
kill him the menace of his voice drove
back the hungarians inch by inch till the
women had room to remain the menace
of his levelled gun kept them there the
motor-boat with engine stopped crept
up to the dock pull her in rodney

ordered the man nearest to it one by
one the women stepped down until the
boatman gave the signal that he could take
no more as the launch set off from the
dock the man nearest to rodney struck at
him rodney dashed him off into the
water clinging to the dock he made his
wail there are no more boats and the
crowd with guttural cries pressed forward
toward the man who had cheated them of
their chance

  rodney held his gun steady his voice
raised over the roar of the wind never fal-
tered as he spoke just back of you he
said is a hardware store go over there
and get axes and hatchets rnd nails
break down the shacks for the lumber
then well make rafts its your only
chance if you cant swim

  only the hungarians not understand-
ing the command lingered every other
man joined ir the rush toward the store
but while the sound of splitting lumber
cracked one of the foreigners looking far-
ther back saw a great ball of tire tossed
from the bush back of the clearing over to

the first shack in the town instantly the
shack was ablaze another and another
spurted in flame the watching man gave
a throaty cry and flung himself at rod-
ney bui rodney had seen him in time
to step to one side and to let him sprawl
on the floor of the dock then he set his
foot on him while he scanned the crowd
around the store

  men were working with driving fury
nailing boards together in haphazard haste
rodney groaned as he saw how futile was
their unskilled labor on rafts that would
not stand the first frenzy of the gale a
blazing hot breath from the fire roused
him to the urgency of haste he could
show them in five minutes how to make
ihose rafts but if he left these mad hun-
garians on the dock they would run wild
if they killed no one else they would kill
themselves in their fury rodneys eyes
roved through the crowd beyond sight-
ing a tall blond man who was splitting a
long timber into poles  captain hurst
he cried to him

  hurst sprang from his task to the dock
 captain hurst rodney gave command
 you will hold these men here while i show
those fools how to make rafts hursts
hand went up in acceptance of the order
wild crcaturcs passed him in their panic rush -page 

then came down again to his gun-pocket
as he took rodneys place

  with his own revolver still in his hand
rodney jumped from the dock to the
ground from group to group he went
working planning counting till the rafts
were finished and all the time the smoke
from the fire was blinding him the breath
of the fire was scorching him his hat
was gone and he could feel his hair grow-
ing crisp in the horrible heat that choked
him as he drove the last nail in the last
raft

  on the dock hurst was piling the hun-
garians on the rafts  get them off first
rodney had yelled to him after them
came the men who bore the rafts to the
shore as the fire blazed less than five hun-
dred feet back of them throwing lurid
light on the darkness the tornado of
the fire was tossing the waves over the

rafts but rodney saw that none of them
was going down at the dock men were
tumbling on the last raft calling to rod-
ney to join them hurst and he were
the last on the shore get in he or-
dered hurst the englishman hesitated
then obeyed rodney with one knee on
the edge of the pier set this foot down
 the frail craft reasoning that it in-
creased his hope of safety tenfold then
he drew it back too heavy he said
hurst tried to clamber off but rodney
shoved him back im going to swim
he said

  through the choking darkness hurst
spoke to him captain rodney he
said twice youve proven yourself the
bravest man of us all rodney held out
his hand to him thank you he said
then he shoved the raft away from the
dock

cormac obrien piper

by amanda mathews

      i l l ii s  r a t ion nv f  c  v o h n

ormac obrien the an-
cient piper and old norah
his wife lived up a bit of
rooked stone-walled lane
across the road from the
duffys this bleak cloudy
winter afternoon the couple sat in their
respective chimney-corners silent as their
own hearth for the peat never roars
spits or crackles it gives a tranquil fire of
yellow glows and gentle caressing orange
flames

  a red cow walked confidently into the
kitchen her calf at her flank corniac
rose and opened for them the door of what
had once been the room but a great
patch of roof had fallen in so that it was
now used only as the byre behind the
calf the procession was extended by ducks
and chickens these broke rank and
dashed clamorously about the kitchen

  ye unmannerly birds admonished
norah but she scattered food on the flag-
stones their supper over they went
peaceably to the byre norah lighted
the candle husband and wife then re-
sumed their low wooden chairs

  the fireplace was very shallow and
smoked in all winds a holy picture on
the gable wall was so blackened that
mary and the child could scarcely be rec-
ognized the few small objects on the
mantel might have been carved out of
bog oak a saucy smoke-puff fanned the
pipers face then made itself into a wreath
about his head instantly dissolved and
mingled with the general smokiness of the
room he coughed

  there must a bit of black stone been
builded into this chimly observed his
wife sympathetically her remark was
as customary as the behavior of the chim-
ney her husband offered no reply

the piper was blear-eyed from his
eighty-five years but erect as youth his
abundant black hair was only slightly
grizzled though the sideburns framing his
vol lv-

clear-cut old features were quite gray he
wore a gray homespun suit with patch on
patch norah ten years his junior had
a softly wrinkled face and pleasant brown
eyes she was dressed in black skirt red
body and blue kerchief her feet
were bare

  johneen duffy slipped in his right in-
dex-finger holding a place near the back
cover of a book

  i cannot read in me own home for the
ructions of kitty and dermot he ex-
plained plaintively

  ye bes welcome encouraged the pi-
per  i perceive ye to be a lad of parts
in this sentiment old cormac voiced the
general changed opinion of the neighbors
since johneen had borne off the prize of
the letterkenny feis for a gaelic poem
by a school-child the boy stretched him-
self luxuriously on the warm flags with
his book lying within the circle of yellow
firelight

  mary anne appeared next with some-
thing wrapped in a cloth

   i cannot keep clean the white coat i
am knitting with me sister kitty rubbing
herself against it every minute she com-
plained

  ye bcs welcome repeated mrs
obrien as the girl took the creepie-stool
and spread out on her knees the compo-
nent parts of the white jersey

  you are the great knitter entirely
approved norah so was i once but
that once is away me eyes are no more
equal for it and now i never take the skiv-
ers in me hands i mind though when i
was a wee one and our old servant set me to
learning with a couple of goose-feathers

  i must finish this coat the night for
mother will be taking in all our knitting
to the shop at ardnagapery to-morrow
anxiously declared mary anne

  her fingers fairly twinkled the skivers
a silence reigned which was most grateful
to johneen as he rapidly turned the thrill-

                                   
cormac obrien piper

ing final pages he closed the book and
looked into the fire

  what hes your thought lad in-
quired his host

  i was wondering just would you be
blowing your pipes the night

  old cormac took down his instrument
from the top of the dresser deliberately
tied the leathern string about his body
strapped the pad above his right knee ad-
justed a bellows under each arm and
struck up mcleods reel

  as if charmed in by the music two more
people entered mary anne had started
and dipped her flushed face almost into
her work but she looked up and nodded
shyly when she heard the hearty voices of
tim mcgarvev and his wife peggy who
was peggy doogan before tim returned
from america and resumed his long-inter-
rupted courtship what had been peggys
house was now the byre tim had buik a
grand new cottage exceeding the splendor
of the odonnells

 mr and mrs mcgarvey were wel-
comed they seated themselves side by
side on the box-bed and begged that the
music proceed

  it was proceeding through the mazes of
mcsweeneys march when maiy annes
face again dipped into her work at another
step on the threshold this time it was
shane odonnell big clumsy and fairly
gruff what with being intensely bashful
and now intensely conscious of mary
annes presence he was monitor at
school and on the high road to being a
master

  i am trying to think what the pipes
sound like said johneen

  troth what could they be sounding
like but themselves queried norah

  her husband lifted his hand with affa-
ble yet commanding gesture

   remember norah ye are only a
woman i am not denyin ye do very well
for what ye bes but the faymale mine is
lackin raich

  the pipes has the makings of a whole
orchestra chimed in mcgarvey there
is a flute and a pipe-organ on a jag and a
beeskip after you have put a stick in it

  the piper scowled at the yankees well-
intentioned encomium

  it is a grand sound they make alto-
gether put in peggy pacifically

  a man has a big ear to be picking up
all them tunes mcgarvey blundered on

  obrien straightened himself away from
the back of his chair

  it is plain you are no musicianer not
to be telling pieces from tunes mr tim
mcgarvey boy to johneen open
yon chest and fetch me dark music

  it was dark music in the most literal
sense being blackened by age and smoke
until only an occasional note was visible
but the piper had johneen hold it up in
front of him while he went through fare-
well to erin without taking his eyes
once from the blurred sheet

   what say yez to me dark music  he
demanded

  that is the tidiest piece whatever
responded peggy  it is not to-day nor
yesterday you got to learn

  i forgot to knit said mary anne
simply

    know now about the pipes- began
johneen restrained by shyness but driven
by the urge of his thought

  speak up lad

  the wind gets caught in them and
may not be away until it has told all its
secrets to cormac obrien

  the old man was mollified and thun-
dered on with roderick dhu

  the pipes bes too wild for the tamer
times we has now and too dark for the
lazy ones to icarn holy saints but they
had their day of old the irish has
danced to them fought to them laughed
to them wept to them died to them

  as old cormac ceased speaking shane
drew forth once more the white envelope
from his pocket

  this letter came to the master he
explained and the master was sending
it to you by me they will be having a
grand gaelic festival in dublin come next
month and they are wanting to gather all
the irish pipers in the whole island they
will be giving them tickets to dublin and

there will be prizes-

  cormac obrien looked inches taller in
his chair but his only immediate response
was to plunge into a series of irish jigs

  have t gone back in me piping he
demanded have i gone back

  ye have not gone back cried mrs
obrien

  norah he answered i must be re-
cormac obrien piper



mindin ye that ye bes only a woman
how can a mans wife hearing him all the
time be telling if he has gone back
sure you have gone back nothing
declared shane i doubt the likes of
you will be found in all ireland was
you not carrying off the first prize of the
donegal feis three years since

   i was responded the gratified mu-
sician was i ever tellin yez the an-
swer i made to the band-master at done-
gal when he was inquirin how i come by
such a strong grasp of music 

   every one present had heard the anec-
dote innumerable times but this moment-
ous invitation to play at the dublin feis
threw over it such a glow of fresh signifi-
cance that the requests were sufficiently
genuine and spontaneous

   i am a son of nature i told that
band-master i live between two ele-
ments the wind of the sea and the wind
of the mountains so i get the both winds
mixed up like in me music

  again he played-an impromptu med-
ley of old selections threaded with his own
variations of the moment indeed his
listeners seemed to hear screaming sea-
gulls and the shrilling of wind among sails
mingled with the tossing of wrenched
boughs on storm-beaten mountain-tops
a sort of awe fell upon his hearers

   you must be mending the hinges on
your old bag or i doubt but it will spill
your clothes on you

   cormac wilted down in his chair look-
ing dazed and troubled this time he was
plaintively petulant

   norah why can ye no understand to
let a man soar when he do be soaring
but shane and the rest sympathized
with norah in realizing that there were
certain practical aspects of the dublin
matter which the old man should be
brought to consider

   me father will be proud to drive ye to
 the station in our donkey-cart volun-
 teered shane

   i am sure me mother will be killing a
 young bird for you to be eating along the
 road ventured mary anne

the yankee plumped down a half-crown
on the pipers knee here is for you to
bring norah a gewgaw from dublin 
norah clasped her hands delightedly
thats terrible kind of you tim mc-

garvey and himself will be seeing some

brave fairing like a new handkercher-

  thank ye kindly muttered the old
man but he was evidently still dazed and
the half-crown rolled to the floor

shane what day must he be starting
for beyant asked peggy mcgarvey
shane took out the letter and studied it
thisday fortnight i would say that
will let the master write for the booking
yez mean well the piper interposed
irritably but yez seem to be all pushing
me out of me own house into the road
has anybody yet heerd me say i was
going tell me that

   but are ye not  inquired one and an-
other of his listeners

  norah smiled into the fire her voice
was so fresh and girlish it seemed to come
from mary anne

i can fair hear ye swirling away to

them all in dublin and the wonder-

  norah he protested ye are hearin
what ye are no called upon to hear
and for what would she no be called
upon to hear it asked mcgarvey

  the piper continued to look only at old
norah who in her turn was still smiling
into the fire

  we have been married fifty-five years
come candlemas he mused aloud i
was a young gossoon on me way to pipe
for a dance and i met a big house i took
for a workhouse and i sent out a tune
going by to hearten up the poor old souls
inside and who came running out but the
tidiest jewel of a girl with her hair blow-
ing all about her sweet face hashkee
hashkee how i wished i could pipe her

after me down the road-

  ye were swirling bonny charlie
and i learned the big house to be a
rectory and her the rectors daughter and
every day i passed piping and wishing her
to follow we got acquainted at the cross-
roads and the night come when i piped
 bonny charlie  down by the wall and she
was away with me to be married

  i wore a purple camelot gown
beamed norah

  was her folks annoyed inquired
peggy

  they was done with her the day she
run off with a poor catholic musicianer-
so she come down to this miserable house
instid of that grand rectory


reprieve

  there was blue-velvet chairs in the
drawing-room crooned norah but i
had to follow the piper swirling bonny
charlie and this house is warmer she
extended her bare feet to the glowing
embers

  norah do be growing a bit childish-
like with her years offered mr obrien
to be sure i am ten years older nor her
and there bes nothing childish about me
as yet god be thanked but that is be-
cause he made a mans brain stronger to
bear up under his age

  cormac dear ye bes the great man
entirely for discourse give me a taste
of your dudeen he passed it to her

  if you were not to go to dublin
shane expostulated it is the chance of
your life you would be missing

  but norah is me life and i am more

thinking it is me chance for losin her-

  now do ye not be fretting about
norah cheered mrs mcgarvey it
is fine care we will all be taking of her

and it is meself will be in and out and
out and in-so will shusan duffy and the
childer

   yez be good neighbors and mean kind
by us but yez have your own troubles
with the fowl and the animals norah
has dizzy spells and the time ye was out
might not be ion and yet long enough
for me norah to fall into the fire i will
be stayin

  norah looked up happily

  cormac darlin we have our pensions
and ye need not be going up after that
prize though its yourself would bring it
away i would be heart-scalded missing
ye so long from the house for once
she was not reproved

  shane and mary anne gazed dreamily
at cormac and norah in their chimney-
corners both were having a dim sol-
emn prophetic vision of themselves at
the far end of the long road down which
they were now groping for each others
hands to make the start together

reprieve
by charlotte wilson

the other day it dawned on me

a sudden shock across our play

he is so old-the miracle
may happen any day

the miracle at any hour
this small man-comrade at my knee
may grave upon his soul his first
clear memory of me

some trivial moment slackened mood
imperishably there may trace
my picture as at heart i bear
my sweet dead mothers face

i-i unworthy let me bow
like kneeling page of old to feel
laid on his shoulder stiff and shrewd
the consecrating steel

abased in utter thankfulness
before the mirror of his eyes

he is so little yet-i still
may make his memories
the point of view 

     apropos of the efforts made from time
     to time to take mount vernon away
      from the association in whose hands
     it has been for more than fifty years one is
     struck afresh by the amount of forgetting
     which is going on in the world for there

    seems to be a wide-spread igno-
a washingtons			r 

birthday	ranee as to the actual ownership ot

reminiscence the place some newspapers hand
vlrnon udl il over to the daughters of the
association and american revolutionand indeed
its founder a mernijer f that society has been
heard to say blandly oh yes we own
mount vernon  fancying of course that she
was correct in the statement and ignorant
of the fact that there is one womans patri-
otic society in america which antedates her
own but there are still persons living who
remember the appeals to women in every
town and village from one end of the
united states to the other to subscribe the
sum of one dollar apiece for the purchase of
the home and grave of washington

       i have before me an interesting pam-
     phlet giving a sketch of ann pamela cun-
     ningham the founder of the mount vernon
     ladies association the first suggestion
     of the purchase of the estate came however
     from miss cunninghams mother although
     it was far from her thoughts or wishes that
     her invalid daughter should carry the enter-
     prise on her shoulders going down the
     potomac one evening in the year  mrs
     cunningham noted in the moonlight the
     ncglected and desolate condition of mount
     vernon reflecting on the ruin which was
     likely to overtake the place unless some
     speedy effort were made to save it the idea
     came to her that the women of america
     should own and preserve it she suggested
     the plan in a letter to her daughter and miss
     cunningham at once said i will do it
     at all crucial points in the undertaking
     when the impossible had to be accomplished
     miss cunningham had a way of saying i
     will do it and she always made good

       she started the movement at once but
     being a gentlewoman of the old school could
     not imagine herself coming before the public
     in her own person she always signed her-
     self the southern matron and it was

only in  when the estate had finally
been purchased t hat she yielded to the solic-
itation of mr everett and other friends
and signed a public letter with her own
name in  she was horrified to see a
notice of herself in a newspaper her re-
turn to south carolina was menlioned and
her sympathy with secession was assumed
she wrote to a friend conceive of my
amazement and distress when the paper was
handed to me you know my horror of
publicity for a lady-of her name appearing
in the newspapers  it was under any
circumstances most improper and indeli-
cate to draw a lady into the political arena
how much more to do it in connection with
her relation to an association formed to
have joint ownership and guardianship of
the grave of the father of all-no matter
how our country is divided which shows
that this south carolina woman was not
sectional in her sympathies as to the rest
her times were indeed different from ours
for when in  philadelphia was respond-
ing enthusiastically to the call for money for
the purchase of mount vernon the leading
men of that city suddenly refused any sup-
port to the movement because it was a
womans effort and they disapproved of
womens mixing in public affairs

  the movement was at first started wholly
as a southern affair southern women were
to raise the two hundred thousand dollars
for the purchase of the property and vir-
ginia was to hold it the ladies to have it
in charge and adorn it if they could have the
means fortunately the owner mr john
augustine washington refused to agree to
the first charter and the northern press t hen
began to notice the movement claiming
that it should be a national one in which
the northern states should aid miss cun-
ninghams patriotism rose to the occasion
as she wrote later concerning the first ef-
forts they failed because washington be-
longed not alone to the south while as
she went on to say the second effort failed
because the title and power were to be
given to one state and washington be-
longed not to one state alone

the point of view

cunningham started the enterprise found-
ing the mount vernon ladies associa-
tion in  from first to last she ac-
cepted no failure or rebuff nor did she
depend on her pen alone was her presence
required at mount vernon to win over mr
washington at richmond to persuade the
legislature or at charleston philadelphia
or washington to those places she went
sometimes carried on a bed a woman of
great intellectual ability and force of char-
acter she must also have been gifted with
unusual charm for obstacles apparently
insuperable disappeared before her personal
appeal when she begged edward everett
to aid her he found her arguments so con-
vincing that he most generously devoted
the proceeds of his lectures to the cause until
he placed in her hands the sum of sixty-
nine thousand dollars she persuaded mr
washington to part with mount vernon
she made friends in richmond and in spite
of the opposition of those who warned the
legislature not to be carried out of its
propriety by sentiment and female witch-
ery and the consequent loss of one bill
another one was entered and carried the
next year so great had been the wear and
tear of the struggle that after the victory
it seemed as if miss cunningham might die
before the necessary papers could be signed
the lawyers and her friends waited in an
anteroom for her to rally from an alarming
attack and finally the papers were read in
due form and then as she describes it in a
letter to a friend a gentlemen knelt be-
side my couch and held the papers for my
signature my lifeless fingers could hold a
pen but a few moments could only make
two or three letters at a time no wonder
she was in a mental stupor for three weeks
she roused herself to raise money for resto-
ration and repairs and early in  issued
the appeal which was the first to be signed
with her own name before the work had
progressed very far came the civil war
during the war miss cunningham was shut
up for the greater part of the time in her
south carolina home with heavy burdens
of private affairs on her shoulders but as
long as she could keep in communication
with the agents whom she had left in charge
at mount vernon she continued to guide its
affairs she directed that a request should
be made of the commanders of both armies
to give a pledge for the safety of mount

vernon and this appeal doubtless had some-
thing todo with the fact that the spot was
held sacred by both armies

  when the war was over miss cunning-
ham and her vice-regents at once renewed
their efforts to raise money for the restora-
tion and care of the place her last great
effort was to obtain an indemnity for the
government use of the mount vernon
steamboat during the four years of the war
she went to washington and to the capitol
and although she  had not for twenty years
dared to walk up such a long flight of steps
she ventured to do it she had to climb
those steps six or seven times during the
next ten days when the senator who was
to introduce the bill told her that he could
do no more that  member of his commit-
tee would consent to ask him to introduce
the bill without further consideration he
added  but you can do it  she did do it
he needed three members of the committee
to empower him to act she selected three
from the list asked them one by one and
each one assented immediately to her re-
quest on another day she went ill with
fever to give the necessary information to
enable her friend the senator to reply to
the opposition since every one seemed to be
as ignorant of an association whose work
had filled the newspapers but a few years
before as if america had not been the scehe
of action and after all the bill did not
pass at that time again in february
 she went to washington and in march
congress finally granted the claim and the
association received seven thousand dollars
with which to repair the desolation at
mount vernon miss cunninghams great
work was done she kept the regency a
few years longer and then in  resigned
and as her biographer says left mount
vernon with just strength enough to reach
rosemont her carolina estate where she
died may i 

the constitution of the association
was drawn up by miss cunningham
it provides for a regent vice-re-
gcnts secretary and treasurer and such
subordinate officers as may be from time to
time appointed one vice-regent was to
be appointed if practicable from each
state in the union the appointments
are for life and so far there have been but
the point of view



 four regents the last one elected in 
 under them is a resident superintendent
 who has his assistant superintendent head
 gardener and such other officials as are
 needed the grand council composed of
 the regent and all the vicc-regcnts
 nims- meets once a year at mount ver-
 non where the ladies remain in
 residence for a fortnight or more during
 which time they carefully go over all details
 of the care of the place they have never
 found it necessary to depart from the scheme
 laid down by their first regent tn miss
 cunninghams farewell address she said to
 those whom she was leaving the home
 of washington is in your charge see to it
 that you keep it the home of washington
 let no irreverent hand change it no vandal
 hands desecrate it with the fingers of prog-
 ress those who go to the home in which
 he lived and died wish to see in what he
 lived and died let one spot in this grand
 country of ours be saved from change
 upon you rests this duty

   it is in this spirit that mount vernon is
 cared for everything is dotie to keep it in
 perfect repair but the repairs are made in
 accordance with the period of the place
 the visitor secs the finished result-the
 house as washington lived in it the garden
 as it was when mrs washington and nelly
 custis walked along its paths he sees
 nothing of the infinity of pains which pro-
 duces this result the watchful care of the
 mansion and the tomb the minute attention
 to trees and shrubs to garden and farm lo
 roads and drainage and finally the way in
 which the income is helped out by gifts from
 the regents of every manner of thing from
 furniture and relics within the house to stone
 boundary walls without and so not see-
 ing there are some restless souls who would
 like to change matters

   it is from the entrance fees that the in-
 come for the care of the estate is derived an
 income none too large yet there has been a
 clamor to abolish these fees and the regents
 have even been grotesquely accused of di-
 viding and pocketing them other persons
 have demanded lhat the united slates gov-
 ernment deprive the association of its char-
 ter and turn the place into a national park
 there has been considerable activity in this
 direction during the past year

   when in the early days of struggle miss
 cunningham was asked what qualifications

 were necessary for acceptable service on the
 board of regents the reply was the qual-
 ifications needed on the part of a lady are
 that she shall be of a family whose social
 position would command the confidence of
 the state and enable her to enlist the aid of
 persons of-the widest influence she must
 be in independent circumstances as the of-
 fice is not a salaried one and attending the
 annual meetings would involve some ex-
 pense she must be able to command con-
 siderable leisure as the duties will require
 much time until the stipulated funds are
 raised she should also possess liberal pa-
 triotism energy of character cultivation of
 mind and such a combination of mental
 powers as will insure that she shall wisely
 and judiciously exercise the power of voting
 in grand council upon the future guardian-
 ship and improvement of mount vernon

  this is the standard up to which the re-
gents have always conscientiously tried to
live is there any government office which
demands such qualifications any person
who knows something of the history of
mount vernon since it came into the hands
of the association is satisfied that its pres-
ent regent speaks nothing more than the
truth when she says that the association
has for more than half a century main-
tained the high standards that have from
the beginning characterized the manage-
ment of this mecca of the nation and
that there is no record of failure on the
part of any vice-regent to fulfil these in-
herited obligations where in our public
service is there a record equal to this

  some one may say that it is an aristocratic
administration what of it it is a won-
derful survival of the best traditions of the
early days of the republic and is itself a
part of the sacred relic wnich mount ver-
non is to the nation in addition it is in all
probability the sort of administration which
would best please that aristocratic repub-
lican george washington and martha his
wife where could their tastes be more ap-
propriately consulted

it came to me very clearly the other day
in reading herodotus that the great
need of our present civilization is for a
delphic oracle we show plainly enough
that we yearn for authoritative utterances
on all such subjects as art education poli-


the point of view

ties and philosophy we accept final words
almost too docilely when we find them-
and we find them constantly-only they are
so liable to change it is discouraging to
go so often through the same experience to
be told an eternal truth to learn it by
heart to decide that on this subject
at least we need never again do the
smallest amount of thinking and then to
find that something entirely different and
even more authoritative has been promul-
gated by the powers that be there again
is one of our great difficulties the powers
that be it is not always easy to reach
the critic who knows absolutely the last
fashion in art or to induce some hermit-
scicntist to tell us what wc ought to be ac-
cepting as scientific truth

  fancy how restful it would have been last
winter if we could have sent in a body to a
good dependable oracle and asked is this
futurist movement in art anything we must
really trouble ourselves about or as a
friend of mine would more succinctly put it
 is it any good imagine the amount of
unenlightening discussion that a definite
reply to this question would have spared us
can you not fancy a messenger from the
present administration approaching the
pythoness to inquire whether the proceeds
from the income tax would balance the
losses in revenue consequent on the reduc-
tion of the tariff to say nothing of all the
personal problems of manners and business
and love with which our daily press attempts
to deal with a reasonableness far from con-
vincing we dont want to be taken behind
the scenes we dont want the facts set be-
fore us so that we can judge for ourselves
we want to be told yes or no

  some superficial thinkers will say that
the age lacks faith and that without faith
an oracle is impossible this is a complete
mistake the ancients themselves were
sceptical nothing could be more scientific
than the spirit in which crcesus tested the
oracles before he decided to which he would
submit the question of his persian campaign
he first sent messengers to all the best-

reeommended oracles exactly one hun-
dred days from the time of departure each
messenger was to address the same ques-
tion to the shrine to which be had been ac-
credited what was the king doing at that
time observe that the messengers did
themselves not know the answer this is
in the style of the society for psychical re-
search at its most rigorous probably at
the time the messengers left sardis crcesus
had not yet decided he did however
manage to think of an unlikely occupation
he was cooking two different kinds of meat
in a brass vessel with a brass top only the
oracles at delphi and of amphiaraus were
able to give the correct reply

  to such simple tests as these our oracle
would of course be subjected and for my
part in these days of thought-trarsference
i have no doubt the priestess would know
the answer to such a demand as  what was
i doing a year ago last easter  but if her
occult powers should fail her in an emer-
gency such a reply as secretly wishing for
that which once had been yours for the ask-
ing or trying in vain to forget what
your heart forever remembers would do
very well with nine inquirers out of ten
and how a few successes would run like
wildfire over the country and be written
up by the daily papers

  the stage setting would be simple-a
deep cavern in some rocky range preferably
near but not too near one of our more fash-
ionable health resorts a young woman of
pleasing appearance and psychic tempera-
ment a tripod and since a pythoness might
still be regarded as requiring a python an
amiable snake

  the more one thinks of it the more the
prospect opens for instance one of the
minor benefits would be the profession of-
fered to a class of people who as things are
find few useful employments open to them
-the overeducated subtle men and women
too sensitive for drudgery and not robust
enough for creative work they would be
admirably adapted to act as interpreters of
the oracles replies

the appeal of the winter
las dsc ape

the art of the landscape-painter makes
its appeal to the public from two
widely different standpoints-each le-
gitimate in its way ard each finding its
source in one of the fundamental and uni-
versal instincts of the human race the
first and by far the mere usual avenue of
approach is by way of association and sug-
gested sentiment helen and john strolling
through the spring academy come upon a
delightful little picture of the woods in june
with a streamlet meandering through the
open spaces reflecting here a tree and there
a bit of sky in its limpid mirror it reminds
them irresistibly of that red-letter day long
ago when they wandered together through
just such a patch of woodland and seated
themselves upon the mossy banks of just
such a delightful little stream and it recalls
vol lv-

to them the memorable fact that they came
home hand-in-hand an engaged and blissful
couple

  although it means many a small sacrificc
in other ways they purchase the picture
and install it in the breakfast-room where it
will meet their gaze morning after morning

  there were other canvases which im-
pressed them less favorably-a gray day in
autumn for instance which left them op-
pressed with a sense of sadness and a cer-
tain snow scene which positively made them
shiver

  they derive genuine pleasure from their
periodic rounds of the picture-galleries-but
their pleasure is purely derivative-the re-
sult of association and suggestion they
arc very apt to demand anecdotal interest
in a figure picture and a landscape must re-
call something or suggest some experience
of their own their interest is intellectual

                                       


the field of art

rather than artistic the intrinsic beauty
of the work itself does not suffice

  it was the johns and the helens of this
world who placed raphael on a pedestal and
kept him there for three hundred years
while velasquez and hals and rembrandt
and vermeer remained in outer obscurity
and neglect in the generation immediately
preceding our own they did not understand
turner their children did not care much
for inness and they allowed john twacht-
man to die unrecognized beauty in itself
and by itself made no appeal to them

  there is another class of piclure-lovers
however-smaller it is true than the group
to which john and helen belong but rapidly
increasing in numbers nevertheless-who de-
mand only of a work of art that it shall be
beautiful it was they who some fifty years
ago rediscovered velasquez who twenty-
live years later found in the forgotten
corners of the old dutch galleries certain
pictures by an unknown painter named
vermeer of delft pictures which have now
taken their place among the great master-
pieces of the world it was they who ac-
claimed constable and millet and corot and
manet when these great artists were cav-
iare to the vulgar they possessed the true
vision they were sensitive to beauty
they recognized it whenever and wherever
it appeared and hailed its creators as the
 masters

  now just as false standards in art have
frequently dominated humanity for long
periods so false standards have sometimes
been used for generations in judging natures
own beauties and the decrees rendered
under their influence have been repeated
over and over again until they have become
traditional and so firmly rooted in the con-
victions and prejudices of the race that even
the artist is affected by them and at times
doubts the verdict of his own vision

  a good example of one of these false and
misleading world traditions is that which
proclaims the tropical landscape to be na-
tures supreme effort in the domain of natur-
al out-of-door beauty and which classes the
landscape of the temperate zone as a very
poor and uninteresting second by compari-
son of course the very opposite of this is
true any one who has resided long in the
tropics and who has suffered as i have from
the barbaric riot of tropical color-the howl-
ing greens and blues and reds and yellows

that everywhere afflict the eye in equatorial
regions-understands why the only really
great school of landscape-painting which the
world has ever seen should have grown up
in the misty north it is not contrast which
makes beauty but harmony contrast is
the joy of the savage harmony the delight
of the civilized man the patagonian stalks
triumphant in a blanket whose alternate
bands are of bright crimson and vivid blue
but the cultivated man finds his highest a-s-
thetic pleasure in subdued tones of harmoni-
ously blended color it is at least open to
reasonable doubt if the most vociferous ef-
forts of our post-impressionist brothers will
succeed in wholly destroying our taste for
the work of whistler and of botticelli

  the distinction which is here drawn be-
tween the landscape of the tropics and that
of the temperate zone in my opinion holds
good if in a somewhat milder degree when
applied to our own american landscape
under its summer and its winter aspects
the interest which john and helen found
in that picture of the woods in summer was
due wholly to association and not at all to
the intrinsic beauty of the picture itself-
for of that the canvas had little or none

  the crude green of its trees contrasting
with the crude blue of its summer sky made
a color relation that was anything but agree-
able for blue and green are not complemen-
tary colors and only when used in attenu-
ated scale and handled by a master like corot
can they be fused into a true work of art
this same landscape however when man-
tled with snow-its white vistas stretching
away to meet the deep blue of the winter
sky-might easily have furnished the motive
for a work of art of the first order

  and herein we find the dividing line be-
tween the two points of view above noted
in the first it is sentiment which counts in
the second beauty pure and simple the
first is intellectual the second visual the
first would make of the painter a story-teller
the second demands that he be an artist

  and it is the growing recognition of the
fact that the true function of art is the
creation of beauty which has turned the
attention of so many of our first landscape-
painters to winter subjects for there can be
no question that the inclement season of the
year which is least productive in the material
sense is by far the most productive in the
artistic sense considered in terms of color
the field of art



and of decorativc line winter is fai more
beautiful than summer it would almost
seem as if kindly mother nature desiring to
compensate her children for the loss of the
peas and the peaches had provided them

hundred times a day in response to changcs
in thecolorof the sky-for the sky color is al-
ways the key-note of a snow-scene and its
response to this color call will invariably be
the complementary color so subtly stated

the old inn at cos-cob by birge harrison

with a special feast for the eyes and the
spirit but why asks helen should
plain white snow be considered more beau-
tiful than the lovelygreen of summer leaves
a sheet of paper is clean and fresh and pleas-
ant to look upon but after all it is just white
paper

  ah there you are snow is never white
it will take on a thousand exquisite and
varied tints-you can exhaust the vocabu-
lary of jewels and of flowers in attempt-
ing to describe them and still leave more than
half unmentioned-but it is never white it is
an instrument upon which nature plays won-
derful color symphonies with never a harsh
or a discordant note it changes color a

however that to the non-professional eye
the snow will appear to remain a pure and
virgin white

  if the sky is yellow as at sunset l he snow
will reply with a note of exquisite lavender
blue if the sky is blue the snow will be deli-
cately yellcw if the sky is greenish the
snow will be roseate in hue i have even
seen it assume an unbelievable tone of crim-
son pink in reply to the call of a violently
emerald sunset sky

  but snow has still another attribute which
occasionally interrupts and varies the action
of this general law of complementaries in
a shy and gentle way it reflects adjacent
color-masses much in the same way as water


the field of art

reflects near-by objects so that like a ca-
pricious maiden the snow is constantly offer-
ing surprises even to the trained expert who
is conversant with her ways and her gen-
eral character it therefore behooves the
painter to bring each day a fresh and un-
prejudiced vision if he would catch her most
delightful moods

  at one time it was my unfortunate lot to
reside in the tropics for a period of more
than ten years when at last i came
north again i was frankly fascinated by the
beauty of our new england winter and es-
pecially when the whole country was trans-
figured and glorified by the white beauty of
the snow i could not get enough of it and
like a saint bernard dog returning to his
own t rolled in the white drifts for the pure
joy of the thing

  during my ten wandering years i had
sailed more than once around the world
visiting almost all of the spots which have
been admired for their rare and special
beauty yet i found the snow-covered hills
of new england more beautiful than any
of these famous places of the earth

  opposite my present home in the catskills
there rises a wooded and rather featureless
hill at the foot of which nestles an old dutch
farmhouse when it is clothed in its usual
garb of summer green no one would suspect
it of any a-sthetic or artistic possibilities
but when the snow comcs its climbing pas-
tures suddenly develop a delightful and most
interesting pattern nd as its while mass
stands forth against the ringing blue of the
december sky it makes an ideal motive for
a landscape-painter

  at sunrise its summit receives the first
rosy kiss of the mounting sun while all else
sleeps in amethystine shadow at noonday
it rises pale and beautiful through i he sunny

winter haze-a symphony in mother-of-
pearl at twilight it looms a mass of ultra-
marine and turquoise against a sky of palest
amber and under the ghostly light of the
december moon it floats a dream mountain
of faintest blue against the deeper blue of
the midnight sky  have painted it six
times under as many different effects and i
shall probably paint it as many tmes again
every one of these pictures of the hill has
been sold at its first public exhibition and i
am convinced hat were  to make a picture
of the hill in summer it would go the weary
rounds of the exhibitions for years unsold
and undesired-if indeed it were ever ac-
cepted by the exhibition juries

  no one certainly would find any touch of
beauty in its crude blue-and-green contrasts
even john and helen would pass it by as it
has no possible human or anecdotic interest
to feature it-to pull it out of the slough

  but our american winter landscape is
paintable even when devoid of its white
mantle of snow the general color of the
woods and the fields is a tender russet-yel-
low enlivened with a brilliant touch of rose
or orange here and there this of course
makes a delightful color harmony against
a sky that has in it the faintest tint of crys-
tal-green drawn over an ashes-of-roses un-
derground indeed at this season it is just
about as difficult to find a picture motive
which is not beautiful in color and harmo-
nious in line as it is in midsummer to dis-
cover one which has these qualities but
after all it is the snow which gives to our
winter landscape its greatest beauty and
the frequency with which snow-scenes are
now appearing in the annual exhibitions is
due to the fact that our landscape-painters
have discovered this cardinal truth

bikce harrison
leaders of fashion

hthe question who makes the
styles is generally countered
with that other question what
is style 

  nevertheless there has always
been in all the various worlds-or
to use the french word mondes
-some one authority or group of
authorities creating the style to
which all the world ultimately sub-
scribes then that style at first
exclusive becomes more and more
general until at last it becomes so
general that it ceases to be the
style at all in the meantime these
autocratic authorities have created
a new style which in the same
way runs its course

  in the days when the horse
was a useful beast of burden
as well as a smart fashion and
whenknowingones prescribed
the style for the horse the
harness the whip the seat and

the fittings there grew up a great
many things-some valuable and
attractive and some merely arbi-
trary-which were the fashion for
the horse the equipage and the
road

  today we have a new world-the
monde of the automobile-growing
rapidly-far too rapidly to give full
consideration to its own code but
nevertheless developing one with
or without consideration but
young as is the designing building
and driving of automobiles it is
already apparent that there is a dis-
tinct fashionor somethingbetween
a fashion and an ideal having
more or less influence on all
cars and on everything related
to them and that that influ-
ence is exerted as far as it
has yet been expressed in
and by the motor cars known
as pierce-arrow

scribners magazine advertiser

                      whoever rides or walks on crowded avenues
                    where motor cars congregate can pick out a
                    pierce-arrow car without an instants hesitation
                    of course the sophisticated ones know all cars at
                    sight but everyone recognizes the pierce-arrow
                    it is recognized not so much by its distinctive-
                    ness as by the distinction of that distinctiveness

each year there has been in the pierce-arrow
car some one thing that differentiated it from
other cars-a something recognized at sight by
everyone to be as attractive and appropriate to a
motor car as a smart gown or coat is becoming to a beautiful woman

these things which for a season are
the peculiar and exclusive ear-marks of
the pierce-arrow car become the fol-
lowing year the fashion of the auto-
building world the characteristic
pierce-arrow lamp of three years ago
the arched door of two years ago the
window lights with no frame to obstruct
the field of vision of last year and the
searchlights on the mud-guards today
are but a few of these features which
were so innately appropriate and appeal-
ing and were recognized so promptly
by the motor followers as the hall-mark
of a smartly appointed car that it be-
came necessary for other makers to
use them to prove that their product
belonged in the world of smartly ap-
pointed cars

the reason why the pierce-arrow
car can produce such things is because

-

scribners magazine advertiser
of the ideal that prevails in the factory where the
pierce-arrow car is built

  it wa long ago recognized that no car would ever
reach the topmost position in the estimation of the
motor world unless it developed artistically as well as
mechanically the pierce-arrow is something more   i i i
than a successful machine it is a successful work of	  j

art in the same way that a sargent or a saint gaudens
is a successful work of art the pierce-arrow motor n  
is science  the pierce-arrow body is art-beauty cloth-
ing utility

  natures great masterpiece-man-is made in the same way the

skeleton of a human being is a wonder-
ful machine in it is found an applica-
tion of every principle of mechanics
but wonderful as it is in its utility it is
ugly in its reality nature then clothed
it with flesh with the body which per-
mits of graceful lines-lines suggest-
ing strength poise endurance speed
rest-idealizing the practical skeleton
underneath

  so the pierce-arrow body surrounds
the pierce-arrow engine transmission
clutch-all the necessary ugly but effi-
cient machines that make the car what
it i and this body has not been an
illegitimate descendant from the old
coach builders it has been created out
of its use and its environment created
by artists and every now and then
the artists working upon this body find
the ncccssity for some individual ex-

ing the motor car broad between
the eyes do not set these things
down as being hair-splitting by
just such methods-by the sound
progress of art resting securely
upon utility-all the great things
of the world have been produced
in this spirit the creation of every

sion in the arched door because
the taste of the artist demands

the spirit of service

when the land is storm-swept
when trains are stalled and roads
are blocked the telephone trouble-
hunter with snow shoes and climbers
makes his lonely fight to keep the
wire highways open

  these men can be trusted to face
hardship and danger because they
realize that snow-bound farms homes
and cities mast be kept in touch with
the world

  this same spirit of service animates
the whole bell telephone system the
linemen show it when they carry the
wires across mountains and wilderness
it is found in the girl at the switchboard
who sticks to her post despite fire or
flood it inspires the leaders of the

telephone forces who are finally re-
sponsible to the public for good service

  this spirit of service is found in the
recent rearrangement of the telephone
business to conform with present pub-
lic policy without recourse to courts

  the bell system has grown to be
one of the largest corporations in the
country in response to the telephone
needs of the public and must keep
up with increasing demands

  however large it may become this
corporation will always be responsive
to the needs of the people bccausc it is
animated by the spirit of service it has
shown that men and womenco-operat-
ing for a great purpose may be as good
citizens collectively as individually

ambition for tie better things of his calling who
saves to get a howard

a howard watch ia always worth wliat

                   hthe determination to build
             fireproof should be formed
            with the very first thought of
            s building at all

                no plans should be gone into even
              tentatively that do not contemplate
              construction of

fireproof age-proof damp-proof vermin-proof warmer in winter cooler in summer

all classes of buildings are open to natco fireproof construc-
tion the different forms of natco blocks extend its utility
to the entire structure-floors partitions roofs and walls

natco construction involves essential advantages beside
that of fire safety natco hollow tile never deteriorates in
any degree in any climate no matter what the weather
or how long the building stands with the insulation of its
air chambers it nullifies the effect of outside upon inside
temperature

      the genuine natco hollow tile is always to
      be distinguished from its imitations by the
      trademark natco pressed into every block

romances of modern business

the american romance is in the large office-buildings and the marts of
trade it is the romance of great achievements in commerce in industrial
leadership and it is a wonderful romance the child of the worlds
nations is leading them-arnold bennett

chapter iii

the story of the  varieties

  the big clock boomed the hour of noon
where there had been quiet among the dili-
gent workers there now broke a wave of con-
versation the doors were flung open and
into the green courtyard passed the hundreds
of employees in playful mood

  they made a gladsome picture-these vig-
orous men and women with their buoyancy
and apparent content with their lot seeking
to make the most of their midday recreation
with laughter and healthful exercise a visitor
to the plant with his host turned to take in
the view and then above beheld another
sight that compelled interest

  at a window on the second floor of one of
the main buildings stood a man looking upon
the scene in the courtyard with a benevolent
smile he was an elderly man with a face
subtly merging the qualities of power and ten-
derness intently he watched the employees
at play  whose is the  face at the window  
was asked

  that replied the host is mr h j
heinz the founder of the company

  during the forenoon there had been un-
folded to the visitor the history of the house
of heinz-for that is the scene and subject
of this story-and in it the founder of this sig-
nificant industry stood out an heroic figure
a truly romantic story it was blending the
elements of sentiment and the dramatic action
of big achievements the deft hand of arnold
bennett could make of it a romance worthy of
the name

  the man who stood at the window controls
an industry that has a main plant at pittsburgh

occupying one hundred and sixty city lots and
fourteen branch factories in different parts of
the united states with others in canada eng-
land and spain he employs over five thou-
sand hands in his factories alone and distrib-
utes his products through his own agencies and
branch houses in all the principal nations of the
world

  forty-five years ago this same man began
preparing and selling food products but under
very different conditions a small room in a
house at sharpsburg pennsylvania and an ad-
joining garden of about half an acre were the
setting for the first scene of the industrial
spectacle of the house of heinz here
mr heinz began his business career by raising
horseradish and in the single room he put it
up for the local trade

  consider this mighty transition to the
accomplishment of it there must have been
brought some force besides the fineness of the
products and the integrity of the business
management

  mr m s achenbach advertising manager
for the h j heinz company named the third
of the trinity of supports of the heinz strong-
hold when he said the success of the heinz
company has been in no uncertain degree made
possible by the character and extent of the
companys advertising

  it will be remembered that the vital adver-
tising campaign which early established the
 varieties in the public mind was carried
on in the periodicals of national circulation

  the little room and plot of garden at sharps-
burg yielded an inspiration but this small

this is the third of a series t article- that is being published to show how
magazine advertising is serving the public



scribners magazine advertiser
the story of the  varieties

foundation could not long serve the purposes
of a man with the will to build a large struc-
ture mr hein expanded his operations to
fruits and vegetables soon he had established
such a lucrative local trade that he decided
the scope of sharpsburg was too limited for
his enterprise so in the early seventies the
heinz plant was moved to pittsburgh

   here again the words of mr achenbach are
pertinent the local success after the estab-
lishment of the plant in pittsburgh was great
he said the heinz products found a ready
market and a continuing demand but it did
not take the young manufacturer long to dis-
cover that no matter how superior his product
might be unless he spread the knowledge of
that goodness to a wider territory he should
always remain a local manufacturer so he
began to advertise

  the founder of the house of heinz had
an ambition to create a world-wide demand
for his products in those early days before
the efficacy of high-powered advertising had
been demonstrated this was regarded as a
dream but the heinz dream has reached a
dramatic fulfilment

  all this was accomplished by a broadly
gauged advertising appeal the foundation
was laid through the weekly and monthly
periodicals of national circulation later the
firm used practically every kind of medium that
would make for universality of advertising
the response lifted the heinz company from
a local pittsburgh concern to an industry of
international proportions

   the heinz company believed in the persis-
tency of advertising and this with the orig-
inality of the companys advertising ideas has
had a telling effect who is there not familiar
with the small green-pickle trade-mark or the
sign of the  varieties

  the green-pickle trade-mark was adopted
soon after mr heinz began advertising in the
magazines later he saw the psychological ap-
pealof apopularcatch-phrase none that came
to his attention seemed just what he wanted
until he noticed a sign in a new york shoe-
dealers window it read twenty styles

   why thought he can i not advertise the
number of my products he drew out a
memorandum-book and counted the items in
the list of foods manufactured by him there

were fifty-seven how can i word this
he mused styles will not do for a food term
 kinds does not sound right fifty-seven fifty-
seven-varieties the thought came to him
in a lash and so the term   varieties
was started on its history-making career in the
food world

  mr achenbach has some interesting things
to say about the heinz advertising ideals
hear him further the business of the h j
heinz company is an example of the possibili-
ties of modern commercial evolution it is
simply the logical result of fitting an idea to
public demand and sticking conscientiously to
its purpose of fulfilment

  through the national magazines we have
commanded a national business this after-
ward was supplemented by the results from
other media of advertising the heinz com-
pany feels that the magazines have been a
force in developing a demand for and a confi-
dence in heinz products the ethical stand-
ards of the magazines with regard to their ad-
vertising are in harmony with our own ideals
and have assisted us materially in creating the
public confidence that we now enjoy

  a great industrial success such as that of the
h j heinz company is another vivid illustra-
tion of the power of the magazines in working
hand-in-hand with an industry in its develop-
ment a product is advertised in a standard
magazine that message from the manufac-
turer penetrates every section of the country
carrying with it the accepted suggestion that
the product advertised must be right or it
would not be represented in the magazine
such is the present-day view of magazine
advertising

  there is another phase of the mission of the
periodical advertisement of equal importance
with its ethical and commercial values that
is its accomplishments in the field of public
service the one instance of the heinz com-
pany is eloquent of this the creating of a
demand for heinz products has set new food
standards has given employment to thou-
sands of people has made a market for the
products of some thirty thousand acres of land
has conserved the food supply and has relieved
the housewives of the world of many cares
many the woman that has blessed heinz when
an unexpected guest arrived

beauty in piano tone

   tone beauty in the piano is the indefinable quality that appeals to the emotions refresh-
ing and awakening them to new life

   it imparts the rich coloring and the dainty shadings to the score bringing out in ti ue
proportion the intent and mood of the composer

   tone beauty is one of the distinguishing traits of the melville clark piano sensuous-
ness virility brilliancy bell-like clearness richness and dynamic power are its notable
characteristics

   added to this is beauty in finish beauty in case design sensitiveness to the touch and
durability in construction-all prime requisites in the artistic piano

        these qualities have given the melville clark
        piano a singular prestige and it is justly re-
        garded as one of the best pianos in the country

     overlooked side of the many-sided ivory they know ivorys thoroughness asa cleanser

the mildness and purity of ivory soap are so evident and of such advantage that
many of us who use it because of these qualities are apt to forget that ivory is first of
all a wonderfully efficient remover of dirt

but the facts are these the extreme purity and high quality of ivory soap give it
great detergent or cleansing power it may not work as quickly as cleansers containing
alkali or grit but it works so thoroughly that it produces not ordinary cleanness but

aseptic cleanness

no matter how badly soiled the skin may be when it is cleansed with ivory soap a
man feels clean looks clean is clean in the strictest sense of the word and he
experiences none of the painful sensations which accompany the use of cleansers that
rely upon harsh ingredients to do their work
