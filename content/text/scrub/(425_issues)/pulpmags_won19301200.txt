  life on other planets

              by hugo gernsback

	the average science-fiction
author it is a foregone conclu-
sion that life on other planets
will be found similar to what
we have on earth writers
talk about human beings
found on the planets mars or
venus and these are usually assumed to be
constituted the same as our own race

  modern science scoffs at such notions be-
cause the chances are less than one in a mil-
lion for finding a type even remotely resemb-
ling the human race on any of the plants that
could harbor life there is little doubt that
practically none of the planets with the ex-
ception of venus and mars are able to sujt-
port human life as we know it of the inner
planets only venus has conditions analogous
to those on earth while mercury is certainly
iar too hot to support human life

  mars being a smaller body than the earth
and not much larger than our moon presum-
ably cooled down millions of years before the
earth hence the prevailing notion of science-
fiction writers is that the intelligence of
martians if there be any must be far in ad-
vance of that of earthlings while life on
venus which has not as yet cooled down and
has an almost impenetrable atmosphere is
probably still in the dinosaur stage

  immediately the thought confronts us if
mars is a logical abode for human life and
is so far in advance of the earth then why
have those human beings not made their
presence known to us before

  furthermore science today concedes that
interplanetary travel will probably come
about during the next hundred years if
terrestrial beings therefore can make a trip
to the moon or to mars it seems absurd to
believe that the supposed martians with a
civilization millions of years in advance of
hunvan beings should not have done likewise
during their evolution if we are so far be-
hind in the scale of evolution as compared to
the martians it would be more than pre-
sumptuous to believe that we can steal a
march on the

  logically then something is wrong with
our reasoning however a solution probably
is not so difficult to find and while every-
thing in connection with this analysis must
be based on pure guesswork one of the
thoughts given below may contain the correct
answer

  if mars cooled down millions f years ago
and evolved intelligent life such as we know
it at that time it is almost certain in that
case that the martians constructed space-
fliers and visited the different planets
they could not then make a landing on
earth for the simple reason that it proba-
bly had not cooled down or else it was in such
a state of development that it could not sup-
port martian life the same would be the
case with all of the other planets that they
visited so the chances are that the mar-
tians had to return regretfully to their own
planet and remain there until the race died
out in this case any future earth trav-
elers to mars will find the remains of pre-
historic martian civilization

  on the other hand mars may contain in-
telligent life today but not as we know it
it may perhaps take the form of insect life
and it is not even impossible that a race of
insects similar to our termites or ants who
can reason as well as we can may have
developed if the race is blind as are ter-
mites of course they could not know about
other planets and would therefore make no
attempt to visit us all of this is possible
it would also support the theories of the
martian canals such martians may have
high intelligence yet an intelligence that
could not conceive a space-flier

  third and last evolution on mars might
have taken an entirely different line of devel-
opment than on earth and it is not at all
necessary that intelligent life should have
developed on the planet in this case also
such life could not conceive of travelling to
other worlds

  any one of the three guesses may be right
and somewhere in between them we probably
have the eerrect solution


the outpost
   on the moon

illuslraled by paul

they believed themselves alone on the desolate moon
but then the ray of the outpost flashed its
deadly challenge from the skies

opening in the line of closely-packed car
presented itself

   the falling darkness brought with it a
light rain which rendered the highways in-
creasingly slippery and as the approach-
ing cars turned on their headlights one by
one the driving became very difficult the
pace i was taking was the height of folly
but i was cold to the marrow and reason
was swept aside in my hurry to reach the
warmth which awaited i rushed heedless-
ly past a sign which read sharp curve
and swung over to the left-hand side of the
road in order to pass the car ahead of me
too late i saw the coupe roundiiig the curve



it was late on a sunday afternoon in early
spring impelled by a feeling of rest-
less loneliness i had taken my little second-
hand roadster for a drive wandering at ran-
dom over the highways far from the city
the day had been deceivingly mild and i
had left my overcoat at home now the
lowering sun and a chilling breeze forced me
to head for my little third-floor room in the
heart of the great metropolis the numb-
ness of my fingers and toes influenced me
to discard the caution that crowded roads
and hurrying cars require my foot rested
more and more heavily on the accelerator
until i was passing the traffic wherever an
by joslyn
   maxwell

fascinated i watched the machine climb into the pitiless sky
langley muttered twenty men and one fool pilot

toward me  could not drop back into
line there was not time to pass the car
ahead i must leave the road or crash in-
stantly i chose the former alternative swung
my wheel hard to the left and jammed on
my brakes there was a moment of jarring
over rough earth a violent shock and i was
lying on the seat behind the twisted steering
wheel

  it was one of those freak wrecks the car
was completely demolished yet i had es-
caped without a scratch i found myself
unable to get out of the machine which had
hit a telephone pole and was so bent out of
shape as to be almost unrecognizable pieces
of glass lay all about me yet not one had
touched my skin in fact the only injury
i could discover outside of a severe shaking-
up was a slight bruise on my left elbow

  while i was debating the best method of
escape i heard voices close to the car and
presently a head appeared through an open-
ing in the wreckage of the top

  are you alive the owner of the head
asked excitedly and a bit timidly

    quite all right thanks but i cant get
  out i replied the head disappeared and
  i heard a murmur of voices people passing
  the news along to the constantly growing
  crowd-hes all right-nobodys hurt 
  presently the man who had first spoken re-
  appeared with a fence rail which he used
  as a crow-bar prying open a hole large
  enough for me to get through albeit with
  some damage to my clothes

    i found myself in the midst of a circle of
  curious passers-by most of whom to judge
  by their expressions thought that i had got
  no more than i deserved perhaps they were
  right but i hoped that at least one of them
  would forget his prejudice to the extent of
  offering me a ride back to the city it was
  in thus looking over the crowd that my
  glance fell on a familiar figure i recog-
  nized him almost immediately as barton
  wiley a prominent physicist who during
  my attendance at the city college had been
  a young instructor that institution had
  now grown to the proportions of a good-
  sized university though still retaining its




wonder stories

original name and with its rise wiley had
attained considerable fame through his ex-
periments in electricity he was now pro-
fessor of physics after thanking the man
who had liberated me  spoke to him

  do you remember me professor wiley
george marland- was a graduate student
at the city college nine years ago

  yes indeed mar-
land he replied so
it was you appar-
ently the laws of man
do not appeal to you
as much as those of
nature he laughed

may i give you a ride
back to town i see
you were in a bit of a
hurry to get there

he indicated with a
wave of his hand one
of the autos parked
alongside the road and
noting gratefully that
it was a closed car i
accepted

  we climbed in and
he headed the car for
the city on passing
through a nearby vil-
lage i made arrange-
ments with the local
garage-owner to col-
lect such of my car as
was worth salvaging
and dispose of it to a
junkdealer for what
it would bring

  as we proceeded to-
ward the city there
was little conversation
between us the profes-
sor being intent on
watching the road and
i had an opportunity
to reflect on my acquaintance with him in
the past during my graduate work i had
come in contact with him often and a
friendship had grown up between us he
had urged me to accept a position as in-
structor at the college but i had preferred
to try my luck in the commercial world

 he had remained to watch the growth of the
 college and after an unsuccessful attempt
 to find work in the laboratory of some large
 corporation i had drifted into the news-
 paper business

   my chief success in that line had been the
                      writing of near-scientific articles for the
                      sunday supplements but i had wearied of
                      the job and tried mv
                      hand at one thing and
                      another the interven-
                      ing nintt years had
                      passed quickly and
                      found me no nearer
                      to fame and fortune
                      than when i had grad-
                      uated perhaps if i
                      had followed his ad-
                      vice i should now be
                      in a position compar-
                      able to his own he
                      was highly regarded in
                      scientific circles for
                      his research work in
                      the field of electricity
                      and had made less
                      known though per-
                      haps even more start-
                      ling discoveries re-
                      garding the structure
                      of the atom of his
                      methods i knew little
                      but his results had
                      often been published

                       he had succeeded in
 repeating the experi-
 ments of rutherford
 in which atoms of ni-
 trogen were broken
 down into helium and
 hydrogen and it was
 rumored that he was
 working on the ever-
 fascinating problem of
 getting energy out of
 atoms i welcomed an opportunity to talk
 over some of these matters with him as pre-
 sented by our present accidental meeting

 as though my thoughts had suggested
 themselves to him the professor turn-
 ed to me

 j ne of the greatest ar- v
  i guments in favor of in-
  terplanetary travel comes
  from the lack of ability of
  our scientists to conduct
  complete studies of the
  heavens from the earth
  the same blanket of at-
  mosphere that protects us
  from the cold of outer
  space and deadly rays also
  serves as a blanket against
  our telescopes and other in-
  struments of observation

    what scientists would
  consider as ideal would be
  a place of observation with
  no air or dust whatever
  separating them from the
  heavens then the sciences
  of astronomy and physics
  would get a real impetus
  from the discoveries that
  would follow

    an outpost on the moon
  would do all these things
  and if the earth were men-
  aced by an unknown yet
  terrible danger from space
  such an outpost would be
  not only a plaything of
  science but a vital necessi-
  ty to our race mr max-
  well develops this theme in
  an exciting story of adven-
  ture and mystery that
  i will take us to the furthest 
  limits of the solar system
the outpost on the moon



  how about having dinner with me he
asked why not spend the evening you
must have had some experiences during the
years since you left the college that would
interest a man like myself who never gets
out of the laboratory except to teach
classes

  i told him that i would be delighted but
that i was much more anxious to hear more
of his work than to talk of my own fruit-
less efforts

  accordingly we dined at a neat little res-
taurant close to the city college near which
he maintained his residence our conver-
sation ran to pleasantries and topics of
current public interest by common consent
we deferred deeper sub-
jects until we had finish-
ed the meal

  when we reached the
professors comfortable
little apartment and had
lighted cigarettes and set-
tled ourselves comfort-
ably i again broached
the subject of his work

he said nothing for a
moment apparently lost
in reflection

  he looked much the
same as when i had seen
him conducting classes
a tall man of rather
slight build with regular
features too large to be
called handsome his
hair now graying slightly was as always
perfectly combed and in spite of hie shell-
rimmed spectacles and slight stoop his ap-
pearance suggested rather the distinguished
man of leisure than the scholar

  i was startled out of my contemplations
by his voice mild and slow yet with great
carrying power

  i understand marland that you are con-
nected with a news agency and if i remem-
ber rightly you have been the author of a
number of articles purporting to describe
the discoveries of research workers

  i nodded assent

  he continued in that case i should
ordinarily have nothing to say but since

i take it that your question has been
prompted more by a personal interest than
by a desire for news and provided that
you give me your word that you will pub-
lish nothing i may tell you without my
express permission i shall be glad to talk
over some of my experiments with you

  i assured him that whatever he said
would be held as strictly confidential and
that my interest was purely that of a student
of science in the work of a successful re-
searcher he smiled

  i can hardly be called successful he
said for the most part i have merely
done what others have done before me
there was considerable comment in scien-
tific journals i believe
over my attempts to
change the structure of
the nitrogen atom which
were in part successful
as you doubtless recall
the atom consists of a
number of charges of pos-
itive and negative elec-
trcity these normally
neutralize each other but
occasionally a change in
the number of negative
charges or electrons as
they are called takes
place in the outer limits
of the atom one or more
electrons may be picked
up or lost and the atom
becomes an ion this is
of course familiar to you but i am merely
restating it in order that you may be pre-
pared for what  am about to say

  with the single exception of experiments
like those  have recently performed no
one has been able to redistribute the pro-
tons or positive charges of course in the
very heavy metals such as uranium radium
and the whole class of radioactive elements
this goes on spontaneously the nuclei of
helium atoms being liberated in the form of
alpha-ray and electrons in the beta-rays
but to do it artificially to any of the other
elements or to even speed up the spontan-
eous processes of radioactivity is at present
impossible

  j nodded leaning forward interestedly
even were this accomplished it would
not necessarily result in the liberation of
energy that is not the end to which my
efforts have been directed contrary to cer-
tain reports the aim of the modern al-
chemist-that of transmuting one element
into another such as mercury into gold-
has been my field as i say i have as yet
been unsuccessful

  but let us suppose that one could at his
desire separate the protons and electrons
of an atom and recombine them it would
be possible for such a person to make at
will any element or chemical compound he
wished from any other or perhaps to cre-
ate a substance as yet unknown to us-a
metal whose atomic weight was greater than
that of uranium for example such an
element would probably be highly radio-
active if we may judge from the behavior
of those radioactive substances already
known

  you mean i asked that it would be
possible in that manner to liberate the lat-
ent energy of the atom

  no he returned that is not what i
had in mind but a substance so unbalanced
in structure might easily be a storage bat-
tery so to speak of vast quantities of ener-
gy which could be built up slowly and liber-
ated quickly

less than nothing

he was silent for a moment and i took
the opportunity to ask what of your
experiments in electricity

  that has been more of a hobby with me
than a subject of real research he replied
the two fields are closely related how-
ever we know that electric charges are
merely unbalanced proportions of electrons
and protons and that an electric current is
nothing more than a stream of moving
electrons again he paused for a moment
looking at me intently

  marland he said if i remember right-
ly you once remarked on the similarity of
the behavior of astronomical bodies to that
of electric charges of opposite sign and
asked whether it might not be possible to

discover some sort of negative gravity
which would repel and be repelled by mat-
ter as we know it i answered you i believe
by saying that the resemblance was merely
superficial and to prove my point i called
your attention to the fact that when two
charged bodies approach one another there
is a redistribution of the electrons which
repel each other and consequently are driven
to the far sides of their respective bodies
while no such redistribution takes place
when two bodies are placed each within the
gravitational field of the other since our
discussion einstein has brought out his
theory on the interchangeability of gravity
and electricity and i have found in the
laboratory definite corroboration of his
views

  he stopped but i remained silent know
ing that he had not yet finished presently
he resumed we believe that an atom-
say of hydrogen since its the simplest of all
-consists of a positive charge at the center
and a moving negative charge weve as-
signed a pretty definite size and weight to
the negative charge-the electron but the
hydrogen atom weighs nearly two thousand
times as much as this electron so we say
that the difference must be in the proton
and to make it agree with our theories we
say it has the same charge as the electron
but is much smaller i know it sounds
rather contradictory to say that the smaller
body has the greater weight but thats all
covered in the electromagnetic theory of
mass some of which has been developed
ince your time

  i fell to speculating on what would hap-
pen if the negative charge could be made
smaller and therefore heavier or the proton
larger and lighter i devised some exper-
iments along that line and with rather
startling results i assure you for when i
succeeded in exchanging the weight of the
proton and the electron i found that i had
actually created a negative element-one
which weighed less than nothing contin-
uing along this line i made another cur-
ious discovery-that when a proton and an
electron of the same weight are combined
their weight disappears ehiirely though
not their inertia and furthermore they
the outpost on the moon



absorb the force of gravity so that matter
made up of these charges which i have
called equi-protons and equi-electrons
weighs nothing and is a perfect insulator
against gravity

  like cavorite i exclaimed h g
wells famous story the first man in the
moon flashed into my mind here was
the very sort of thing that had enabled his
heroes to make their voyage to our satel-
lite why shouldnt his dream become a
reality

  no not cavorite professor wileys
amused face brought me back to earth with
a flush wells imaginary compound if
you will remember was made into shutters
fastened on the outside of his glass space-
car but unfortunately you cant make a
gas into shutters and that is what i have
been experimenting with-hydrogen gas

  i experience a feeling of bitter disappoint-
ment stories of trips through interplane-
tary space independent of the attraction of
the heavenly bodies as well as that of the
earth had always excited my imagination
and in the brief flight of fancy which i had
just experienced i had hoped to actually
witness the accomplishment of this dream

  at length my thoughts returned to wileys
remarks  was curious to know something
of the method by which he accomplished this
wonderful thing the explanation which he
gave i shall not reproduce in detail for
many reasons primarily because the pro-
cess is not protected by patent and also be-
cause the mathematics involved would be
meaningless to the average reader let it
suffice then that the procedure consisted
in passing hydrogen ions through electric
and magnetic fields of such intensity as had
not been produced anywhere else on earth
and that in the end the dimensions of the
proton wrere expanded to those of the elec-
tron then their charges being equal and
opposite the respective weights became like-
wise wiley offered no explanation of the
absorption of the force of gravity he con-
fessed frankly that it was beyond his ability
to explain at present

when he had finished speaking i
asked him whether he had tried thd
process on any substance other than hydro-
gen-ions he replied that he didnt believe
it would work with any others but that he
intended experimenting with helium shortly

  you see he explained there are elec-
trons and protons bound together in the
nucleus of the atom and you cant very
well affect one without affecting the others
however he said he proposed to run the
test on a number of common elements in-
cluding some of the lighter solids in re-
sponse to my eager questions he admitted
that should one of these last behave in the
same manner as hydrogen he would indeed
have a substance similar to cavorite

  but said wiley if it should turn out
id have to keep it dark else some idiot
would want to start right off on a trip to
mars of course no one with sense enough
to know the danger would think of it and
it would take a man who realizes the danger
and who understands astronomy to carry it
through successfully yet theres always
some fool ready to try it hed undoubted-
ly be lost thereby giving the hopes of those
who might be competent a severe setback
not necessarily i exclaimed why
id be glad to undertake the trip ive stud-
ied astronomy enough to plot my course
you exclaimed wiley

  and why not i demanded after all
ive been enough of a failure at everything
else to deserve a chance at success in this
and ive no connections no property-noth-
ing at all to tie me here to the earth
wiley regarded me steadily for perhaps a
minute before speaking

  well he said at length weve let our
fancies run away with us since the success
of the vital element hasnt been tested yet
our gravitation-screen is merely an idea so
far this was obviously intended to dis-
courage me and divert my attention from the
question of a trans-ethereal flight his next
words however assured me that he expected
success

  if i were you he said i should let the
matter drop in lime it will be accomp-
lished but one is foolhardy to anticipate
developments the first aviator didnt set
wonder stories

off for paris he left that to a man better
trained and with the equipment and exper-
ience developed through a quarter of a cen-
tury

  true enough i answered the wright
brothers didnt set off for paris but they
flew as far as they could a flight to mars
would perhaps be too much at present but
why not a trip to the moon-only a two-
hundredth part of the distance

  what would be the object of that ask-
ed wiley

  what was the object of the wrights in
flying their few miles i retorted to
show the world that it could be done and
to encourage others to try it

  perhaps youre right he said slowly
but i must have your promise to say ab-
solutely nothing of what we have discussed
toriight

  -given-on condition that you keep me
informed of your progress in your experi-
ments i replied

  we agreed and i departed exultantly for
i knew from his manner that he would be
successful if he made the attempt to produce
the gravity-resisting solid and i knew also
that he would never allow the opportunity
for such a discovery to escape him

  but my thoughts were turned away from
wiley and his experiments in an unforeseen
manner when  reached my residence i
found a call from the chief of my news bur-
eau there were reports that china had
declared war on russia the washington
office was short-handed and i was ordered
to catch the first train there to cover devel-
opments i hastily packed a suitcase caught
the midnight train and reported for duty
shortly before nine the next morning

  during the next two weeks i found plenty
to occupy my mind i was new at the task
of reporting political news consequently i
spent hours where more experienced men
would have taken minutes searching in vain
through the dark halls and airy rooms of
the big state war and navy building for
someone with both authority and inclination
to speak attending conferences at the white
house in company with a dozen or more
representatives of rival press agencies or
waiting in the ante-room of the state depart-

ments press bureau for a mimeographed
handout radioed from the consul general
at shanghai

  news is no respecter of the clock and
coming as it did from the other side of the
world it happened as often as not that the
most important developments were reported
to the national capital in the small hours of
the morning time and again my slumber
was broken by phone calls from the inde-
fatigable chief of the press bureau inform-
ing me that a statement was being prepared

  it was after such a night spent in trying
to beat rival reporters to the wire that i
returned to my room and found a letter
bearing wileys name above the return ad-
dress i tore it open and read it at a
glance

   dear marland

      after trying unsuccessfully several
    times to reach you by phone i was in-
    formed by your office that you were in
    washington covering the russo-chinese
    outbreak and were apt to be there for
    some time i had hoped to see you soon
    but i trust you will communicate with
    me immediately upon your return

      referring to our conversation of the
    other night if you will come to my labor-
    atory at your earliest convenience i may
    be able to show you something of inter-
    est

                      cordially

barton wiley

he had succeeded

chapter ii

success

wileys letter filled me with an im-
mense impatience to see him at once
a leave of absence from my duties at this
time was out of the question the only re-
maining alternative was to resign i gave
notice and waited with what patience i
could muster until a man had been found to
fill my place meanwhile notifying wiley
of my intentions

  upon being relieved from duty i caught
the first train and hastened to the labora-
tories of the city college i found my
friend making preparations for another of
his innumerable experiments but on seeing
me he dropped everything and dismissing
his assistant led me to a corner of the room
the outpost on the moon



where there lay a heavy box apparently
fastened firmly to the floor i could feel
a strong draft of air rising about it and as
he unlocked it the lid flew back apparently
of its own volition observing my surprise
wiley explained these phenomena

  as you probably surmised he said i
have been successful i have in this box a
plate which is perfectly impervious to the
force of gravity nothing above it has any
weight hence the vertical air-current and
the lightness of the lid

  he reached into the box and brought out
what appeared to be a square of blackness
and laid it on the table do not misunder-
stand me it did not in the least resemble a
piece of black wood or metal there was no
reflected gloss no appearance of solidity
it was as though i was looking into a bot-
tomless hole in the laboratory table and
the effect was heightened by the strong up-
ward draft i commented on this and
again wiley satisfied my curiosity with a
simple explanation

  the color of this substance differs from
what we ordinarily refer to as black in
that it absorbs practically all of the light
which strikes it he said ordinarily
black paint reflects enough light to make it
visible but the human eye is unable to de-
tect any reflection from this there is no
visible surface and therefore nothing from
which to judge its location the effect is
the same as that of looking into an unlighted
hole

  i was struck by another thought if the
air above it has no weight i said wont
ii escape into space

  i hardly think so he answered this
plate is six inches square and removes the
influence of gravity from a column that
large directly over it  however as the air
arises it expands equally in all directions
and the greater part by far is forced out
over the ground again there are probably
strong currents high in the atmosphere
which blow the rising air out of line with
this gravity-resister then too think what
an infinitesimal portion of the globe it cov-
ers all the rest is free to attract the air
after it gets a little way up

  one more question i said why
doesnt the plate itself fly upward

  i took the precaution to cement it to a
sheet of iron on the under side said wiley

  for a few moments he demonstrated the
peculiar properties of his discovery hold-
ing objects above it and allowing them to
rise until stopped by the ceiling where they
remained until he slid the black plate from
beneath them or juggling them up and
down by passing it back and forth allow-
ing the force of gravity to act intermittently
at length he returned the plate to its box
pushed down the lid and fastened it then
he faced me

  marland he said gravely think of the
possibilities of this discovery as applied to
aviation he paused to let his words take
effect then he continued suppose an air-
plane were equipped with enough of this
material to make its weight practically noth-
ing the wings could be reduced to a size
sufficient to direct its flight upward or down-
ward such as the ailerons at present em-
ployed the air resistance would be cut
down enormously and the motive power
could be increased almost indefinitely since
the weight of the engine would cut no fig-
ure think of the great air liners it will be
possible to build ships carrying thou-
sands of passengers tons of freight around
the world-anywhere

  it was a glowing picture he painted car-
ried away by his own thoughts he enlarged
on the idea

  a plane could rise high into the thin at-
mosphere many mies above the earth and
there attain such a speed as would carry it
across the pacific in a few hours

  these words brought forward again the
idea which had lingered in my mind since
our previous talk

  whats to prevent such a plane heading
straight up and flying off through space to
the moon i asked wileys face became
grave and he considered for some time be-
fore answering

  nothing he said at length i could
depend on you to think of that again with
a smile but there are a few practical
objections to the idea suppose you did
head straight up and leave the earth how


wonder stories

would you steer so that you would land on
the moon

  a matter of starting in the right direc-
tion i replied after leaving the atmos-
phere the plane would continue in a straight
line until stopped by some other force
such as collision with the surface of the
moon asked wiley

  exactly i replied though the contact
should not be violent enough to cause a
wreck

  and to avoid a wreck you must either
slow down before landing or start at a
low enough speed so that a direct collision
would not injure the plane i am not an
astronomer but i do know that the moons
atmosphere if any is so thin as to go un-
detected by any means known yet too thin
to slow down in at any rate if you adopt
the other alternative-start at a speed of
say five miles an hour-how long would it
take you to make the journey

  about  hours that is  days
or roughly five and a half years i said
calculating mentally

   ather a tedious journey com-
at- mented wiley and when you had
landed how would you return with no at-
mosphere to start in he smiled better
stick to the earth marland and leave your
interstellar voyages to the future

  but we havent exhausted the possibil-
ities yet i protested there are other
means of motive power than a gasoline en-
gine and screw-propeller for instance
suppose the plane were built like a rocket
with discharging explosives to drive it it
would be possible to start and stop in a
vacuum then

  perhaps so agreed wiley it would
require a considerable amount of gunpow-
der to give you much initial velocity though
and the same amount to stop then to go
back you would require still more

  only half as much as you think i re-
plied to start off it would only be

newtons third law of motion states to
every action there is an equal and contrary
reaction or the two actions are equal and
opposite the small mass and great velocity
of the discharged explosive are equal to the
larger mass and smaller velocity of the rocket

necessary to interpose the gravity-screen be-
tween the earth and yourself the centrifugal
force of the earths rotation would do the
rest at the equator you could start off
with a velocity of a thousand miles an hour
and less as you liked from a higher lati-
tude returning with the same velocity
you need only turn the gravity screen tow-
ard the earth and the atmosphere would
soon stop you the discharge would be
necessary only on the moon

  right again said wiley you know
marland youre beginning to convince me
of the practicability of this idea of yours
the other factors are not insurmountable
light heat air and food theyve been
worked out by submarine builders he
arose and paced the floor nervously then
faced me

  do you really mean youd care to try
try it he demanded

  wiley i said thered be no better
man for the job ive been a failure so
far ive nobody to care what becomes of
me if i shouldnt come back and it would
be a great help to science if i succeed ill
start the instant you give your consent
he shook his head doubtfully

  i couldnt let the credit go to someone
outside the college he said my hopes
fell as he continued after all i made
the trip possible and i ought to take charge
of it he regarded me quizzically but
fi i need an assistant who knows astronomy
i can make a job for you in the physics
department cosmic research shall we
call it youd have to teach a couple of
classes what do you say

  accepted i exclaimed i could ask
nothing better when do we start

  we start if ever when i have convinced
the trustees of the college of the advisab-
ility of financing us was the reply we
cant build our machine on knowledge and
hopes but your first duties will be to
make complete specifications for the mach-
ine and a map of our course i havent
the time and your knowledge of astrono-
my is much better than mine ill leave
it to you

  wiley had put it up to me squarely to
get the plan into presentable form and i
the outpost on the moon



resolved to do my utmost the first prob-
lem was to determine the course we must
take in order to reach the moon to the
layman it might appear to be a simple mat-
ter of waiting until our satellite was di-
rectly overhead and starting off leaving
fhe rest to gravitation but such a course
would probably have ended in our being
 educed to gaseous elements in the sun
or freezing and starvation as we drifted
lurlher and further away from the solar
system

  the centrifugal force which would set us
lree would send us in a direction tangent
to the earths surface to an observer be-
neath us at the moment of our departure
we would appear to rise nearly vertically
for a time drifting more and more to the
west and if he were to follow us with a
telescope we would disappear below the
western horizon or set as does the sun
twenty-four hours after our departure he
would find us almost due east of himself
several thousand miles away

  supposing that we started from our own
latitudes our initial velocity would be ap-
proximately seven hundred miles per hour
our course would be bent slightly upwards
-that is away from the earths surface-
by the buoyant force of the atmosphere on
our weightless car but oncefree of the air
our course would be a straight line my
problem then was to determine our ulti-
mate direction and time our departure so
that we would meet the moon at whatever
point on its orbit we might choose the
journey would require a little over four-
teen days

patient plans

i next turned my mind to the design of
the car in which we would travel the
first consideration was its shape the gra-
itv screen was difficult and expensive to
make so that the smallest surface possible
desirable this of course suggested
a here with its surface covered by the
gra it -opaque substance it was necessary
t remove the screen at times in order to
land heoce the screen was to be divided in-

to hemispheres one of which could be slip-
ped above the other

  a second requisite was that the hull of
the car must be strong enough to withstand
the shock of the innumerable tiny meteor-
ites which fall with great velocity near the
earth and are destroyed by the atmosphere
but which would strike our craft when free
of the protecting air high-grade armor
steel seemed suitable

  next we must have a means of swinging
the moving half of the gravity screen from
beneath us such as an electric motor and
we must have light and heat storage bat-
teries seemed desirable as a source of ener-
gy as their weight was no objection then
there must be a means of keeping the air
in the car breathable this could be ac-
complished by driving the stale air through
limewater and heating potassium chlorate
to liberate its oxygen from combination

  then there must be the means of stop-
ping by storing hydrogen and oxygen at
high pressure and burning them in the right
proportions steam under tremendous pres-
sure would be generated and this directed
as desired by nozzles would stop the car
by the recoil of its departure i deter-
mined on hydrogen and oxygen as an ex-
plosive mixture because of the convenience
of storing large quantities and ihe rela-
tively great energy of their combustion
last of all there was the matter of storing
sufficient food and water to last us during
the trip in addition to the four weeks in
making the journey we would spend some
time in exploring the surface of the moon
and the return

  i had entered on my duties as assistant
instructor which consisted of taking charge
of a few laboratory and recitation classes
each week the remainder of my time was
spent in the physics laboratories sur-
rounded by drawing instruments reference
books and reams of paper with calculations
drawing up plans and specifications map-
ping our course and compiling data to pre-
sent to the board of trustees during sev-
eral weeks i scarcely ate or slept and when
at length the task was finished i showed
the results of my work to wiley with con-
siderable satisfaction


wonder stories

  in their final form the plans called for
a steel shell twenty-five feel in diameter
which was to be lined with asbestos in-
side this was to be a second shell with the
space between the two allotted to the stor-
age of the hydrogen and oxygen the in-
ner shell was also to be lined with asbes-
tos and have fastened to it i he storage
batteries and tanks of water compressed
air and purifying chemicals next inside
these were to be cupboards fur storing
food and such equipment as we took along

  all this occupied a considerable portion
of the interior of the shell leaving us but
a small space in which to live but with the
idea of economy i had purposely made the
machine as small as possible i had in-
cluded in my plans a sort of diving ap-
paratus with which to leave the car through
an air-lock which provided the only means
of entrance and exit in the outer door of
the air-lock was the one glass window or
port-hole i had allowed more than this
 had not deemed advisable because of the
possibility of their being broken by met-
eorites it could be covered with a steel
cap and need be exposed only for the time
necessary to make observations the inner
door of the air-lock could be left open
when the port-hole was in use

  wiley went over my drawings carefully
reading the specifications and estimates

  you certainly seem to have considered
everything he remarked i see youre
quite an astronomer your explanation of
our course would be clear to anyone
these data will help me to put the proposi-
tion up to the trustees in a convincing
manner he put the sheaf of papers and
drawings in his desk adding from now
on its up to me to put it across ive been
talking to the head of the physics depart-
ment dr willson and hell back us
heftner cant see it at all but you know
how these old-time astronomers are he
predicts that well land on the sun if we
ever leave the earth and hes refused lo give
us any help in the matter but we dont
need him as radner has agreed to check
your calculations if necessary and give us
any information we want regarding the posi-
tion of the planets

  theyre allowed for i replied though
id be glad to have him go over my fig-
ures but do you think its a good idea
to talk about this plan to so many people
dont you think it would be better to keep
it a secret at least until were reasonably
sure of success

  i havent mentioned it to anyone outside
the faculty replied wiley and i meant
to caution you not to by all means we
must keep it dark too many men have
become the laughing stock of the world
over their fruitless attempts to plan to do
what we plan and publicity would only
bring ridicule

  during the ensuing days i waited with
considerable impatience for the meeting of
the board of trustees i devised in my
mind a thousand plans for financing our
trip independently should the board turn
us down mentally resorting even to specu-
lation in the stock market and bank rob-
bery but the more i thought on the matter
the more obvious was the conclusion that
we must be backed by the college or not at
all you may imagine with what eagerness
i waited for news from wiley when on the
second of april he went before the board
of trustees with our plan during my
morning quiz i found my thoughts miles
away from the classroom and twice caught
myself marking a opposite the name of
a student who reported himself unprepared
at length i dismissed the class early and
waited in the office of the physics depart-
ment for a phone call from wiley

  it was an hour before the bell rang but
even as wiley spoke my name i knew the
outcome

  marland we u in  and he banged up
the receiver

         chapter iii
         first flights

of the bustle and feverish activity of
the next few weeks i remember few
details wiley and i spent most of our time
in the laboratory making the gravity screen
as we would not trust the precious formula
to anyone else the contract for the outer
the outpost on the moon



steel was let and arriving in due time it
was subjected to every test the physics de-
partment could devise occasionally wiley
or  took time to supervise some detail of
the installation of tanks batteries and such
equipment there were many delays a
whole shipment of plates for the batteries
was defective and had to be replaced the
cement which we had ordered to fasten to-
gether the plates of the gravity-screen was
lost in transit and the plate glass port-hole
had to be trimmed down to fit the frame
an unforeseen difficulty due to our lack of
knowledge of diving apparatus arose when
we tested out the special suits in a vacuum
chamber they enabled us to breathe as
we had expected but the pressure of nearly
fifteen pounds per square inch stiffened
out the fabric so that we could not move
the difficulty being solved by placing metal
joints at the shotrlders hips elbows and
knees

  the school year was over and it was
early summer before the car was complete-
ly assembled neither wiley nor  taught
any classes in the summer school so our en-
tire time was devoted to the examining and
testing of the car i was impatient to be-
gin our trip at once but wiley more pru-
dently planned to make a series of test
trips cruising above the atmosphere for
awhile in order to determine the behavior
of the ship while actually free in space
and to make observations on the number
and size of meteorites encountered

  our first trial trip nearly resulted in dis-
aster the car had been carried to a field
outside of town and after a final inspection
we entered closed the air-lock and put the
gravity screen in position the sensations
were exactly opposite to what one might ex-
pect after having ridden in high-speed ele-
vators for with the force of gravity sud-
denly cut off from beneath us we felt as
though we were dropping rapidly an im-
mense distance there being only the slight
acceleration caused by the buoyancy of the
car to hold us to the floor

  we promptly opened the port-hole and
found ourselves already some distance above
the ground as we could tell only by the
proximity of the clouds since our view be-

low was cut off we quickly passed
through these and by the blackening of the
sky above us we realized that the air was
becoming extremely thin soon some of
the brighter stars were visible almost ov-
erhead i recognized capella the twinkling
diamond of our winter nights and well to
the east nearly lost in the suns glare was
mercury the most elusive of the planets
whom many die without seeing

  as the diffusion of light by the air grew
less and less the sky was soon studded with
stars and by reference to our watches we
saw that we were nearing the upper limits
of the atmosphere presently we began to
hear occasional light taps on the shell of
the car-falling meteorites of minute di-
mensions which had not yet penetrated the
protecting blanket of air far enough to be
burned by the heat of their passage we
closed the cover of the port-hole for safety
and listened to the slowly increasing patter
of these wandering particles of metal and
volcanic rock occasionally one louder
than the rest denoted our collision with a
stone of appreciable dimensions and once
a loud crack and noticeable jolt accompan-
ied the fall of a fair-sized meteorite

  at length wiley decided that we need go
no further from the earth and reached for
the switch which rotated the moving half
of the gravity-screen from its position be-
neath us hardly had he made the con-
tact however when the car lurched violent-
ly to one side and capsized throwing us
into a heap with all the movable objects in
the car in one corner

  for a moment i thought we had been
struck by a large meteor but presently i
realized what had happened imagine that
you have a ball balanced on one finger if
you move your finger to one side the ball
promptly tips to the other side and falls off
that was what had happened to us the
lower half of our spherical screen had been
moved and the moment the force of gravity
took hold of the edge of the car it drew
that side down sharply upsetting the car
and turning everything in it upside down
we were diving headfirst toward the earth

  i scarcely had time to be grateful that
there were some fifty miles between us andl
wonder stories

the ground when a new danger presented
itself the interior of the car was becom-
ing uncomfortably warm due to the fric-
tion of the air as we passed through it with
increaswg speed the mental picture of
ourselves landing on the earth reduced to
cinders in the midst of a blazing steel met-
eor galvanized me into action i reached
for the switch with the idea of turning the
gravity screen into position but the futility
of that soon became apparent the shock
of the upset must have jammed it open
then i remembered the tanks of hydrogen
and oxygen shuttingoff the current from
the motors which controlled the gravity
screen i reached for the valves turned the
gas into the nozzles beneath us and shot am
electric spark across them there was- a
sharp report a roar and i was again pre-
cipitated to the bottom of the car as the re-
coil ofthe burning gases checked our fall

  we were saved from destruction by fall-
ing or by incineration but there was still
h difficulty where and on what would
we land i could see only one way to ans-
wer this question after we had dropped
slowly for several miles i shut off the gas
and opened the porthole for a look all
i could see however was a bank of clouds
brilliantly illuminated by the sun i must
wait until we were nearer the ground ac-
cording i again opened the gas valves
braced myself and touched the igniting but-
ton

we fell several miles more slowly pass-
ing through rarer layers of the atmos-
phere until i estimated we were close
enough so that i could see where we were
moving as quickly as possible i cut off the
gas and opened the porthole by pressing
my face close to the glass i could see the
city several miles to the east with the silver
thread of the river winding close to it
this offered an idea if i could maneuver
the car to a position over the water and
drop into it there would be little danger
i closed the porthole and startecl the gas
this time from the nozzles to the west as
well as below me

  my next observation showed that we were
nearly over the river and about a mile high

i allowed the car to descend slowly until

it was only a few feet above the water the
shut off the gas entirely there was a shook
as we hit the surface of the river then
after all motion had subsided i opened the
porthole once more and the darkness out-
side told me that we were resting on the
bottom

  during our headlong descent i had not
had time for more than a glance at wiley
he had been lying amidst the pile of loose
objects which had tumbled about the car
on the way down quite unconscious i
found a large bruise on the back of his
head but apparently he was only stunned
as his respiration and heart action were
normal  found some water in one of the
tanks and bathed his head presently he
came around and sat up rather unsteadily

  still alive at any jrate he observed
dryly what happened did we hit a
meteor

  i explained briefly he nodded and
made a hastly inspection apparently sat-
isfied he turned to the switchboard again
with a warning to hang on by means of
the gas jets he again capsized the car so that
the gravity screen was beneath us and with
the aid of more gas we burst through the
surface of the water and into the sunlight

  we effected a safe landing on the field
to the surprise of the few mechanics and
assistants waiting for us who had witnessed
our drop into the river and that night
found us again in the laboratories of the
college bruised and shaken but still full
of impatience to undertake the journey

  before making any further trips it was
apparent that we must change the design
of the gravity screen the simplest solu-
tion appeared to be that of making it in the
form of four quarter-spherical surfaces
mounted on common bearings so that they
might be manipulated to expose any portion
of the car in any direction they could
now be moved apart separately from the
lowest portion of the car so as to expose
equal portions on either side of the center
of gravity this design possessed the add-
ed advantage of stable equilibrium since
if the car should turn to either sidle mere
the outpost on the moon



of that side would be covered by the gravity
screen and tend to rise

  the new screen was completed and put
in position on the car thereafter on our
test trips we met no more mishaps from
this or any other source nor did we dis-
cover any injurious effect from drifting for
hours free of the earths gravitation at
length we were satisfied that our car would
make the trip without mishap and there re-
mained only to load it and wait for the
moon to reach its proper position we had
decided that the most advantageous time to
land therewould be at the full when our
tests were completed it was nearing the full
late in august and since we would require
two weeks to reach it we must start at the
next new phase during the two weeks that
remained we busied ourselves in stocking
the cupboards with every imaginable kind
of canned and condensed food reading
matter and similar supplies

  finally all was in readiness toward
sunset of a clear autumn afternoon wiley
and i bade farewell to those few of the
college faculty who were in town and pro-
ceeded to the field where the space-travel-
ing sphere awaited us wiley appeared as
calm as though he were about to take a
sunday afternoon drive but i must confess
that i felt considerable nervousness we
had regulated our chronometer to a frac-
tion of a second and as the orange disc of
the setting sun touched the horizon we en-
tered the car and bolted the air-lock fast
wiley took his position by the switchboard
while i kept watch on the chronometer
at seventeen minutes thirty-two seconds
after sunset he closed the switch that sent
us on our way with that now familiar sen-
sation of dropping

  we kept the port-hole open until we had
left the atmosphere in order to verify our
direction then when the slowly-passing
stars had shown that we were headed for
the position the moon would take two weeks
hence we closed the steel cap over the glass
and resigned ourselves to hours of reading
and sleeping punctuated ba occasional
meals and observations of the stars we
agreed that one of us should always remain
awake though for what purpose it would

be hard to say since there was no navigat-
ing to be done

  we had provided ourselves with shoes
having magnetized steel soles in order that
we might have some footing for being in-
sulated from the attraction of all the heav-
enly bodies there was not even enough
gravity to hold water in a glass because
of this an amusing spectacle presented it-
self when either of us went to sleep fol-
lowing our terrestrial habits we lay down
to rest on whatever surface of the car ap-
pealed to us but the slightest movement
was sufficient to send our heads away from
the wall of the car while our feet anchored
by the magnetic shoes held fast one was
apt to find himself in any fantastic attitude
when he awoke the sight of the wak-
ing person was even more grotesque espec-
ially if he happened to be on the opposite
side of the car for then the sleeper appar-
ently hung head down in peaceful repose
we had brought along a camera and a sup-
ply of films and i used several of these
making time-exposures of wiley in various
attitudes none of which unfortunately
turned out well

nearing the moon

ten days dragged by marked only by
the hands of the clock before the first
event of real interest occurred we now
left the port-hole open continuously since
the danger from falling meteorites was
small due to their lesser velocity at this dis-
tance from the earth and while looking
through it at the stars at wiley slept i
noticed a thin crescent of light on the outer
edge of the steel frame of the glass-the
rays of the moon by a simple triangula-
tion i computed its position with respect to
our own and knowing our respective velo-
cities verified my expectation that we
would cross its orbit as it reached the full
phase

  from then on wiley and  watched the
progress of the reflected rays down the
fiame of the glass until by pressing our
faces close to the opening we could see
the edge of the sunlit surface it resembled
the moon-rise on a dusty evening its color


wonder stories

being a dirty range and tbe disc was
much larger than as seen from the earth
it was already near the full but since we
saw it from a different angle than terres-
trial observers only a little over half the
surface visible to us was lighted by the
sun the mountain ranges near the ter-
minator the dividing line between sunlight
and darkness were plainly visible as they
are seen from the earth through a small
field glass and by employing the powerful
binoculars we had brought we reduced its
apparent distance to about thirteen hundred
miles

  because of the small size of the glass
port-hole we were forced to take turns ob-
serving it and while wiley was using the
binoculars i checked our position we
were about forty thousand miles from the
moon and had completed five-sixths of our
journey at this point the attraction of the
moon would overcome that of the earth
and we would fall toward it unless we
turned the gravity-screen to that side of the
car this would of course cut off our view
of the moon except for an occasional neces-
sary glimpse while landing when the screen
would have to be opened for a moment

  i was about to call wileys attention to
this when he uttered an exclamation

  marland come have a look he called
i hurried to the glass and he moved aside
handing me the binoculars i examined
the visible portion of the moons surface but
could see nothing out of the ordinary i
was about to say as much when he directed 
look on the dark side near the south
pole

  i turned my glasses toward the lower por-
tion of the globe there perhaps a sixth
of the distance from the equator to the pole
and almost on the terminator was a tiny
speok of light barely distinguishable even
to my excellent eyes and all but lost in the
glare of the sunlight on nearby mountain
peaks at first i though it might be an il-
lusion in the glass but i was struck by the

the glasses were of course erecting glasses
differing in this respect from astronomical tele-
scopes through which inverted photographs of
the moon are made giving the impression that
the moon is upside down with the south
pole at the top of thepicture

peculiar color of the light-blue or blue-
green with perhaps a slight yellow tinge
but entirely out of keeping with the sur-
roundings even as i looked more closely
it faded into the line of sunlight and was
invisible

  did you see it asked wiley

   i did i replied but its gone

   gone out he exclaimed

   no i returned it crossed the termin-
ator and was lost in the sunlight

  impossible exclaimed wiley how
could it have crossed the terminator it
was miles away when i saw it besides
how could a volcano move

  volcano i exclaimed do you
think it was that

  what else could it be he demanded
then why wasnt it seen before this from
the earth i asked

  plenty of reasons he returned in
the first place it was so faint as to be al-
most invisible although we have no atmos-
phere between it and ourselves the dis-
tortion produced by the earths atmosphere
would make it invisible if not it might
easily be hidden by a range of mountains
you forget that we see the moon from a dif-
ferent angle now and finally it may not
have existed before now

   he seized the glasses and went to the port-
hole for another look but after several min-
utes of close scrutiny he gave up unable to
locate the light again

   i suddenly recalled that it was high time
that the gravity screen were closed and
raeutioned it to wiley he gave up his
position reluctantly and i closed the steel
cap over the porthole and set in motion the
motors to shift the screen wiley returned
the binoculars to their case  the wall and
remarked musing

  what do you suppose could cause a
volcano to stop erupting like that

   probably its still going but you cant
see it because of the sunlight i suggested

  no he objected it was too far from
athe terminator when i saw it the sunrise
doesnt move that fast

  it might have been on a gentle slope
i said the sunlight would travel down
the slope pretty rapidly
the outpost on the moon



for answer wiley went to one of the
shelves in which were stored among
other things a number of maps of the

moons surface together with a number of
photographs from these he extracted a
view of the section we had just been dis-
cussing which though seen from a different
angle was still fairly recognizable we
examined the map closely for some such
formation as i had suggested but failed to
find any which might meet the conditions
then we tried to recall the location of the
point as we had seen it

  wiley indicated by a dot the place where
he had last seen it and i indicated where
it had crossed the terminator we looked
at each other in considerable amazement
for not only did our estimates as to the dis-
tance from the edge of the shadovt differ
but my point was considerably further
north than his nor could we reconcile our
views by reference to surrounding land-
marks it was possible to set limits to our
possible errors in observation and we en-
closed each of our points in a circle which
made the maximum possible allowance for
such errors yet our two circles were a
quarter of an inch apart at their nearest
point wiley insisted that the light had
been well clear of the terminator while i
was equally certain that it had crossed the
terminator

  allowing for the motion of the sunlight
itself while we had changed places-which
was in fact almost negligible since the ter-
minator travels on the moon at about nine
miles per hour-we had still a difference
ei some fifty miles in our points there
was only one inference the light had
moved

  a further examination of the scant data
we had on the subject showed even more
tartling results at the very least the
earce of the light had moved fifty miles
ia five minutes or less-from the time wiley
id first called my attention to it until the
tine i had located it just as it crossed the
brder of the shadow in other words it
ml have been traveling at a rate of six
badred miles an hour

  in ike face of such figures we were both
iac lined to question our minds as to the cer-

tainty of the position of the light but the
facts remained unquestionable wiley had
seen it well in the shadow and i had seen
it pass into the light it had moved and
it seemed likely that its motion had been
very rapid

  the subject of this mysterious traveling
point of light occupied our minds for the
greater part of the remaining journey we
pored over maps and photographs of the
moons surface speculated on the nature
of such a high-speed body and thought erf
every possibility-so it seemed to us-even
going so far as to raise the question of
intelligent inhabitants living perhaps on
the interior of the satellite or even a form
of life which was not dependent on air for
existence

  the thought intrigued us yet i must con-
fess that my interest was not unnaixed with
apprehension a people sufficiently intel-
ligent to maintain their existence in spite of
the evident lack of air or water on the sur-
face of the moon must necessarily be far
in advance of the human race in mental de-
velopment we should probably be looked
on much as are the rats which invade our
homes in their own selfish interest just as
we were at present bent on invading the
moon the prospect had at least its ques-
tionable angles

  wiley too wasevidently thinking deep-
ly on the matter he had put away the
maps and photographs and was sitting in-
sofar as it is possible to sit without the aid
of gravitation on the opposite side of the
car his hands clasped around his knees his
toes stuck under a projecting valve to an-
chor himself gazing into nothingness pre-
sently he spoke as if addressing himself to
his thoughts rather than to me

  lets see what weve got he said
first i saw a light then you saw the
same light cross the terminator we have
only estimates of the distance it moved but
we agree that it was too far for the sun-
light to travel so as to cover a stationary
point the best estimate gives it a velocity
of six hundred miles an hour suppose
were wrong by half that it still moves
faster than anything on earth except bullets
and some airplanes -the question is what

was it a machine driven by some living
being what sort of being could live on
the moon there is no air-no water
even supposing a creature with a super-in-
telligence such that could manage to remain
there now how did it develop the moon
must have lost its atmosphere and water
long before the surface solidified it can
never have been a habitable globe like the
earth then either the creature supposing
there is one has a body radically different
from our own or else he is an immigrant
from some other planet but if the for-
mer why has he never come to the earth
and if the latter why go to the moon at
all

  he sat huddled motionless his eyes half
closed and presently he appeared to have
fallen asleep i got out paper and pencil
and was about to re-compute our position
as i was constantly doing in order to dis-
cover any deviation from- our intended
course when he uttered an exclamation

  of course he cried nothing sim-
pler mar land what a pair of idiots we
are super-beings-life without air-
tommyrot

  i wondered what was the cause of this
outburst but was quickly enlightened

  we have been fortunate enough to find
a new member of the solar system he said
smiling what we saw marland was
probably a sub-satellite-the moons moon
a little globe revolving around it at a dis-
tance of a few thousand miles-probably
not far from where we are hence the ap-
parent rapid motion it passed between
us and the dark part of the moon then across
to the bright side and was outshone by the
reflected light of the moon too dim to
have been detected from the earth because
of the atmospheric refraction

  this simple and logical explanation of
the phenomenon presented such an easy
solution to the problem that we were both
surprised we had not thought of it before
wiley and i were both anxious to take a
further observation in order to determine
the size and behavior of this lunar satellite
but this was out of the question at present
indeed it was quite a problem to get

enough data to check our position as wo
had to do frequently without unduly ex-
posing urseives to the attraction of the

moon

        chapter iv
        journeys end

as the hours passed we drew closer
and closer to the end of our journey
we remained awake constantly now and
nearly all of our time was spent in calcu-
lating the exact moment and spot of our ar-
rival from the latest observation we
found that we should arrive somewhat to
the south of the equator on the sunrise
side-that is the portion on which the sun
had been shining for less than half of the
two-weks-long day this section of the
moons surface was more thickly covered
with mountains than some but there were
a reasonable number of level spaces and
it was in this quarter that some of the most
interesting features of the globe were to be
found such as the giant craters tycho and
copernicus with their radiating streaks

  at length there remained only a thousand
miles or so between us and the moon at
our present rate we should reach it in some-
what more than an hour we spent the re-
maining time in arranging the loose articles
in the car such as dishes bottles reading
matter and similar debris so that they
would not pile up on the downward side of
the car when we landed and opened the
gravity screen

 the amount of junk which we had
amassed was tremendous we had not both-
ered more than once or twice to make use
of the air-lock to throw out our trash and
there were empty meat-cans bottles and
such stuff which were of no use to us what-
soever wiley suggested that we pile them
into the air-lock so that they would be out
of the way and could be thrown out as soon
as we landed we began this at once but
the action immediately called our attention
to another fact the air-lock was turned
toward the moon and was covered by the
gravity-screen since we had been looking
through its glass port-hole it would be
the outpost on the moon



down when we landed and would make it
unpossible to leave the car this gave us
a moments worry until we recalled our
former startling success in turning the car
upside down during our first trial trip
accordingly we took our final observation
of position when we were but a few miles
from the surface over one of the great
plains termed as by the early observers
because of their darker color

  this one was known as mare nubium
ithe sea of clouds and we were approach-
ing the center of it we quickly calculated
our velocity from two observations a few
minutes apart then closed the port-hole for
the last time until landing and turned the
gravity-screen until the car rotated through
 degrees under the influence of gravity
then closed it entirely shutting ourselves
off once more from all attraction then
we opened the valve controlling the flow of
gas into the jets pointed toward the moon
and touched the electric spark

  having become accustomed during our
two weeks journey to move about the car
as we pleased yith no regard to the relative
directions of fop and down we- had neg-
lected to hold on while doing this and we
found ourselves in rather laughable circum-
stances as a consequence however the ac-
celeration of the gas was not sufficient to
throw us very violently to the bottom of the
car and the situation was more humorous
than unpleasant we had just picked our-
selves up and endeavored to become accus-
tomed to the strange sensation of direction
once more when there was a moderate jar
announcing our landing wiley jumped to
hut off the gas while  opened the gravity-
screen the jar was repeated the car hav-
ing bounced a little from the surface
but it promptly settled down on an even
keel and we were on the moon

  so far our journey had been carefully
planned but now that we had reached our
objective we were rather at a loss as to our
next step exploration had been vague-
i  mentioned but we had outlined no route

  vever our bodies had been cramped in
lue snail interior of the car long enough to
ct- -ire action so with one accord we un-
packed our diving suits tbe term is poor-

ly applied but we never gave them any
other name and put them on they were
unwieldy things but with the slight gravity
of the moon we managed them quite well-

   was ready firsl and released the fast-
enings of the inner door of the air-lock
as  lowered this i was showered by the
refuse which had been hastily piled into the
opening and forgotten in the excitement of
our landing i took an armload with me
leaving wiley to bring as much as possi-
ble with him and climbed into the air-lock

  the doors to this could be fastened from
inside or out so as to remove the necessity
of an operator inside the car once inside
the lock with the air-tight doors bolted fast
a pump exhausted as much of the air as pos-
sible into the interior of the car in order
to conserve our not over-abundant supply
of the vital gases i had crowded into the
small space fastened the door and soon
afterward the swelling of my suit to its in-
terior pressure told of the pump at work
 waited with as much patience as i could
muster until the air was thinned out to a
near-vacuum and released the catches to
the outer door

  a blaze of sunlight such as i had never
seen before met my eyes i wore dark
glasses but even so the brilliant light re-
flected from the rocky plain about me was
almost intolerable  stepped out onto the
top of the spherical machine reclosed the
door and after kicking the rubbish over the
edge began to survey the surrounding ter-
ritory while waiting for wiley

we were situated approximately in the
center of a vast plain extending in all
directions to the horizon broken here and
there by low elevations the smaller and
closer ones presented an appearance sug-
gesting the crater formation familiar to
those who have seen the moon through a
telescope while those in the distance resem-
bled lines of jagged cliffs being too remote
and too high to be seen in their true form
the floor of the plain itself resembled a
mud flat from which the water has receded
leaving its surface dried and cracked by the
sun indeed we soon foun out that it was
much like that the surface rock being split

and checkered by ages of boiling heat fol-
lowed by cold unknown to the earth

  the sky was even more remarkable-jet
black with thousands of stars blazing with
a splendor beyond description the sun
was dazzling even more so than on earth
by peeping over my arm i could see the cor-
ona and a red spot which might be a huge
prominence the earth was faintly dis-
cernible as a pale circle of light close to the
sun visible only by the light refracted
through its atmosphere

  my observations were interrupted when
wileys head appeared through the air-lock
and after blinking for a moment in the sun-
light he stepped out beside me we had
no method of communication other than ges-
tures supplemented by what lip-reading we
could do through the glass of our helmets
but he presently made me understand that
he wished to descend and explore the plain
about us we made our way cautionsly
along the curving surface of the sphere to
the ladder which extended up the outside
i started to climb awkwardly down but
wiley made a flying leap from the twenty-
foot height on which we stood i turned in
startled amazement having forgotten the
slight attraction of the moon and watched
him float as if on a parachute landing with
perfect ease on the ground

  i followed his example but with less
grace landing on my hands and knees but
with no discomfort we started off at a
brisk walk but our first step lifted us clear
of the ground and we coasted several feet
before touching our muscles accustomed
to earth-travel instinctively exerted enough
pressure to bear our normal weight but
meeting with little resistence lifted us clear
off the ground we experimented a bit and
found that by leaning slightly forward we
could travel at a fast trot with practically
no effort

  we set off in this manner toward the near-
est of the little craters we must have
resembled a slow-motion picture of a pair
of sprinters so leisurely were our move-
ments our feet raised clouds of the fine
dust which covered everything but like ev-
erything else on the moon this dust be-

haved in a strange manner it rose to a
greater height than on earth then instead
of remaining suspended large and small
particles alike fell to the ground leaving
not the slightest haze behind us

  until now  had been so absorbed in the
new sensations which surrounded me that i
had not noticed a growing sense of discom-
fort but suddenly i realized that it was
becoming intolerably hot inside my protect-
ing suit the temperature increased as i
went a few steps further and i realized that
if i did not find shelter from the sunlight
soon i would suffocate i tapped wileys
arm and started for the shadow of the near-
est rock it was some distance away and i
realized that i was rapidly losing conscious-
ness when  stumbled headfirst from the
glare into the blackness of night and fell
to the ground

  my exhaustion perhaps saved my life for
i had barely gotten into the inky-black
shadow of the rock and lay with my face
only a few inches from its edge as  re-
covered possession of my faculties i saw
that the glass of my helmet had become
coated with frost condensed from my breath
the temperature around me was many de-
grees below zero the effect of extreme
changes of heat on glass is well known
no doubt the heat reflected from the sun-
lit ground a few inches away had saved my
glass from cracking and letting out the air

  a few moments cooling sufficed to set
my teeth chattering and wiley and  set
off once more being careful to stop in a
shadow once in a while we reached the
little crater toward which we had been
walking and skipped up its side as easily
as two mountain goats it was perhaps one
hundred feet high the sides sloping at an
angle of about sixty degrees the rim was
jagged and split by many fissures while
pieces of rock had scaled off and slid into
the interior from where we stood we had
a good view of the entire crater it was
about five hundred feet in diameter and the
floor was studded with tiny replicas of the
crater itself a few feet in diameter while
in the center was a small cone rising to 
height of some thirty feet
the outpost on the moon



a puzzling phenomenon

as we stood looking at the crater an odd
thought ran through my mind pan-
cakes i said to myself pancakes were
one of my weaknesses and  had had ample
opportunity to make them during our trip
the interior of the crater resembled a vast
pancake on the griddle bubbles of escap-
ing gas had burst leaving holes as the sur-
face stiffened and solidified perhaps the
crater itself was such a bubble left by a
larger uprush of gas

  we descended into the crater and exam-
ined the formations more closely every-
thing seemed to bear out my idea as the
surface of the moon had cooled gas had
formed in spots under the hardening crust
and presently burst through piling up the
semi-solid lava in a circle around the erup-
tion later as the cooling proceeded the
crust of the interior of the crater being
thinner was more easily broken hence the
many small pit all this activity had long
since ceased and the dust of ages of ex-
posure to heat and cold covered everything

  at length we started backto the car for
despite the ease of travel we found the heat
quite enervating and the need of rest and
a meal was pressing we had been gone
several hours and we could not be sure just
how long the air in our suits would last
we hurried along going from rock to rock
resting a few minutes in the shadow of each
and taking a slightly different route on our
way back

  we had covered perhaps half the distance
to our machine when i felt wiley touch my
arm looking in the direction he indicated
i saw that not far to our right there were evi-
dences of the all-pervading dust having been
disturbed we walked in that direction and
came to a patch of bare rock some fifty
yards across the dust had been swept
clean piling up around the edges of the
bare spot as if a circular windstorm had
blown it away but that obviously was not
the cause of this phenomenon as we well
know what could have caused it as i
turned the matter over in my mind the
thought of meteorites occurred to me and
 started for the center of the space to look

for traces of meteoric stone i examined
the ground closely but found nothing what-
soever except a few scars on the rock itself
as if it had been melted by some tremendous
heat they seemed fresh and might possi-
bly have been caused by the fall of a meteor

  we continued our journey with no further
events and presently were once more within
the car with a meal cooking on the electric
stove neither of us referred to the events
of our trip until we had finished eating and
settled down to enjoy a smoke then wiley
spoke

  what do you make of that bare spot
probably the mark of a meteor i re-
plied it looks quite recent

  recent yes he paused but why
havent we noticed any more meteors

  i thought for a moment before answering
perhaps the earth gets most of them-its
superior gravity you know and so close
they would have to be headed just right to
get here he nodded

  but why didnt we find the meteor it-
self after a moment

  it probably hit hard enough to be heated
to gas i answered

  it would take considerable speed he ob-
served by the way what velocity would a
meteor have landing here

  if you assume it to fall from rest an in-
finite distance away it would be going a mile
and a quarter a second i said

  the big berthas did better than that
during the war he remarked ever hear
of a shell turning to gas when it hit
no i admitted but the meteor might
have exploded like a shell

  not likely he said but its possible
i grant you perhaps our friends at the
city college are dropping us a note with
which remark he ended the discussion but
long after i lay down for a sleep he sat up
engrossed in his thoughts

  i was awakened by the smell of food and
found i had a prodigious appetite

  about time to get going old timer said
wiley youve slept the clock around and
then some

  we quickly dispatched the meal donned
our diving outfits and were soon out on
the surface of the moon despite the pasa-
wonder stories

    of more than twelve hours since we had
last seen it the son bad moved but little
and everything was much the same this
time we set out in a different direction to-
ward another of the small craters this one
was more distant and somewhat larger than
the first but we made better time in reach-
ing it and climbing its steep sides having
kecome more accustomed to the strange
mode of travel we sjent a little time ex-
ploring its interior which was much the
same as that of the other crater and pres-
ently made for the little cone which so often
is found in these formation in the center of
the circular hollow its sides were steep
and on reaching its summit we found a vent
extending down inside to an unknown depth
the sunlight penetrated a few yards in
which the walls narrowed slightly suggest-
ing a funnel beyond this we could see noth-
ing

  wiley motioned me to follow him and-
started to pick his way cautiously down the
steep side of the funnel i followed to the
edge of the sunlight and we stood for a
moment trying to fathom the inky depths
presently our eyes became more accustomed
to the darkness and we could see the faint
gleams reflected from footholds just below
us we took a few steps downward and were
surrounded by darkness

  suddenly i was startled to see the side of
the pit opposite me illuminated  looked
for the source of the light and discovered
that wiley had succeeded in withdrawing his
arm from its covering into his suit and had
taken a flashlight from his pocket and di-
rected it through the glass of his helmet he
turned it into my face then away and i
could see that he was laughing at my sur-
prised look then he turned the light below
him and led the way further into the depths

  we descended for perhaps another hun-
dred feet the walls of the funnel narrowing
until we could brace our feet against one
side and our backs on the other we paused
and wiley turned the light downward the
shaft continued toward the center of the
moon no one could say how far without
becoming much narrower  would have
liked to continue but it was inadvisable

as we had quite a climb back to the surface
and must consider our air-suppty

i looked up the funnel framed a circu-
lar patch of sky above us in which the
brighter stars blazed with brilliant splendor
on a jet-black background powdered with
other stars too small to be distinguished one
from another

  it was now some twenty-four hours since
we had landed and for the first time i saw
the surface of our mother earth not very
much to be sure only a thin sliver of fight
was visible like a huge day-old moon the
crescent shone with a brilliance far sur-
passing everything in the heavens except
the sun i wondered what what it would be
like at the full when the sun would have
set on our side of the moon

  one moment  was looking at the silver
thread of the earth the next i was blinded
by a glare of light sweeping across my field
of vision the heavens were obscured by a
broad fan-tail of flame blue or blue-green
with a tinge of yellow in it  closed my
eyes for a moment to let the dancing spots
on my overtaxed retinas fade and looked
again but it was gone in the glimpse i
had had it seemed to be moving to the south-
ward  thought i could detect a glow on
the northern side of the funnel above me but
my eyes were still too blinded to be certain

  i felt wiley below me pushing me upward
urgently and with as much speed as pos-
sible i scrambled up the side of the pit it
required perhaps five minutes to reach the
top we faced south with one accord and
there over the rim of the crater far in the
distance could be seen a faint blue-yellow
glow it did not strike me as strange at the
moment but wiley pointed out its meaning
later

  we had retraced our steps to the car and
were discussing the appearance of the light

  did you notice the after-glow he asked
and as i nodded do you realize what that
means gas marland there must have
been gas you know that light cannot be
diffused in a vacuum the air does it on
earth but we have no air here there must
have been a body of gas attached to that
light or the light gave off gas which glow-
the outpost on the moon



ed now what could be liberating glowing
gas so near the moon

  we sat silent for many minutes finally
wiley answered his own question in part

  tt may have been a small comet he
suggested and made haste to bury himself
in a book obviously he did not wish me to
point out that the comet if comet it were
had passed between the earth and the moon
and with a velocity heretofore unheard of

  f must have fallen asleep for presently
i had a sensation of motion and awoke to
find wiley manipulating the controls he
answered my questioning look with a sin-
gle phrase heading south further ex-
planation was unnecessary i knew he had
closed the gravity screen and given the car
a start to the southward we were drifting
under our momentum in the direction of the
light which we had seen once before land-
ing and later over the nearby crater cruis-
ing about the southern section of the moons
surface

chapter v
an awesome sight

wiley had inverted the car so as to take
an occasional look at the moon
through the port-hole i left the running of
it to him and caught up my notes on the two
trips we had made we traveled for eighteen
hours in this manner there was no way of
telling our exact speed but wiley estimated
it in the neighborhood of a hundred miles
an hour this increased from time to time
slightly due to our changing course to meet
the curvature of the moon if we had con-
tinued on our original course we would
have left the surface on a tangent and contin-
ued in a straight line but our views below
served the double purpose of giving us our
bearings and allowing us to fall toward
the surface enough to maintain an altitude
of three to five miles the velocity of our
fall was in part added to our speed of travel

  thus we arrived over the moons south
pole which could be located from the ap-
pearance of the terminator beneath us be-
 ond which the sunlight did not reach here
wiley brought the car to a stop and de-

scended gently to the interior of a fair-sized
crater it was his purpose lie said to re-
main there for half a month when the other
side of the moon would be illuminated then
we would continue our search for the mys-
terious light

  the spot had been ideally chosen for
here the sun never completely set never
showed more than part of its disc above
the horizon the extremes of heat and cold
were therefore less evident our car rested
on a little knoll where the rays of the sun
seldom struck it directly but were always
reflected from a nearby rock the earth
part of which showed above the mountain-
tops was nearing its first quarter and
added to the illumination the stars of the
southern sky showed brilliantly overhead
neither of us was much inclined to explor-
ation preferring tc spend our time reading
or lolling about the car smoking and med-
itating we settled ourselves comfortably
for a two weeks stay

  our living quarters were given a much-
needed overhauling and put in perfect or-
der we checked our supplies of food gas
and air tested the storage batteries and sat-
isfied ourselves that everything was ship-
shape then we caught up on our sleeping
and eating thus we passed the hours
serenely awaiting the sunrise on the hidden
half of the moon

  five terrestrial days had passed since our
first arrival wiley was immersed in a book
and i was peeling potatoes preparatory to
getting a meal when the walls were flooded
with a bluish-yellow glare from the port-
hole i jumped erect but wiley was at the
glass first

  its coming down he shouted making
a rush for his diving-suit i climbed into
mine as he disappeared into the air-lock and
waited impatiently for the pump to stop
signifying that he was out i followed as
quickly as i could but by the time i emerg-
ed he was already a quarter of a mile away
going at a fast trot toward a bright glow
beyond the mountains when we had gone
a mile or more it faded out gradually but
we had located it well enough to be sure of
finding its source we reached the wall of
the crater and climbed quickly up wiley
wonder stories

several rods in the lead he reached the sum-
mit and passed out of my sight while i
paused from exhaustion

  when at length i resumed my climb and
reached the summit i was first too startled
then too horror-stricken to move for at
the foot of the slope two hundred yards
from me sat an awesome and marvelous ob-
ject it was in the shape of a cone of fifty-
foot base and somewhat greater altitude
with circular windows around the sides and
particularly at the top while from the
base which was pierced at regular intervals
by semi-circular vents resembling culverts
there issued a cloud of luminous gas bluish-
yellow in color

  this much i saw in a swift glance then
i discovered that wiley was running down
the slope toward it suddenly from the apex
f thfe cone there issued a jagged flash which
struck wiley as he ran tumbling him head-
long on the rocks i shouted in an agony
of horror and apprehension and in a futile
rage seized a fragment of rock and hurled
it at the unknown thing this evidently
drew attention to me for it emitted another
flash which seemed to burst into myriads
f stars there was a crash and blackness


  to my mind the oddest feature of com-
plete insensibility is ones total ignorance
of the passage of time my sensations on
awakening followed immediately upon the
flash which had stunned me yet when i
was able to talk i discovered tht over fifty
hours had elapsed and my life had once
been despaired of

  i was alone with wiley who was fully
dressed but minus his diving suit it was
lying in an amazingly comfortable bed in
a small but attractive room such as one may
find in many american hotels the walls
were painted in a solid color which was
restful to the eyes there were no pictures
and the room was devoid of useless decor-
ations but contained many conveniences
the furniture was of metal attractively up-
holstered and colored a shaded electric
lamp shed a remarkably good counterfeit
f sunlight and though there were no win-
dows the whole effect was inviting and cheer-
ful

  wiley spoke to me glad t see youre
awake again old man you had a rather
tough time the doctor had a pulmotor on
you for an hour and would have given up
if i hadnt kept after him

  doctor i echoed dazed pulmotor
where are we

  this is the headquarters of those fellows
in the flying-machine he replied they
knocked us out with a high-tension spark i
came around in a few minutes but you had
broken the glass on your helmet and they
had a nice time getting air back into your
system and teaching you to breathe again
theyre prepared for such things but you
were a pretty bad case

tatho are they i asked

  yy i dont know much about them
he answered i talked to the doctor some
but he keeps his mouth shut it seems there
are a lot of them here and theyve been here
for years a man wrho calls himself -for-
scher meaning searcher is the guiding
spirit im fo have a talk with him soon
he and they are human of course from
the earth they came here in machines like
the one you saw quite an ingenious bit of
machinery by the way

  i had a look around it after theyd fin-
ished working on you it gives off gases
at a tremendous velocity and the recoil
drives it same piinciple as the gas jets on
our car but much more powerful appar-
ently they havent any gravity-screens but
the force of the discharge from their ma-
chine is sufficient alone to lift it free of the
ground and they get up some pretty big
velocities we re two thousand miles from
the pole yet they got here in three hours
what are they doing here i asked

  i couldnt say replied wiley the
crew that picked us up was sent out to do
just that they found our machine on one
of their trips and reported it we saw the
mark of their landing-where your meteor
had blown away the dust they got orders
to bring us back and here we are thats
all theyve told me and apparently its all
were to know until i talk to dr forscher
as he finished speaking the door opened
and a man in a white coat entered he was
the outpost on the moon

perhaps forty tall with close-cropped blond
hair and wore rimless spectacles from the
bag he carried i judged he was the doctor
wiley had referred to he nodded pleasant-
ly to wiley and turned to me

  i am pleased to see that you are again
conscious he said his slight accent con-
firmed my impression that he was of german
birth he produced a stethoscope and set
about an examination of my heart and lungs
which was as rapid as it was thorough

  there will be no danger he announced
presently some food will taste well-is
it not so then a long sleep and you will
be as good as before

  his prescription suited me perfectly he
took his departure and in the course of a
few minutes a dapper frenchman appeared
carrying a tray of food

  pour le malodey said he indicating me
then to wiley monsieur will follow me to
the dining hall

  ill see you after youve had some
sleep said wilev as he departed

  i turned to the dinner which had been
brought me there were dishes i had not
seen for weeks-fresh green vegetables fresh
meat butter milk evidently there were
farms and dairies on the moon i attacked
the meal with considerable appetite and
made a respectable impression on it then
more comfortable and very tired i fell
asleep

  when i awoke wiley had returned his
face shone with a a smile of satisfaction and
i was filled with curiosity

  have you seen dr fdrscher i asked
he nodded

  i have he replied and a good deal be-
sides i had dinner with some of the higher-
ups and was shown around a bit then i
talked to the doctor and found out some
more were scheduled to be guests of
honor here for awhile to get acquainted
with the place i dont know what will
happen then but you may be sure that
were quite welcome much more so than
when we first arrived  didnt mention it
to you but we were considered as inter-
lopers and werent very popular at first

  you see this dr forscher is a rather
reclusive sort and while he supposed that

some day someone would succeed in getting
to the moon he hoped it wouldnt be until
aftfer he had finished his business here and
passed on but he was much relieved to
find out that we werent the advance guard
of a sizable expedition and that no one
knows the secret of the machine except our-
selves wiley paused to light a cigarette
then continued they picked up the old
space-traveler and brought it here to find
out what makes it work but they cant un-
less i help them and the doctor knows it
by now so theyre keeping it for us-to
make sure we dont run away before hes
ready to let us

  what sort of a man is he i asked
and why is he here

  as to the latter i dont know replied
wiley nobody seems willing totell me
and i cant guess but as for the doctor
hes quite an odd sort not very attractive
physically about five-feet-two as a guess
with a head all out of proportion he just
sits like a statue while he talks to you but
i really believe he can look right into your
mind he has the most marvelous intellect
ive ever seen

  this from wiley was a real tribute for
the world can count on one hand the men
with minds equal to his

  hes what you might call a super-scien-
tist he continued he knows more phy-
sics than the whole department at the city
college the worlds best chemists are mere
tyros compared to him as a physician or
surgeon he could have made a fortune on
earth the science of psychology is mere
a-b-c to him and he can solve problems in
mathematics without putting a mark on
paper that would take me an hour or more
that is by no means a comprehensive list
of his achievements he had specialized in
none of the sciences but he knows them all
and better than any man on earth every-
thing in this colony is the product of his
mind he conceived it engineered it built
it and now he rules it

many wonders

ttve seen enough of the place to appre-
x ciate what a man he is for instance
theres the air perhaps youve noticed its


wonder stories

freshness it should be fresh- it was made
a few hours ago he makes the oxygen and
nitrogen right out of the rocks around us
theres plenty of oxygen to be found in the
quartz but its hard to get out and theres
little if any nitrogen to be found in any
form nevertheless he makes both of them
by a kind of atomic chemistry he gave me
a general idea of the process he uses high
temperatures and strong electric and mag-
netic fields to break up the atoms of some
elements and then recombines them into
others silicon seems to suit the purpose
well and theres plenty of it in combina-
tion with oxygen all around us in the form
of sand and quartz

  he uses the same principle indirectly in
driving those flying machines which they
call tractors do you remember our talk
the night you wrecked your car when i
mentioned that if anyone could find a way
to build up a radioactive atom more com-
plex than uranium he would have a storage
battery for unlimited power its a sub-
stance like that which drives the tractors it
takes millions of horsepower to make a
pound of it but the power all comes out
again as its wanted

  did you enjoy your dinner perhaps
youre interested in knowing where it came
from there are acres and acres of artifi-
cial soil where plants and animals live un-
der quartz-glass roofs receiving light from
the sun and from arc-lamps the cattle
hogs and chickens he raises would be the
despair of our best farmers and the tall
corn from iowa isnt even in it compared
with the crops he harvests the year around
marland that man has everything there is
to be found on earth and hes gone nature
one better in every way

  i found out loo where the power comes
from the most obvious source-the sun
and very simply prom sunrise to sun-
set there are hundreds of boilers heated by
huge burning glasses which generate elec-
tric energy part of it is stored in batteries
for the dark period

  this colony lives underground in a sys-
tem of excavations and tunnels that extends
for several miles around there are hun-
dreds of men but no women or children i

dont know how he intends to replenish his
labor supply when age and accident take a
hand theyve been here eleven years
building and digging there are a corps of
scientists who are the doctors assistants and
share his confidence to a considerable ex-
tent the rest are mechanics artisans and
laborers one of ihem told me where they
all came from there are french germans
belgians english austrians-imost every
white nationality on earth they have
enough to do but never too much and
enough variety to make it interesting
theyve provided with facilities for recrea-
tion comfortable quarters and plenty of
food they seem contented with their lot
and indeed they may well enough be

  some of this the doctor told me and
some i found out from other men but the
most interesting ihing of all-the reason
for this tremendous establishment so far
from the earth-no one has mentioned he
wants us to become acquainted and then
hes going to have a talk with both of us
meanwhile theres nothing much to do but
make ourselves at home

  he sat in silence for a time while my
head whirled from the multitude of wonders
he had described but i was anxious to be
up again and see for my self this strange
subterranean world of humans a quarter of
a million miles from their birth-place i
set about exploring our apartment and
found a completely equipped bathroom with
facilities for shaving and a shower-bath i
immediately availed myself of these and
once more dressed and moving about i
found that my appetite had returned in
answer to my question wiley informed me
that there would be a meal in the dining
hall in half an hour or so meanwhile he
suggested that we take a stroll around the
hallways which suited me perfectly

  i found that the corridors formed a large
h with the laboratories and farms opening
from the parallel passages and the living
quarters dining-hall etc along the connect-
ing corridor the doors in most instances
bore only numbers though a few had
legends in many languages over them one
of these was the dining-room to which we
presently returned
the outpost on the moon



  we were led to a table at which were
seated several men of various nationalities
who wiley told me were dr forschers
cientiftc assistants the doctor himself
preferred to eat alone seldom joining the
others in the dining-hall wiley introduced
me to each of the men at the table they
were for the most part unknown to me
though in a few i recognized men whose
names had once been familiar on earth

  they had best remain anonymous for
reasons which will presently be understood
there was also the chief engineer whom i
shall call-dr langley who stood highly in
the estimation of dr forscher and who
had been partly responsible for the feats of
construction at which we marveled he told
of the difficulties which had been overcome
us during the course of the meal of some
since their arrival it seems that he had
come in company with dr forscher and
some of the scientific staff together with a
part of their present labor force some eleven
or twelve years before they had establish-
ed a small headquarters digging a cave into
the rock fitting it with an air-lock setting
a small power-plant in operation and con-
verting the cave into a work-shop

  with this as a starting-point they had de-
signed and constructed the vast subterran-
ean labyrinth which formed the present
dwelling of the colony increasing the power-
plant as necessary at present there were
accommodations for nearly twice as many
inhabitants as it now held and no more con-
struction was under way their activities be-
ing directed into other channels here he
stopped as if fearful of having said too
much and we could learn nothing more

that there was some purpose to this
organization as yet unfulfilled we had
no doubt but every time the subject came
up we ran into a blind wall wiley and i
had made conjectures as we explored the
corridors but we could arrive at no reason-
able supposition in the list of laboratory
directors the sciences were nearly all repre-
sented yet none seemed to predominate
thes scientists we learned had all come of
their own volition yet with every oppor-
tunity for fame on earth with greater facil-

ities than could possibly be presented here
why had they chosen an existence on this
barren satellite so inaccessible so cut off
from communication so fraught with dan-
ger for solitude it hardly seemed like-
ly in fact one might find comparatively
greater privacy on earth than here pent up
with a few hundred fellow-beings whose
daily association was unavoidable there
must be some more powerful motive which
was so far wrapped in secrecy guarded by
the trusted few who surrounded wiley and
myself at the dinner-table

  the repast was finished and at dr lang-
leys suggestion we adjourned with him to
his own apartment we settled ourselves for
a chat and discussed further the work of
constructing the colony he told us in de-
tail how the air-plant operated leaving out
only the vital principle which enabled dr
forscher to destroy and reconstruct atoms
which he confessed was known only to the
doctor the head of the physics laboratory and
a few others he described also how a con-
tinuous circulation of water was maintained
the sewage being filtered and boiled so as
to render it pure again it was of course
simple to supply more uniting hydrogen
and oxygen by combustion but it was sel-
dom necessary

  we found out many other interesting
things how after the glass covered pastures
had been made for for them a few cattle
sheep hogs etc had been brought from the
earth and allowed to multiply to the pre-
sent herds how it had been necessary for
the first year or to to live almost entirely
on synthetic food made there in the work-
shop how they managed to procure the
materials for their work some minerals he
told us they found it easier to mine as they
were found in large quantities about the
moon iron was one--they had several iron
mines they were reached by flying-
machines and maintained separate power
air and water plants

  some substances too could not he found
on the moon and were too difficult of man-
ufacture notably organic substance chief
among these was wood dr forscher pro-
jected the planting of a forest of timber
in the near future but it would take inaay


wonder stories

years to reach maturity in most cases a
more durable substitute had been found-
metal for furniture doors etc concrete
stairs and floors the indispensible mater-
ials of this sort had been brought from the
earth and used as sparingly as possible but
at some future time it would doubtless be
necessary to renew the supply

  dr langley added too that the need for
occasional communication with the earth
was growing increasingly evident as a great-
er labor force was needed especially since
time and accident had contrived to mater-
ially reduce its original numbers

  at this point we were interrupted by the
ringing of the wall phone and dr lang-
ley answered it we gathered from his re-
marks that something was amiss as he
hung up we prepared to take our departure
but he detained us

       p

  would you care to take a trip to one
of the mines he asked the airplant
has broken down and i must go there to
supervise repairs and of course remove the
men

  wiley turned to me how about it
marland he asked have you energy
enough after your siege

  try to count me out i exclaimed
dr langley nodded his approval and turn-
ed to the phone again getting in touch
with the chief of transportation he ordered
two tractors made ready for flight then he
gave directions to a corps of mechanics and
finally signified his readiness we follow-
ed him to one of the corridors near the cen-
ter of the main tunnel and for some dis-
tance along this to a store-room he took
out three of their air-envelopes which
served the same purpose as our diving suits
and illustrated the method of donning
them we found them much better than
our own in many respects besides great-
er ease of movement each was equipped
with a small radio apparatus consisting of
microphone and miniature loud-speaker
having a range of a half a mile or more
so that conversation was easily carried on
they were also heat-insulated to guard
against the unpleasantness which we had ex-
perienced and the helmets were entirely of
colored glass which permitted greater

ranges of vision yet prevented possible sun-
blindness

chapter vi
a tragedy

dr langley now conducted us through
the smaller of two doors into a cylind-
rical chamber which served the double pur-
pose of air-lock and elevator the doors
when closed were hermetically sealed
and by touching a button we were carried
rapidly a hundred feet or so to the surface
meanwhile a pump had been exhausting the
air in the chamber and we now stood in a
nearly perfect vacuum with only another
air-tight door between ourselves and the
exterior of the moon on stepping out we
saw before us two of the huge conical flying
machines each with a wisp of vapor issu-
ing from the semi-circular openings at the
base following langley we approached
the nearer and  was startled to hear his
voice loud as a gun-shot from the radio
speaker aboard the tractor open up

  yes sir came a response and in a
moment a door opened in the side just above
the ground passing through another door
to the right to the interior of the machine
we found ourselves in a circular runway
extending entirely around the base of the
machine a tall man might have had dif-
ficulty standing erect in it as there was lit-
tle more than six feet head room the
sides slanted toward the apex of the mach-
ine at slightly different angles the inner
more nearly vertical the floor was ap-
proximately ten feet wide and the roof
somewhat less on our left directly out-
side the air lock door was a ladder lead-
ing to compartments above we mounted
through two more compartments differing
from the first only in that they were con-
tinuous having no air-lock

  dr langley mentioned in passing that
they served as cargo space or as accommo-
dations for passengers the ladder con-
tinued up to a trap-door in the floor of
the fourth compartment this was open
and we climbed into the engine room of the
tractor here we removed the air-enve-
lopes and dr langley showed us through
the outpost on the moon



the room explaining the driving principle
and the apparatus in the engine room it
was much larger than those below and jam-
med with machinery which nevertheless oc-
cupied a minimum of space so well was it
arranged there were eight huge genera-
tors covered with aluminum cases which
served the double purpose of protecting the
occupants from injury and preventing pos-
sible leakage of air as the machinery was
driven by turbines which connected with
the interior conical well of the car it was
through this interior well that the gas which
we had seen escaped being given off by the
driving element

  it has often been said that there is nothing
new under the sun but the author of this
famous saying had never heard of dr for-
scher the driving element was literally
new not in the sense that it consisted of a
hitherto unknown substance nor of a new
combination of old substances it was en-
tirely a new element above uranium in the
periodic system it was appropriately call-
ed synthium being a manufactured ele-
ment- the ultimate achievement of dr
forschers dexterity in atomic physics not
content with changing the elements one in-
to another he had added protons and elec-
trons to the uranium atom and created syn-
thium undisturbed its half-life period
was a matter of minutes only but if kept
at an extremely low temperature its activity
was greatly reduced it was necessary to
cool it constantly as its very activity re-
sulted in heat and heat bringing more ac-
tivity it gathered speed like a rolling snow-
ball and was quite as apt to wreak havoc
kept under control by electric refrigera-
tion however it was a willing and mighty
slave it gave off molecules of gas which
glowed with the heat of their liberation
they were given off in all directions equal-
ly but those which encountered the walls
of the conical container rebounded out-

wards so great was the recoil of their de-
parture that they easily lifted the huge
tractor

  the method of driving was simplicity it-
self the chief difficulty being to retain the
liberated energy within controllable lim-
its the synthium was allowed to attain
a temperature of some three hundred de-
grees centigrade and here it was main-
tained by the eight generators which sup-
plied current to a system of electric cool-
ing these generators were driven by tur-
bines in the path of the escaping gas
when the tractor was to be brought down
more current was supplied the resulting
lessened discharge which also affected the
turbines being compensated by the opening
of valves which at full power diverted all
but a fraction of the stream from the vanes
at rest a slight discharge continued which
served merely to run the cooling system
when the machines were returned to their
hangars the driving element was removed to
cold-storage far beneath the ground

  there were also in the engine room the
gyroscopic balancers and the necessary ap-
paratus for renewing the air which need
not be further described above the en-
gine room at the apex of the cone was the
pilot house it was practically sound-proof
and darkened save for hooded lanlps over
instruments which indicated the tempera-
ture of the driving element the accelera-
tion of the tractor condition of the air etc
a little to one side of the center wras the
tube of a small refracting telescope which
was used in long flights away from the
moon to examine the path of the tractor
and reveal possible obstructions

  we stayed but a moment for the pilot
house was sacred to its occupant and since
the corps of mechanics were now on board
it was time to depart

  the end of time

by henry f kirkham
seven million years into time they travelled to
discover the fate of the human race

i sat up suddenly startled out of a deep
sleep by the unexplainable feeling that
someone was very close to me and that this
individual whoever he might be had no
right to enter my room in the dead of night
for a moment i allowed my eyes to become
accustomed to the faintly luminous gloom
of a moonlit night in midsummer my at-
tention had been focused at once on a

  shadowy figure seated in my armchair i
  strained my eyes in that direction then i
  reached my hand up to the wall behind me
  and switched on the room lights

    as the face and figure of the man in my
  chair leaped suddenly into prominence in
  the bright light i gasped in amazement

    brown  exclaimed what in the
  world-


we were looking with amazement into faces that gazed at
us without surprise and without emotion

  one of those mocking smiles which had
always irritated me flitted across mr
browns lips he seemed to be enjoying
my discomfiture

  you who know me so well he said
should never be surprised at anything i
may do how i came here is of no import-
ance what concerns you is why  came
here

  instantly my mind flashed back across
time to that terrible that incredible adven-



ture of ours in lost atlantis when brown
and i fought for our lives against men who
had been dead ten thousand years of late
months i had begun to doubt the whole
amazing affair  had begun to doubt the
very existence of brown since he had dis-
appeared completely he and his house and
his laboratory and not even the blue mark
on my finger or the half-empty fire extin-
guisher on the wall could convince me that
i had once actually saved his life by putting

out a blaze in his abode those who have
read my time oscillator will recall my
undignified return to the world of today
when i picked myself up from the floor
of my own laboratory the astounding brown
had vanished and a man less scientific than
i would have dismissed that fantastic jour-
ney backward into time as a freak of the
imagination all the weight of deliberate
reason stamped the events as altogether out-
side the pale of prob-
ability if i admitted
to myself that such
events had taken place
then i considered my-
self stark mad and
naturally i could not
admit the latter as-
sumption to be true

  the reappearance of
brown-i had almost
said the apparition of
brown-came there-
fore as a blow at my
very reason but i
realized once and for
all that i really had
gone back to atlantis
and that this man sit-
ting quietly at my bed-
side with that cynical
smile of his was the
wizard who had taken
me there

  awake my friend
continued the master
of time then he
chuckled how typi-
cal  mankind sleeps
while the stars gyrate
in the heavens

  accustomed as i was
to browns bitterness

i merely smiled and
then got out of bed and donned a dressing
gown between brown and myself there
were none of the usual formalities of hand-
shaking such was the power of this re-
markable man that the empty months seem-
ed to vanish and it seemed as though i had
seen him that very day and that we were

december  issue science wonder stories

resuming a conversation begun in the twi-
light

  i called upon you in this rather informal
fashion began my friend in his offhand
manner because you are the only man on
earth who knows me and trusts me the
truth is that i am about to embark on the
most elaborate time-voyage i have ever un-
dertaken before i go any farther i wish to
know whether i can depend upon you as i
have in the past -
whether you are will-
ing to accompany me
on my greatest adven-
ture

 some of the old
spirit of courage and
daring some of the
old love for the biz-
arre rose up in me
and i nodded

  as my disciple
continued brown t
want you to share the
dangers and joys of
this adventure-and i
warn you there will
be more danger than
you have ever faced
before compared to
the trip upon which
we are to launch our-
selves the journey to
atlantis was a mere
visit next door so to
speak and the dangers
we faced were nothing
the dangers xve are to
face you cart imagine
but the joy of this ad-
venture will lie in
viewing what no man
has ever viewed be-
fore - the ultimate
wonders of the time dimension watson
-he paused to give emphasis to what he
was about to say-i intend to venture even
to the end of the world to the end of
time

  the terrific possibilities of what brown
mentioned staggered me for a moment yet
not for an instant did i disbelieve him why

         human race scien-v
  s tists tell us is only a
  creature of his environ-
  ment s long as things
  go well and nature is kind
  he will progress but if an-
  other ice age should come
  there is no assurance that
  he will not disappear and
  the supremacy of the earth
  pass on to the termite or
  the-cockroach 

    but even granting that
  he can withstand the on-
  slaughts of nature he pos-
  sibly carries within him-
  self the seeds of his own
  doom just as an individual
  becomes mature middle
  aged and then senile so it
  happens with a race and a
  species man is still now in
  the flush of his youth but
  what will be the situation
  seven million years from
  now when his primitive
  strength is gone and he can
  no longer do such an ele-
  mentary thing as bring
  children into the world
  this fascinating story
  thrills by its vivid pictures
  of the human race at the
  send of time
the end of time



hould i hesitate i who had accompanied
him before especially since i knew how he
yearned for human sympathy-a common
veakness among great men

  brown i answered trying to keep the
excitement out of my voice no matter
what you do you can count on me-to the
end

  and so brown came once again into my
life against my better judgment i felt
bound to this strange man and if i believed
in destiny as do the mohammedans i
would say that i had been destined to fol-
low him to the ends of time

i had projected into the future in browns
first time machine the same one which
had taken me back to the french revolu-
tion and which had nearly
brought me to my death in
lost atlantis it was a far
cry from that block of cry-
stal in browns laboratory
to the stupendous creation i
was privileged to see a few
weeks after the lost inventor
appeared in my room that
nwht in midsummer

  in a far mountain retreat
hundreds of miles from my
prosaic office i met the man
of the time machine with-
out ceremony he led me to
a cavern that ran into the
side of a lofty cliff and
there deep in the earth i
came upon his laboratory

  brown i said with a smile you re-
mind me of a gnome who performs his won-
ders underground away from the light of
men vulcan worked his forge in the dark-
ness the magicians and the alchemists
teemed to think that darkness was part of
their stock-in-trade really-

  never mind all that said brown wav-
ing his hand at the amazing machine which
stood in a natural grotto in no wise did
ri resemble the time machine of our first
adventure that incredible creation which
introduced me to the possibilities of the
time plane and initiated me into the myster-
ies of time travel was a great block of pure

crystal illuminated by myriads of lights
within and without a cube which appeared
to have an infinite number of cubes within
itself one inside the other in spite of its
divisions it was an entity a single device
browns new machine appeared to consist of
three distinct parts

  the core of the mechanism-if it can be
called a mechanism-was in the form of a
small hollow pyramid surrounded by a
winding glass spiral around both pyramid
and spiral glittered a spherical globe of
brilliant transparent crystal as the crystal
globe radiated the light of the glowing arcs
that were focussed upon it-lights which
gave the time machine its boundless energy
-i could not help laughing aloud at the
impression which struck me i was re-
minded of nothing so much
as an ordinary goldfish
globe with a toy house in
the center through which the
fish could swim when they
got tired of swimming
around the bowl itself

  you laugh said brown
suspiciously perhaps i
should not have trusted you
after all

   hastened to reaure him
and explained the cause of
my ill-advised mirth

  you smile he repeated
seriously at a magnificent
new conception you are
looking with amusement at
the three mathematical sym-
bols typical of natural laws-the curve the
spiral the apex nowhere in creation is
the straight line a part of nature

  what about the level surface of a body
of water i interjected this surface is a
plane and a plane consists of an infinite
number of straight lines

  i was not speaking of planes but of
lines in and by themselves answered
brown by means of these three visible
manifestations i hope to penetrate the
earth plane to a point far distant in the un-
explored future-to a point where animate
life shall cease to exist that will not be
the end of time but as far as conscious

wonder stories

beings on the earth are concerned it will
be the end of time and the beginning of
eternity

  you mean-the end of evolution-the
termination of processes which have been
working themselves out for millions and
millions of years i dont believe it i
said warmly i cannot conceive of the
human race dying out unless some terrific
natural catastrophe takes place-another
glacial age or the collision of the earth
with some other heavenly body and even
then i believe man will be sufficiently ad-
vanced to turn back an advancing glacial
period disease will be conquered by then
-as a physician i predict it with confi-
dence unless all the natural resources of
the earth are exhausted i cannot conceive
of suph a thing-and when they are ex-
hausted science will find a way to replace
them

  i have absolute faith in the future of
man i cannot understand how you expect
to come to the end of the race unless you
come to the end of the world as well-and
in that ease it will be safer not to make the
trip at all for we will never return re-
member that in atlantis we were nearly
murdered by men who have been dead for a
hundred centuries

to the end of time

brown smiled wearily as i have
never been to the end of time he an-
swered i cannot say with certainty when
the human race will vanish and when the
earth will become a dead world but this
much i can tell you-that it will happen
you think of space as infinite but space is
curved we can measure the curve i be-
lieve in cycles i believe the cycle of life
on the earth has a definite limit

  since it was impossible to argue on the
point and get anywhere i turned my atten-
tion once more to the marvellous new time
machine as i came under the glow of the
battery of lights i felt the same abounding
vigor race through me which had once be-
fore filled me with courage for a mad ad-
venture undoubtedly both machines had
the same motive power i mentioned this

to brown who nodded then i explored
the interior of the globe so different from
that cube in which we had visited the dim
past

  as in the original time machine i observ-
ed a camera obscura a series of charts and
electric controls and a curious arrange-
ment of mirrors one piece of equipment
especially attracted my attention it re-
sembled a portable searchlight-something
like the powerful special lights on automo-
biles-and it was attached to what looked
like a metallic helmet

  what is this i asked i never saw it
before

  an atomic disintegrator he replied
one of my own inventions it is more than
likely we will need some deadly weapons
where we are going and since i couldnt
take a battery of field guns i invented some-
thing better this is a very effective weapon
indeed i have a theory of my own about
the future races of man i rather imagine
that man will not progress as far as we
think he will and that at some periods in
his history he will not progress at all the
cycle idea again in case we run foul of
a race of throwbacks we wont be defense-
less automatic pistols were good enough
in atlantis but the men of the future will
laugh at them and even this disintegra-
tor will be no novelty-but its nothing to
laugh at

  it will be a bad day for humanity i
said when a man of our generation has
to help kill off the last human beings on
earth

  lets hope it never comes to that an-
swered brown solemnly yet with a trace of
his usual disillusioned mockery

  are we to wear the wire mesh suits we
used at atlantis i asked

  we wont be able to frighten anyone with
electricity a million years from now said
brown meditatively a though he thought
of it for the first time but ive got them
aboard you never can tell what youll
need for all i know we may run into a
second jurassic age and we may be attacked
by reptiles that will have to be taught to
keep their distance yes by all means we
take the suits and two automatics
the end of time



  what will we do i asked if we find
ifcat the seas have covered the continents-
they did millions of years ago do you
think we stand a chance of getting back
thats part of the adventure responded
brown his eyes lighting up we may find
a race of human beings who have accus-
tomed themselves to an amphibian exist-
ence- believe its possible we came from
the water-why cant we go back to it
what will actually happen if we should
land in the middle of an ocean i cant say
-and whats more i dont like to think
about it but since you think of so many
objections to this trip-perhaps you would
rather not take the chance there is still
time for you to change your mind

  deep in my heart i knew i was setting
oat on a mad enterprise for whereas on
my first trip i believed in brown implicitly
in this case i was firmly convinced that he
was wrong in his original hypothesis but
my idiotic pride or my vanity kept me
ilent and i followed brown into the time
machine

   almost before i realized it he had sealed
tfee globe and turned the control i recog-
nized the blurring of the lights the sense
of flying upward away from the world in-
to a new boundless element  seemed to
epiral into space as the mirrors revolved
with incredible rapidity against my will
i had been projected headlong into the fu-
ture and at terrific velocity i was approach-
ing the end of time

alow chuckle behind me made me
turn on brown in a fury but the ut-
ter calm of his countenance and the care-
less smile which played around his lips made
me remember myself in time after all
he had never been wrong before and it
seemed as though i were fated to share
with him one adventure more the best and
 hoped-the last

  now that youve got me here you may
as well show me how to operate this
machine of yours i said to brown after
a something is liable to happen to you
considering the dangers we are to face and
i ought to have a chance to get back to my
own world

  judging by your attitude answered the
omniscient brown with his bitter smile
you wouldnt be sorry if something hap-
pened to me right now i should have
known better than to take you into my con-
fidence a second time you dont trust me
any more you think im crazy and this
time you think you have proof of it well
before this trip is over i hope to convince
you that im as sane as you are-and per-
haps a lot saner

  im sorry brown i said genuinely re-
gretting by hasty conclusion say no
more about it im with you here and ill
be with you to the end

  thats the way to talk exclaimed the
inventor enthusiastically and now that i
know you wont try anything ill try to
teach you how the machine works

  and for what appeared to be a long time
as the crystal globe tore through time to its
inevitable destination brown instructed me
in the intricate workings of his marvellous
mechanism

  i wonder if i can see that wonderful city
again i remarked you remember i saw
one upon our first trip which seemed to be
built of glass and another that had a vast
spinning globe in the center

  we are far beyond those said brown
solemnly we are two million years in
the future as we speak

  i gasped and then turned to the camera
obscura and flashed off the interior lights
a vast panorama spread before us it was
night upon the world a full moon shone
coldly on a vast city of gleaming glass shin-
ing lke crystal in the white rays it seemed
more like a continent than a city for when
one looks down upon a city from the air
he can discern its boundaries but here as
far as the eye could see was that one vast
dome of glass beneath which the teeming
life of a nation pulsed and seethed through
the mighty arched roof which seemed to
cover the entire earth flashed the myriad
lights that turned night to day inside the
magic structure the entire city or state
or nation-we could discern no distinguish-
ing characteristics-was one immense chain
of structures all connected like the apart-
ment houses we had left behind two million

years before but these were of stupendous
size and it was quite evident that elevators
were unnecessary for any number of people
rose from the glittering floor of the enclosure
and apparently without effort and in defi-
ance of the laws of gravity shot up to any
ledge of apartments they wished to reach

  they have conquered gravity said
brown apparently they use nullifiers if
i saw any wings i could explain the mechan-
ism but as it is i rather think they have
miniature atomic energy devices strapped
to their backs which drive them through the
air he adjusted the lens of the camera
to obtain a clearer focus and exclaimed i
knew it you can see they all carry some-
thing on their backs-something nature
never put there

  and i was right after all i joined
in didnt i say man would conquer the
advancing glacial ages evidently this glass
dome is used to protect the people from the
elements you can see the snow on parts of
it how they get their fresh air i dont
know but its a pretty sure thing that human
beings have learned to conquer the elements
i think youre wrong brown man will
never die out

  you think so asked brown well
that remains to be seen

        chapter ii
        into the earth

the words had hardly left his mouth
when he suddenly put his hand to his
head staggered and fell at the same mo-
ment the time machine gave a splintering
crash and shuddered in every part

  i sprang to the controls to stop our flight
through time there was no need to do so
the machine had stopped of its own ac-
cord

  from the base of browns skull trickled a
little stream of blood evvidently he had
been dazed by a sliver of crystal with my
medical skill and with my first-aid kit it
was a matter of a few moments to restore
him to consciousness he sat up and looked
at me accusingly

  we cant be at the end of our journey

he said i might have known better than
to trust you with the controls henceforth
you will leave the navigating to me and
take the controls only after i am killed
he rubbed the back of his head ruefully
a little farther down and you might have
come to the last men bearing an unusual
gift-a corpse

  the inventor picked himself up and ex-
amined the controls i thought so he
said smashed 

  does that mean- i asked feeling the
blood leave my extremities and congeal
around my heart

  does that mean that you are stranded
out here in time mimicked brown no
it does not your precious skin is safe it
means only that i must replace this delicate
little mechanism with another-and i have
only two thank heaven i exercised my
usual foresight otherwise-but i am sure
you can imagine the rest for yourself

  he opened a locker and from it carefully
lifted a replica of the damaged control
there is only one left he said significant-
ly pointing to another in the locker you
will please confine your activities to obser-
vation not manipulation

  i was too angry to attempt to explain
never in my life did i feel so impelled to
express myself in blistering profanity
browns contemptuous treatment of me-as
thought i were some specimen of imbecile
-made me sorrier than ever that i had ac-
companied him as the machine shuddered
on its way i turned my back on him and
walked to the camera obscura once more
we were hurtling forward through centuries
unborn and as the glittering globe tore on-
ward i gazed again into the future

  you will probably notice said browns
mocking voice from behind me that the
earth is growing colder and colder and that
the glacial areas are spreading i am afraid
we will soon come to the end of all life
i glanced over my shoulder brown waa
not looking into the camera yet he had
predicted precisely what was happening be-
fore my eyes as i watched i realized thal
the extinction of human life was inevitable
for even the glass cities i had seen could
no longer protect man from the mortal chill
the end of time



of a cooling earth and a dying sun dying
the sun might not be and yet the earth was
cooling losing some of the solar heat giv-
ing way to eternal ice and perpetual gloom
the sun shone down at noon no stronger
than the moon i had observed perhaps i
thought the earth had been drawn from its
orbit by another body and was as far from
the sun as mars but whatever the cause
the effect was plain not a living thing was
visible everywhere ice gleaming smooth
cold implacable nowhere the cheering
sight of a solitary creature that drew breath
involuntarily i shuddered and turned away

  you have stopped for a moment at two
way stations on our journey said brown
with grim and almost inhuman humor with
an appalling callousness the next stop
will be the last better get your baggage
ready because this is as far as we go
why i almost shouted youre mad
youre a monster in human form i wish
i had never seen you or heard of your in-
fernal machine i- i stopped some-
thing had happened the time machine
cames to rest with a grinding jar but still
i felt it moving-in what direction i could
not tell i dashed to the camera and dimmed
the lights of the car and before my eyes
the various strata of the earth seemed to
pass in rapid in bewildering procession
we seemed to be sinking down down into
the very bowels of the earth past the outer
strata the deposits of the fern age the fos-
silized skeletons of fabulous monsters
down until i noticed a perceptible increase
in the temperature were we heading for
the center of a dying planet

      ou didnt expeot this chuckled
x brown did it ever occur to you
that human beings could live inside the
earth as well as on its surface weve
reached the end of life on the earth my
friend were on our way to the last rem-
nants of it beneath the surface this was
the best surprise of all he continued un-
able to restrain his mirth in spite of the
horrible things he tossed off so casually
well-whos crazy now

  brown i said my hatred and contempt
drowned in sheer admiration youre the

greatest genius the world has ever known-
but i wish i had never met you and i wish
to heaven i had never made this horrible
journey the thought of what mankind is
coming to the idea that glorious man with
all his magnificent achievements is coming
to this refuge under the earth the idea that
the sun will go out of human life and that
only hideous cold and darkness will remain
is too much it will haunt me the rest of
my days i would rather be an ignorant
south sea islander laughing at the sun
secure in the knowledge that my descendants
will laugh in the sun for generations to
come than the greatest scientist in the
world working on with the realization that
all my discoveries will come to naught and
that everything i do for mankind and
everything mankind has ever done will some
day disappear in the eternal ice of a dying
planet

  bravo exclaimed brown smiling cyni-
cally and applauding at the same time
excellent and now that you have deliv-
ered yourself of a sentiment such as the
world has never heard before you may as
well realize that you will have very little
time to be haunted by anything least of all
by an idea of what the world will come to
in seven million years please realize that
you are at the end this very minute if
you dont live to return to your own world
you wont have to worry about this and
whats gotten into you i thought you were
a man of science an explorer in the ab-
stract ive been talking this way only
because it seems you have been metamor-
phosed into a sentimental fool rather than
an alert man of science pull yourself to-
gether-theres enough to do right now
without weakening you were a strong man
in atlantis-dont fail me now

  oh so thats why you acted so strange-
ly i said rather relieve at his outburst
i was about to ask what had gotten into
you to change you so however- 
what i was about to say was obvious but
i never said it as we stood facing each
other in the midst of the crystal globe the
walls of our time machine seemed to melt
away into invisibility as a red glow all
around the device grew stronger and

stronger and we found ourselves lookking
with amazement into a ring of venerable
faces that gazed at us without surprise and
without emotion

  we have arrived exclaimed brown
with his old laugh and gripping my arm
as if to reassure me he stepped boldly for-
ward and drew me after him into the
enchanted circle

  wait a minute i said weve for-
gotten the automatics and everything else
i dont fancy going among these ghosts
empty-handed

  well we cant go back for anything
now dont forget for a moment this isnt
atlantis its the very opposite and any
false move on our part may result very un-
pleasantly-for us

  i oast longing eyes at the atomic disin-
tegrator and somehow i didnt feel com-
pletely dressed without my holster and its
deadly black burden but a number of
expressionless pairs of eyes were upon me
they seemed peaceful enough but  was
taking no chances with the advanced science
of the final product of human evolution

  meanwhile as at atlantis the time
machine had vanished had i not known
from past experience that it was still there
invisible i would have given up all hope
of ever returning to my own age brown
apparently oblivious of everything else
was studying the quiet figures before him
into my mind flashed a thought which  am
sure was duplicated in his that these strange
men were robed very like the ancient greeks
and romans in the toga and that the simi-
larity was heightened by the sandals they
wore strapped to their feet and ankles it
was a most remarkable resemblance

  perhaps weve unwittingly gone back to
the time of plato i whispered to brown
or we may be in the presence of cicero
these outfits are pretty familiar

  nonsense he said sharply no greek
or roman ever had a head such as you see
here

  and indeed he was right no ancient not
aristotle himself could possibly have pos-
sessed the cranial development of these
silent figures and surely no one in those
times of sunlit paganism appeared so inhu-

man so free from passions and desires no
not plato himself who is said never even
to have lost his temper in eighty years of
life what was most curious they had ut-
tered not a single word since oift arrival
as i had remarked to brown they were
more like ghosts than men

a world-weary race

as if reading my thoughts brown sudden-
ly exclaimed i have it they dont
ned to talk-they have developed thought
transference and by this time they must
have agreed among themselves as to who
we are where we come from and to what
species we belong i feel as though i have
been catalogued in a dozen different minds

  always a good psychologist brown was
willing to let the other side make the first
move and so he simply held up his right
hand palm outward in the universal gesture
of peace and friendliness as this was evi-
dently meant for them the silent spectators
raised their own finely moulded hands in a
similar salute and then slowly lowered
them and remained looking at us in the same
owlish silence

  i felt tempted to latigh the situation
was more than ludicrous-it was a perfect
comic opera setting there is nothing that
can be so disconcerting and at the same
time so farcical as a silent examination by
a group of total strangers

  when the silence reached a point beyond
the power of human beings to endure i cast
all discretion to the wind and announced in
a ringing voice lafayette we are here

  brown himself smiled and an individual
directly opposite me advanced immediately
and seized my hand a curious affinity
seemed to spring up between us travelers
who had been through india used to tell me
of the remarkable feats of the hindu jug-
glers some of these magicians can com-
municate by genuine mental telepathy with
people hundreds of miles away and deliver
messages to them in that manner but first
they must be in sympathy with them-
that is they must have had physical con-
tact a clasp of the hand for example
would be sufficient to establish the rap-
the end of time



port between the juggler and the subject
so it was with me and this man of the last
race of men the moment our hands clasped
a subtle electrical connection seemed to be
established between us and i felt distinctly
the influence of an extremely powerful in-
tellect working on my own brown prob-
ably realized what was going on but he
merely watched me evidently he wished to
see what would happen before he himself
submitted to the process

  thought images were flowing into my
mind clear-cut and unmistakable and
though i could not translate them into
words i received the unmistakable impres-
sion that the man looking deep into my eyes
with ancient world-weary orbs was offering
me welcome i seemed also to catch the
impression that a long wait had come to an
end and that brown and i had appeared on
the scene in time for something momentous

  i think theyre friendly i reported to
brown but dont try to pose as a god
again they wont fall for your bluff

  brown did not notice what i said-or he
pretended not to instead he displayed once
more his amazing knowledge of root words
as he had done at atlantis apparently he
was asking a question the men looked a
trifle surprised then one of them clasped
his hand and it was obvious that my com-
panion also was receiving thought images
i saw him nod then he beckoned to me and
brown and i and the welcoming committee
moved off in the direction of a powerful
light

  it seems they have been expecting us
said brown and before we go any farther
they want us to undergo a treatment which
will purge us of some of the taints of our
gross twentieth-century bodies apparent-
ly they are afraid we will bring them some
forgotten disease i dont believe theres
anything to be afraid of

  brown and i were delivered to the care of
two attendants arrayed in curious protective
garments who conducted us into a small
chamber in an edifice of some gleaming
material unknown to me and shut the door
on us instantly we were conscious of the
action of powerful invisible rays i felt as
though a mild electric current were run-

ning through the body i was filled with a
sense of exalted physical vitality the years
seemed to fall away it was as though i
sloughed off my former skin and assumed a
new one more easily than a snake sheds its
old coat as a physician the process
aroused my curiosity could i but carry
the secret back with me-that is if we ever
found the time machine which had disap-
peared-what a wonderful addition it would
make to the medical lore of the twentieth
century

then we were forced to submit to a
change of attire i felt ill at ease in
my fluttering toga but brown seemed to
enjoy the experience and when he was
completely clad in the curious garments he
looked remarkably like an athenian of the
golden age of pericles i had never noticed
before how finely cut were his features or
how imposing the cast of his head

  have you noticed asked brown how
terribly old these men are-how their eyes
seem to be weary with the weight of cen-
turies i think we have fallen among peo-
ple who realize they are the last men and
who have learned to prolong life indefinite-
ly one thing i have not noticed-have you
seen any young person or persons who
might by a stretch of the imagination be
considered young

  no i havent i answered we seem
to have come down to a race which exists
in a state of senile decay in atlantis there
was youth and beauty and strife and
hatred and war this place reminds me of
the more repulsive ideas of heaven i ac-
quired many years ago every inhabitant
of that blessed abode was venerable and
saintly but unless im very much mistaken
these old men are the very opposite of
saintly they eyed me as i myself might
eye a culture of scarlet fever germs and
in more than one world-weary eye as you
term it i rather think i detected a glitter
which reminded me of a cat looking at a
mouse

  i got the same impression agreed
brown but we must never allow them to
realize that we know more of their charac-
ters-if they have any-than we did before


wonder stories

we landed our best bet is to act gullible
and innocent now that ive seen what the
last men will look like i want to find out
just a little more about them before we go
back

  if we ever get that far i amended
and if we ever find the time machine
again

  brown suddenly smote his forehead by
jove i thought i had forgotten something
they surrounded us so suddenly i didnt
have a chance to mark the place i laid
stones in front of the machine in atlantis
as far as i know  didnt mark the spot
here at all

  as brown spoke i felt myself growing
pale and while he realized the seriousness
of our situation as well as i did it was
not his custom to give way to qualms and
quakings we may find it again he con-
tinued i have a pretty good idea where
we left it but of course most places look
alike down here we may not need the
weapons but how will we ever get back to
where we came from

  perhaps we can live here forever and
let time catch up with us i ventured i
am convinced those rays are used to increase
the life-span i should say that the fel-
lows we have seen are centuries old-each
one of them

  very probable said brown they
remind me of changelings you remember
the story of the irish woman whose infant
was stolen by the fairies-irish mythology
is full of them in place of the human
child they left a fairy changeling which
was its exact double but the mother knew
at once what it was simply because out of
its innocent face looked malicious eyes that
burned with the knowledge of fifteen centur-
ies well thats how our new friends ap-
pear to me their faces are innocent but
their eyes give them away i wouldnt be
surprised if they tried to experiment on us
just as we use frogs for vivisection

chapter iii

the intercepted message

our two attendants approached and
brown addressed them in english

they continued to stare and he tried the
other european languages with equal fail-
ure then he went back to his root words
the same he had used at atlantis and i de-
tected a glimmer of recognition in the deep-
set tired eyes

  you notice said brown to me that
the fundamentals of language scarcely ever
change and just as he had spoken to
the men of the lost continent so now he
spoke to the survivors of the last race as
we walked toward what was apparently the
council chamber of this underground race
he talked easily and surely with the amazed
centenarians whose answers in low flat
monotones seemed to please him immense-
ly i gathered from what he let drop at
intervals that speech was not their usual
method of communication as they had de-
veloped thought transference to a degree
unthought of in backward times like our
own

  i was right after all said brown be-
tween pauses it seems they have been
expecting our arrival i presume they too
have mastered the mysteries of time when
the glacial age became so destructive to life
-in spite of their cities of glass-the more
enterprising members of the human race
with untold centuries of science at their
command turned to their last refuge
some of them ventured to other planets-
some to venus some to mercury but they
were never heard from and the great mass
of the people were compelled through
force of circumstances to follow the lead
of their greatest scientists and delve beneath
the earth for their only certain shelter
against the advancing age of ice we may
hear a great deal more a little later i
have my own theory as to how they got here
how they live and how old they really are
but one thing i cannot understand-why
they should act as though they were expect-
ing us and why they should be so unusual-
ly happy to see us it seems to me as
though they were waiting for someone to
pul to their own uses

  the council chamber if that is what it
was looked like any other immense room-
except that it was equipped with devices f
had never seen before that it had an arti-
the end of time



ficial heaven in which glittered stars so
realistic i had to rub my eyes before i real-
ized we were not in the open air above the
earth at night and that at one end was an
enormous astronomical device something
like the planetarium i had seen in chicago
in my own lime through this i was to
learn later that the earth had changed its
course and that the stars constellations
and planets were not where i had been ac-
customed to look for them

  some had changed their places entirely-
that magnificent spectacle known as the
southern cross was one of them-and oth-
ers were obviously on their way to oblivion
i do not say the stars were dying but per-
haps the erratic course of the earth made
il impossible for them to be seen

  more astounding still the windows of the
room looked forth on what appeared to be
a wonderful garden of tropical foliage it
was more than a garden it looked like a
tiny jungle with the trees and the flowers
gone wild i fancied the palms were stir-
red by a gentle breeze but i felt sure that
this vision was like the starry heaven an
illusion i did not believe it possible that
any sort of plant life had survived the sub-
arctic cold of the earths surface i was
ready to admit that this world underground
had ample light and moist balmy air all
under perfect control it appeared but i
saw here a flat contradiction to the science
of my own day which assumed that the low-
er orders of life could endure longer than
the higher

  the entire display i felt was for artistic
reasons a nostalgia for the ancient heritage
of man lost long ago the sun the skies
the pure air the winds the seas the sweet
smell of young grass and budding flowers
and yet i knew these things had been den-
ied them time out of mind and again i won-
dered by how many centuries each man
reckoned his age

meanwhile brown as spokesman for
the adventurers of a backward age as
the venerable inquisitors termed us was
speaking familiarly to the most impressive
specimen of humanity i have ever seen the
ancient root words stood him in good stead

and where his language failed he seized the
others hand and they understood each oth-
er perfectly at once brown was so ab-
sorbed in his conversation that i deemed it
wise to keep myself in the background and
after almost a half hour of palaver dur-
ing which the leader and several of his com-
panions had addressed themselves to the
time wizard i saw brown suddenly seize the
right hand of the chief and the left hand
of the man who sat next to him

  i was mystified and drew nearer my
companion to be with him in case of troub-
le allhough unarmed as i was my aid
would have been in vain brown still re-
tained the hands of these two men and as
he spoke uttering words that he seemed to
have memorized i saw a look of amazement
cross his face and then a frown of perplex-
ity

  the magnificent brows of the last men
gleamed in the soft cold light their amaz-
ingly large crania covered with silvery
hair nodded slowly and impressively at
every pause and still brown held the
hands of the two men as he talked into the
air these two seemed not to be listening
to him whereas ihe others appeared to pay
attention

  as brown stopped speaking-for lack of
anything further to say i imagine-the con-
clave rose he dropped thehands he was
holding and stepped back to where i had
remained the plot thickens he an-
nounced laconically these fossils are not
as saintly as they look-not by a long shot
i rather admire fcheir brains though

  what were you telling them i asked

  oh the usual thing-that i come from
another age millions of years back-which
they understand perfectly they have been
expecting someone for centuries and they
are surprised no one came before this in
view of the fact that they themselves know
so much about time travel when i asked
them why they didnt travel back to a
warmer age they declared that while they
knew it was quite possible their time expert
had departed this life and they confessed
frankly that with all their millions of years
of science and with all their tremendous
brain power they were incapable of con-


wonder stories

atructing an apparatus which would take
them all to a milder period of history
quite a compliment for me i think
you should be flattered i answered
did you offer the use of your own ma-
chine

  am i insane asked brown i want
to get back some time myself-i want them
to forget all about my own invention they
may decide to keep me here to build one for
them and i dont think i can do it

  then why did you suddenly become so
affectionate as to grasp the hands of those
two old fellows

  ah said brown with satisfaction this
time i have put one over on them i told
them that i was honored beyond words to
be the first to grasp the hands of the two
leaders of a race so advanced you may
have noticed that i recited something i had
memorized and you may also have noticed
that they paid very little attention to me
allowing me to hold their hands was an act
of diplomacy on their part i must find
other occasions for hand-holding its too
bad there arent any pretty girls here i
might have a legitimate excuse if there
were

  that reminds me i said i havent
seen any women

  oh they probably exist said brown
but what i learned is of more importance
you know they communicate by telepathy
which in this place is an art and a science
well holding the hands of both of them
 intercepted their messages and all the
time they were pretending to listen to me
they were in reality deciding that you and
i were to go on a long journey to some
other race in this underground world-and
unless i am very much mistaken we are to
go as hostages for something

  hostages

  i only think so said brown we will
find out very shortly i have an idea i can
worm some information from one of our
guides i will ask them to take me on a
tour of the place and if i find out what i
imagine ill find out-that is unless they
are too wary for me-then ill know that
im not making any mistake

  i found i was growing sleepy and brown

too was wearied by the events of our jour-
ney but nowhere in the spacious halls did
we find anything approximating a bed
brown soon learned from the attendants that
sleep had been mastered thousands of years
before and that the last men required none
of it i suppose their ray treatments re
moved the poisons of fatigue at any rate
brown and i stretched out in the most con
venient spot and our guides understanding
perfectly what troubled us withdrew and
left us to our slumbers

a struggle for existence

the next morning-i call it morning
simply because im used to it although
there was neither night nor aay in that
phantom land-we were fed on capsules
containing high-powered food content i
discovered that our hosts ate on an an aver-
age of twice a week and as a physician i
could understand the state to which they
had brought themselves

  on our tour of inspection-on which
brown had insisted- my companion spoke
easily and carelessly to the guides leaving
me to take my notes alone and everywhere
was ample evidence of the wonderful mind
of man the atmosphere was supplied as

	had imagined-vast pumps of a size and
structure unknown in my own day drew
in the clean cold air at one opening in the
earths surface and expelled it at another
under high pressure everywhere the il-
lusion was preserved that the inhabitants of
ultima-as brown termed it-were walk-
ing on the surface of the planet

  the earth enclosure was artfully dis-
guised giving the illusion of vast distance
even to the mirage of a horizon line with
trees and buildings standing out against the
sky how much labor must have been ex-
pended in the construction of this under-
ground world staggered the imagination i
understood however the motive for all this
the last men realizing that their hour had
come had devoted themselves to work as
the only means of keeping alive their spirit
the the only salvation from the maddening
realization that with them the human race
the pride of the universe had reached its
the end of time



last representatives and so these inhabi-
tants of a plate which never knew the sun
fabricated for themselves cold light from
myriad sources which replaced the blessed
light to which i was accustomed and in
their planetaria they set suns which never
ceased to throw their light on the surround-
ing planets

  the broad streets designed obviously for
air space were almost deserted in spite of
the fact that once a populous race must have
passed over them people who walked from
these thoroughfares into tunnels for quick
transportation to other parts of the city
evidently the last men had returned to the
realization that walking was not an evil
unmodified for they encouraged this mild
exercise on every occasion and reserved in-
credibly swift mechanical transportation for
long distances yes the race was shrink-
ing for while i saw aged countenances
everywhere the faces of men who outlived
methuselah nowhere did i see the erect
figures and the radiant countenances that de-
noted youth

  brown observing all this shook his head
sadly its a pity he repeated again and
again it seems they are unable to repro-
duce a race of young men with the scien-
tific knowledge of their ancestors could yet
make this planet the proud home of man
have you discovered anything i asked
anything that concerns us i mean
nothing that concerns us directly he
answered but i am putting two and two
together and i rather imagine the result
will be four i have learned that there is
another race living underground here-on
the other side of the planet as far away as
possible from this one an inferior race
regarded with contempt by the people
among whom we have fallen but a race
which of course is far ahead of our own
these people whom we have never seen
outnumber our kind hosts ten to one and
as far as i can gather there is no love lost
between them

  why cant they live together in amity

	asked  should think that at the end
of the world all personal enmities would
be forgotten in the struggle to maintain the
race of man on or in the planet as long as

possible why should there be any hostil-
ity between the last two races of man

  why echoed brown well i admit
there shouldnt be one would think the
brotherhood of man would reach its highest
point now if ever but i adhere to my
cycle theory i believe that as the circle
closes as the last point on the circle moves
toward the first differences are swept away
and the last men become like the first oh
j dont mean primitive i mean that in spite
of all the science of the ages the essential
nature of man has not changed sad to say
and while all men may have been brothers
a couple of million years ago the spirit of
nationalism-call it that for want of a bet-
ter name-is still rampant

  the superior race instead of aiding and
uplifting the inferior despises it the infer-
ior race instead of trying to imitate the
other instead of working its way into its
good graces merely hates and fears and
so it stands the same old situation all over
again from the moment one man showed his
superiority over another-the same old en-
mity that existed between the neanderthals
and the cro-magnons i think my cycle
theory is right

the guides were beckoning to us again
drop behind ordered brown ive
got to discover some more alout our unseen
friends on the other side of the world

  i	walked slowly after him trying to ap-
pear indifferent to what he was saying my
own attempts at conversation were carried
on by telepathy which was quite easy as
long as i held the hand of the guide i must
have cut a ridiculous figure walking hand-
in-hand with this patriarch like a child with
its nurse

  after showing us around the outward bat-
tlements of the city our guides escorted
us to a building which seemed to contain
nothing but elevators we shot up at dizzy
speed-miles it seemed-and emerged into
the most splendidly-equipped observatory
the human mind can imagine the elevator
had been run through a mountain peak and
this observatory high above the surface of
the earth was the last point of contact with
the outer world


wonder stories

  here a few fortunates protected from the
intense cold by a great dome of crystal so
vast that the giant telescopes worked with-
in it and so clear that visibility was not
interfered with in the least surveyed the
heavens instruments unheard of in my time
noted and recorded the slightest variations
in sidereal and stellar motions for cen-
turies this system had produced the most
complete and minutely accurate system of
star maps in existence and so powerful
were the telescopes that these men of the
future had been able to study animate life
on the nearest planets

  mars i noted had sustained life of a
high order long past my time-dimension
venus supported a limited life cycle of a
low type but at the time i saw these charts
mercury the only planet suitable for any-
thing like human habitation in view of the
waning powers of the sun had developed a
system of life and evolution similar to what
we know of the beginning of life on the
earth

  ten planets were listed in all-eight of
which i had known one had been discovered
in my life-time and as for the one unknown
to me i could not doubt its existence it
was to this observatory and its calculations
that the planetaria beneath the earths sur-
face owed their superhuman accuracy at
any period the marvellous mechanisms
miles beneath this mountain-top contained
exact replicas of what the astronomers re-
corded wireless telephony television and
mental telepathy all combined to keep the
lower astronomical stations accurate to the
fraction of a minute through these record-
ings also i learned that my old friend the
north star no longer occupied his place as
a cardinal point but that he had been re-
placed millions of years before by another
sun

  what is the use of all this i asked
brown with the exception of the astron-
omers no one here ever sees the stars why
then all this trouble to map the heavens
day after day when the race is dying off

  the will to live probably said brown
even though they know the race is dying
off they still remain men proud to the
last but they have one hope-they have a

  means to continue the race if only they can
lay hands on-or rather if they can get
enough of-a radioactive substance of un-
usual properties-a substance of which i
never heard before

  how can they use this to reproduce
well as i see it answered brown their
females are too old and too sterile-through
long habit-to be of any use in that respect
and as you saw the men themselves are en-
tirely too aged but for centuries they used
ectogenesis-and this substance will either
fertilize the females unattractive as they
are or else it will react on let us say a
uterus which has been separated from the
body in either case the result will be the
same

  i heard something about that back in our
own time i answered thoughtfully but
as a physician i could never understand how
the offspring could develop away from the
mothers body-without the necessary blood
stream to nourish it

  apparently things have developed in
medicine since your time said brown
but the important thing-as far as we are
concerned-is something else something
only remotely connected with this method
of producing life what i have discovered
is that this radioactive element is used to
manufacture the food capsules and that
only a certain amount of it is allowed for
food and for use in the ray treatments
what do ycra mean by allowed i
queried who can say how much or how
little shall be taken

  have you forgotten the other race i told
you of asked brown with his irritating
smile it appears that this radioactive de-
posit while very large and consisting of
something i never heard of-something in-
deed discovered only a thousand centuries
ago-is the last of its kind in the earth
the plutonic regions have been pretty well
searched and this is the last source of life
well the hostile race is afraid that if our
old friends get an oversupply of this ele-
ment they will fertilize their females or
produce offspring in the other way i men-
tioned and that will be directly contrary to

a method of breeding children apart from the
body of the mother
the end of time



their interest yon see like all inferior
races the one i am speaking of fears an in-
crease in the superior race they are
afraid-needlessly perhaps-that with an
increase in the population the greater race
will fall upon them and exterminate them
taking for itself the radioactive deposits
which are vital to both races even here
the law of the primitive holds good self-
preservation is said to be the first law of
nature apparently it is also the last
and you say this alien race outnumbers
the greater at least ten to one

  brown nodded

  then it requires ten times the amount
of the element that this one requires
your reasoning said browrn would
do credit to a newton such indeed is
the case

  then why doesnt this lower species ex-
terminate the higher and keep all the miner-
al for itself

  ah said brown there you have it
our friends run the earth-what is left of
it without their science i doubt whether
the other race would survive very long our
guide has informed me that we are going
to see something more wonderful still i
imagine that the scientific work done here
keeps their enemies from falling on them
as far as i can judge the matter was fought
out not very long ago-only a few centuries
ago-and both sides realize the futility of
further loss of life the superior weapons
of this side just about balance the superior
number on the other a sort of armed neu-
trality exists an increase in the population
here would mean war and the final destruc-
tion of one side or the other and so the
circle goes one point leading to another
and all leading back to the beginning

  but where do we come in to act as host-
ages as you said

  that said brown i havent thought
out yet but i have a pretty good idea ill
know it before long

chapter iv
hostages

on our way down in the elevator i
thought it prudent to change the sub-
ject wherever i went i felt the cold eyes

of my guide upon me it was as though he
were looking through me into my inmost

being

  did you notice the two planets with rings
around them i asked brown as we shot
earthward

  yes he answered and one of them is
the earth at this moment the earth has a
ling like saturn and the moon has vanished
from the heavens you probably know that
the moon receded from the earth and then
approached it and that at a critical point
the gravity of the earth and the gravity of
the sun acting upon it split it apart and
its fragments formed an orbit around this
planet shapley was right after all

  the elevator had reached the underworld
but instead of stopping it continued down-
ward until the heat became almost unbear-
able and there perhaps was the ultimate
achievement of man the tapping of the incal-
culable supply of heat still remaining in the
depths of the earthcore what had been a
great dream in my own day was an every-
day reality here in an enormous cavern
illuminated with cold light-a cavern be-
yond the black confines of which red tongues
of flame writhed and roared as they had in
the imagination of dante-gigantic pol-
ished engines throbbed to the terrific power
pulsing even then through thecenter of the
icy planet what a contrast

  what purpose the power generated was
put to i did not imagine at the moment
unless it was for driving the vast air pumps
and for assisting in the manufacture of the
artificial moistened atmosphere but i
noted that whatever work was necessary was
performed by robots of superbly ingenious
construction working in heat which no hu-
man being could long endure and then
we were shown one of the most amazing
feats of engineering in the entire under-
ground world it seemed incredible that
brown could be talking of his own unim-
portant affairs when he viewed the magni-
ficence of the achievements of the last men

  i	had long known that the earth as it
rushed through space generated millions of
volts of electrical power and that this power
flowed around it in a great stream to har-
ness this intangible and yet tremendous


wonder stories

force would have seemed out of the ques-
tion and yet as their supreme achievement
the last men had done just that

  brown and i were shown seven immense
helices of tightly wound wire that extended
upward it seemed for an infinite distance
these were the bases of seven mighty hills
that in happier days had been wrapped in
the copper coils-wires of a nature to excite
the magnetic fields induced by the fields of
the sun that immense and perfect dynamo
the earth the nearest approximation to per-
petual motion had been harnessed to keep
alive the men who had vanished from its
surface the incalculable electrical energy
derivd from the rotation of the earth was
put to working the machines that tapped the
earths heat and these in turn giving power
to so many other devices in reality made
life possible and so at the very end man
had cheated the earth which had cheated
him of life on its surface my making its
very vitals serve his needs one thing alone
he could not do-and that was reproduce his
own kind the most elementary function of
nature he could not perform

  when brown and i returned to the coun-
cil chamber we were informed that our
education was not yet complete that we
were to take a journey to the people on the
other side of the world and that we would
remain there for some time brown winked
at me i began to get the drift of the ar-
rangement

  as i understood from what brown trans-
lated for me we were to be shot through a
long straight tunnel in a magnetic car
drawn forward with incredible rapidity by
powerful electric currents although the
world under ground had been pretty well
hollowed out making it possible for one
race to attack another in deadly combat
rapid transportation was still carried on
through tunnels i understood that one tun-
nel led directly to the deposit of radioactive
material and that at regular intervals both
races sent out cars for supplies these
times were agreed upon in advance and as
an evidence of the absolute trust the last
two races of men reposed in each other the
deposit was protected by an array of photo-
electric cells and television devices making

it impossible for one party to carry away
the element without the other knowing of
it this then was what prevented my hosts
from stealing enough of the mineral to cause
reproduction but something told me that
was not enough

t see it all now said brown and i
a must say its devilishly clever our old
people here must send two of their members
every period as hostages with the under-
standing that if they try to abstract any
of the stuff the hostages will be put to
death the old roman idea all over again
the only reason they dont go back on these
two victims is that human life here is so
terribly precious it isnt worth the risk to
cause the death of a great scientist simply
to bring about the birth of a lot of potential
scientists

  then that means     i began
exactly said brown with these robes
and with the benefit of the ray treatments
we resemble them to an amazing degree
these enemies of theirs will never know the
difference our good friends can steal all
the stuff they want and you and i will pay
the price capital i wonder whether that
was why they welcomed us so eagerly
this is what comes i said bitterly of
trying to put your wits against creatures
millions of years in advance of you what
are we to do now we cant escape to the
time machine because we dont know where
it is and even if we did know i doubt
whether we could get away i never dream-
ed that i was to die seven million years after
my time

  oh ill find a way out said brown
easily with superb self-confidence it
would be easy enough if we had our weap-
ons but this adds a little more fun to the
adventure imagine escaping from the fu-
ture and returning to the past

  youre only saying this to keep up my
spirits i answered gloomily you dont
believe it yourself

i dont eh asked brown with his con-
temptuous smile then look at this
from beneath the folds of his toga he
drew a long sliver of crystal strong as steel
and sharp as a needle you dont think i
the end of time



let myself go unprepared do you he
v eered ltthose who accompany us are
i ing to get the surprise of their lives i
c nt suppose anyone has been stabbed down
fy-re for ages but i intend to introduce an
it novation

  put it away  ordered looking hastily
around you wont gel anywhere with
tiat you havent a chance in the world
now you listen to me said brown and
listen closely when we get in that car
were as good as dead unless we can con-
vince the people at the other end of the
arth who we are and what sort of a trick
being played on them  have an idea
that theyre not such a bad sort after all
but i dont want to do that ive seen as
much of the last men as  want to and im
mtisfied i dont mind not seeing the other
race-i can imagine what its like my only
desire is to get back to our own century
and ill get back there if i have to kill off
every man in ultima

  already our diplomatic hosts were ap-
proaching us laden with curious objects
timeo danaos el dona ferentes chuckled
brown

  what i asked

  dont you remember your latin asked
brown in amusement i fear the greeks-
even when they come bearing gifts if these
fellows dont look like greeks bearing gifts
then i dont know anything if they were
besieging a town i would expect to see a
wooden horse

  our ancient friends led us to the mouth
of a large tunnel and indicated to us a
curiously shaped car completely enclosed
on top by a covering of crystal which re-
minded me faintly of the torpedo-shaped
racing cars favored by barney oldfield of
revered memory the car stood on a shin-
ing metal track like a monorail affair it
was apparent that a large wheel beneath the
center of the vehicle was the only means of
propelling it and while i sought for a
rocket attachment i saw none

already two of the ultimates had
taken their places in the machine
brown and i in the face of a score of an-

cients who looked remarkably vigorous
for their age and who undoubtedly had
weapons concealed under their flowing
robes thought it the part of wisdom to en-
ter also into our hands they thrust cur-
ious vessels of a metal like beaten gold-
probably peace offerings to distinguish the
hostages from their conductors

  brown sitting next to one of the guides
watched intently as his companion pressed
down a lever the car seemed to spring
forward there was none of the backward
pull of inertia in spite of the fact that the
pull of gravity was greater because we
were closer to the center of the earth than
are the trains of my own generation i
could not realize the speed at which we
were traveling first becausc there was no
noise second because there was no vibra-
tion and third because whenever i looked
through the windows the blackness outside
remained uniform-i could see nothing
rushing past the car i judged was bal-
anced by gyroscopic control which derived
its power from the track

  i began speaking to brown in the most
natural way in the world taking care not
to touch my guide and hoping i would not
be understood

  suppose we overpower these two birds
and make them take our places i asked
then we could bring the car back our-
selves with some sort of story

  i thought of that said brown but i
have a better plan i dont think i can
get the other people to attack our friends
they wouldnt believe me and they would
only imagine i was drawing them into a
trap with men of superior intellect it
doesnt pay to attempt ordinary means i
want to get hold of some of the weapons
our hosts have hidden and i think i know
a way to do it this isnt atlantis dont
forget here its brain against brain and
mine is the second best by a long shot

  i remained silent and brown engaged his
companion in conversation pressing one
line of questions the other stooped and
drew from beneath the seat two peculiar
objects i had never seen their like be-
fore except in museums they resembled
nothing so much as the corselets the knights


wonder stories

used to wear when they went forth to kill
dragons and to knock their opponents from
their horses but i knew very well that
these devices were something different
brown seemed to be intensely interested
he toyed with it examined it and finally
tried it on it covered him from throat to
waist

  this is used to ward off the peculiar
bullets they use down here he explained
to me it will be handy to have around
when things start popping i understand
that our not-so-distant enemies have weap-
ons like pistols from which they can shoot
devastating rays-some ort of concentra-
ted cathode ray i imagine these rays
are effective at a distance and when they
dont kill they exert a paralyzing effect
these protectors turn the rays aside they
neutralize them my guide tells me that
the rays of our enemies are not as deadly
as the explosive bullets of those we thought
were our friends i must get hold of the
latter weapons-theyll be very important
to us

  meanwhile i must say i am terribly
disappointed-i really expected something
unusual in the way of a deadly device
why even in our own backward day men
had learned to kill each other on the mass
production principle i really dont know
what the world is coming to

  on browns face was his most cynical
smile he seemed to enjoy his grim jest
i took heart at his attitude it always pre-
saged that he had found a way out of our
difficulties

  how long we were traveling i do not
know it may have been an hour or it may
have been two or three but the car halted
as suddenly as it had started as we rolled
into an illuminated open space a group
of men looking more vigorous and a great
deal younger than our late hosts stood
awaiting our arrival i noted that they
were all armed-another graceful tribute
to international amity-and that in their
midst were two men of the race i had just
visited evidently these were the hostages
that were to be returned-in exchange for

  brown turned to me with a smile be
us

ready to leap into this car at any moment
he said in the most matter-of-fact way
this is the most exciting game of chess 
was ever in

chapter v

cornered

we alighted from the vehicle and ap-
proached the group of soldiers who
inturn advanced to us our guides ad-
dressed them in their own language
brown handed over the gold vessels and
the two former hostages prepared to take
our places in the car as i stood on one
side i was amazed to see one soldier and
then another crumple silently to the ground
and lie still

  it was all over before i could realize
what had happened they fell like nine-
pins tumbling over each other in grotes-
que heaps and i could swear i detected a
look of astonishment on their faces the
last man standing faced brown and reached
for his ray pistol brown laughed as the
mans hand closed over an empty holster
the next moment he too lay on the ground
and before our astounded friends could say
a word they also had joined the platoon
of the silent and the prostrate

  brown surveyed his achievement with
evident pleasure-nay with relish he
played with the ray pistol he had abstracted
from the soldiers belt as the gifts were
handed over well he asked with his
quizzical smile how does it strike you
speechless i answered are they all
dead

  i hope not he answered but if they
are their blood is on their own heads
well were going back

  what i exclaimed back where we
came from

  certainly do you want to remain here
and get caught hop in

  we climbed into the car after we had
provided ourselves with a holster and pistol
apiece brown ordered me to don one of
the protective garments as he did and
rumaging under the seat he found head-
protectors like close-fitting helmets which
we saved for emergency
the end of time



  brown stepped on the lever and the car
darted back on the path it had come as
we sped back to ultima the time master
outlined his plan to me making sure the
corselets were carefully concealed under our
robes he battered the inside of the car with
the butt of his weapon chipped the crystal
dented the outside then he held out his
robe and put a few holes through it where
they would be immediately noticed  fol-
lowed suit wondering at the audicity which
had carried him alive from atlantis and
which was now to lead him into conflict
with men even million years ahead of him
in the scale pf evolution it was like a
man of the old stone age fighting a modern
soldier but then brown was so far ahead
of his own generation that he could not
really be said to belong to any age

  as we dashed into the illuminated circle
we had left a few hours before brown stood
up fcis hair disheveled his aspect wild and
shouted again and again in the tongue of
the last race if ever i beheld astonish-
ment on those impassive faces this was the
moment we are being attacked he or-
atorized in his most effective manner at
least that is what he told me he said i for
one could not understand him

  they killed our friends before our very
eyes he continued they are bent on
destroying you and keeping the planet for
themselves no longer do they need you
you are doomed even at this moment
your lives are approaching their ends

  with resignation on their faces but with-
out haste and without apparent fear the
ultimates made a concerted move for a
building which stood apart thats what
i wanted to know whispered brown
thats where they keep their arms i rath-
er thought they would rush for them

  with the basest ingratitude the ancient
warriors forgot us entirely-at least they
forgot to supply us with weapons per-
haps they considered us incapable of using
them strangely glittering side-arms dang-
led at the sides of venerable scientists ev-
ery man carried on his shoulder enough
power to decimate an army in an incred-
ibly short space of time the entire city had
been surrounded with protective photo-

electric devices arranged to explode mines
of terrific power outside its gates de-
tachments went below down into the earth
itself to watch over the precious machinery
that gave the underground world its breath
of life others went up into the observa-
tory to defend to the last the noblest pur-
suit of mankind but on every face was a
look of utter resignation as though this
were the end indeed but on every face
also i noted the stony determination to pre-
serve the highest achievements and aspira-
tions of the human race to the very last

in the general bustle and excitement
brown and i were unnoticed we had
failed in our destined function and these
men had no further use for us

  i think i know where we left the time
machine said brown if we can get
there unobserved it will be easier than i
expected after all why should they want
us to remain here

  we moved in the direction indicated
our way lay directly past the great eleva-
tors which connected the ground with the
observatory unnoticed we paused at our
car to pick up the helmets we had found
as we repassed the elevators one of the
lightning-fast cars descended and the chief
of the council chamber stepped forth he
looked at us curiously suddenly he step-
ped forward and caught my hand in his
and looked deep into my eyes i tried to
struggle away from him but it was too late
in that moment he had read what was in my
mind he saw clear as day the deceit and
the trickery with a dramatic movement
he tore open my robe and as the enemy
pistol met his gaze he raised his voice in
command to his subordinates

  he started to speak then he suddenly
sank to the ground a burning hole in his
forehead run for it said brown hold-
ing his pistol hes told them we are ene-
mies within their gates in league with the
enemies without and the discovery of that
enemy pistol spilled the beans put on
your helmet and follow me

  as we adjusted the protective metal and
backed away he said  could shoot up in
an elevator and smash the dome of the ob-

servatory and let in the cold to kill them
all but itll probably kill us before we find
the time machine and i dont dare take the
chance

  something struck me in the chest-some-
thing that exploded and emitted poisonous
fumes lucky we have these armor
plates said brown turning his ray gun on
our pursuers

  instead of falling they continued to ad-
vance slowly methodically knowing that
we were trapped and enjoying the cat-and-
mouse situation their own protective
corselets and helmets were more than suffi-
cient to ward off the rays

  aim for their legs ordered brown fir-
ing over his shoulder as he turned and ran
at full speed in the direction of a rosy glow

  i turned once to fire as he had ordered
the leader of the party wavered and fell on
his face struggling to rise and then i too
ran in the direction of the glow

  explosive bullets scorched us through
the projectors a score of times my helmet
withstood the impact of a projectile at
intervals brown and i stopped for a frac-
tion of a second to fire another round but
whenever we did our erstwhile friends
threw themselves flat on the ground and
presented nothing vulnerable it became
a game of tag more grim than anything i
had ever imagined

  suddenly brown screamed a bullet
better aimed than the rest had glanced off
his unprotected left arm and the explosion
while it did not tear off the unfortunate
member disabled it at once still we ran
toward the strengthening glow and brown
staggered and would have fallen had  not
caught him we held our arms before our
bodies now firing only at intervals a
bullet struck an inch behind my heel and
the flame burned like the fixes of hell
limping as i was i had to support the al-
most unconscious brown more seriously
wounded than i was

  suddenly i realized why none of our
shots took effect the pistols had been dis-
charged the limited amount of energy was
gone

  in a fit of fury i turned ignored all dan-
ger and hurled the weapon full at the on-

coming ultimates the heavy pistol flung
with the desperation of insanity thudded
with a satisfying crunch against the knee-
cap of a leader and if i am any sort of
physician it was a smashed knee that
brought him crashing to the ground and
then as we hurried forward brown and i
received a crushing blow from before us
something that sent us reeling back

  quick he gasped we must have
run into the time machine i pressed for-
ward cautiously found the door of the in-
visible mechanism and shoved him through
it just as a bullet whistled over his head
struck the delicate controls and demolished
them with a blinding flash

  curse you i shouted following brown
into the machine and shutting the door
my friend lay on the floor a bloody sight
heaving convulsively brown i said
can you still work the disintegrator

  something like a smile appeared on his
face i lifted off his helmet and replaced
it with the helmet of the deadly atomic
weapon then i seized one of my substan-
tial automatics opened the door and fired
the heavy slug ploughed through the ar-
mor as through silk it was a pleasure to
see the honest lead crumple up a soldier
who was aiming at the invisible time mach-
ine something i had not noticed before-a
field piece which would have blown us and
the great crystal globe to atoms

hitting the mark

my automatic spurted flame and death
among the last men of the world be-
hind the eye-pieces of their helmets i could
imagine their deep eyes wide with amaze-
ment at the efficiency of a forgotten weap-
on as i reached for the other loaded gun
i heard a terrific roar and the ground shook
beneath us brown laughing weakly lay
prone on the floor and where a host of
enemies had stood was nothing but a gap-
ing hole in the earth and the reek of burn-
ing flesh and here and there a fragment
of a body a piece of armor plate a shred of
clothing a length of rifle

  belter than i thought gasped brown
with a chuckle as he lapsed into uncon-
the end of time



ciousness i could have-blown the
whole-damn-nation-to hell

    i slammed the door shut and pulled the
  unconscious brown into a corner for a
  few moments at least we were safe from
  further attack i darted for the locker that
  contained the last set of controls i knock-
  ed off the damaged mechanisms cleaned the
  horizontal plates set the new controls on
  them and turned the lever nothing hap-
  pened were we to be stranded forever
  here in time

   looking round wildly i glanced at
  brown he was too far gone to be revived in
  a moment to my practised eye his con-
  dition seemed to be serious then my mind
  flashed back to the time he had rebuked
  me had i seen a key was it not true
  that he had distrusted me to the extent of
  taking the key from the controls

    i felt around his neck there was a
  chain on the chain was a peculiar key i
  jammed it into the lock on the control
  board moved the lever and listened
  there was a faint vibration the lights
  above me shed a flood of strengthening
  radiance and then looking down i dis-
  covered i was naked and brown lying
  on the floor his left arm bleeding and swell-
  ing the flesh charred and horrible to see
  was as unclad as a satyr in the far-away
  pagan days of classic myth

    as in ancient atlantis whatever we took
  with us disappeared as soon as we were in
  another time dimension in that case we
  took with us things long since turned to
  dust which vanished and here we wore
  garments which had as yet no real existence
  but  was more concerned with brown and
  after setting the control for our own cen-
  tury i shut off the camera obscura which
  had been left in operation-so as not to be
  distracted-and gave all my attention to
  the unconscious wizard

    browns arm was fractured at the elbow

   washed the wound with antiseptic solution
  from my medical kit taped the broken skin
  and improvised a splint for the burned and
  shattered bone as far as i judged the
  work consumed the better part of an hour

brown was still unconscious probably from
the riakssi	 f jn explosive bullet

and i deemed it wisest to leave him in mer-
ciful oblivion i prepared a hypodermic
to deaden his pain when he came to him-
self in order to keep up his strength i
forced between his lips a little hot concen-
trated soup we had brought in vacuum bot-
tles

  then i cleaned myself up as well as i
could patched up my scorched heel swal-
lowed a few cups of the strengthening liq-
uid and rummaged in the inexhaustible
locker for decent apparel no matter
where we came we could never emerge in
our embarrassing state and brown might
die for lack of prompt hospital attention

  in the locker i found three pairs of an-
cient trousers such as men love to go fish-
ing in brown had his human side after
all i slipped into one of the garments my-
self pulled the other up over browns
limbs and felt once more like a human be-
ing the locker yielded one flannel shirt
which i appropriated for myself i judged
it better for brown to leave his injured arm
free

  then and then only did i flash on the
camera obscura but what i saw convinced
me that we had still a long way to go hun-
dreds of thousands of years and i inspected
the controls put my faith in browns mach-
ine and stretched myself out on the floor
for a little rest

  presently i began to grow drowsy the
machine vibrated onward through century
after century hurtling invisible through the
fourth dimension to an age long past un-
der the glowing roof lights i felt invigora-
ted and refreshed and basked in them as i
would in a flood of sunshine the sun
how long was it since i had seen the sun-
the one i knew and loved not the sickly
dying dwarf star of the ultimates

and then the vibration died down and
stopped the machine i sensed gently
came to rest as in the time when i visited
the dungeons of the french revolution i
stood in another room i stood invisible but
 grasped the controls so as not to lose
myself

  the room in which i stood and in which
lay the unconscious brown was vaguely

 down the hill they came-like
 flying shadows theres thous-
 ands im exclaimed perkins

undefeated-the scourge was supreme in the town
an army was held at bay

the chief of police was having an un-
pleasant time his face was flushed
and he was frowning under the questioning
of the citizens committee benson the
chairman was his most insistent tormenter

  what do you expect us to do mr ben-
son we even borrowed men from the new
york department if they cant find out
anything it proves that it aint our fault
dont it

  benson shook his head were tired of
alibis hennessy ten or twelve men dis-
appeared again last week if you cant
find out whats back of it all well have to
get someone who can

  while the chief paused to think up the

most effective reply there was a knock at
the door come in he growled

  a plainclothes man thrust his head into
the room say chief theres a guy out-
side claims he just seen a man carried off
by a big bug or something i guess hes
nuts but i thought mebbe youd want to
see him says his names henry todd
lock him up ordered hennessy im-
patiently i got no time for nuts or
drunks tonight

  wait a minute chief interrupted ben-
son i know todd better bring him in
and lets hear what he has to say

  hennessy looked his disgust saw a
man carried off by a big bug did he
thats the craziest story yet all right
mr benson anything to oblige bring the
guy in dugan

  a minute later a white-faced little man
evidently badly frightened entered the
room followed by a group of reporters

  you cant come rn here growled the
chief to the reporters well let you
know later what we got to give out

  better let us stay chief said one of
them weve got this guys story already
and its a wow

  i dont see any objection to the reporters
being here said benson

  people are always disappearing and nev-
r being heard of again sometimes one
of these disappearances get in the news-
papers but usually not a man grows tired



of the monotony of life and wanders off to
start a new and more exciting life else-
where women disappear for much the
same reason most of these cases are re-
ported to the police who as a rule pay lit-
tle attention to them they are pigeon-
holed for reference in case a body is dis-
covered floating in the river

  however ten persons disappearing from
a small town in one week was a different
matter south change is a fairly aristo-
cratic suburb of new york and many of the
inhabitants are well-known people it is
true that three of the missing were servants
but the other seven were the kind of persons
who are regarded as important one was
a bank president two were manufacturers
and one a wall street broker the remain-
ing three were men who had retired from


wonder stories

business with comfortable incomes

  it seemed unlikely that these ten persons
should drop out of sight voluntarily sin-
ister rumors began to circulate at first
an effort was made to keep the matter from
the newspapers a private detective agen-
cy was called in and its operatives could be
seen day and night
gumshoeing through
the oranges then at
the end of another
week it was found that
five of the private
detectives had disap-
peared as well as sev-
eral more of the resi-
dents of the town

  that sunday the
new y ork mirror
published a sensation-
al account of the dis-
appearances it sug-
gested that an organ-
ized blackmail and
murder gang was at
work in the vicinity of
new york and gave a
list of the men who
had dropped out of
sight

  this first article
blew off the lid the
other newspapers fol-
lowed with sensational
write-ups most of
them dwelt on the
blackmail - murder
gang theory the
times was the first to
suggest that there
might be something
even more serious at
the bottom of the mys-
tery

all the men had disappeared at night
some of them had started from the
railroad station to their homes and never
arrived one had left his house about nine
oclock to go a few blocks to a drug store
he never reached the store two had step-
ped out of tlieir houses for a moment into
the surrounding grounds they did not re-

 turn the three servants had been sent on
 errands the detectives who disappeared
 had been on night duty

   one difficulty about the kidnapping the-
 ory was that so far as was known there
 had been no outcry or struggle in connec-
 tion with any of the disappearances it
 seemed hardly possi-
 ble that a considerable
 number of men had
 been carried off
 against their wills
 without at least one of
 them putting up
 enough of a fight to at-
 tract attention

                     two or three ser-
                   vant girls were badly
                   frightened by things
                   they claimed to have
                   seen however their
                   stories were so fantas-
                   tic that no attention
                   was paid to them un-
                   til henry todd told
                   his experience

                      todd was bookkeep-
                    er for a new york
                    commission house and
                    had no more imagina-
                    tion than a cigar store
                    indian he was mar-
                    ried and had never
                    taken a drink in his
                    life it happened that
                    benson was the only
                    man at the police sta-
                    tion that night who
                    knew him personally
                    when he could not tell
                    a coherent story be-
                    cause of fear and ex-
                    citement benson took
                    him in hand and quietly questioning him
                    brought out the facts

   todd had been on the way from the rail-
 way station to his home in company with
 a neighbor james lewis who commuted on
 the same train with him from new york
 the streets of south orange are bordered
 by estates of considerable size with the

   lyvery once in a while a
   sudden onslaught of an-
   imal or bacterial life re-
   minds us that we go about
   our lives in the blithe feel-
   ing that the human race is
   supreme and has no ene-
   mies worthy of itself

     the plague of influenza
   in  the onslaughts of
   the corn-borer the periodic
   ravages of the locust should
   all be evidence to us that
   powerful foes of man ex-
   ist and they need only a
   favorable circumstance to
   make us sadly aware of
   them each such plague or
   catastrophe finds us de-
   fenseless and totally un-
   prepared perhaps our in-
   sect and animal foes real-
   ize it by this time and
   they know that it needs
   only conditions more fav-
   orable than those of the
   past to entirely sweep men
   from the earth

     mr colladay deals in an
   intensely realistic fashion
   with such a menace he
   does not exaggerate it yet
   he gives us the feeling that
   at any time the menace may
   widen its field and become
   a national calamity a first
    rate story
the silent scourge



houses set well back from the road there
are many places deeply shadowed by trees
todd stopped for a moment to light his pipe
and lewis got a few feet ahead todd was
sure there was no unusual sound but some-
thing caused him to look up he saw lew-
is in the grasp of a monster which he had
difficulty describing

it was dark there under the trees he
explained but it looked like a big worm
with a hundred legs like a caterpillar
what was it doing to lewis asked
benson

  it seemed to be holding him with its
front legs it was sort of standing up the
way a caterpillar does if you know what
i mean

  how big was it

  todd frowned in perplex-
ity i know it couldnt
have been as big as it look-
ed there in the dark mr

benson i dont know what
to say

  well how big did it look
to you

  todd considered the ques-
tion for a moment it
held lewis up pretty near
as high as the lower branch-
es of the trees and there was
a lot of it on the ground i
guess it was about thirty feet
long its body was at least
three feet thick through be-
sides the legs on each side

  did it see you

  i dont know i was so surprised and
everything happened so quick-

  what happened did it start after
you

  todd shook his head as he tried to re-
member i guess it didnt pay any atten-
tion to me it went through the hedge of
the albertson place and i came running
here

  what about lewis did he make any
effort to get away

  he looked dead to me he never moved
or made a sound

  hennessey had been regarding todd with
increasing disfavor say mr benson this

guys either drunk or crazy you aint go-
ing to swallow any fairy story like that

are you

  todd was still too frightened to be indig-
nant he looked helplessly from the chief
to benson i never took a drink in my
life and im not crazy he asserted with
quiet dignity you know that dont you
benson

  yes i know it said benson and i be-
lieve your story

  benson was an important man in that
meeting and represented even more import-
ant men hennessey became less truculent

  if you know him personally mr ben-
son of course thats different

one of the things

ifteen minutes later a
group of men started
from police headquarters
with todd leading the way
all were armed with revol-
vers or automatics and two
of them carried thompson
machine guns

presently todd paused at
a dark tree-shadowed
stretch of road this is
where it happened

flashlights revealed noth-
ing suspicious where
were you standing when you
saw the worm asked ben-
son

todd walked over to a
tree i stood right here so i could light
my pipe its died down now but there
was quite a wind blowing

  now show us where the worm was
todd advanced gingerly to a spot near
a hedge about twenty feet ahead it was
right about here its head was waving
around in the air when i saw it and it was
holding lewis with its front legs

  where did it go

  todd pointed to the grounds of a con-
siderable estate it went through that
hedge there

  you didnt try to do nothing when you
saw it carrying this guy away interrupt-
ed hennessy


wonder stories

  what could i do asked todd sullen-
ly i didnt even have a pen knife
hennessy examined the hedge theres
a hole here all right he acknowledged
its big enough for a cow to go through
come along you fellows

  hold on there a minute chief said
benson

  whats the matter demanded hennes-
sy not getting cold feet are you
dont you smell a strong animal odor
around here

  hennessy sniffed smells like a skunk
he said what about it

  it doesnt smell like a skunk to me
said benson

  it was strong enough to knock you down
when i was here before todd volunteered
you noticed it then did you

  it was when i was lighting my pipe i
got a whiff of it and i guess thats what
made me look up to see where it was com-
ing from

  mebbe the smell frightened you and
made you run away suggested hennessy
sarcastically

  todd flushed i know it sounds rot-
ten but i think that smell had something
to do with it it made me sort of dizzy
i guess i lost my head

  lucky for you you did said benson
you couldnt have done anything for lew-
is and if you hadnt run away thered have
been two disappearances instead of one
you figuring the smell knocks em out
asked hennessy

  maybe if it does it explains why no
one has put up a fight doesnt it

  hennessy frowned in thought you un-
derstand mr benson i aint convinced by
this guys story that theres any such ani-
mals im only following it up on your
say-so

  at this moment there was a dramatic in-
terruption whats that shouted one of
the men pointing down the road look
out its coming this way

  my god exclaimed hennessy what
is it

  afterwards the man were able to give a
fairly good description of the creature by
comparing their impressions the road

was dark except for the light of an occa-
sional street lamp the millepede - for
that is what the naturalists eventually call-
ed it in spite of its size-was running tow-
ard them with a man clasped in its forward
legs the front part of its body was there-
fore raised from the ground the body it-
self was about three feet wide but the legs
added another three feet on each side it
looked about forty feet long and ran like
the wind in spite of the weight it was car-
rying

  the men crowded to one side of the road
paralyzed with fear until it passed then
benson grabbed a machine gun from a po-
liceman the stream of bullets caught the
millipede where its body was elevated from
the ground it was not killed-in fact it
was afterward found that it was impossible
to kill them with bullets-but it was suffi-
ciently hurt so that it dropped the body it
was carrying

  the men police and citizens alike were
so shaken by what they had seen that it was
not until fifteen minutes later that some of
them cautiously advanced to inspect the
partly consumed body is it your friend
lewis benson asked todd

  todd shook his head no its not lew-
is hes bigger than that

  how about the rest of you fellows
any of you recognize it some of them
still hung back dont waste any time
continued benson impatiently it isnt
pretty to look at but therell be worse things
if we dont face this situation now

chapter ii
the fight begins

ann hour later a white-faced serious
looking lot of men representing the
towns influential citizens were gathered in
the chiefs uncomfortably crowded office at
police headquarters reporters from out
of town were constantly arriving the
news of the nights discovery had reached
the papers as a flash from one of the press
associations benson had been tacitly ac-
cepted as the leader of the gathering the
police were intent on disclaiming respon-
sibility for a fight on the giant insects
the silent scourge



  hennessy stated their position we
couldnt do nothing even if we had the
whole new york force here if it was men
wed get em for you but these-these-
ben finkel president of the central bank
jumped up and shook his fist in hennessys
face youre yellow rats thats whats
the matter with you well kick you off
the force-the whole bunch of you

  well you see its this way mr finkel
explained hennessy we all want to do
anything we can but we aint much good in
a case like this it aint a police case
what you need is a man like mr benson
here to take charge of things put him in
charge and well all take his orders well
show you we aint yellow

  there was a murmur of approval from
the anxious-faced men sounds as if it
might be a good idea admitted finkel
if benson will take the job

  ah eyes turned to benson

  every man is subject to draft when an
emergency as serious as this occurs said
benson slowly however youll have to
give me authority to take any steps i see
fit and agree to carry out all orders with-
out question

  thats good enough for me said fin-
kel how about the rest of you gentle-
men  

  there were no dissenting voices

  theres no use deceiving ourselves as to
the seriousness of the situation said ben-
son something has occurred to produce
this race of gigantic creatures that feed on
human flesh i imagine because of the
limited territory in which they have been
operating that at present there are not many
of them our only hope is to find some
way of exterminating them before they mul-
tiply if we dont theyll proceed to eat
us at their leisure

  at this point one of the committeemen
became violently ill

  i know it isnt pleasant to think about
continued benson but its the condition
were up against we havent any time to
waste

  what are we going to do first asked
finkel

  well wait here until the rest of the re-

porters arrive and give them all the infor-
mation we have everyone in south orange
who has a telephone must be notified to re-
main indoors until daylight tomorrow
well have a meeting in new york of all
the scientists we an gather together at such
short notice

  the scientists met at columbia university
at three oclock in the afternoon benson
had given a general invitation through the
newspapers to anyone who had any ideas
he thought might be valuable it was sure
to bring some cranks but it would not do
in a case like this to ignore any sugges-
tions in addition benson had telegraphed
and telephoned certain biologists and engin-
eers he wanted to be present without fail

  he addressed the gathering briefly one
of the newspapers had a stenographer pre-
sent so there is an accurate report of the
address extant the salient points he made
were two first that the giant millipedes
were apparently a recent development from
the smaller species with which we are fam-
iliar therefore the task for the biologists
was to determine what new condition or
what new food was responsible for their
growth as so far the millipedes appar-
ently lived only in the vicinity of south
orange the field for investigation was com-
paratively limited

  second that a method of destroying the
giant creatures already in existence must
be found by the chemists and engineers
whatever the biologists eventually discov-
ered as to their origin it was necessary
to devise immediately some way of destroy-
ing the monsters who were already in exis-
tence

professor lucien shepard of colum-
bia suggested that two committees of
six members each be appointed by the chair-
man one composed of biologists and one
of engineers this was done

  there were several developments during
the afternoon the governor of new jer-
sey declared martial law in south orange
and the adjoining communities to make
it effective he called out the state militia
which established a cordon around south


wonder stories

orange no one was allowed to enter the
town and arrangements were immediately
made to evacuate the inhabitants

  as it was impossible to carry out this
latter order before dark all persons were
ordered for the second successive night to
remain indoors the ordinary millipede is
a lover of darkness and apparently their
giant brothers shared this characteristic for
none of them had so far appeared during
the day the soldiers on duty that night
kept bright fires burning none wandered
far from his companions in the flickering
light from the fires gigantic shadowy forms
were seen flashing through the streets

  when morning came the evacuation of the
inhabitants was begun much against the
will of some of them at the same time the
two committees appointed the previous af-
ternoon got to work benson was ex-officio
a member of both of them in a joint meet-
ing they decided that it was necessary to
secure immediately one of the giant milli-
pedes alive or dead no matter what the risk
involved the risk could hardly be over-
estimated the ordinary millipede can run
at a terrific speed considering its size if
the larger ones possessed this ability in pro-
portion they could undoubtedly run rings
around any living creature

  the biologists wanted to be definitely
sure that the giant was a development from
the smaller individuals instead of a new
species the chemists and engineers who
had assumed the stupendous task of exter-
minating them wanted a specimen to study
doubtless a reasonably safe way to kill or
capture one could be devised in time but
time was the one thing the two committees
did not have at their disposal

  apart from the fact that until they were
exterminated the millipedes would go on
multiplying their appetite for human flesh
probably could not be satisfied by any other
food when south orange was evacuated
and it was no longer possible to capture
human beings there they would almost cer-
tainly extend their activities the process
of removing people from their homes could
hardly be continued indefinitely

  directed by the engineers the soldiers
started a foot by foot search of the country

for the dens of the millipedes they lived
below the surface and any hole big enough
for them to emerge from must be fairly con-
spicuous

  the afternoons work yielded four suspi-
cious looking tunnels these were marked
and plans were made to place at each of
them an ingeniously constructed net strong
enough to hold anything that became en-
tangled in it however the events of the
next forty-eight hours made this unneces-
sary

  the searchers left the evacuated area as
it began to grow dark and the soldiers again
took up their duties as guards all resi-
dents had been removed from south orange
as an added precaution the fires that night
were built only ten feet apart a rampart
of them extended entirely around the ter-
ritory where the millipedes had manifested
themselves

all unreasonable

there were a number of disappearances
that night from such widely separated
points as caldwell and elizabeth when
they were reported the next day benson
was inclined to doubt that the millipedes
had any connection with most of them it
was natural to expect the millipedes to ex-
tend the range of their forays but it was
unlikely that they would make jumps of so
many miles in twenty-four hours presum-
ing they all belonged to the one colony it
was a tempting opportunity for dissatisfied
men and women to escape from their respon-
sibilities and start a new life in some other
part of the country undoubtedly a certain
proportion of the disappearances could be
accounted for in this way

  the really important news of the day
though no one realized it then was an ob-
scure item on an inside page of the new
york times telling of mysterious thefts at
the plant of a certain chemical company
bensons eyes lighted on the item and there
rested thoughtfully it was headed mys-
terious thefts continue

    the bauxite products company have
  been unable to discover the methods by
  which thieves night after night ab-
  stract large quantities of a certain
the silent scourge



  chemical which is being manufactured
  under contract for the united states
  government secret service agents
  have been on guard for some time past
  but the thefts continue a puzzling
  feature of the case is the discovery of
  a number of curious tunnels in the vi-
  cinity of the plant which may have
  been used by the thieves

  benson frowned and re-read the article
then he called up the times office and af-
ter considerable trouble got hold of a man
able to give him the information he wanted

  where is the plant of this bauxite pro-
ducts company he asked after explaining
who he was

  back in the hills somewhere beyond
west orange

  funny place for a factory know what
theyre manufacturing for the government
search me whatever it is theyre
keeping it under cover

  i have a hunch id better find out
said benson after a moments thought

  think it might have something to do
with the millipedes asked the newspaper
man eagerly

  well it occurred to me as a possibility
i tell you what id do if i were you mr
benson id get in touch with washington
youre in south orange now

  at police headquarters at the moment
why

  we have a man there bill gregory if
theres anything we can do at this end let
bill know

an hour later benson and three other
men got out of a car before a series of
low frame buildings surrounded by a high
double barbed wire fence two guards
were stationed inside a closed gate while
others could be seen patrolling the grounds

  whats the idea of keeping us waiting
out here called benson when the guards
made no move to open the gate

  aint no visitors allowed you fellers
get back in that car and get out of here
send for the superintendent of the plant
demanded benson

  and who might you be

  never mind who we are you do as i
told you

  the guard stared steadily at benson for

a minute then he turned to his compan-
ion jim go bring the chief here tell
him theres four nuts outside tell him i
want to know whether to shoot em or let
em die natural

  ten minutes later the second guard re-
turned with a man whose face was dimly
familiar to benson he frowned at the
visitors sorry but no strangers are al-
lowed within three miles of the plant
brady he called to a uniformed man
standing beside a motorcycle go with
these men as far as the road

  he started to -turn away but paused at
bensons impatient demand my names
benson i havent any time to fool with
you or your regulations if you give me
any trouble ill have the state militia take
possession of your plant

  the face of the man inside the gate
changed you the benson in charge of
this millipede campaign

  yes responded benson curtly

  t guess i can let you in i dont know
about the men with you who are they
whats all the mystery about

  the man flipped back the lapel of his
coat revealing a badge my names kel-
ly government service

  thats different said benson ill
vouch for these other men this is profes-
sor sharpe of columbia and mr dowd
one of the chemists at the edison plant
also bill gregory of the new york times
afraid i cant let you bring a reporter
in here mr benson

  thats all right ill vouch for mr
gregory too he wont print anything
without your permission

  kelly ushered the four visitors into the
office of the plant he gazed at them keen-
ly what makes you think this place has
anything to do with your giant millipedes
were investigating every possible lead
said benson it was an item in this morn-
ings paper about your plant being robbed
of a certain chemical that sent us out here-
that and the reference to your finding some
mysterious tunnels

  its damn funny about those tunnels
said kelly we come across new ones all
the time and no one has a chance to dig


wonder stories

them no man we dont know gets inside
the fence

  yet somebody steals your stuff every
night if this newspaper story is right
thats the damnable part of it said
kelly flushing angrily its true

  this chemical thats being stolen -
whats it used for

  i cant tell you that its a government
secret

  benson looked thoughtful give us
some idea you neednt violate orders
the situation down at south orange is so
serious that we cant waste any time on a
wild goose chase

  what do you want to know asked kel-
ly-

  ill explain the biologists believe that
the giant millipedes are small ones which
have got hold of some substance which im-
mensely stimulates their growth

  it doesnt sound reasonable to me said
kelly

tt doesnt sound reasonable to anybody

   the whole affairs unreasonable we
dont know that there is any such substance
if the giant millipedes are a new species
coming from underground to attack human
beings i dont believe theres much we can
do on the other hand if they are just
ordinary millipedes grown to gigantic size
because of some substance theyve got hold
of all we have to do is to find out what
the substance is and remove it beyond their
reach

  well ill take a chance on telling you
this much said kelly were manufac-
turing here an ingredient of a new poison
gas for use in war its at least five times
as destructive as any hitherto discovered
he smiled grimly its a great peace pre-
server as long as we can keep its composi-
tion a secret from other nations

  the four men stared at him its this
ingredient thats being stolen asked ben-
son

  kelly nodded thats why most of the
secret service is working on the case now
weve got to keep the stuff from getting
into the hands of any person who might ana-

lyze it he paused i guess thats about
all i can tell you

  mind if  ask a few questions said
benson

  ask ahead but i dont know that ill
answer them

  what relation does this material which
is disappearing bear to the final product
the gas itself

  i can tell you this much said kelly
bauxite is used here to produce a material
which is added to a certain other material
this second material is manufactured at
another plant they are mixed under pres-
sure at still a third plant when this pres-
sure is released the combined substances
vaporize into the gas

  i see said benson the two mater-
ials are manufactured and kept separate un-
til they are needed

  exactly they are both stable except
when combined

chapter iii
the experiment works

late that afternoon a dozen men gath-
ered around a cage constructed of fine
wire netting in one of the buildings of the
west orange edison plant on the wooden
floor of the cage two ordinary millipedes
about an inch long were darting around
trying to find a way out

  benson carefully opened a lead-lined box
which was filled with a sort of pinkish clay
the other men crowdcd closer to look at it

  you say this stuff is extracted from
bauxite said one of them reaching over
to pick up a fragment

  benson seized his hand this was fur-
nished by the government under the express
agreement that no effort will be made to
analyze it and that whatever portion of it
is not used in this experiment will be re-
turned

  dont be so damned suspicious benson
im not a spy and neither is anyone else
here

  no i suppose not but the stuffs too
important to take any chances with it
youre going to put some of it in the
the silent scourge



cage with the millipedes aid one of the
younger men present suppose it has the
effect you anticipate that wire cage
wont be much protection

  thats all been prepared for even if
this stuff makes little millipedes into big
ones it cant work instantaneously we can
fill this room with cyanogen gas in five min-
utes that will take care of millipedes
big or little

  he carefuly opened a little door in the
top of the cage and dropped some fragments
of the pinkish substance to the floor the
two millipedes darted toward it and rolled
in it with a kind of frenzy like a cat
with catnip said dowd only more so
benson looked at his watch its now
four oclock we have a great deal to do
and i suggest we meet here at eight tomor-
row morning to observe results if there are
any

  you think its safe to leave the milli-
pedes asked dowd

  one of the laboratory men will be on
duty here all night well all sleep a few
blocks away so we can easily reach here
if it should be necessary

  benson did not get to bed until midnight
and he was very tired he had a disturbed
dream of an earthquake which was shaking
down all the buildings in the city trying
to escape a wall which was toppling on his
head he wakened to realize the noise was
someone pounding on his door

  he jumped out of bed and found a white-
faced bellboy standing in the hall they
want you over at the laboratory right away
mr benson somethings happened
come in and tell me said benson
sharply dragging on his clothes

  they didnt say much over the phone
except to tell you to come down as soon as
you could

  thats all you know

  well i know what the men say that
left the plant when it happened

  damn it boy when what happened
the centipedes got loose and et up a
couple men

 god god go wake up professor
sharp and mr dowd and tell them what

youve just told me and say ill meet them
at the laboratory

the lobby of the hotel was filled with
men most of whom were trying to get
out of the windows the clerk hurried up
when he saw benson better be careful
sir the things theyve been having in
south orange are here and they say theyre
eating people up

  benson hurried outside he glanced ner-
vously into the shadows and walked in the
middle of the deserted street he knew
this was a useless precaution because of the
millipedes speed but it made him feel
safer he had been carrying a gun for sev-
eral days past but he was not now depend-
ing on it for protection lie carried in his
right hand a large flashlight

  he thought lie saw something slinking
along in the darkness and pressed the but-
ton of light the beam revealed a giant
millipede fifty feel away it was stand-
ing with the forward part of its body ele-
vated holding some object as benson had
seen one hold a human body a few nights
before when the dazzling beam of light
fell on the creature it darted to one side
and as the beam followed slithered oil the
road

  benson had had an idea that the milli-
pedes were afraid of light but he had not
cared to take the responsibility of asking
someone else to experiment he swuni the
beam around as he walked rapidly toward
the laboratory suddenly he realized the
danger professor sharp and dowd would
run with millipedes in the street and no
way of frightening them off he turned
and hurried back toward the hotel

  sharp and dowd were just coming out
of the door when he arrived whats the
trouble- shouted dowd

   dont know yet

  havent you been to the laboratory

  i started but i thought id belter come
back for you two he related his encount-
er with the millipede and the effect of the
light beam sharpe and dowd went back
for two flashlights and then the three hur-
ried off to the laboratory

  the plant worked twenty-four hours a


wonder stories

day and all the windows were brilliantly
lighted when they arrived the laboratory
looked as if a cyclone had struck it there
was no trace of the wire cage in which the
millipedes had been confined the furni-
ture was demolished and the partitions torn
down and the floor was covered with frag-
ments of bottles and retorts a trail of red
zigzagged across the floor

  looks bad said sharpe wonder if
the men all ran away there isnt a sign
of anyone here

  someone must be around replied ben-
son they phoned for us to come down
you know

  lets try the office thats probably
where they telephoned from

  the offices were on the second floor of
a building a block away as they tramp-
ed up the stairs the door at the top was
cautiously opened and a man stuck his head
out

  hurry he said nervously we saw
you coming across the yard

  what did you do shut down the works
asked benson

  the works shut themselves down when
your millipedes got out

  inside the room were gathered six white-
faced men and among them was the one
who had been left on guard at the labora-
tory hello roberts i thought theyd
got you said benson he frowned why
didnt you turn on the cyanogen gas when
things began to look dangerous

  they didnt look dangerous to me re-
plied roberts the millipedes rolled
around in the pink stuff and got bigger but
i thought there wasnt enough of it so
theyd grow much

  roberts paused uncertainly what hap-
pened demanded benson impatiently

  i suppose its all my fault but i thought
i was doing the right thing i dont know
now what actually happened

  you were there werent you

  i was over here at the office telephon-
ing for you i thought youd better come
down when i found the experiment was
working

  what was the matter with the telephone
in the laboratory

  theres no switchboard operator at
night the office is the only place to get
an outside wire

  i didnt get any message until after the
millipedes had broken loose

  i know they said at the hotel you were
asleep and they wouldnt call you before
 got back to the laboratory the millipedes
broke out of the cage and smashed things
up

  did you see them asked benson
roberts shook his head they were
gone before i got back but wilson here
saw them

fruitless efforts

ilson was a young workman in jump-
er and overalls he was still white
and shaken from the experience

  how big were they asked benson

  the biggest things i ever saw mr ben-
son forty or fifty feet long and as wide
as this room they were brown and had
about a million legs

  benson nodded thats what i thought
they werent the two millipedes from the
cage

  of course not wilson may be exag-
gerating the size of the creatures he saw
but still they must have been a lot bigger
than any millipede could grow in a few
hours even with an unlimited supply of this
magic food these you remember had on-
ly a few fragments of the bauxite deriva-
tive

  roberts looked relieved im sure glad
to hear you say that mr benson the oth-
er fellows are thinking im responsible for
the deaths of the two poor boys that were
carried off

  well you arent so dont worry about
it the millipedes that did the damage
came in from outside they were after that
pinkish stuff i left in the cage i dont
know how they found out it was in the cage
of course maybe they can smell it from
a distance they entered the laboratory
and destroyed the cage to get at it the
little millipedes escaped the big ones car-
ried off a couple of the men thats what
happened as far as i can reconstruct it
the silent scourge



  then the experiments been a success
said dowd weve found out how to keep
any more giant millipedes from growing
up

  it looks like it all we have to do is
get rid of the stuff that produces them
thats simple enough now we know what
it is

  we ll get rid of all the bauxite product
this x-material said sharpe then
well go after the monsters already in ex-
istence

  the next day the federal government
acted the machinery at the factory back
in the hills was dismantled all of the
x material on hand was sealed in leaden
cases and shipped to an arsenal in the mid-
dle west

  benson directed the operation and it was
not until late afternoon when the soldiers
began arriving in trucks that he learned
the federal authorities had also taken con-
trol of the evacuated towns

  he immediately realized the danger of
having these additional men in the danger
zone with the millipedes becoming raven-
ous for food he got in touch with the
governor at trenton and later with the
war department at washington he was
not able to impress the authorities with the
seriousness of the danger to which they
were exposing the troops the soldiers had
been specially armed with rifles grenades
and gas bombs it was the confidence of
the army authorities in the effectiveness
of these weapons against the millipedes
that resulted in the tragedy of that night

in a final effort to reduce the risk to the
troops benson approached colonel zc-
rnurry the commanding officer weve
tried to have the war department withdraw
the troops from the danger zone colonel
he said but evidently some of your men
will have to be killed before the department
 ondescends to accept advice

  colonel zemurry frowned slightly he
had the professional soldiers disdain for
civilians but because of bensons position
be made an effort to be courteous it
teemed best to concentrate on exterminating
ike millipedes when they emerge tonight

there are enough troops to police the in-
fested area and by tomorrow morning we
should have it pretty well cleaned up
by tomorrow morning if you carry out
your present plans you will have fed a lot
of your soldiers to the millipedes and have
made our job that much harder

  ill have to obey orders mr benson
said the colonel shortly besides youve
been using the state militia yourselves
havent you

  weve used the militia to establish a cor-
don around the infested district with fires
every few feet to keep the millipedes from
getting out

  whats your objection to the plan of
patrolling all the streets and roads in the
district with soldiers armed with grenades
and gas bombs theyll kill all the milli-
pedes they can and follow the rest to locate
their lairs

  benson smiled grimly its evident you
havent seen any of the millipedes they
run so fast that hitting them with anything
will be an accident besides a pistol or a
rifle bullet wont hurt them i dont believe
a machine gun will do one of them much
harm unless hes obliging enough to stand
still and let you cut him to pieces remem-
ber colonel theyre thirty feet long and
seven or eight feet wide wait till you see
one

  colonel zemurry rose terminating the
interview im afraid mr benson the
troops will have to carry out the plan that
has been arranged i dont feel that i have
authority to change it

  then at least colonel have every sol-
dier carry a powerful flashlight the milli-
pedes dont like light

  the colonel frowned again how are
we going to dispose of them if we frighten
them away we want them to come out of
their dens and well be able to take care
of them

  very well said benson ive done all
i can ive told the governor of the state
and the war department at washington ex-
actly what ive told you there wont be
any question tomorrow as to where the res-
ponsibility lies for whats going to happen
tonight

chapter iv

a night of terror

the state militia which had been on
duty for several nights had no illusions
as to the kind of enemy they were up against
consequently when benson asked for co-
operation from colonel moultrie the com-
manding officer he got it

  all the portable searchlights that could
be secured were stationed at strategic
points magnesium flares and rockets
were got ready the commanding officer
of the federal troops tolerantly agreed that
the militia should still maintain its guard
around the south north and east sides of
south orange while the federal troops
would occupy the town itself and the terri-
tory o the west as far as the plant of the
bauxite products company

  much of this territory was mountainous
and wild exactly what arrangements were
made for the soldiers detailed in this section
lo maintain communication with one anoth-
er has never been made known events
proved that the entire plan of operations
was a mistaken one

  as soon as it grew dark benson went to
the militia headquarters which had been es-
tablished in a large private house on the
border of south and wrest orange it was
built on the top of a mountain and had ex-
cellent automobile roads leading from it in
all directions field telephone stations had
been established on the picket line around
south orange a switchboard in the en-
trance hall enabled colonel moultrie to
keep in touch with every sector of the line

  benson found the officers seriously wor-
ried there wont be any way of finding
cut whats happening out there in the moun-
tains said colonel moultrie

  benson shrugged his shoulders what
could you do anyhow

  nothing thais the damnable part of
it

  he strode out on the terrace followed by
benson to the south was the glow of the
fires lighted by the militia to the west
there was nothing except an occasional
flash and rumble

  damn fools to use artillery fighting
bugs grumbled colonel moultrie

  it was ten-thirty when the first report
of trouble came in the telephone stations
had been reporting all quiet every fifteen
minutes colonel called the operator
station eleven reports that they can see the
millipedes among the trees and theres hun-
dreds of them

  tell them to build up their fires and
have the flares ready notify all the other
stations

  five minutes later reports came in of
frantic regulars making efforts to reach the
militia picket line the searchlights re-
vealed the millipedes in immense numbers
darting around outside the line of fires

  soon the fugitive soldiers stopped com-
ing some of them are safe in buildings
said benson but im afraid for the rest
for the next hour there was silence ex-
cept for routine leports finally colonel
moultrie turned to benson i guess its
all over by this time

  benson had been impatiently pacing up
and down the terrace it seems as if we
ought to be doing something he said

  colonel moultrie frowned in thought as
he gazed down over the dark and silent
country which the federal soldiers had oc-
cupied then he turned to the man at the
switchboard order the tank corps to be
ready in ten minutes well go in and
see what the situation is

  when did the lanks arrive asked ben-
son in surprise

  several hours ago you made more im-
pression on the governor than you realized
this afternoon he couldnt do anything
with the war department but he ordered
the six tanks the state owns over here
theyre small and intended for mobs but
theyh just suit us they have two search-
lights apiece and machine guns theyll
make about twenty-five miles an hour over
rough country

the six tanks two abreast with search-
lights playing ahead made a formidable
appearance as they roared down the road
leading to the center of the silent town ben-
son was stationed at an observation slot
the silent scourge



in one of the forward two the search-
lights revealed no sign of life in the streets
or the deserted buildings until the railroad
station came into view here the tanks
slowed down and stopped

  the first man out shouted gas ad-
justing masks distracted the attention of
the men for a moment from the scene of
horror revealed by the massed searchlights
directed across the tracks and centered on
the red brick station

  the ground around the building includ-
ing the railroad tracks was covered with
a loathsome mass of dead millipedes
scattered among them were the bodies of
men in grotesque positions many of them
had been partly consumed by the milli-
pedes

  to see better benson slipped off his mask
for a second but had to replace it choking
with the gas which still filled the depression
of the railroad tracks and overflowed the
road

  the legs of the millipedes twitched as the
battery of searchlights was turned on the
mass of liquefying flesh colonel moultrie
motioned toward the machine guns mounted
in the tanks benson shook his head

  he started to pick his way toward the
nearest human body which happened to be
unmutilated it was lying face downward
and he rolled it over as a matter of form
he put his hand inside the shirt though
the body was already stiffening then he
got up and spread his hands toward the
watching men to indicate the futility of try-
ing to render any assistance

  colonel moultrie ordered the men back
into the tanks which started slowly forward
while he and benson removed their masks
and consulted as to the next thing to do
the faces of both were set in grim lines

  i counted ninety-seven bodies said ben-
son theres no telling how many more
are in the station or covered by the bodies
of the millipedes

  or eaten by them interjected the col-
onel

  benson nodded somberly i cant un-
der stand what happened at the station i
never dreamed of their having a set battle
with them

  it looks to me said colonel moultrie
as if the regulars finally realized what
they were up against and gathered in the
station to defend themselves here they
were attacked in the one-story building by
an overwhelming force of the millipedes
benson nodded ravenous because
their food supply had been cut off guns
and grenades werent any good against
them and gas not much better

the gas did kill the millipedes said
the colonel the trouble was it didnt kill
them quickly enough to save the men
there was a sudden exclamation from the
lookout at one of the observation ports
the tanks were approaching a large brick
building which stood back from the road
looks like a schoolhouse said benson
and theres a light in the upper story
added colonel moultrie somebody alive
there

  look at them things running along the
ground said the lookout they was run-
ning all over the walls a minute ago
colonel moultrie gave a grunt of dis-
gust it was his first glimpse of live milli-
pedes the ground was covered with them
a squirming mass of hideous legs and more
hideous bodies the searchlights made
them uncomfortable and they tried to dart
away but there were too many of them
they got in one anothers way after a few
seconds effort to escape the glare of the
searchlights they turned and made a fren-
zied rush toward the tanks

  benson remembered the paralyzing odor
the creatures emitted the men had fol-
lowed the colonels example in taking off
their gas masks

  put on your masks he warned he
leaped for one of the observation ports and
shouted the same warning in the hope that
the men in the other tanks would hear

the survivors gather

he felt a searing pain and the blood
poured from a jagged wound in his
cheek as he fell backward he saw two of
the men slashing at half a dozen legs which
were reaching through tie port one of the
legs fell inside the tank severed by a sharp
jack-knife it was three feet long and armed


wonder stories

with sharp claws it wriggled and jumped
around on the floor of the tank while the
men beat at it with their rifles there came
a yell of pain from the other side of the
tank a man had had his face badly
slashed by legs inserted through another
port

  all openings were hurriedly closed and
colonel moultrie who was a physician in
civil life started to work  the two wound-
ed men benson had a nasty cut across one
cheek but it was nothing to worry about un-
less the millipedes claws should prove to
be poisonous colonel moultrie swabbed it
with iodine and fastened a dressing on it
with adhesive tape the other mans wound
was more serious for his eye was badly
torn

  ill have to get him to a hospital as soon
as i crfn said the colonel in a low voice
to benson

  benson shook his head cant be done
whoever tries to drive will be torn to pieces
hell have to see where hes going and yet
you darent uncover an opening

  colonel moultrie frowned you think
we cant make it

  if you try youll have a lot of us to take
to the hospital

  well i suppose we can stay here until
morning if we have to

  yes thats one thing to do agreed ben-
son the millipedes will leave at day-
break i have a better idea though youve
got a couple of tanks of gas why not use
it it killed them back there at the sta-
tion

  we might try it said colonel moultrie
though its going to be hard for you to
wear a mask on that face of yours and
harder still for this boy here

  well manage somehow said benson
the wounded man nodded and swore softly
under his breath

  the men in the tanks sat silently masks
on listening to the hiss of the gas as it es-
caped from its cylinders benson kept his
eyes fixed on his wrist watch at the end
of thirty minutes he carefully opened one
of the observation ports and jumped aside

  nothing happened he advanced cauti-
ously to the port again and gazed out the

searchlights of all the tanks were still di-
rected toward the schoolhouse for a mo-
ment benson did not notice the piles of
dead millipedes curiously enough there
was never very much left of them after they
were dead except the legs the bodies
quickly disintegrated now as he looked
downward the ground as far as he could see
was covered with them their legs still feeb-
ly waving

  benson glanced around at the men in the
tank they all looked half asleep the
millipede odor he muttered to himself
didnt get their gas masks on soon
enough ill wake them up he had been
in one of the first tank corps organized dur-
ing the war and he had not forgotten how
to drive he climbed to the seat and threw
in the clutch

  the tank slowly straddled the ditch be-
side the road and crushed down the stone
wall which surrounded the school grounds
it crawled over the millipede bodies which
covered the campus and brought up against
the steps leading to the building

benson scrambled down and was the
first man outside he was relieved to
see the other five tanks crawling across the
campus that meant there was probably
not much wrong inside them a few minutes
later their crews still a little groggy
poured out there were a few cut faces and
arms but no serious casualties colonel
moultrie made a hasty inspection and
nodded his head in satisfaction

  meanwhile the great double doors of the
school remained closed though the upper
floor was still lighted when pounding on
them brought no response a machine gun
easily smashed the lock the tank crews
made a concerted rush up the stairs to the
third floor here they found twenty-five
badly frightened soldiers

  why didnt you come down when you
saw us demanded colonel moultrie

  a sergeant who was the only officer in the
party explained gas we havent any
masks

  what did you do with them

  the sergeant shrugged his shoulders we
couldnt run fast enough with em on
the silent scourge

  did-the millipedes get anyof -you

  plenty

  well i guess youll have to stay here
until morning any more of you in the
buildings around here

  some i guess it was every man for
himself when them things got after us we
dont know how many got away

orning revealed about two hundred
survivors from the two regiments
barricaded in buildings searching parties
during the day picked up the bodies of the
dead wherever they could be found the
extent of the tragedy was not known in time
for the morning papers but the evening pa-
pers gave it flaming headlines bensons
futile protest against the massing of troops
in the area was revealed by the governor at
trenton and condemnation of the war de-
partment for the needless slaughter of reg-
ular was violently expressed in congress

  there was a spontaneous demand from a
number of quarters simultaneously that the
federal troops be placed under bensons
control and that he be given officially dic-
tatorial powers this was accomplished
a few hours after the demand was made by
the presidents declaring martial law in
northern new jersey and appointing ben-
son military governor there was no pre-
cedent for this action but there was no pre-
cedent for the appalling situation which ex-
isted

  benson immediately ordered a concentra-
tion at south orange of all the tanks in the
eastern part of the country in view of the
destructive effect of gas on the millipedes
this seemed the best way to fight them pre-
sumably with the removal of the x-sub-
stance no new millipedes were being pro-
duced if those already in existence con-
tinued to attack as they had at the railroad
station and at the schoolhouse they could
be exterminated in a short time

  no attempt to attack the millipedes was
made the night after the massacre the
militia kept its fire-studded picket line
around the town in the meantime the
tanks were gathering each supplied with
cylinders of compressed gas

chapter v
a nation aroused

the following night the advance into the
infested territory began in long or-
derly rows were over a hundred tanks large
and small at a rocket signal they started
into life roaring clanking iron monsters
with searchlights playing in all directions
inviting an attack by the millipedes

  they traversed the territory where the
millipedes had been seen and returned to
their starting point without getting more
than a distant glimpse of shadowy giant
forms which sped away before they could
be attacked

  morning came with nothing accomplished
this procedure was followed for three more
nights with the same results before benson
acknowledged that it was a failure why
the millipedes attacked the first night and
ran away afterward was and remained a
mystery

  it was evident however that some new
way of attacking them must be found they
were beginning to appear in the surround-
ing country and again people were being
carried off their numbers had been great-
ly reduced and they were perhaps less ag-
gressive but their appetite for human flesh
had not been curbed

  it was a suggestion in a letter written to
the new york times by a man whose identi-
ty was never discovered that indirectly ended
the menace the letter read

    editor new york times sir if
  these so-called scientists aint absolute
  fools why dont they use a little horse
  sense i am a vermin exterminator
  and i could kill all the millipedes in
  twenty-four hours they aint got sense
  enough to hire me to do it so ill tell
  them how for nothing here it is get
  some of that x-stuff and put it where
  the millipedes will find it when they
  come after it shoot the gas into them
  everythings easy if you know how

  the letter was signed bug killer it
immediately attracted country-wide atten-
tion strong pressure was brought to bear
on the government to try the suggested plan
without success spokesmen for the war
department announced that the risk was too
great exposing enough of the x-substance


wonder stories

to serve as bait would if there were any
defect in the plana be the means of creating
another generation of the giant millipedes
there would be a new crop added to the
survivors of the old lot

  it was while matters were at this impasse
with public opinion becoming more bitter
as the newspapers told day after day of new
victims of the millipedes that the idea oc-
curred to benson which brought the war to
a close

  he embodied it in a memorandum to the
war department briefly it was to use the
secret xy gas in an effort to exterminate the
remaining millipedes he suggested that it
was at least possible that the x-substance
retained its attraction for the creature even
after it had entered into its xy combination
if this were the case it would only be neces-
sary to release a quantity of the gas in some
isolated place the millipedes would be
attracted by the x-ingredient in the gas and
would be destroyed

  benson was summoned to washington
where he met the head of the chemical war-
fare division

  your idea is plausible enough said
general m but unfortunately it is im-
practical

  impractical repeated benson why
for several reasons one is that we do
not know how long the gas will make the
place where it is released uninhabitable
you see it is too dangerous to experiment
with and we know very little about it it
has been manufactured as a threat to poten-
tial enemies with no real idea that it will
ever become necessary to use it

t suppose you saw in this mornings
jl paper that several more children had
been carried off said benson it seems
the millipedes have acquired a taste for
children

  yes its horribly distressing

  is it so distressing that youll take a
chance on making some place uninhabitable
for awhile

  theres still another difficulty mr ben-
son we dont know whether any of our
gas masks are effective against this gas the
men who attempted the experiment you sug-

gest would practically be committing sui-
cide

  you supply the gas said benson and
ill get enough volunteers to use it

  several nights later benson with two com-
panions entered an especially prepared tank
as soon as it was known that an effort to
destroy the millipedes was to be made which
would be particularly dangerous to those
taking part in it there were hundreds of
volunteers bensons task was simply to
select those he wanted to take his choice
fell on a man named williams who had been
in the tank corps during the war and per-
kins a gas expert of the chemical warfare
division

  the tank was hermetically sealed and all
observation ports were covered with thick
non-shatterable glass instead of gas masks
each man was supplied with a helmet very
much like a deep sea divers to which was
attached a cylinder of compressed oxygen
these were for use if for any reason it be-
came necessary to leave the tank after dis-
charging the gas

  cylinders of the deadly xy gas had been
rushed by airplane from an arsenal in the
middle west

  the tank with ihe volunteers proceeded
slowly through the darkness to an uninhab-
ited valley in the hills beyond south orange
no searchlights were used because the ob-
ject was to attract the millipedes instead of
driving them away

  when it reached this agreed on spot the
three men shook hands with one another
benson and perkins opened simultaneously
the two petcocks which released a stream
of gas from each side of the tank then
they stationed themselves at the observation
ports and watched if the gas still possessed
the attraction of the x-substance the milli-
pedes would be drawn to their destruction
if it did not-there would be another fail-
ure to add to the increasingly long list since
the war with the millipedes started

  bensons gaze was fixed on the distance

any detailed description of the special ap-
paratus devised for discharging the gas with
a minimum of risk to the men in the tank is
prohibited in fact it has been requested that
this final episode in the war with the milli-
pedes be described as briefly and with as littla
detail as possible
the silent scourge



where he expected the millipedes to appear
and it was a minute or two before he be-
came conscious of a curious glow around
the tank it was rather like the red fire of
a torchlight parade except that it was more
evenly diffused

  damned funny exclaimed perkins

  must be the gas said benson its
evidently luminous in the dark

  now they could see it spreading from the
nozzles through which it was being discharg-
ed into the air gradually the entire valley
became alight with its rosy glow

   guess were going to see the whole
show said perkins

  if theres any show to see doubted ben-
son so far i dont see any signs of milli-
pedes

  theres one now

  a great shadowy creature like a mediae-
val dragon came sweeping down the side of
the hill in a second it was beside the tank
with its head pressed against the glass of the
prl all three men started back in sudden
disgust and horror it was impossible for
a human being to look calmly at those pro-
truding eyes and sobbering lips the head
was pressed against the glass for only a
moment the gas immediately got in its
deadly work the millipede sank back and
the giant body turned over leaving the legs
feebly waving in the air

  it works exclaimed perkins

  i guess it does benson agreed here
are some more of them

down the side of the hill and up the
valley they could be seen coming like
flying shadows they bathed for a moment
in the rosy glow and then sank helpless to
the ground its like dead leaves falling
in a high wind said williams

  god theres thousands of them ex-
claimed perkins a few minutes later
theyll bury the tank

  looks as if we might get them all this
time

  soon the bodies reached to the port and a
little later covered it

  how long are we going to stay here
asked williams

  benson kept his eyes on his wrist watch

as the minutes slowly passed finally ho
stooped down and turned off petcocks in the
two cylinders well get out of this now

if we can he said to williams

  slowly the caterpillar treads began te
move and the tank started forward benson
switched on a searchlight but it did not il-
lumine the darkness as the tank crushed its
way through a mountain of dead millipedes
it travelled a hundred yards before it reach-
ed the open air now the searchlight show-
ed a concrete road ahead behind it re-
vealed the entire valley a writhing mass of
quivering bodies and waving legs

  think theyre really dead asked per-
kins doubtfully

  dead enough said benson the legs
may keep that up for an hour

   

  this was the final rout of the millipedes
for forty-eight hours no one visited the
valley to give the xy gas a chance to dissi-
pate - on the morning of the third day a
cautious advance was made by a group of
men headed by benson they were ready
to stop at the first indication of ill effects
from any remaining gas they found none

  the little company came to the valley of
the massacre scarcely any trace of the
mountain of dead millipedes was to be seen
the scavengers of the earth and air had done
their work

  that afternoon the two committees of
scientists sent out their first optimistic re-
port they stated that ihey believed all dan-
ger was over that practically all of them
had been destroyed and any remaining speci-
mens would be exterminated as the result
of measures to be put into immediate effect

  a careful exploration of the entire coun-
try which had been infested was begun
wherever a hole or cave was found cyano-
gen gas was forced into it under pressure
then the opening was filled up with con-
crete tanks and militia remained on guard
at night for three months at the end of
that time the people of south orange were
allowed to return to their homes

no authoritative announcement was ever
made of the number of persons killed by
the millipedes the whole affair is so in-

the synthetic men

for generations they labored to create man in his
image - but the revolt camel

ghostly and weird was the laboratory
in which dr pontius labored from ear-
ly morning until late at night on the deli-
cate subject of life and all its intriguing
mysteries it would have been an excellent
place for an exponent of black art or sor-
cery and at this time the shadows of night
had stolen into the room making it even
more spectral but the blackness was
somewhat relieved by a single frosted elec-
tric lamp that cast a pale phosphorescent
glow over a paper-littered desk in a dismal
corner

  hanging along the wall on the right was
a row of four human skeletons complete
and erect on a massive shelf over these
stood rows of colorcd bottles each bearing

a label identifying its contents the shelf
ran the entire distance around the room ex-
cept where a lone door created a four-foot
gap directly opposite the grisly human
relics and flanking pontius desk rested
two monster test-tubes of thick glass large
enough to accommodate the body of a full-
sized man

  due to the murky gloom of the place it
would have been hard to determine at a
first glance just what the tubes contained
because they were half-hidden in the enve-
loping shadows but a close observer
would have been appalled to behold that
each tube contained the nude body of a man
seemingly at rest in the thick-jelly-like
fluid that the tube contained and if one

had turned on one of the green-looking
globes that hung suspended above each tube
he would have been amazed lo see the mans
body become transparent so transparent
and seemingly delicate that the internal or-
gans could be seen functioning with the
steady precision of a watch

  through the arteries of the bodies he
would see coursing a peculiar pea-green
fluid that seemed to glow like liquid emer-
alds in one body it flowed in a steady
stream but in the other it was sluggish and
thick gushing through the veins in quick
spasmodic jerks with each throb of a green
heart that was located far up on the right
side

  it was easy to see that this latter crea-
ture was on the verge of death but the
first his rather cruel sharp features ap-
pearing peaceful and calm seemed as nor-



mal as a man asleep on his feet both
bodies erect supported by the heavy-fluid
faced the laboratory in a way that tr pon-
tius could glance at either of them from
his desk

   he was the son of ihe famous edward
pontius who in  had startled the world
with his discovery of the q-ray that he said
was the wavelength of energy fundamental
to the continuance of life he had been
besieged by the press the government and
scientific societies to divulge his secret more
fully to tell from where this ray emanated
and how it was produced it wa known
that he had made some astounding experi-
ments of the effect of q-rays on animals

   but pontius refused to release his secret
 saying it is not ready for the world
 and when he had passed on his mantle was
 naturally worn by his son and scientific

 heir the present clifford pontius

   close associates knew that young clif-
 ford had been trained from earliest youth
 on the mysterious experiments of his father
 and when old edward had died clifford
 then twenty-six had hidden himself from
 the world to carry on as he called it
 now clifford at the age of seventy was
 about to reap the fruits of sixty-five years
 of unremitting labor
 between father and
 son

a little less
crusty than his
father he believed that
the time had now come
for the world which
had meanwhile forgot-
ten him to learn the
tesult of his discover-
ies as he now sat at
his desk wearily
slumped in his chair
from an all-night siege
at his complete report
he awaited the arrival
of a reporter whom his
old friend amesbury
editor of the globe
was sending for the
story pontius had
chosen the globe as
his medium for the re-
lease of the secret to
the world because he
knew he could trust
the way amesbury
would handle i t

 there would be no
 sensationalism-just a
 simple recounting of
 the fact that with the
 continual experiment-
 ing of sixty-five years he had been able to
 produce two mature living thinking syn-
 thetic men

   pontius looked up from his desk quickly
 at the sound of a muffled bell he pressed
 a button on his desk and a picture flashed
 on a little screen in front of him-showing
 a young man on the doorstep hat in hand

   who is it asked pontius into a little

 nn here is no greater sec-
 - ret that our scientists
 would like to learn than
 how life was formed in
 that secret may well lie the
 clue to the entire nature of
 the universe we can guess
 that at some remote age
 something happened to a bit
 of lifeless material-thru
 some strange circumstances
 that we have never seen
 duplicated-that gave this
 material life that some-
 thing happened millions of
 years ago and the thing it
 gave life to became no more
 than a one-celled animal
 we are its descendants
 with our millions of cells
 in specialized groups com-
 plicated beyond belief

   what if a scientist by
 trial error and experiment
 after experiment should
 finally hit upon the secret
 and be able to make life
 synthetically-would it be
 a blessing or a curse

                     grinning skeletons and
                     the synthetic men he
                     gave a perceptible
                     start the scientist
                     eyed him with a con-
                     templating glance

   dont like them do you young man
 he asked seriously

   douglass shuddered i always feel
 strange in the presence of human skeletons
 dr pontius and these things he added
 pointing to one of the creatures

   quite natural said the scientist ev-
 ery living thing has some horror for skele-
the synthetic men



tons of its kind even a dog will avoid its
dead but you dont feel that way about
my children he smiled nodding toward
the figures in the test tubes

  they dont appear to annoy or bother
you the reporter commented where
did you get them-the skeletons

   dr pontius settled back in his chair and
filled his pipe with the same deliberate cool-
ness that he performed the other act

   the first one is all that remains of kill-
er garth who was executed at sing sing
five months ago pontius remarked cas-
ually

  douglasss eyes flashed and he squirmed
uneasily in his chair as he regarded the de-
signated skeleton pontius
continued number two was
an unidentified laborer who
was drowned six months
ago at camden new jersey

note the curvature of the
vertebrae at the neck-

   no thanks dr pontius
said douglass turning his
head ive had enough

but why all the skeletons

  pontius realized that
douglass was purposely
avoiding the subject of the
meeting-his two synthetic
men he snapped a tiny
lighter into flame and igni-
ted his pipe contemplated
the reporter silently for a
moment and then blew out
a cloud of smoke with a nod he drew the
young mans attention to the test tubes

  i am using them to obtain in the sur-
rounding jelly a substance which i need for
the making of my synthetic man there
he had shot his bolt he regarded doug-
lass awe-struck face as he continued in
other words the skeletons will dissolve into
my fluid until they are all gone the fluid
will be enriched by a substance necessary
to the production of life

  douglass almost jumped out of his chair
when he comprehended what the two test
tubes in the shadow contained he stared
at them for fully five minutes before it
dawned upon him that the contents were

really living men his handsome face went
strangely pale and took on a ghostly ap-
pearance under the glow of the feeble lamp
that scarcely touched the gloom enshroud-
ing the tubes so this was the mysterious
story amesbury had sent him for

  but could it be true he felt a shiver
steal up his spine as he contemplated the
grotesque creatures and turned quickly to
see the scientist studying him intently

  t dont envy your job douglass said
x in a half whisper but do you mean
that you can make new men living thinking
men out of that green jelly and bones
partly yes replied pontius sucking at
his pipe the creation of
life is no longer a mystery
at least to me but the solu-
tion lies deeper than dead
mens bones

  of course commented
douglass with a strange
sense of reality still i
think if i were you i would
be afraid of the wrath of the
super intelligence that creat-
ed all life at the beginning
synthetic creation of human
life by man it seems to me
is a violation of all the laws
of god

  dr pontius shrugged
the super intelligence is
the mind young man he
said bluntly all life ori-
ginally evolved through the crystallization
of a colloid the idea that one creator
made all things is a primitive superstition
at least that is my opinion and it i founded
on two generations of research and experi-
mentation in the realms of material physio-
logy by my father and myself

  you are an atheist then douglass in-
quired amazed

  dr pontius pipe had gone out he scru-
tinized his guest with an amused look as he
applied the lighter again

  im afraid my views on religion would
be uninteresting to you douglass he said
simply it is a delicate subject to discuss
and not injure the feelings of another so

wonder stories

let us get down to the business of your vis-

  douglass face brightened he had dis-
covered himself forming unkindly opinions
of this old scientist for his seemingly dog-
matic views the idea that the creator had
made all things had been drilled into doug-
lass from childhood by devout parents and
he resented anything to the contrary-des-
pite his broad-mindedness he was glad to
change the subject for he had no stomach
for an argument with the scientist and above
all he wanted the story

  the reporter nodded then you can
proceed dr pontius he said taking a
sheaf of folded foolscap from his inner
pocket in preparation to take notes you
need not deviate from scientific parlance
i am well schooled in science and will un-
derstand your terms quite amply biology
has always fascinated me i am glad of
this opportunity to hear an expert discuss
it

  thats fine applauded dr pontius with
a mischievous grin i want you to get it
right dont hesitate to interrupt if  get
too deep for you

chapter ii
the story of pontius

for two solid hours the scientists voice
droned out in the dismal room it
seemed smothered and stifled by the close-
ness of the place the reporters pencil
literally flew over his papers dr pontius
talked steadily touching many details of
his discoveries but he talked about it ab-
stractly he did not seem eager to have the
world know that he of all men had been
the first to solve the mysteries of life

  if douglass had thought himself well-
schooled in science he soon discovered that
he was pitifully ignorant many times was
he forced to interrupt the scientist for a
simpler explanation of a detail dr pon-
tius rallied to his aid on each occasion
again and again he gestured toward the test
tubes each time the reporter experienced
chilling sensations running up and down
his spinal columu

  the story that pontius told was in effect
the history of two generations of unremit-
ting devotion to an idea two men father
and son following each other in the silence
of this laboratory watching over bits of mi-
crosopic material that were finally to be-
come men not perfect men pontius em-
phasized this fact to douglass and to
illustrate it he took the fascinated reporter
in front of one of the bodies and switching
on the globe suspended above illuminated
the internal structure of the creature he
showed douglass that instead of having
blood coursing through his veins the crea-
ture had a green fluid that pontius called
xyone and further as a memento that
the hand of the potter might occasionally
shake he showed that the synthetic mans
heart was on the right side instead of the
left there were other differences too that
set the synthetic man apart from our own
flesh and blood but these differences only
served to douglass to heighten the reality
of this amazing creation leaving the crea-
ture who seemed to be asleep in his enve-
loping green fluid the two men returned to
their seats and pontius went on with his
story

  the original discovery that the elder pon-
tius had made was the creating of a single-
celled organism from agar a derivative of
sea weed that had been treated at various
temperatures and in various solutions it
was all part of a preconceived idea of ed-
ward pontius that under the proper condi-
tions animal life could be produced from
plants that was where the q-ray came in

  edward pontius had experimented with
the effect of cosmic rays on animal life and
found that they were fatal in large doses
so were the much longer radium rays and
the still longer x and ultra-violet rays
but each of these in proper doses was
beneficial to life here indeed was the be-
ginning of a puzzle that the giant mind of
the elder pontius could unravel might
not one of these short wavelength radiations
be the one that coming from outer space
had caused plant life to change miraculous-
ly into animal protoplasm

  the q-ray was the answer lying be-
tween the gamma rays from radium and the
the synthetic men



cosmic ray they were found to be a nar-
row band of radiations unexplored by
science perhaps they were unexplored be-
cause of the peculiar conditions necessary
to their propagation- and further because
the conditions necessary to produce them
were so delicate their praeence had not ev-
en been detected

  but edward pontius had discovered that
on projecting the q-ray on the agar he pro-
duced a microscopic bit of living matter
and when the ray was intensified the mic-
roscopic organism in a miraculous way
began to subdivide and grow and become
more complex the process of the increas-
ing complexity of simple organisms that
took hundreds of thousands of years in na-
ture took days in the laboratory of edward
pontius

  feverishly he set to work to yest this
amazing fact to the fullest after inadver-
tently telling the world about his q-ray
he saw his mistake and retired to his labora-
tory for the rest of his life month after
month year after year-testing retesting
discarding starting over he finally evolved
a process that had finally culminated in
the two synthetic men his son had produced

  what it meant was that the process of
the evolution of a single-celled organism
into a mature man which had taken hun-
dreds of millions of years had been com-
pressed under the action of the q-ray into
sixty-five years douglass gasped when the
significance of these words penetrated his
mind

  of course pontius said slowly when
my father died and left me his experiments
i knew i would succeed all i had to do
was to carry them on and allow the half-
formed creatures to continue evolving but
now they are finished badly finished per-

 radiant energy is classified according to the
wavelengths of the rays there are the visible
light rays whose wavelength is between 
and  inches wavelengths of energy
longer than the longest light wave gives us
the infra-red heat waves and still longer waves
gives us radio waves shorter than the short
waves of light are the ultra-violet still shorter
are the x-ray which are about  inches
in length gamma rays of radium arc still
shorter being about  the length of the
x-ray while at very end of the spectrum we
have so far discovered are the cosmic rays
being less than a thousandth of the length of
the gamma rays the q-ray therefore is an
extremely short wavelength lying between the
gamma ray and the cosmic ray

haps but i know that they live i can
arouse them to life at any moment i wish
he paused i am old i have no heir
and i want the result of this work to be
given to the world the world must do
with it as it will

  and your creatures really live doug-
lass said when he could find his voice

  pontius nodded only yesterday i saw
that one there and he pointed to one of the
imprisoned men making efforts to get out
of his tube the human desire for freedom
of course and that fellow is a particularly
pugnacious member of his species

from the streets outsidd came a sudden
shriek of police sirens douglass sat
up with a jolt the scientist appraised him
quizzically and glanced at the tubes the
reporter heard him mutter something in-
comprehensible as he tensed in his swivel
chair he glanced toward the two synthe-
tic men

  the green fire-shot eyes of one were rov-
ing over the room douglass clutched his
papers and pencil lightly in a trembling fist
and watched silently in awe dr pontius
half-rose from his chair in a tense attitude
then the synthetic creature lifted a feeble
hand and ran itnervously across his face
a cry of fear clogged the reporters throat
he struggled to down it but it came forth
in a terrified grunt

  good god he groaned hes coming
to

  silence hissed dr pontius severely
those damned sirens their vibrations
have awakened my subjects before i was
ready for them

  douglass watched the synthetic beings in
peculiar fascination his brows were con-
tracted into a frown that bordened on stark
terror it seemed to him that something
like an electric current passed from the
tubes to dr pontius making him as rigid
as steel the scientist gripped the arms of
his chair so tightly that his knuckles showed
white and bloodless

  so distinct was the impression of the re-
porter that there was some mystic unfath-
omable tie between dr pontius and his syn-
thetic creations that he almost dropped his


wonder stories

pencil with a startled gasp he pocketed
it safely with his papers and fumbled ner-
vously for a cigarette his taut nerves were
shattering and he had a strange premonition
that something was going to happen
something dire and untoward a weird
chill seemed to permeate the room suggest-
ing violence and death it made the re-
porter experience hot and cold sensations
from head to foot

  dr pontius watched his subjects in si-
lence a sense of awe and apprehension
placed itself upon him there was a mark-
ed change of expression in the faces of the
synthetic men in the tubes gone was their
seemingly lifeless sleep their emerald-
green eyes that were flecked with fire stared
out into the gloomy laboratory with un-
blinking steadiness the bodies began to
squirm suddenly weakly the creature
that had appeared on the verge of death
had strangely taken on new life he show-
ed even more strength now than the other

  then douglass felt the full force of their
stare as they swung their fiery eyes upon
him he felt a sensation of nausea in his vit-
als his stomach seemed to turn over com-
pletely there was a powerful something
in the eyes of the creature that made him
shudder and feel sick it seemed to him
that a faint diabolical grin formed on their
lips remaining as if glued there

  god he mumbled under his breath
what a terrible curse they are to human-
ity

  his eyes flashed grimly as he fought to
remove them from the leering faces behind
the glass dr pontius eyed him thought-
fully and laughed quietly he spoke in an
almost inaudible whisper that made the re-
porter start

  i will ask you to remain as my guest
tonight douglass pontius hissed softly
tensely i will need your help

  the reporter stiffened he stared for a
moment apprehensively at the scientist then
shook his head

  im sorry sir he whispered nervously
i cannot possibly remain the service is
waiting for my press copy-

  tut tut pontius countered un-
mistakeably you are afraid

  douglass smiled grimly his lips feeling
strangely tight across the teeth i am
uneasy he snapped in muffled tones but
not afraid i have seen men hanged and
electrocuted and dead decayed bodies in
the police morgues as a reporter ive had
to handle some but never have i encoun-
tered such a horrible experience as this
no dr pontius i am not afraid i beg
to be excused nevertheless

help needed

dr pontius shrugged resignedly of
course i would not hold you here
against your wishes he muttered disap-
pointedly i thought you would welcome
the chance to aid me as a means of better-
ing your story it will be necessary to re-
move my subjects from the tubes tonight
it is too big a job for me to handle alone
i will have to call on my niece for help if
you insist on going

  you mean you would get a womans
help douglass inquired dumbly incred-
ulously why you dont even know what
the creatures might do

  you are correct young man said pon-
tius stiffly i dont know what will hap-
pen but allanna my niece has often
helped in the laboratory- in fact she seems
quite fond of my subjects

  douglass shuddered again and cursed his
own emotions of fear he was afraid to
remain and knew it something in his sub-
conscious mind advised him to go but a
greater force held him he could hardly
picture a woman doubtlessly young hand-
ling such awful creatures as the tubes con-
tained he realized that if the subjects
became uncontrollable old dr pontius
would be little protection for his niece
what then he would never be able to
forgive himself if anything happened in the
place after his departure

  before he could prevent himself from
giving his final answer the words fairly
splurged from his tight lips then ill
remain dr pontius he whispered squirm-
ing uneasily in his seat not because i
want to but for your protection some-
thing might happen i have a hunch-
the synthetic men



  thats fine douglass the scientist in-
terjected just remove your coat ill
give you a robe after i call allanna

  you-you are going to bring your niece
in anyhow the reporter gasped brokenly

 dr pontius nodded grimly she
wouldnt want to miss it he mumbled
in fact she asked that i let her in on the
work ill need her too for shes a trained
nurse

  the scientist turned to his desk phone
lifted the receiver and pressed a button on
the call-box douglass thought he heard
the faint tinkle of a bell not far away and
wondered if allanna lived with her uncle
in the big house that was built around the
laboratory his thoughts were diverted by
pontius muffled voice

  allanna the scientist half-whispered
can you come to the laboratory at once
the lime has arrived to remove the subjects
from the tubes

  the reporter shivered slightly as he be-
gan removing his coat the sound of a
musical voice reached him as it came over
the wire to the scientist

  why of course he heard allannas
reply i was just wondering when it
would happen but isnt it a trifle early

  ordinarily they should not have been
removed until the end of this week dr
pontius said controlling a voice that was
filled with excitement and suspense the
awakening is a bit premature due to the vib-
rations from some sirens then you will
be right down

  right away uncle cliff she replied
a trifle eagerly anyone there to help

  dr pontius automatically glanced at the
reporter douglass stood coatless rolling
his sleeves

  mi douglass a reporter is here al-
lanna responded the scientist he will
help

  oh said the feminine voice not
much there but it will come in handy
ill be right down

chapter iii

the creatures live

tie reporters face reddened and his ears
stung at the insinuation of the invisible
woman before he had time to decide if he
resented it dr pontius grinned up at him
went softly to a closet and handed him a
linen gown

  protect your clothes douglass he said
quickly youll find this an unpleasant
job

  douglass agreed silently that it was not
the least bit inviting inwardly he re-
belled at the thought of touching the greasy
subjects in the huge tubes but he steeled
himself to the impending ordeal quickly
he donned the gown then glanced at the
synthetic creatures

  the diabolical grins that had been on
their lips had given away to murderous
leers the reporter recoiled a trifle when
one of them cast him a side-long glance
twin jets of fire seemed to come from those
fiery eyes to sear his very soul they bit
into him like blades he turned to pon-
tius

  are you sure that it will be safe to re-
lease them doc he inquired tensely

  the scientist tied the belt of his gown be-
hind his back and looked at the reporter
calmly

  certainly he replied nonchalantly
moreover it must be done otherwise they
will die and rhy lifes work will go for noth-
ing

  what do you plan to do with them
douglass blurted

  that i have not fully decided dr pon-
tius stated advancing for the present
im going to try to teach them to be house
servants and drill a little sense into them

  then they will emerge from the tubes
dumb and witless

  dr pontius laughed quietly but doug-
lass noticed that it was a dull humorless
laugh then his face sobered and his eyes
sparkled with the mysterious light of func-
tioning genius

  an infant is dumb and witless when it
is born douglass he nodded my sub-


wonder stories

jects are men in stature but will emerge
from the test tubes with the intellect of a
five-year old i will be forced to develop
their brains such as they have the brain
runs second in all human mysteries and
while  have succeeded in creating synthe-
tic life i do not profess to have solved the
mystery of thought and subconscious phen-
omena perhaps the next experiment will
show better results in that line

  the reporter gasped aloud with a sucking
in of breath then you are actually going
to try it again he asked mouth agape

  dr pontius was on the verge of making
a reply when the door bell tinkled his at-
tention was diverted and drawn to the lock
control he went to his desk hurriedly
and pressed the button douglass glanced
at the door expectantly and in a moment it
swung open into the dismal room walked
the only bit of sunshine he had seen since
arriving hours before

  allanna was like a beautiful flower in an
ugly vase she was young and fairly rad-
iated sunshine her cheeks seemed to glow
even under the subdued illumination of the
dreary dismal laboratory and her eyes a
deeper shade of blue than the scientists
sparkled with a frank understanding ten-
derness she was dressed in the spotless
white of a trained nurse from under her
starched cap protruded curling whisps of
auburn hair

  douglass felt that never before had he
beheld such a beautiful girl before her
arrival he had mentally visioned her as
skinny curt and undemonstrative he was
completely bowled over now and he gaped
at her in astonishment when she paused a
few feet away from him

  good evening she said in a soft musi-
cal voice you are mr douglass

  the newspaper man shook his head eag-
erly forgetting entirely that he was im-
mersed in the dreary gloom of a womb of
science

  douglass-morton douglass he stam-
mered you are allanna dr pontius
niece

  she smiled warmly uncle calls me al-
lie she said ive read and digested many
of your scientific articles mr douglass and

found them charmingly written and precise-
ly correct

  thank you miss allanna he grinned
theres nothing more disgusting than rot-
ten scientific reports i strive to get mine
correct that is why i am here tonight-
to get your uncles startling discoveries first
hand

  they were interrupted by dr pontius
no need to introduce you two he chuck-
led quietly youll get along now lets
get busy allie you know what to do
mr douglass will help me with the tubes

suddenly dr pontius snapped an
electric switch instantly the labora-
tory became a place of brilliant light the
young mr douglass gave a start his pulse
beat a tattoo at his temples quickly he
glanced around the room the gloom had
vanished and he found that the place was
not so sal as it had been under the glow
of the single frosted desk lamp yet the
peculiar revulsion for it all still clung to
him the four human skeletons stood out
now in high relief against the wall their
sightless sockets seemed concentrated upon
him he winced at a discovery

  the skeletons were not wired at all as
he had suspected they were indeed frsh
green bones partly dissolved in the devas-
tating green jelly with a sinking feeling
he withdrew his popping eyes from them
and glanced at allie she was making
ready two operating tables in the center of
the room her back was turned to him so
that she did not observe the panicky look in
his eyes and the pallor in his cheeks

  he was glad of it for he did not want her
to think him a coward he could have
faced death easily knowing what confronted
him but here in this place of unknown
things unnatural life and inhuman sorcery
he was all but completely unnerved nor
could he have been blamed for it only
long association with such dreadful things
could make a man or woman indifferent to
them neither allie or her uncle minded
the strange combination of life and death
in the least

  the place now seemed like a sepulchre
the silence was oppressing the very at-
the synthetic men



losphere was filled with a high tension as
if a bomb lay in the middle of the place
with a burning fuse nearing the deadly
charge of explosives douglass sensed dan-
ger of an unknown degree and turned to
the tubes to see the synthetic creatures ap-
praising him greedily

  dr pontius motioned to him from where
he stood just beside the first tube inside
of it the creature leered his lips curled into
the snarl of a savage jungle beast the
reporter looked hard at him and found that
he was no longer transparent he glanced
at the other man gone also was his trans-
parency and he appraised the scientist
questioningly as though he sensed what
lay in the reporters mind dr pontius vol-
untarily enlightened him

  they were made transparent by this n-
ray projector he pointed to the globe
above them i arranged that so i could
see what was taking place within their ana-
tomies at all times but you will find that
they have a healthy look now

  the newspaperman looked at them again
indeed they did appear healthy their skin
seemed like green silk and as smooth as
silk but it still seemed ghastly and un-
earthly something about it created a sense
of horror in the reporter his soul rebelled
against them and he wondered if miss al-
lanna or her uncle had any such feelings

  before he had time to inquire about it
dr pontius announced himself ready to re-
move his subjects the reporters blood
pounded his lips lightened across his
teeth again and his hands went into balls of
muscle and bone voluntarily he watched
the scientist as he began removing the sus-
taining bands from about the tube doug-
less felt his flesh creep he stiffened
strangely when allie came up and stood be-
side him their elbows brushing she spoke
to him in a very low whisper

  arent you thrilled mr douglass she
asked bubbling over with excitement i
think its wonderful

  yes er-i am miss allanna he replied
shakily im so thrilled that my spine
shivers 

  she gave an almost silent laugh and he
felt her deep-blue eyes upon him fearful

lest she discover his weakness he did not
look at her but watched instead the crea-
ture within the tube that dr pontius was
working on the leering subject was gaz-
ing at his creator now the tips of his fin-
gers working convulsively as though eager
to get at the throat of the scientist

  arent you the least bit afraid miss al-
lanna douglass blurted suddenly she
chuckled

  not in the least she replied sincerely
are you mr douglass

delicate work

he ventured a glance at her she was
watching her uncle her face was
aglow with expectantcy not a single quiv-
er of revulsion ran through her and the re-
porter marvelled at her remarkable equam-
nity in the face of such horrors she was
as calloused to them as her distinguished
uncle

  now said pontius crisply one more
thing to do and then well be ready to re-
move them

  he wheeled over to the tube a large stand
the lower part of which held a box on which
were a row of black buttons a long thick
rod projected upward to a qpeer-looking
metal globe pontius adjusted the stand in
front of his creation and sighting along
it for a moment pressed one of the black
buttons instantly a sharp dazzling beam
of light emanating from the globe bathed
the synthetic man in its glow for a mo-
ment as douglass gazed in awe the crea-
ture remained motionless then his arms be-
gan to move slowly up and down through
the confining liquid and his features took
on the look of one awakening from a long
sleep

  now douglass said pontius suddenly
on the other side of the tube you will find
a crank turn it slowly in a clockwise di-
rection until the tube is inclined fifteen
degrees then well open up the tube and
release our good friend

  hesitantly the reporter went to obey he
grasped the handles as directed and was
amazed to feel ihe tube slowly incline
when the inclination had reached fifteen


wonder stories

degrees he opened up the tube leaving the
synthetic man exposed as though he stood
upright in a glass coffin

  expecting to see the creature fall out of
the tube and at him douglass quickly set
the half-tube aside and partly crouched
the being stared at him strangely but made
no effort to get out

  i dont believe joe agar would hurt a
flea laughed allanna amused at the re-
porters actions

  douglass calmed easily joe agar
he squinted at her curiously is that
what you are going to call the creature
what else could we name him mr
douglass allanna smiled agar is the
substance from which they sprung hence
the name the other one is jack their
names are joe and jack agar

  brothers under the skin the reporter
grimaced

  deeper than that mr douglass the
girl replied quickly

  her attention was suddenly drawn to her
uncle who spoke softly at her

  are you ready to receive him allie
the scientist asked without pausing in his
work strait-jackets for emergency ether
and all that

  yes doctor she responded dropping
all interest in everything but her profes-
sional duty as a trained nurse

  then take your post dr pontius or-
dered curtly he turned to the reporter
douglass you stand ready to support the
subject in event his weakness causes him
to topple when i let the jelly out into the
hole at the bottom of the tube

  weak eh douglass muttered to him-
self im damned glad of that makes
me feel better

  whats tbat young man dr pontius
snapped sharply

  nothing sir responded the reporter
i was just humming a tune

  good ejaculated the scientist i like
to have around me men who are fearless
and callous you are improving sir
thank you doc douglass said evenly
then to himself if he only knew the
truth

  douglass was so utterly startled by a sud-

den groan from the curled lips of joe agar
that his face turned even more pale the
creature sagged forward a trifle as the jelly
slowly filtered through the now opened
hole instinctively but revulsively the re-
porter reached forward to support him
his hands touched the greasy body it felt
as clammy as the skin of a snake and it
made him tremble he felt his flesh creep
but stood rigid both hands under the arm-
pit of the artificial man

       chapter iv
       the first death

joe agar swung his steady unblinking
gaze upon the newspaper man doug-
lass avoided the green eyes by concentra-
ting on the creatures hairless head and
aboriginal brow he shook almost violent-
ly for the somber ominous atmosphere with
its invisible menace was striking deeply at
his soul danger seemed to lurk on every
hand and the reporter sensed it even more
when the final protecting fluid had slipped
from the creatures body

  instantly joe agar toppled limply into
the reporters arms the scientist quickly
went to his aid nd together they carried
the weak synthetic creature to a table al-
lanna had spread upon it clean sheets and
blankets she stood at its head a mask
in one hand and an ether container in the
other evidently they had not expected the
creature to emerge in such a weakened con-
dition and they were ready to subdue him
if need be he was placed under the blan-
kets and the girl laid aside her instruments
of mercy

  he is too weak to be harmful she
said calmly and too feeble to stand an
anasthetic

  that is correct allie said her uncle
his respiration is dangerously low just
cover him well and let him sleep until morn-
ing i think hell be alright now mr
douglass if you dont mind well remove
the other one

  silently they returned to the tubes leav-
ing miss allanna bending over joe agar

he heard her gasp and glanced over his
shoulders she was looking after her uncle
questioningly but said nothing there came
a dismal groan from the table dr pon-
tius turned suddenly and retraced his steps
toward it

  what was that allie he asked appre-
hensively as though sensing something un-
toward in the sound that had escaped his
subjects lips

  miss allanna looked up at him curious-
ly i-i dont know she replied softly
unless he is dying

  douglass came up beside her and looked
into the grotesque face on the sheets joe
agar seemed to be breathing his last his
lips were still curled into a foreboding
sneer and his lids were wide a purple
rash stood out on his brown and a greenish
liquid perspiration fairly surged from his
over-large pores

  why hes dying exclaimed the re-
porter with a feeling akin to genuine joy
through his mind raced a wild thought
i hope he does he thought a thing
dies then well only have one his brother
to reckon with no doubt about it they
seemed to have taken a form of life to pur-
posely revenge themselves on man who vio-
lated all laws of nature

  silence snapped dr pontius with a
scowl he reached up suddenly and took a
green bottle from the shelf as if ordered
to do so by mental telepathy allanna pull-
ed one of joe agars arms out into the open
dr pontius emptied the contents of the bot-
tle into a glass tube under the table and
calmly began to transfer it to the veins of
the dying subject douglass shuddered as
a silver tube was inserted in the artery of
the arm and turned away appalled some-
thing drew him to the other creature he
paused in front of the big tube to stare
meditatively at the leering features of jack
agar

  he felt an urge to bolt the place then
suddenly he came down to earth if he ran
out on this terrifying experiment he would
never hear the end of it after all he was
a newspaper man on an important story
he must continue with the ordeal whether
he wanted to or not despite the fact that jack

agar was going to be more difficult to han-
dle than the other

  jack agar virtually chewed at his lips in
a strange sinister emotion of savagery
muscles seemed to bulge under his silky
skin his fingers twitched with the rest-
lessness of a mad man douglass realized
that there was nothing weak about him he
heard dr pontius emit a dismayed groan
and turned allanna was working a small
pulmotor frantically but the scientist waved
her aside

  never mind allanna he said omin-
ously hes done dead

the reporter shrugged as she pulled a
sheet over the greenwhite face across
his lips flashed a smile piously he glanc-
ed upward and shook his head as though
to offer thanks to the invisible creator of
all things for having interfered with this
horrible violation of natures laws he
heard allanna stifle a sob and wondered
if she mourned the death of the synthetic
creature but no it was not that she
sympathized with her uncle who stood be-
side the bed dejectedly like a man who has
lost his all he jerked erect suddenly and
came toward the reporter

  were not beaten yet douglass he
muttered i rather suspected joe agar
would pass on but i have little fear for
jack hell live to prove my fathers dis-
coveries to the world

  i hope so dr pontius lied douglass
glibly yet he felt genuine sorrow for the
old scientist who had spent his life to evolve
man then be forced to watch the results of
his genius die at the point of success he
is indeed filled with vigor and-uncon-
trolled deviltry

  you are right dr pontius replied
promptly he has developed far beyond
his brother that is why i valued his life
more though he has scarcely less than
the brute capacity of the simians and will
be hard to control still i have no fear
of him for i will bend him to my will by
hypnotic suggestion

  douglass somewhat doubted the genuine-
ness of the scientists expressed fearlessness
there was something in his tone now that


wonder stories

belied a kind of fear for the creature in the
tube but the reporter argued with himself
that it might be a tone of sadness at the
death of joe agar yet his uneasiness in-
creased and he stirred restlessly while dr
pontius dismantled the tube he watched
with unrestrained forebodings

  jack agar possessed the strength of a
maniac this might appear strange con-
sidering the fact that the creature had never
been permitted to move freely but dr
pontius had used special care to build up
his muscular system scarcely had the re-
porter removed the front section of the tube
than the synthetic man lashed out with a
frenzied left hand to clutch at him

  hadnt you better use a hypodermic
needle on him dr pontius he asked
trembling then he added in a grim whis-
per til sock him square on the button if
i have to

  no no no said dr pontius severely
the shock may forever weaken his senses
do not raise a hand against him young
man i warn you

  douglass suddenly sensed the nearness
of allanna she had crept up unnoticed to
watch the work of releasing the bestial sub-
ject and had sen jack agars savage thrust
at the reporter there was an unmistakable
expression of alarm on her features yet she
seemed calm and collected she peered in-
tently into the maniacal face of the strug-
gling creature her deep-blue eyes boring in-
to him steadily

  as though compelled to do so by some
powerful invisible force jack agar grad-
ually ceased his struggles the green fire
seemed to vanish from his eyes they be-
came soft and languid as the eyes of a child
looking up into his mothers kindly face
appealingly still douglass thought he
detected an evil gleam in the look his
gaze traveled from the creature to allanna
across her lips flashed a pleased smile

  be a good boy jack she whispered soft-
ly never moving her eyes from him for an
instant but whether jack agar understood
what she said douglass could not decide
he very much doubted it however and won-
dered what force she had applied to him
to bring him to submission had she used

hypnotic suggestion or just plain hypnotism
on a weaker will or was the creature
merely fascinated by the charm of the girl
and did the evil gleam in his eyes spell ill
for her whatever it was she had certain-
ly subdued him her eyes soothing him like
music soothes the savage beast

  dr pontius glanced at her presently
hell be alright now allie he said
smoothly you may rest a moment you
must be tired now

  oh im alright uncle mark she re-
sponded trembling slightly you can go
ahead the table is ready

       chapter v
       uneasy hours

the scientist gave her a warm affection-
ate smile and turned again to the tube
quickly he surveyed the silent foreboding
subject whose eyes followed allanna as she
turned away douglass crouched instinc-
tively expecting the creature to leap from
his coffin of glass but jack agar made
no such move he seemed thoroughly fas-
cinated by the girl and watched her stead-
ily through unblinking eyes the reporter
was amazed to see dr pontius lead him eas-
ily from his container directly to the table
he followed cautiously tensely ready for
any sudden outbreak from the synthetic
man

  with his subject prone on the table dr
pontius lost no time in strapping him down
by the ankles and wrists jack agar made
no protest but kept his orbs glued on al-
lanna reaching to the wall quickly the
scientist grasped a cord and lowered a
great green-shaded lamp of the same pro-
portions as the table without hesitation
he switched on a biilliant light that sprayed
the subject with an emerald glare jack
agar writhed as though he lay on a bed of
coals his muscles bulged and snapped
then dr pontius flicked his open hand be-
fore his face like a hypnotist working on a
subject the synthetic man ceased his strug-
gles and lay still under the flood of light

  the reporter heaved a sigh of relief he
opened his clenched fists and relaxed his
the synthetic men



numbed fingers the nails had bitten into
the palms leaving crescent scars his
hands trembled in reaction to the released
tension suddenly he found himself weak
very weak dr pontius appraised him
glancing at his watch

  it is after midnight douglass he said
showing no reaction to the strain and un-
certainly of his work perhaps you had
better retire allie will show you to a
guest room

  you sure you wont need me again to-
night dr pontius the reporter inquired
dismally

  the scientist nodded no douglass
he said simply i will not need you let
me thank you for your help

  they shook hands then if you dont
mind i will retire replied douglass ris-
ing he walked over and stood beside the
table for a moment to stare at the synthetic
man jack lay perfectly still now as still
as his sheet-covered brother near him his
unblinking eyes stared upward at the bril-
liant illuminated tubes in the flood-lamp

  douglass felt a nauseating sensation surg-
ing through him as he peered into those
dread orbs they reminded him of a pic-
ture of satan he had once seen the eyes
had been wide and menacing he felt the
roots of his hair tangle he turned away
with a desire to quit the place forever
when he confronted allanna he recalled
quickly that he had a hunch a persistent
premonition that something was going to
happen seeing her again caused him to
forget instantly his desire to leave her
sunny smile again captivated him

  she held his coat and hat in her hands
you will not need the gown any more mr
douglass she said her voice was soft
and cheery he had forgotten about the
white linen gown he wore and quickly shed
it she helped him with his coat and to-
gether they went out of the ghostly labora-
tory leaving dr pontius alone with his
skeletons and his subjects life and death
and evil shadows hovering about him

  is your uncle going to work all night
miss allanna the reporter inquired as
they entered a door leading off from the
hallway and began mounting a pair of wind-

ing stairs that creaked under their weight
the sounds made the reporter shiver for
they sounded mysterious spectral

  i do not believe so she said promptly
but he has much work to do you see he
plans to preserve the body of joe agar and
intends to place it in the preservatives to-
night

  going to pickle him the reporter
gasped

  the clear ring of her corresponding laugh
made him turn to look at her she flashed
him a serious glance could nothing ruffle
this girls cool indifference to the stark real-
ities of the place lie wandered if anything
could suspend or break her callousness even
temporarily

  thats it precisely she commented soft-
ly the delicatc texture of artificial flesh
makes preservation necessary at once now
that joe agar is dead uncle cliff wants
the preserved body to go to tyburn col-
lege

the house of dr pontius the reporter
soon discovered was almost as weird
and spectral as his laboratory indirect il-
lumination made it a place of lurking shad-
ows that seemed to blend perfectly with the
mystery of the man himself in the living
room to which allanna guided him were
many preserved specimens of life arranged
in glass containers on shelves and pedestals
the entire room shrieked silence and dark
mystery allanna was the only bright ob-
ject in the place and douglass was glad to
rest his tired eyes upon her sunny face and
supple form

  she invited him to the divan and for the
first time since his arrival he regained some
of his composure

  did i hear you say you were busy every
evening miss allanna he inquired
strategically to pave a way for future meet-
ings she appraised him cooly

  oh no she replied suppressing a
yawn i have several nights open

  thats excellent he applauded happi-
ly flow about the others

  well she said mischievously you
wouldnt expect a girl to be without at
least one boy friend would you


wonder stories

   the reporter felt a vague feeling of jeal-
 ousy surge through him his lips tightened
 strangely again but in jealous embarrass
 ment

   not a beautiful girl like you he said
 slightly confused but i was hoping that
 i might see you more than several nights a
 wekk

   allanna shrugged and was about to re-
ply when dr pontius came suddenly into
the room he was smiling oddly

  you are indeed a fast-working young
man douglass he said  wish you
luck he turned to his niece hadnt
you better retire for your beauty sleep
allie

   allanna yawned and stood up i believe
i shall uncle mark she responded if
mr douglass will excuse me    

   of course aid the reporter his face
 stinging good night

   dr pontius cut him short come along
young man he ordered ill take you to
your room the butler will call you for
breakfast

  side by side they followed allanna to the
 second floor the house was as silent as a
 tomb allanna flashed them a warm smile
 as she turned into a room from the hall
 above douglass blood raced at it for it
 had told him much

   as he entered his room directly across the
 hall from the one taken by allanna doug-
 lass felt a strange feeling come over him
 just why he did not understand but he
 seemed to sense the presence of death
 something akin to a cold current shot
 through his veins as he picked up a pair of
 silken guest pajamas he managed to con-
 trol himself as he spread them out and spec-
 ulated on the size after undressing he
 climbed into bed and counted sheep until
 he fell into a troubled restless slumber

   during the following hour his subcon-
scious mind ran the entire gamut of sen-
sations wild dreams and nightmares made
him toss and roll his lips became fever-
ish from them escaped weird sounds that
in themselves even went to further terror-
ize him they appeared to him to come
from the curling lips of the synthetic men
the body of joe agar seemed to hover over

 him like a dismal ghost the wide satanic
 orbs of the living jack stared at him burn-
 ing like twin fires and searing his soul

  then something happened that brought
douglass wide awake what was it was
his imagination mnning wild or had his
ears detected the faint stealthy footsteps of
a bare-footed prowler sitting rigid in bed
he waited for the sounds to reach his ears
again the room was pitch dark in
front of his eyes danced gray ominous
shapes the fancies of his strained vision
suddenly he heard what he thought sounded
like a dull thump as though a body had
collided with a wall or the floor then the
silence became ominous

  trembling from head to foot and chilled
to the marrow with a cold clammy feeling
he softly got out of bed and glided to the
door a skylight over the hall bathed it
in a pale phosphorescent glow from a high
moon at a glance he saw that dr pon-
tius door was open his room was beside
allannas and the scientist had closed his
door on entering douglass had seen that
but why was it open now was dr pontius
prowling around the house he wondered
if the scientist had made the unnatural
sounds

as he watched the open door douglass
thought he saw a green ghastly face
appear in it for a moment his blood ran
cold and his knees banged together not
a sound reached his ears altho he listened
with his hands cupped behind them

  clang clang clang the great an-
tique clock in the living room chimed sud-
denly douglass almost screamed then a
grotesque face appeared in the scientists
doorway the reporter recoiled like a
snake almost at once he heard the pad of
bare feet in the hall and by sheer force of
will was he able to look out again

  the hulking form of jack agar was re-
treating slowly down the hall from his
wrists and ankles dangled the tom straps
that had held him to the table in the labor-
atory 

  my god douglass groaned through
dry parched lips as though hearing jack
agar paused abruptly and turned his fiery
the synthetic men



eyes back from whence he had come they
seemed like the orbs of a tiger flaming in
the night then he turned suddenly and en-
tered another room two doors beyond the
one occupied by the scientist more silence
followed beating down upon the reporter
like the blows of a triphammer

  what had jack agar done in the scien-
tists room it seemed to douglass that his
hunch had materialized in the dead of a
horrible night but had the synthetic man
actually killed his creator the reporter
could wait no longer to find out with a
bound he leaped into the hall and ran si-
lently to the opposite room without hesi-
tating he entered fumbled for a light-
switch near the frame and found it the
switch snapped

  as part of his duty as a reporter doug-
lass had seen men hanged but now as he
crouched against the wall he was terrified
and appalled at what his eyes beheld dr
pontius lay in a corner beside his bed his
head crushed like an eggshell

  the reporter suddenly heard another dull
thump and a hiss of air from a dying mans
lungs swiftly his mind searched for a pos-
sible meaning to this then it dawned up-
on him that the butler must have fall victim
to the terror that was slinking like a mad
gorilla through the house he again heard
the indistinct pad of feet his blood
throbbed at his throat and temples sending
cold clammy chills over him where
would the beast of the test tubes go next
to his or allannas room

  douglass crouched just inside the death-
room door a great shadow ghastly and
spectral fell across the sill he felt an urge
to scream and smothered it the murder-
beast slunk past his long arms dangling
strangely at his bides his lips curled into
the same ominous leer his nude body glis-
tening under the light that filtered into the
hall

  the reporter was so utterly appalled that
his wits seemed dull it was fully a minute
before he overcame his horror and stole a
glance into the hall the synthetic man
crouched before the closed door of allanna
he looked toward the reporter as if by in-
stinct douglass dodged back out of sight

and waited expecting to see the beast track-
ing him down after a few seconds he look-
ed out again

  jack agar had vanished douglass heart
almost stopped before he could control
himself he had leaped out into the hall in-
stantly there came a blood-curdling scream
from allannas bedroom with terror strik-
ing at his mind the reporter ran for her
door it was open wide and her room was
filled with beastly muttering and stifled
cries then he heard plaintive pleadings
coming from the darkness pleadings from
horrified feminine lips

  young mr morton douglass could stand
no more mumbling dire things he bounded
into the room pausing to switch on the
lights and take stock of the situation

  the synthetic man was bending over al-
lanna as she lay in fear on her bed her
arms outstretched to ward off his deadly
murderous fingers douglass saw at a glance
that he had her by the throat now and in a
twinkling would beat her head to a pulp
the beast paid not the slightest attention to
the sudden flood of illumination but seem-
ed bent only on murder

  douglass had a glimpse of pleading eyes
peering at him through the beasts arms
for the first time in her life allanna was
in mortal fear the expression on her fea-
tures caused the reporter to go stark mad
with the roar of a beast he flung himself
forward felt his nerveless fingers touch the
clammy flesh of jack agar and gain a hold

the secret destroyed

it seemed to him then that nobody could
be closer to death but in his insane fury it
mattered not whether he came out victor-
ious or had his head smashed in so long as
he gave allanna a chance to escape gain-
ing momentary control over his reeling in-
furiated senses he yelled loudly to the girl

  run allanna he shouted using pre-
cious breath that he knew would be needed
to protect himself from jack agar call
the police

  allanna neded no urging like a wood
nymph she sprang from her bed and ran
terrified into the hall douglass heard her


wonder stories

calling desperately but futilely to her uncle
her feet sounded on the hall floor and then
the reporter heard her scream again he
did not doubt but that she had discovered
her uncles gruesome form stilled in death

  jack agars lips became discolored with
a green ghastly foam giving him the ap-
pearance of a rabid animal as he turned
slowly to face his antagonist from his
throat came the startling snarl of a jungle
brute making a kill but his actions were
sluggish because of his dull undeveloped
wits his great arms writhed through the
air like serpents and the reporter ducked
under them

  douglass stepped nimbly aside and de-
livered a clean right-handed blow on his
adversarys unwholesome chin the syn-
thetic mans eyes went strangely dull and
listless losing much of their savage mur-
derous lust he faltered a trifle and am-
bled backward the newspaper man fol-
lowed like a trained pugilist and led again
with a vicious left

  the delicate flesh of jack agars chin
split in a horrible gash a green liquid
sprayed over the reporter smelling like the
damp sour weeds of the sea his eyes
blazing furiously he lashed out with a potent
savageness across his vision was a curtain
of red and he cast caution aside to deliver
another terrific right then jack agars
waving arm caught him in the grip of a
boa he sobered in the instant and was
amazed at the supernatural strength of the
creature jack agar seemed to have the
power of steel vises in each arm and they
closed around the small of his back with
menace

  the newspaperman felt an agonizing pain
through his middle his blood seemed to
turn to ice and his heart appeared to have
suddenly stopped something told him he
was going to explode then he looked into
those terrible fiery orbs he tried to
scream but his voice was dead great balls
of fire danced before him and he knew he
was going into unconsciousness for a fath-
omless black abyss yawned under them like
open space he felt himself falling falling
with a terrific wind racing past his ears

  then as it seemed he was at last going to

strike terra firma at the bottom of the pit
he heard a terrific explosion through his
reeling head ran the thought that he had
actually exploded and his astral body was
floating over his mortal remains something
hit his ghost and knocked it strangely aside
then he thought that he was gloating over
something

  and that something looked very much
like the still form of jack agar with a round
hole in the center of his brow from which
poured a smelly green liquid other forms
moved about like weaving ghosts then he
felt a cold icy something on his forehead
cradually objects began to assume definite
shape and finally out of a jumbled nothing
he recognized allanna from her deep-
blue eyes ran glistening tears

  oh mr douglass he heard her sob
tearfully he did not kill you oh 
he saw her shudder violently and then a
blue-uniformed man lifted her erect

  take it easy young lady advised the
officer it wont do to go into hysterics
hes alright

  eager hands lifted the reporter to his
feet his head reeled and he lurched side-
ways hands caught him water was forc-
ed down his parched lips rapidly he
emerged from the cloud behind which hov-
ered death and oblivion

  w-what happened he managed to ask
as he stood tottering a bluecoat glanced
to a heap on the floor and nodded

  he had you in a bad way young fellow
the officer said with a grin in another
second hed have bashed your head like an
eggshell murphys slug got him right be-
tween the eyes

  allanna shivered and hid her face against
the police captain who supported her she
sobbed convulsively douglass had a sud-
den thought

  did he kill the butler too he blurted
feeling the strength returning to his tremb-
ling legs he searched the officers eyes
the bluecoats nodded as one

  and the old man in the other room
said one of them smoothly bashed
in	

  i know all about that the reporter cut
in quickly to save allanna from hearing
the synthetic men



further the beast will never kill another
man i hope

  aye interjected the captain hes
as dead as a door-nail

  i had a hunch something like this would
happen said douglass shaking his head
sadly dr pontius violated all the un-
written laws of nature by creating synthetic
human life man should not try to duplicate
the work of the master creator i am sorry
for dr pontius but glad that he will carry
his secrets to the grave

 douglass instinctively glanced toward his
room across the hall where his coat con-
taining his papers reclined on a chair-
back he wondered if the papers had been
touched without hesitation he went to
the room removed the notes from his inner
pocket and strode to the open fireplace
near the foot of the bed his hands trem-
bled and he muttered softly to himself
he told me he had no written formula

he mumbled glancing at a paragraph in his
notes that revealed the secret of synthetic
life so here goes the works the secret
will remain a secret as far as im con-
cerned  

  a match scraped along the fireplace
stones it was held to the sheaf of fools-
cap a flame illuminated the drawn fea-
tures of the reporter he held the burning
documents until the flame reached his shak-
ing fingers then dropped the twisted mass
into the grate with a feeling that he was
doing mankind a great favor

  within a year the house of horror had
been transformed into one of sunniness
the pickled bodies of jack and joe agar
had been sent to tyburn and with them had
gone everything scientific dr pontius had
possessed allanna had fallen into the
wealth her uncle had left but her husband
the young mr morton douglass continues
to be the right hand man of amesbury of
the globe

 mr sharp is well known as the author of the eternal man and the eternal man re

 on space travel that it is possible for a satellite to be built for the earth such a ship sent  
 up to  miles and riven a speed of about five miles per second would continue to travel        
 around the earth indefinitely without further power such an idea has thousands of possibil     
 ities and mr sharp uses a few of the best to construct a story of mystery intrigue and         
 thrilling adventure

 the author who was recently a professor of medicine at the university of adelaide austra

 men or are tall or short fat or thin intelligent or moronic if such a power came into the     
 hands of any man he could use it to upset our entire earth a world wide catastrophe might       
 follow if he should use this knowledge to evil uses you must not miss this story

 what takes place far below the surface of the ocean is still quite a mystery to us because       
 of the terrific pressure at even moderate depths we have never been able to penetrate more      
 than a few hundred feet but it is probably true that strange creatures exist in the submar     
 ine depths what they would be like we have no means of telling but if we were to pene

  the struggle
  for venus dy s

lllxatrated by marckioni

 it rapidly grew in intensity it had the appearance of a half moon
 toward which i was rushing with frightful velocity

 
the day on which my story opens-
june  -was marked in advance
aa the date of a transit of venus across the
disk of the sun it will have a foremost
place in the minds of future generations
of school children as the date on which the
first expedition of colonists from earth
landed on the neighboring planet

  although a broken leg prevented me
from being a member of that band of
brave men my later
destiny was closely
linked with their
amazing adventures on
venus and it is their
story in so far as i
was connected with it
that i shall set down
here to the best of my
ability

  a n introductory
word about myself a
necessary the first
space trips - those
venturesome leaps to
the moon-were made
when i was a school
boy they fired the
imagination of the
world and i was
only one of the mil-
lions of boys who re-
solved to devote their
lives to the explora-
tion of space partly
because i was more
persistent than some
and partly because i
was more fortunate i
was able to follow the
line of my ambition

what will always
stand out as the biggest day in my life was
that on which my theoretical training com-
pleted i hopped off on my first space trip
in which  circled the moon prior to
that time robert e jones and matthew ed-
dy had already made their epochal trip to
venus and i looked upon my first space
voyage as merely further training that
would equip me for similar exploits

  when it was decided to send a large ex-

 pedition to remain at least two years on
 venus and investigate the deposits of rad-
 ium-bearing pitchblende found by jones
 and eddy in their brief stay i was accept-
 ed as a member of the party and took part
 in the preparations my high expectations
 were rudely dashed when a month before
 the start my run of good fortune was end-
 ed by the accident in which my leg was
 broken that of course disposed of my

he planet venus occu-
pies a peculiar and en-
viable position in our solar
system according to the
best evidence that we have
it is a young world younger
than the earth with a con-
sequently longer period of
life before it by its dis-
tance from the sun it is
well fitted to maintain a high
order of life and for all we
know that life may now ex-
ist beneath its ever-present
cloud layers and if life
does not exist on it venus
lies in the skies a planetary
prize awaiting the conquer-
or according to professor
v v stratonoff an emin-
ent russian astronomer the
earth must some day lose
its ability to support human
life and then we must be
prepared if we wish to main-
tain our race to emigrate to
a more habitable sphere
yet our conquest of venus
is not likely to go uncon-
tested for it is probable as
our author shows that a bit-
ter battle is certain over
this fair young world

r

hope of accompanying
the expedition dr
franklin sanders
chairman of the com-
mission for venus of-
fered me the post of
wireless o p e r a to r 
which  gladly accept-
ed my duties were
to aid in the installa-
tion of the station
which would be used
to communicate with
the men on venus
and after communi-
cations were establish-
ed to keep one of the
three eight-hour
watches at the re-
ceiving set at the
same time  was to aid
in preparations for a
second  expedition to
be sent out two years
later when venus
would again be in in-
ferior conjunction
with earth

  on june  
then  left an assist-
ant in the wireless

                    room and went to the
roof of the building in washington i c
furnished the commission by the north
american continental government it is
unnecessary for me to describe the transit
of venus across the suns disk for all of
my readers must have witnessed the pheno-
men either in  or   do wish
however to record a conversation with dr
sanders because it will show our expectant
attitude on that day when the expedition




wonder stories

out  days was scheduled to arrive on
venus i was watching the sun with the
planet outlined against it through a pair of
binoculars when dr sanders approached
me

  if all has gone well he said we
should be in communication with them in a
few days now

  im sure all has gone as planned sir
i replied nothing could go wrong with
commander jones in charge

  he is a wonderful leader dr sanders
agreed i share your confidence in him
nevertheless interplanetary travel is still
fraught with many perils as you know bet-
ter than i it is a long and dangerous voy-
age but i trust it has
been accomplished suc-
cessfully

  their adventures will
only have begun when
they land i said they
will still have to cope
with all the dangers of a
world such as ours must
have been a million
years ago

  and you would give
your right eye to be with
them dr sanders
smiled dont worry

starrett youll join
them at the first oppor-
tunity

 smiled rather
wryly i am afraid
for i knew that the next opportunity
would not come for almost twro years
from that day venus and earth would
steadily separate until some ten months
later they would be on opposite sides of the
sun and separated by more than -

	miles instead of a mere 
miles as at present no trip between the
two planets could be considered until ven-
us again approached inferior conjunction
dr sanders read my thoughts

  venus wont be civilized in two years
my boy he said nor in two decades
im sure you will have your part in the work
of civilizing it and your share of adventure
it is no secret of course that the present

plan is to estalish a permanent colony on
the planet there must be untold resources
to be developed i can visualize the day
when venus will have a thriving population
of men and women

  an almost religious light shone in his
eyes as he continued

  beautiful cities will be planned and
erected free from the blemishes that on
earth we have inherited from past ages of
trial and error commerce will ply the
seas of venus and there will be a steady
exchange of goods between the planets
venus may come to be regarded as the pro-
mised land for the inhabitants of earth
in some future age when the earth receives
less heat from the dying
sun mankind may desert
its old home and move
to the new world nearer
the source of life

  he clapped me on the
shoulder

  these are glorious
prospects that we have
before us in the dawn of
the st century ad-
venture such as no man
ever dreamed of a few
centuries ago my boy
the great adventure is
just beginning i pre-
dict that you will have a
big part in furthering it
so dont let your spirits
be cast down now

  i do not remember what reply i made
except that i stammered my thanks for his
kind words his enthusiasm and vision
were contagious although there was nothing
new to me in what he said later on how-
ever when i was back in the room which
housed the interplanetary wireless set my
disappointment rose afresh after all i
had wished to be a pioneer and it would
not be the same going out with a second
party two years later to find the ground
broken homes erected and a little commun-
ity ready to receive us nothing could be
done about it however i had missed my
big chance through such a trivial thing as a
fall and a broken leg

wesley arnold
the struggle for venus



  the bone had practically healed by this
time but it was too late the expedition
had departed twenty-six days earlier and
as we learned later landed on venus on
that very day and near the time when the
planet was seen from earth in transit across
the suns face i little guessed that day
how fortunate it was for all concerned that
i was not with them

chapter ii

mystery on venus

it was three days later before any word
was received from venus the delay be-
ing explained by the necessity for the tech-
nicians of the expedition to assemble the
wireless and getting it in working order
 still have copies of the messages received
in the washington headquarters so that i
am able to give their exact texts they tell
a dramatic story of mystery and suspense
in a strange and unfriendly world

  contact was established on june  i was
on duty at the time and was reporting per-
iodically to dr sanders that no results had
been obtained the wavelength to be used
was so low that there was no interference
from earth stations i was tuning the set
near the agreed point when i caught a faint
signal i perfected the adjustment and
then wailed if it were indeed venus call-
ing the signal would be repeated in exactly
five minutes precisely at the end of that
period which i spent watching the second
hand creep around the dial of my watch
i caught the signal again much louder it
was the venus station repeating the station
call for earth

  i tapped out the answer to show that
communication had been established and
then sent for dr sanders it would be
more than two minutes before the radio sig-
nal traveling with the speed of light would
reach venus and an equal time before the
reply could be heard

  dr sanders entered the room followed
by others who had heard the good news
there were excited whispers which i stilled
with a motion of ray hand although the
message was taken down automatically by
the receiving instruments i was unwilling
to risk the possibility of mechanical troub-

le and accordingly wrote the message down

  earth attention earth attention
arrived three days ago all o k we
landed near mouth of holmes river and
have begun construction of permanent home
on favorable site living in the ships
pending completion of thatched roof huts
party of hunters on first day surprised herd
of sexons and killed enough to supply us
with meat for a week have caught sever-
al forms of river life in nets and dr alex-
ander is analyzing them potato trees are
plentiful and the root with sexon meat and
bread completes our diet until dr alex-
ander tells us what else we can eat

  have divided party in two groups and
alternate daily one group exploring
neighborhood and collecting specimens of
vegetable and animal life while others cut
and haul lumber the wood of the potato
tree is strong and light and the rough
sawed lumber has the quality of glowing
faintly for several hours after sunset liz-
ards of many types and all sizes are abun-
dant but apparently harmless we hope
tc begin work on radium field in few weeks
when camp is completed men all gather-
ed to wait your reply send greetings to
friends on earth robert e jones

  dr sanders quickly scribbled the answer
which i began sending within a few minutes
after the completion of this message in
the meantime the news had been flashed to
all parts of the world congratulatory
messages from notables began arriving and
were transmitted to the distant party it
was more than two hours later when we
said good-bye for the day

  it is remarkable that from the first there
was no difficulty in communicating with the
party on venus it had been realized of
course that communication could not be
maintained during that part of the synodic
revolutions of the two planets when they
were at nearly opposite sides of the sun
and the most hoped for was that we could
keep in touch with the distant party during
the five or six months preceding and fol-
lowing inferior conjunction our exper-

an ostrich-like bird having six rudimentary
legs whence the name


wonder stories

ience proved beyond doubt that this was
possible although because of circum-
stances which i shall soon relate we ac-
tually maintained touch with commander
jones and his party for only thirty days
the breaking of communications at the end
of that time had nothing to do with radio
conditions if there had been anyone to
operate the station on venus the signals
would have been received at the washington
station

at the first however commander jones
could send a message from venus in
confidence that it would be received about
two minutes later on earth a program
was worked out by which we made contact
with the party at noon washington time
every day that was merely for conven-
ience and regularity as there was always
some one on duty in the receiving room in
the commission building to receive an emer-
gency message if there were any occasion
for one

 during the first week commander
jones daily message told a story of regular
progress in establishing a home under the
tropical and primitive conditions of the new
world the messages might almost have
come from a party in some still uncivilized
section near the equator except for refer-
ences to strange plants and animals simi-
lar to those which may have existed on
earth before the dawn of human life

  the first hint of what was to come was
contained in a message received on june 
it read

  something has happened that we are
unable to understand dick smith and
james fall disappeared yesterday afternoon
when they were cutting down trees a short
distance from the camp and no trace of
them has been found as yet we have
dropped everything else to look for them
no one can explain what may have happen-
ed to them we have seen vensaurians
large enough to carry a man or even two
without much difficulty but none was seen
near the time the men disappeared and no
tracks were found in the neighborhood
where they were working the large
species that we have seen appear to be her-

bivorous and have shown no signs of attack-
ing us what adds to the mystery is the
fact that both men were armed and would
certainly have used their pistols if attacked
no shots were heard by others working
nearby we hope that they have merely
strayed away and become lost but we do
not know what to fear i have ordered a
guard on the camp at all hours we will
continue our efforts to find smith and fall

  this message was a private one to dr
sanders and he did not make it public
since to have done so would have served no
useful purpose but would have aroused fu-
tile fears among relatives and friends not
only of the two men but of all those in the
party

  subsequent messages from commander
jones informed those of us connected with
the commission that no trace of the missing
men had been found the others after a
futile search returned to the other work
which it was necessary for them to do
the camp was completed and operations
were begun on the radium mine

  on july th we received the following
message from commander jones

  i am forced to the conclusion that there
is some intelligent and malevolent force at
work against us what its nature may be
it is impossible to say but on no other hy-
pothesis can i explain the invasion of our
camp last night

  there was no outcry during the night
but when we awoke this morning we found
that three men who had been on guard and
three other men who slept in a hut near
the edge of camp had disappeared we
found no sign of bloodshed nor of a strug-
gle of any sort which makes the occurrence
absolutely incomprehensible

  during the morning i decided to go up
a short distance in one of the space ships
to survey the land and possibly to lead the
missing men back to camp if they were free
it was then we made the discovery that the
ships had been entered and our tanks of
fuel mixture carried away this appar-
ently had been done at the same time the
men were spirited away for i am unable to
believe they took the fuel and left the camp
of their own accord
the struggle for venus



  at any rate we are now stranded here
and apparently at the mercy of unseen foes
the morale of the forty-eight men remain-
ing in the camp is unimpaired by this latest
development we are all determined to
solve the mystery and find out what hap-
pened to our comrades

  the loss of our fuel mixture is a ser-
ious blow since it means that we are forced
to remain where we are and will be unable
to do any extensive exploring unless we re-
cover the tanks the camp will be put on
a war basis until we determine the nature
of the danger which threatens us

  this message was the last that ivas re-
ceived from the expedition

  later that afternoon i tried to make con-
nection with the station  venus to trans-
mit a message from dr sanders i was
unable to obtain a reply nor was there
any word from the expedition the follow-
ing day at the usual time

chapter iii
a desperate plan

several days later dr sanders sent
for me to come to his office i could
tell from his nervous manner as he bade me
sit down that he had something of import-
ance to say he began abruptly

  we have held several meetings of the
commission he said to discuss the sit-
uation regarding the expedition now on
venus while we can only guess at what
may have happened to the party the sudden
breaking of communications following the
mysterious disappearance of eight of the
men and the raid on the camp indicates
that some disaster has overtaken them

  what makes the matter more serious is
the loss of their fuel mixture without
which they are unable to operate the space
ships that means that they cannot move
from the spot where they landed on the
northern coast of elysia and if they are be-
set by foes in overwhelming force they are
unable to escape to some other part of the
planet of course the fact that the fuel
mixture was singled out for theft indicates
that their foes are intelligent beings of some
sort this is in absolute contradiction to
the apparently well-established fact that

  nothing corresponding to human life exists
on venus but we are forced to accept the
fact as it stands

  we have decidcd in short that aid must
be sent to the party and especially that we
must get a supply of fuel mixture to them

  i dont think it is possible i protested
when he paused venus is rapidly sep-
arating from the earth at present a space
ship which started out now would have to
follow the planet through its orbit and
could only gain on it slowly possibly one
or two hundred thousand miles a day at
that rate even if the ship could carry
enough liquid air and fuel mixture for the
long journey it would not overtake the
planet for almost a year

  by all the accepted standards and theor-
ies that is correct dr sanders replied
such an attempt would of course be fore-
doomed to failure necessity however is
the mother of invention and a plan has
been worked out for the commission under
which we believe a space ship setting out
now can reach venus within two months
if you will consider making the trip i will
explain the idea to you it is unnecessary
for me to say that it will be hazardous in
the extreme or to point out that the lives
of the  men who landed on venus a month
ago may be at stake what do you say

  i am willing i replied

  dr sanders drew out a sheet of paper on
which was drawn a system of circles and
dotted lines and which i immediately re-
cognized as indicating the orbits of earth
and venus around the sun the sketch is
reproduced here page  so that the
reader can follow dr sanders explanation

  the plan as i have told you is an ex-
tremely daring one dr sanders contin-
ued it is nothing less than to launch a
ship into space at the proper direction and
at such a speed that it will circle the sun
and return in time to meet the planet ven-
us in its orbit

  the plan is shown on this diagram
the letters e and v show the respective
positions of earth and venus in their or-

the speed of venus in it orbit is about 
miles per second that of the earth  miles
per second if -an attempt were made to
reach venus directly it would be like chasing
after a fast-receding train


wonder stories

bits at the time of the recent transit the
small circles on the orbits e and v show
the positions in which the two planets will
be on july  when all should be in read-
iness for the start of the trip

  looking at the diagram  began to get a
faint understanding of the plan which was
indeed a daring one

  our calculations show that in one of the
small and speedy ships you would have to
travel under power for about 
miles along the course indicated dr san-
ders said since the course lies approxi-
mately in the direction of the sun your
speed would increase rapidly after you
passed the point where the suns attraction
equalled the earths after 
miles your speed would be such that you
could shut off your power and leave the
ship to sweep around the sun just as the
comet does and in the path indicated at
the end of  days the ship would have
whipped comet-like around the sun and re-
turned to the orbit of venus and the planet
would have moved forward to the same
point v thus your trip would require
less than twice the time taken by command-
er jones and his party although you would
cover almost  miles in reaching
the planet

iirphe course lies very close to the sun
 i said after studying the diagram for
a moment

  yes you would pass within 
miles of the sun dr sanders replied and
you would feel some discomfort from the
heat special arrangements will have to be
made to protect the ship the reason the
course is laid so close to the sun is that you
will gain speed that way in addition to
shortening your course your ship when
you turn off the power will be a free body
exactly similar to a comet and you know of
course that the closer such bodies pass to
the sun the greater is their speed

  i took up the diagram and studied it while

i	turned the proposal over in my mind
while i had no desire to sacrifice myself
to no purpose i was perfectly willing to
undertake a long chance in the hope of aid-
ing the men who were trapped on the dis-
tant planet and at the mercy of unknown

enemies on its face the plan seemed
hopeless but was it  knew that astrono-
mers were able to calculate with the utmost
precision the course of comets which ap-
peared suddenly in the solar system swept
around the sun and disappeared in far dis-
tances why then should they not be able
to prescribe the conditions under which a
body would follow a desired orbit around
the sun i knew too that the worlds best
astronomers and mathematicians were at the
call of the commission for venus if they
authorized the attempt-

  ill do it i said you say the start
cant be made until the st

  it will take that long to make the neces-
sary alterations in the ship to be used
dr sanders replied

  as he stood up and took my hand with a
quick nervous motion i realized that dr
sanders thought my death warrant had just
been signed

  there is to be another meeting of the
commission this afternoon he told me
you will be present of course and the
plans for the trip will be discussed

       chapter iv
       the trip begins

ahead of me millions of stars glittered
with magnificent brilliance against the
black background of limitless space ex-
actly  degrees to the right hung the sun
a big ball of fire outlined sharply against
blackness through the double glass port
in the stern of the space ship i could see the
earth brightly lighted by the sun filling
most of the sky behind me

  it was july  and my big adventure
was already an hour old after two weeks
of steady work the small space ship had
been remodeled to fit the special require-
ments of the voyage around the sun in ad-
dition to the heating arrangement it had
been equipped with a refrigerating system
which would carry the intense heat from
the sun-side to the off-side of the ship when

i	neared the sun special expansion plates
had been inserted in the outer steel envelope
of the ship to permit both extreme contrac-
tion from the cold of interstellar space and
extreme expansion from the suns heat when
the struggle for venus



it became intense the work had been
completed on schedule and i had stepped
into the ship at the appointed hour after a
final handclasp with dr sanders

  my schedule permitted of no delay im-
mediately after leaving the earths atmos-
phere i had turned on the rocket power
full force so that i was now many thous-
and miles out on my long journey

  for my own use i carried twenty tanks
of liquid air and five tanks of fuel mix-
ture enough to keep the ship going at full
speed for forty
days and to cov-
er approximate-
 y 
miles as well as
supply air inside
the sealed ship
for sixty days

packed away in
the ship were ten
extra tanks of
fuel mixture for
use in the big
ships stranded
on venus for
lack of it i had
already turned
on the heating
system and it
was warm and
comfortable i n
the inner shell of
the vacuum
ship

  with the ship
set on its course
and running
smoothly i was
able to leave the controls for the time being
and watch the earth from which  was re-
ceding at more than  miles a second
the earth itself i oiling along its orbit at
the rate of more than  miles a second
had already moved a considerable distance
to one side of a straight line behind the
ship in the days that followed it would
steadily dwindle in apparent size until it
became lost in the myriad of bright specks
that surrounded me on all sides and that
represented worlds and suns at incompre-

hensible distances

  almost squarely abeam on the right
side and at right angles to my course was
an exceptionally bright luminary which i
knew to be the planet venus if i could
only turn and fly directly to it my journey
would be a comparatively simple one but
i knew that i should require years to catch
the planet if i set out to pursue it through
its orbit long before that time my sup-
ply of liquid air would be exhausted in-
stead of following what appeared to be the

natural course i
must trust my-
self to mathema-
t i c a  science
which declared
that the sun if
permitted to ex-
ercise its influ-
snce would whirl
my ship around
it in such a way
a to intercept
the planet at an
advanced point
in its orbit

  as far as the
theory went i
was satisfied
that i would
reach venus in
safety i had
only to follow
the course laid
out for me and
there was little
danger of my
ship missing
venus complete-
ly and hurtling far out into space to drift
there long after i had suffocated for lack of
air the chief dangers that confronted me
were three in number and i was well aware
of them

  the first was that i might miss my way
in the maze of the heavens of this i was
not much afraid since  wa able to check
my course both by the constellations and by
the sun even if  became hopelessly lost
 might be able to reach mercury and re-
plenish my supply of liquid air

showing the novel means used by our explorer to
travel from earth e to venus v at the favor-
able time for passage the earth should be at e and
venus at v in a direct line with the sun but the
journey was not begun until july  when the planets
were in the positions el and vi it would not have
been passible to catch venus by chasing alter her
directly so our explorer set his course as indicated
by the heavy line and allowed the suns attraction
to pull him around it at a great speed and thence
land him at venus on september

  the second and probably the greatest
peril would be faced whenmy ship swept
freely in its orbit close to the sun if the
cooling system failed to work properly the
plates of the outer shell might be melted
this would not only disable the ship but
would permit the rays of the sun to beat
on the inner shell and raise the temperature
to a point where human life could not ex-
ist here too however if my equipment
worked properly all would be well

  the third danger was that which every
space flier encounters-the possibility of
his ship being disabled by collision with a
large meteoric particle with watchfulness
and care this could be avoided despite the
fact that i would have to spend some eight
hourse of every day asleep there was of
course an almost steady succession of taps
audible iriside the ship as small particles
ricocheted off the stream lines of the outer
shell but these offered practically no peril

thinking over these matters as the
long journey began i felt with the con-
fidence of youth that the success of my
venture now depended solely upon me and
that i should prove equal to the task

  the warning bell rang and i moved for-
ward to the controls an indicator oper-
ated by a magnetic needle which reposed in
a hemispherical shell of lead on the nose of
the ship showed that the meteor was ap-
proaching from above and to the left and
i quickly picked it out in that direction
it had the appearance of a star which rap-
idly grew in intensity after a minute the
side of it turned to the sun had assumed the
appearance of a half moon toward which i
was rushing with frightful velocity the
bell continued to ring at intervals of a sec-
ond growing steadily louder i realized
that the meteor was an unusually large one
and stood waiting with my hand on the con-
trol although it seemed certain judging
from the direction of the particle that i
would clear it by a comfortable margin
alertness of vision and quickness of re-
sponse in such meetings may spell the dif-
ference between safety and sudden exter-
mination in this case however the met-
eor was in a plane considerably above that
in which i was traveling three minutes

after the first warning i saw it flash under-
neath as a long streak of light i could
follow its course behind the ship for some
five minutes before it became too dim to
distinguish

  that danger past i busied myself about
the ship seeing that all was functioning
properly and accustoming myself to its mo-
tion the manifestations of gravity as or-
dinarily felt on the earth were rapidly dis-
appearing as my distance from the earth
became greater there was no downward
pull and i was able to remain standing on
the floor only because of magnetized shoe
soles instead of a downward pull there
was a steady force exerted in the ship tow-
ard the stern exactly resembling gravity and
due to the fact that the ships speed was
then increasing at a steady rate under the
propelling power of the rocket motor ev-
erything in the ships interior was fixed in
place otherwise all would have collected
in a pile in the stern i was able to keep
my place by resting my hand on a rail
which ran around the interior a strap at-
tached to a belt around my waist could be
hooked onto the rail whenever i wished

  there was of course no night or day on
the space ship since the sun would hang
for many earth days in the same apparent
position it was necessary for me to sleep
however and i soon found myself tired aft-
er the exertion and excitement of the start
i accordingly decided to take a nap de-
pending on the warning bell to notify me
of the approach of any large meteoric body
i ate a capsule of food concentrate drank
a glass of water and then lay down for my
first sleep on the trip

chapter v
past the sun to venus

on the fifteenth day of my journey-for
i had of course kept a careful record
of the passage of time by earth standards-
i turned off the rocket motor leaving my
ship free from then on to describe the
course imposed by the sun it will be un-
derstood naturally that i had power avail-
able at any moment for an emergency such
as the necessity of avoiding a meteor

  the earth had long since ceased to pre-
the struggle for venus



sent more than the smallest disk to the
naked eye and was distinguishable chief-
ly as the brightest of the millions of stars
and planets which i could see it was lo-
cated to use a convenient nautical descrip-
tion off the starboard quarter of my ship
while the sun appeared off the starboard
bow at that time venus was to be seen
slightly abaft of the starboard beam for
i was now inside its orbit and actually trav-
eling away from the planet as i would be
for many days thereafter until my ship
swung around the sun and headed down
the home stretch of the long trip venus
then appeared slightly less bright than
earth 

  observations taken four days earlier
when i crossed the orbit of venus had
showed that the ship was shooting through
space at the scheduled rate on the fif-
teenth day approximately one-sixth of the
trip measured in distance and one-third
measured in time had been completed
since getting clear of earth i had grad-
ually altered my course nearer the sun at
the time i turned off the power the ship
was rushing headlong down hill toward
a point in the heavens about  degrees
from the sun

  it was with a curious feeling that i threw
the switch which stopped the action of the
rockets i was  miles from earth
and considerably further from venus with
the power off i had no more sense of mo-
tion than persons on earth realize their
motion through space on the earths jour-
ney around the sun nevertheless i knew
that my ship would continue to rush on
its predetermined orbit gathering speed
steadily until it whirled like a comet around
the far side of the sun and headed back to
venus my average speed during the re-
mainder of the trip would be double what
it had been while the rockets were in oper-
ation

  with the motor turned off i could no
longer detect anything resembling gravi-
tation inside the ship i can explain this
condition best by asking my reader to im-
agine a closed room or box which is fall-
ing from a great height in a vacuum and
to imagine that he is sitting at a table in

the room the room will be falling per-
fectly freely under the influence of gravity
and its occupants human and otherwise
will be moving under exactly the same
force then if the man holds a book at
arms length and releases it its position
within the room will not change since both
the book and the room are falling at the
same rate in other words the book will
remain suspended freely in the air of the
room the table and chair likewise may
be raised and will float in the air the
man may then sit in the chair or on the
table or float about at pleasure through
the room by pushing himself away from
the ceiling floor or walls he can walk
with equal ease on any of the six walls of
the room this illustration is exactly ana-
logous to the condition of my ship as it
fell through interminable space on its
strange journey

  the succeeding days passed monotonous-
ly except for occasional brief periods when
the alarm announced that a meteoric par-
ticle of considerable size was in the vicin-
ity but despite the monotony i felt a grow-
ing tension in my mind i stood frequently
at the controls watching the sun whose size
now appeared double that as seen from the
earth the dial on my instrument board
began to show that the outer starboard
plates were becoming heated and on the
rd day out i switched on the refrigerat-
ing system which aided in carrying the heat
from that side to the port side from which
it would radiate into space

the sun grew larger perceptibly dur-
ing the next  hours until i was final-
ly able to distinguish individual tongues of
flame licking out hundreds of thousands of
miles from its surface it finally appeared
squarely at right angles to the direction of
the ship and i knew i had reached the
most critical part of my journey when the
ship would swing around the arc of its
course nearest the sun that my cooling
system was working perfectly was demon-
strated by the fact that the outer plates on
the sun side while very warm were well
below any dangerous temperature

  for die next five days from the th


wonder stories

through the th of the trip my ship my
ship would remain at about the same dis-
tance from the sun speeding through the
long curve around it at more than  miles
a second or a million miles every three
hours in the five days it would cover -

 miles

  although this was the most critical part
of the journey and i wished to remain on
guard as much of the time as possible it
was not to be expected that i could stay
awake constantly for five days and keep
my faculties in a proper condition to meet
the emergencies that might arise it was
better to take a minimum of rest depend-
ing on automatic signals to awaken me if
any occasion arose accordingly after 
hours of the critical period had passed with-
out incident and when all appeared to be
going well i lay down for a nap i was
dangerously exhausted and slept soundly
for six hours

  when i awoke the first thing i noticed
upon looking out of the ships ports was
that the sun was no longer squarely abeam
and at right angles to my course instead
it had dropped back fully fifteen degrees
i was seriously alarmed by this observation
the significance of which will be obvious to
the reader it meant nothing less than that
my ship instead of following its plotted
course was heading away from the sun

  as quickly as possible i took obser-
vations of the apparent position of the fixed
stars this verified the fact that the ships
direction had swung away from the sun
and revealed moreover that the angle was
slowly increasing calculations made from
the figures i obtained showed that if the
tendency continued for  hours the ship
would be headed directly outward from the
sun

  the situation appeared fraught with the
greatest peril since my ship was traveling
so fast under the influence of the suns at-
traction that it was practically out of con-
trol by means of the rocket motor more-
over its action appeared totally contrary to
all known laws about the movements of as-
tronomical bodies the only explanation
i could think of was that the ship actually
jvas traveling much faster than i had cal-

culated-so much faster that the sun was
unable to hold it with the result that it
was flying off from the sun in entirely the
wrong direction in that case i knew that
the rocket motor would be able to exert
only a fraction of the power necessary to
right it

  the only reassuring observation that i
made was one which showed that my dis-
tance from the sun had grown slightly less
rather than greater the apparent size of
the sun was larger than it had been when
i went to sleep and the tongues of flame
licking cut from its surface were more dis-
tinct this was in accordance with my
mapped course which should have brought
me at that time lo about the nearest point
of the course to the sun

  a moments calm reflection gave me the
answer to the strange problem and showed
that my only real danger had been that
of becoming panicky and doing something
which i would have been unable to undo
later the ship in fact was following ex-
actly the course laid down for it despite
the fact that its nose was now pointing
further and further away from the sun
what had happened was that when the
ship began its curve around the sun there
was no force to change the direction in
which the ship pointed in the earths at-
mosphere of course the air pressure on
the stream lines would have held the nose
of the ship straight the vacuum of space
offers no such resistance and with the rock-
ets turned off there was nothing to prevent
the ship from traveling sidewise or even
tail first in fact i saw that if left alone
the ship actually would be going tail first
when it reached the end of the arc around
the sun and swept on toward venus nor
would that have mattered except for one
thing-the cooling system was arranged to
apply only to the right side of the ship
and it would be fatal to expose the plates
on the unprotected left side to the intense
rays of the sun

  i accordingly turned on the rocket pow-
er slightly and by inclining the exhaust to
the starboard side pushed the tail to the
left when the ship had assumed its cor-
rect position relative to the sun i straight-
the struggle for venus



ened the exhaust to stabilize it on the course
and then again cut off the power

before i again lay down for a nap
i had the satisfaction of seeing an ex-
ceedingly bright planet appear from be-
hind the sun it was venus which the day
before had been lost to view as i swept
around the far side of the sun from it at
last i was on the home stretch and headed
for my goal

  what i wondered had been the fortune
of the party of colonists in the meantime
had they again established wireless com-
munication with earth after a silence forced
by some circumstances of which i could
know nothing had the lost men returned
the tanks of fuel mixture been recovered
and would i find the camp firmly estab-
lished and all going well

  or had the mysterious raids on the camp
been continued would i perchance find
that the entire party had been wiped out
and that i was the only man alive on the
planet in the latter case the chances would
be heavily against my survival although i
would be forewarned of danger and on guard
from the first

  these restless speculations engrossed my
mind more and more during the days that
followed as the planet venus steadily grew
larger to the eye i could tell that my ship
sweeping through apace at a tremendous
rate lessening however as it receded from
the sun would almost exactly strike the
planet that was well because although i
could easily fly under power to the planet
from my position inside its orbit and slight-
ly ahead of it i wished to save as much
fuel mixture as possible it might prove
necessary to attempt to return to earth in
one of the larger ships at the next inferior
conjunction and in that event the extra sup-
ply of fuel mixture which i carried would
be none too much

  in the final stage of my journey the ship
was traveling about at right angles to the
motion of venus and the two bodies were
converging with a tremendous mutual vel-
ocity from an apparent size equal to that
of the moon seen from earth the disk of
venus perceptibly enlarged it became ob-

vious at length that il left to follow the
orbit into which it had settled my ship
would crash into the planet-so exact had
been the calculations of the astronomers of
the commission

  when still about one million miles off
i turned on the power and altered my
course toward a point somewhat in front
of the planet i then began reducing the
speed of the ship using the rocket power
as a brake twelve hours later my journey
was practically finished as i hovered over
the northern hemisphere about a hundred
miles from the surface of the planet but
well within its atmospheric shell

         chapter vi
         the raiders

from a great height the continent of
elysia looked like a green carpet spot-
ted with patches of white and brown be-
low me i recognized the contours of a large
peninsula which my map showed to be
about  miles east of the mouth of the
holmes river before setting out for that
point i dropped lower to view the surface
of the planet at close range

  the green carpet was a forest of trees
which i estimated to be all of  feet high
and it stretched inland as far as the eye
could reach their tops were waving in a
breeze hardly perceptible otherwise and
above them there was no sign of bird life
or life of any sort when i swooped down
close to the water however i saw a group
of large reptilian animals slither into a
marshy backwater from the bank where
they had been sunning themselves i mount-
ed to an elevation of about  feet and
headed westward toward the destination of
my long journey after  days spent alone
in the small space ship i had the strong-
est desire to set my feet on solid ground
again and to find someone of my own kind
to talk to

   after half an hour about the time i had
allowed myself to cover the  miles
 saw that i was approaching a wide in-
dentation in the coast line which i judged
to be the mouth of the holmes river two
miles upstream i should find commander
jones camp


wonder stories

  as i came nearer however i saw with
surprise what appeared to be evidence of
mans work on a bluff on the far side of
the wide bay the top of the bluff had
been cleared and levelled off and on it
had been erected a dome-like mound of
earth resembling a large eskimo igloo
there was a circular opening in the top
and other openings apparently entrances
around the circular base the fresh dirt
gave evidence that the structure whatever
it was had been finished comparatively
recently the idea which leaped to my
mind as i tried to explain this unexpected
discovery was that commander jones had
deserted his first camp for some reason and
had moved to this point two miles down
at the mouth of the river and had erected
this strange habitation why then had no
one come out to welcome me

  the most logical answer was that be-
lieving it impossible for anyone to make
the trip from earth at the time they took
me for an enemy i hovered low and per-
mitted my ship to drift over the mound so
that if any of the party were concealed
there they could recognize the ship as an
earthly one when i came directly over
the opening i could see that the mound was
hollow i could make out nothing in the
dimly lighted interior and there was still
no sign of life as i searched the strange
mound with my eyes however i saw a pen-
cil ray of intense light suddenly directed
from somewhere within it at my ship

  almost immediately i saw a wisp of
smoke from the floor of the ship near the
stern the ray was cutting through both
inner and outer plates with the ease of an
acetylene torch flame eating through a thin
sheet of lead

  i sprang to the throttle and advanced it
with a tremendous roar the ship leaped
forward so that i was almost thrown to
the floor in barely a second i was out of
sight of the mound over the trees which
surrounded the cleared bluff on the land
side there i again stopped the ship let-
ting it drift while i examined the damage
the ray had cut a semicircular arc through
the inner and outer plates of the ship and
had punctured the overhead plates as well

it had come perilously close to the reserve
tanks of fuel mixture which would have
exploded and annihilated the ship if they
had been exposed to it as it was the ship
had been rendered useless for interplanet-
ary travel although it could still be used
in the atmosphere of venus

  i had travelled some ten miles from the
bluff when the ship again came to rest
after i had finished my inspection of the
ship i looked about me and was surprised
to notice a wide river about a mile ahead
i recalled then that i had not seen the riv-
er before an examination of the map con-
vinced me that in fact the bluff where the
strange mound was situated was actually
on the arm of a small bay and that the
holmes river lay in front of me i ac-
cordingly proceeded slowly to the river
and turned downstream over it since i knew
i was more than two miles inland a few
minutes later i sighted a collection of huts
on the right bank and a short distance
away were the two large space ships used
by the jones expedition it was unques-
tionably the camp established by the party
it was overgrown with creepers however
and gave every sign of being completely
deserted i settled down over it and saw
that my judgment was correct there was
no sign of life in the camp carefully i
brought my ship to rest near the two large
space ships and stepped out to the ground

i was convinced that i had accidentally
stumbled on the home of the creatures
whose mysterious attacks had disrupted the
expedition furthermore i had had a ter-
rible demonstration of the power they were
able to wield i resolved that forwarned
as i was i should not share the fate of
commander jones and his aides whatever
it might have been undoubtedly the creat-
ures would look for me at the site of the
camp as i had not seen them i could
form no idea of how formidable they would
be i decided to inspect the camp hurriedly
and then conceal my ship nearby and re-
turn to watch developments

  in the limited time which i allowed my-
self i hoped to discover some record which
would indicate the fate of the colonists
the struggle for venus



and also if the wireless set were in order
to send a message to earth telling of my
arrival i turned first to the semi-circular
row of huts and searched them rapidly the
huts and their contents had suffered con-
siderable damage from rain since being de-
serted they still contained most of the
personal effects of the colonists indicating
that the desertion of the camp had been ac-
complished in great haste in the fourth
hut which i entered i found evidence that
it had been occupied by commander jones
there was a box containing some of the
instruments taken from the space ships on
a shelf i found what i most wanted-the
log of the trip i opened it quickly and
found to my intense disappointment that
the last entry had been made on the day
when the final message from the party was
received by me in washington there was
nothing to tell how or why the camp had
been deserted which confirmed my suspi-
cion that the colonists had been overcome
by a sudden attack directed from the mound
on the coast

  i tucked the slightly mouldy book under
my arm to study it later at leisure and
completed a hasty examination of the camp
i was unable to understand the complete
lack of evidence of an extensive struggle
the fact that there were no human remains
anywhere in the camp permitted me to be-
lieve with some cause that the colonists
were still alive but whether they were
prisoners or had been driven to some other
part of the continent remained to be seen

  my search was next directed to the two
large space ships the thin waterproof
cover of one of them had been torn and
the ships plates were rusting i entered
the other one and found from a cursory
examination that it appeared to be in first
class condition the apparatus for com-
pressing and liquefying air was in seem-
ingly good repair but the tanks of fuel
mixture without which liquid air was use-
less for motive purposes were missing

  the wireless apparatus had been set up
in this ship and a rapid examination con-
vinced me that it had not been damaged
as i was looking over it more carefully i
heard a chattering sound which seemed to

come from the direction of the huts i
slipped over to one of the ports on that side
what i saw took away my breath and made
my heart beats ccase suddenly

  a large balloon-like object shaped like
a dirigible had settled quietly to the
ground on the other side of my space ship
and from its interior were alighting several
creatures whom i felt sure were from the
mound colony in general appearance they
bore a remarkable resemblance to human be-
ings although they were unlike any men i
had ever seen they were slightly smaller
than the average man and had large heads
big round eyes which protrudede and point-
ed noses and chins they moved rapidly and
alertly they wore tunics which fell freely
from their shoulders to their knees

  as i watched breathlessly between twen-
ty and twenty-five of these beings presum-
ably natives of venus who had escaped dis-
covery on the first exploration of the plan-
et alighted from the object which i could
only suppose to be some sort of flying
machine two of them immediately walked
to my space ship and after examining it
from the outside entered through the open
passage the others scattered to search the
camp

  i realized that despite my resolutions i
had allowed myself to be outwitted by the
enemy in the first encounter the creatures
had surprised me in overwhelming numbers
and in addition as i knew were probably
better armed than i was knowing that they
would soon search the large ships for me
i decided that the best thing to do under
the circumstances was to attempt to hide
in the underbrush until they had left the
camp the space ship was on the edge of
the camp and i was able to keep it between
me and the creatures until i reached the
protection of the trees and undergrowth i
worked my way silently further into the
forest and then climbed into the lower
branches of a tree and mounted to where i
was able to obtain a fairly unobstructed
view of the camp

a meeting

the venusians as i judged them to be
did not seem particularly perturbed


wonder stories

over my escape as i watched them through
the branches of the trees they concluded a
search of the camp and collected around
the balloon or whatever it was in which
they had arrived there was a conference
and then several of them went to my ship
and entered it they emerged within a few
minutes each carrying two of the tanks of
fuel mixture they made several more trips
until all the tanks had been removed to
their ship i could see that they were pre-
paring to leave undoubtedly thinking that
i had been rendered helpless by the loss of
the fuel i watched with the utmost interest
as they entered their conveyance a clever-
ly constructed door closed downward ap-
parently sealing the ship airtight then
without a sound and with no means of pro-
pulsion which i could observe the object
rose in the air and headed purposefully in
the direction of the mound

  i descended the tree and made my way
back toward the camp at the fringe of the
underbrush as i was about to step into the
cleared space i heard a rustling sound
nearby to the right i dropped to the
ground although the noise had come from
so near i was almost sure i had been ob-
served my fears turned to amazed joy when
i looked up and saw a man step from be-
hind a tree a few yards away it was cap-
tain matthew eddy

   starrett he cried but how on earth


   captain eddys joy and surprise at this
unexpected meeting equalled mine he was
at first unable to believe my story of the
trip around the sun but my presence and
that of the small ship forced him to accept
it he then told me briefly the history of
the expedition in the following words

  you already know of the disappearance
of smith and fall and later of six other
members of the party and of the theft of
our fuel mixture we were totally at a loss
to explain these mysteries especially as we
had every reason to believe that there were
on venus no other intelligent beings than
ourselves

   on the night following the first inva-
sion of the camp i was awakened by a cry
from the adjoining hut as i started up i

saw two man-like creatures framed in th
doorway they immediately pounced upon
me and before i was really awake they had
overpowered and bound me i was left
alone in the hut for about five minutes and
in that time i managed to slip the knot in
the wiry cord which held my arms and free
myself i realized from the sounds i heard
that the camp had been invaded in force
and that all the men probably had been
made prisoners as i had knowing that the
fate of the entire party might depend upon
me i crept cautiously to the door and
looked out there were about a hundred
of the strange men in sight many of them
gathered around what resembled a dirigible
which rested in the camp others were car-
rying the bound forms of my comrades and
placing them in the object-which i have
reason to believe is nothing less than a space
ship

  it was obvious tlat if i showed myself
i would immediately be overpowered and
captured the lives of my comrades ap-
peared to be in no immediate danger and i
decided that my best chance of rescuing
them lay in maintaining my own freedom
and watching developments accordingly i
made a hole in the rear of the hut and
unobserved slipped out of the camp i was
the only one who escaped the raid the
others were all placed securely bound in
the raiders ship ten minutes later i saw
the ship rise silently until it was outlined
against the stars high overhead it then
headed swiftly in a northeasterly direction

  captain eddy told me briefly how he had
set out immediately in the direction taken
by the raiding party and after a weeks
search had found the mound colony he
had stayed in the neighborhood of the
mound ever since except for an occasional
trip through the ten miles of jungle back
to the camp for supplies he had observed
the actions of the mound men from trees
on the fringe of the cleared bluff but had
seen no trace of the prisoners his obser-
vations had convinced him for one thing
that the dirigible used by the mound men
was really a space ship of some strange
kind

  i have come to the conclusion he said
fhe struggle for venus



that the mound creatures are not natives
of this planet any more than we are they
are totally unlike any other form of life
to be found on venus and it is almost in-
conceivable that they have developed here
so tremendously in advance of everything
else on the planet it would be no more
incongruous to imagine modern men living
in the same world with the prehistoric ani-
mals which roamed over earth when it
was comparatively young

  moreover the fact that there is only a
single colony and that the party has a space
ship is almost conclusive evidence that they
are visitors from another planet it is my
opinion that the party came here from mars
where we have reason to believe there is
life similar to that on earth

  the force of what my companion said
was apparent and i was inclined to share
his view if it were the truth we were un-
doubtedly faced by the strangest situation
any man had encountered nevertheless
that view of the situation held more hope
than any other i could imagine if the
mound creatures were indeed martians then
their number was limited if captain eddy
and i could outwit them-find some means
of freeing our comrades-the struggle for
control of the planet should not be too
unequal although i was sure the mound
creatures-whether martians or natives of
venus-would prove worthy opponents
my companion told me that there were
about  of them living in an excavation
in the bluff to which the openings in the
mound were entrances about half of them
went daily in the space ship to some point
west of the holmes river he said as he
had no way of crossing the river he had
been unable to discover the objects of these
trips

  captain eddy told me that h had made
an attempt to operate the wireless set but
that his knowledge of radio was not suffi-
cient to enable him to succeed together we
slipped into the space ship and i began
working on the set

  i found that the batteries had lost some
of their strength but nevertheless  made
the necessary adjustments and began flash-
ing the earth call at five minute intervals

several hours later when i was about to
give up in despair i caught an answer i
then transmitted a brief but thorough ac-
count of the supposed fate of the party of
colonists with the assurance that captain
eddy and i would do all possible to rescue
them if they proved to be prisoners of the
mound men

chapter vii
trapped

at captain eddys suggestion we spent
the night in a tree near the camp
sleeping on a platform of boards taken
from one of the huts at dawn we ate
breakkfast in the camp and then set out
for the coast working our way through the
light underbrush although the going was
not difficult it was necessarily slow and the
sun indicated it was noon when we finally
approached the bluff on which the mound
was located we were aided by the fact
that the force of gravity on venus is almost
a fifth less than on earth so that while we
retained our strength on venus we lost
about one fifth of our weight consequent-
ly we were able to walk much more lightly
and to leap over obstacles which on earth
we would have had to climb painfully
moreover the weight of other objects was
similarly reduced so that  pounds could
be lifted with the same effort that would be
required to raise  pounds on earth

  we lunched on the sap of a milk tree in
which my companion had set a spigot the
fluid tasted considerably like milk and cap-
tain eddy told me that dr alexander the
chemist of the expedition had found it par-
ticularly nourishing the trees were plen-
tiful along the coast growing to a height
of about  feet under the shelter of the
tall trees

  we then approached cautiously nearer
the bluff and climbed into a tree which my
companion had found well suited for ob-
servation the space ship was not in sight
having gone as usual somewhere to the
westward nor were any of the mound men
visible at the time five minutes later how-
ever we saw ten of the creatures emerge
from one of the openings at the base of
the mound they descended the bluff and


wonder stories

disappeared in the forest to the left

  i suggested imprudently enough that
captain eddy remain where he was while
i made an attempt to cross the bluff and
enter the mound in the hope of reaching
the prisoners and freeing them captain
eddy emphatically vetoed the plan telling
me that the top of the bluff was constantly
watched he then outlined his own plan of
action which required that we remain
where we were until after dark when one
of us could try to penetrate the home of the
mound creatures captain eddy had often
wished during the two months he had
watched the mound that he were free to
make a similar attempt the odds against
success were so great however and his re-
sponsibility as the only free colonist was
so great that he had not risked it now that
there were two of us he agreed with me
that the effort must be made at my in-
sistence he agreed that i make the attempt
while he remained in the forest

  as we were discussing this plan in whis-
pers i realized suddenly that the tree in
which we were concealed was swinging
slowly out of it vertical position startled
i looked down and saw far below me at
the base of the tree a pencil ray of light
eating through the trunk the swing toward
the ground continued with increasing mo-
mentum and in a second the tall tree was
crashing through the branches of its neigh-
bors while captain eddy and i were
scratched and buffetted and finally torn
loose from the branches to which we were
clinging the resistance of the other trees
slowed our fall somewhat but i was thrown
clear of the tree when it finally crashed
through and struck the ground with suf-
ficient force to stun me momentarily

  before i could move two of the strange
men from the mound pounced on me like
cats and pinioned my arras i struggled as
well as my returning strength permitted and
for a half-second flung them free the next
instant they were back and several others
dashed in to aid them after a fierce but
brief struggle one of them slipped a noose
over me and drew it tight about my arms
i was rendered helpless and though i con-
tinued to kick and writhe as long as pos-

sible they quickly completed the work of
trussing me securely when i finally re-
laxed realizing the futility of further strug-
gling i was laid on the ground a minute
later the bound form of captain eddy was
placed beside me i saw that he was un-
conscious and that his forehead was bleed-
ing but i could not tell how badly he was
hurt

  our captors who were the same ten we
had seen leave the mound chattered briefly
among themselves and then captain eddy
and i were picked up and carried up the
bluff and into the mound after carrying
us through a short passage from the en-
trance our captors descended a long flight
of steps cut in the dirt the lower level
was lighted with a soft pleasant glow the
source of which i could not determine a
large central arena was revealed with cells
around the walls and with six passageways
running off at intervals of sixty degrees
we were transported down one of these
passages for about fifty feet-half of its
length-and the party halted in front of a
door one of the mound men turned several
levers and then swung the door open re-
vealing a vestibule about ten feet wide and
fifteen feet long with a closed door at the
far end

we were laid on the ground in the cen-
ter of the vestibule and the mound
men departed closing the door through
which they had carried us some thirty
seconds elapsed and then there was a sharp
click immediately the inner door opened
and commander jones and several others
of the missing colonists appeared they
did not seem particularly surprised to see
the form of captain eddy but their amaze-
ment when i was recognized can be better
imagined than described our mutual ex-
clamations were interrupted after a moment
by a low musical note from the inner room
apparently it was a warning

  quick commander jones ordered in
a sharp voice drag them in

  friendly hands grabbed me and dragged
me still bound through the open door
others carried the still unconscious cap-
tain eddy into the large room which was
the struggle for venus



revealed and the door then snapped shut

  commander jones turned his attention to
captain eddy while others quickly un-
bound me my companion had suffered a
bad cut on the back of his head he revived
as his head was being bathed with water
taken from a small channel which led
through the underground chamber and it
was found that his wound while painful
was not serious

  commander jones then listened with the
utmost interest to a recital of my trip from
earth-

  we heard something of your arrival
from our jailors he said surprisingly
but it seemed so incredible that we decid-
ed there was some mistake as for poor
eddy we have had regular reports of his
activities while he thought he was unob-
served he has been under constant surveil-
lance and could have been captured at any
time during the two months we have been
held here

  do you mean that you can communi-
cate with your jailors i asked and for
that matter who and what are they

  i can tell you everything that we know
about them very quickly commander
jones said

  soon after we were made prisoners i
was taken into an office in another part of
this ant hill there was a recognizable
map of the heavens on a table one of our
captors who acted as spokesman indicated
earth on the map and pointed to me i
nodded my head foolishly thinking that he
would understand that affirmative sign
when he failed to do so i touched my chest
with my finger and then placed the finger
on the dot indicating earth this he under-
stood and in a like manner he told me that
he and his companions came from mars

  he then touched himself and indicated
his companions placing his finger on mars
he traced a path to venus then he nodded
his head vigorously i wras forced to laugh
as you would laugh at a monkey by the
celerity with which he had adopted my sign
of affirmation once he understood it i re-
alized however that he was no monkey but
a being of quick intelligence but his
message was not completed he next indi-

cated earth on the map and traced a path
to venus and then made a sign of break-
ing something in his hands the meaning
was plain enough he was telling me that
venus should belong to the men of mars
and not to the men of earth my reply was
to show my defiance in the same manner
he had adopted

 since that day i have had many con-
ferences with the same individual and we
have developed a means of communicating
ideas with a minimum of effort i have
picked up some of their vocal sounds and
he has learned a remarkable amount of
something approximating english al-
though there is a certain amount of friend-
liness between us because of this ability to
understand one another his enmity as a
martian against all earth men and his de-
termination to keep venus for his own race
is unaffected

  the present expedition of martians
numbers about  and they have been on
venus for more than two years during
that time they have not been able to com-
municate with mars i was surprised that
they had not developed wireless until i
learned that they have the ability of trans-
mitting thought very efficiently this of
course made wireless unnecessary pn their
home planet but it cannot be used for
more than a few thousand miles

  as a result of this the party must return
to mars to report the success of their trip
and their discoveries here they are plan-
ning to leave within a few weeks when the
position of mars will be favorable then
at the next favorable conjunction they plan
to return with other ships and several thou-
sand of their fellows they expect that
ten years from now the entire population
of mars will have been transferred to venus
since mars is rapidly becoming incapable
of supporting life the population of that
planet now is only about a million as
nearly as i can make out

  one thing they have given me to under-
stand very definitely before they leave
venus they plan to kill all of our party
not out of any feeling of enmity but sole-
ly to eliminate the possibility that we will
return to earth for reinforcements and will

contest with them the possession of venus
the idea has never occurred to them that
the men on earth already know of the suc-
cess of our trip and the nature of condi-
tions on venus

ttut cant we do anything i pro-

   tested

  we have not been inactive commander
jones replied and we have high hopes of
escaping and outwitting them i must ex-
plain to you first the nature of our prison

  the walls are charged with an electric
current at high tension and it is only neces-
sary to press on them to receive a very
severe shock since the connections are be-
hind the walls we are unable to get at them
and it would do no good if we could be-
cause they would know it immediately if the
current were interrupted they have a spe-
cial connection by which they can permit
us to go into the vestibule to get food they
have left there but if we linger the current
is switched on our water we get from
the stream running through the end of the
room it drops to a lower level near the
wall you see and serves there to dispose of
waste it is the system of plumbing which
they have provided for the entire colony

  he led me over to the wall beyond the
small stream and raised a box which rested
there under it was a hole about three feet
across leading down into the ground

  soon after we were imprisoned here we
began working on a tunnel under the walls
disposing of the dirt in small quantities by
letting the stream carry it out to the ocean
it is now completed to within a foot of the
surface near the base of the bluff on the
land side and we are only waiting the pro-
pitious moment to put out escape to the
test

  commander jones next led me to the dou-
ble row of bunks in the center of the room
under the foot of one of the bunks he
pointed out two containers which i recog-
nized as cans of fuel mixture

  i found out where these were kept he
explained when my martian captor ques-
tioned me about them these two are all i
have been able to slip in here unobserved
on my various trips into the other parts of

the ant hill they will serve our purpose
i think

  while others of our fellow prisoners
gathered around us commander jones ex-
plained to me the plan that had been work-
ed out the tunnel could be forced through
at the base of the bluff at any time by a few
minutes work our leader thought it best
to wait for a few days until the exact plans
of the martians were revealed and make the
break for liberty at the last moment con-
sistent with safety two of the men would
slip out under cover of darkness carrying
the two tanks of fuel mixture with them
and make their way to the abandoned camp
where the two large space ships and my
small one were deserted

  a highly explosive bomb could be made
by injecting a small amount of the fuel
mixture into one of the heavy tanks of
liquid air using the rest of the fuel mix-
ture to operate one of the ships the pair
would return over the mound and drop the
bomb on it the attack on the mound would
be timed exactly and before it was made
the remaining prisoners would slip out
through the tunnel and escape to a safe dis-
tance from the bluff

  there was a large group of the colonists
who chafed at the proposed delay in action
it was their argument that the martians
might at any time decide to carry out their
announced plan of doing away with all of
us it was argued that their capture of
captain eddy and me putting all of the
earth men on venus in their power indi-
cated that the crisis was near at any
moment they might introduce into the un-
derground chamber a poisonous gas which
would give us no chance of resistance or
of using the tunnel

  this faction proved the more weighty
and when commander jones acceded to the
wishes of the majority it was decided that
the attempt should be made that night
commander jones refused to leave what he
considered the position of greatest danger
nor did captain eddys condition permit
him to indulge in anything so strenuous as
a ten-mile trip through the forest com-
mander jones accordingly appointed arthur
rhodes one of the most resourceful mem-
the struggle for venus



bers of the party as one of the pair to make
the attempt to bomb the mound i was
picked as his companion because of my
familiarity with the operation of both the
small and the large space ships

  about an hour before dawn the follow-
ing morning rhodes slipped headfirst into
the hole in the floor and wriggled out of
sight  followed although the dark hole
was anything but inviting i made my way
through the tunnel more slowly than my
companion pushing the two containers of
fuel mixture before me when i finally
touched his foot with my outstretched hand
he whispered to me to lie quietly for a mo-
men he had already removed some of the
dirt at the end of the passage after a
moment when no sound reached us he re-
sumed work passing back handfuls of dirt
to me which  distributed on the floor
after a few moments i felt him slip forward
and then felt a breath of cool air i silent-
ly wriggled forward and slid out of the
end of the tunnel we placed a piece of
brush over the opening and then slipped in-
to the forest carrying our burden apparent-
ly unobserved

  we proceeded slowly until sunrise after
which we were able to make better time
considerably before noon we came to the
river bank and soon located the camp we
had decided to use one of the large ships
since they were equipped with chambers in
the floor through which the bomb could be
dropped we accordingly set to work at
once dismantling the aerial posts from the
ship which was in the better condition of
the two that completed we entered the
ship and continued our preparations ar-
ranging the powerful bomb and fixing a
fuse to it

  all was in readiness long before night
but we were forced to wait until the prear-
ranged hour to give our companions an op-
portunity to escape from their prison

chapter viii
the battle in space

an hour after sunset we closed the door
of the big ship i loosed the rocket
power and the ship rose swiftly to a height
of several hundred feet where i steadied it

as it would take no more than a few minutes
to arrive over the mound colony arthur
rhodes was already stationed at the center
of the ship where the improvised bomb
lay in the chamber in readiness to be drop-
ped his voice came to me over the tele-
phone

  ok letergo

  i turned in the direction of the mound and
picked up a speed of about  miles an
hour  did not wish to go too fast as it
would be necessary to slow down over the
bluff on the sea coast so that my companion
could drop the bomb accurately he would
have enough difficulty in any event in aim-
ing the missile through the glass port in the
floor even so we were in sight of the
mound in four minutes

  as i reduced the speed of the ship i saw
a dark object rise swiftly over the mound
there was no sound but in the dusk i
could make out the outlines of the martian
space dirigible which was shooting upward
with increasing speed

  it seemed obvious that the martians had
discovered the escape of their prisoners
and had acted so quickly as to entirely up-
set our plan how many of the party were
in the big ship i could only guess but it
seemed best to carry out the plan of de-
stroying the mound where i presumed the
majority of them remained i accordingly
held the ship on its course when almost
directly over the bluff i saw a figure run
out on it with a blazing torch by the in-
distinct light i realized that it was one of
our own party lest rhodes should fail
to recognize him and drop the bomb i
swerved seaward quickly to prevent the ship
from passing over the bluff

  as i did so i suddenly understood the
significance of the signal some member of
our party had risked his life to give for
some reason at which i could only guess
the martians had entirely deserted the
mound all of them then must be in the
space ship could it be that they were de-
parting for the long homeward journey
had they discovered the escape of all their
prisoners and started to search for us at ie
deserted camp only to change their plans


wonder stories

when our ship came in sight as they took
off

 these conjectures lashed through my
mind instantaneously i automatically
turned the ship upward and advanced it to
high speed in pursuit of the martian ship
as i did so the voice of rhodes came to
me from the center of the ship he had
not seen the martian ship and was unable
to understand what had occurred receiv-
ing only disjointed exclamations in answer
since all my attention was devoted to the
pursuit he came forward to where i stood
in the bow of the ship by that time i had
collected my ideas and was able to tell him
in a few words what apparently had oc-
curred the martian ship had disappeared
from our sight but from its course while
it was visible i judged that it was still
mounting upward from the surface of the
planet

  rhodes agreed with me that we should
attempt to overtake the martian ship and
disable it if possible rather than permit
its occupants to reach mars and return with
reinforcements we had seen that the mar-
tians were intelligent and resourceful able
to use weapons which gave them a decided
advantage over us and absolutely ruthless
in their determination to hold venus for
their race and to wipe out all competitors
they had openly declared themselves our
enemies and we were forced to regard them
as such

  although the sun had set an hour earlier
on the surface our swift flight upward
brought into view first a reddish glow in
the west and then the rim of the sun itself
appeared strain our eyes as we might we
were unable to see the martian ship

  i pushed the space ship to the limit in-
creasing its speed steadily as the atmosphere
became less dense we shot swiftly through
the upper layers of atmosphere and soon
emerged into the blackness of interplanetary
space

  there it is rhodes cried

  i looked in the direction he indicated and
saw a thin crescent of light overhead and to
the left it was undoubtedly the martian
space ship shining moon-like by the light
of the sun against the completely black

background of limitless space it was im-
possible not to see it could we overtaka
it

i could hardly doubt that we had been
observed by the martians as soon as we
emerged from the atmosphere of venus but
i decide upon a ruse if i could place our
ship directly between the martian and the
sun we would be invisible to them while
their ship could be seen in its largest and
brightest form i accordingly cut to the left
and in five minutes accomplished my pur-
pose although we had lost valuable dis-
tance in the race to overtake the martians
we now had a distinct advantage in being
visible lo them if at all only as a small
speck on the disk of the sun while their
ship shone like a large moon before us the
question now was one of speed

  we had about a days supply of fuel
mixture however since our ship was not
designed for space combat our only way
of disabling the enemy ship was to drop the
improvised bomb on it i realized of
course that this could not be done except
under some gravitational force if attempt-
ed outside of a fairly strong gravitational
field the bomb would not drop but would
continue to travel with our ship until it ex-
ploded and destroyed us the only chance
of success a slim one at best was to make
the attack while still within the gravita-
tional field of venus i accordingly pushed
the ship to the utmost and had the satisfac-
tion of seeing the martian ship grow larger
in appearance showing that we were over-
taking it

  while the description of these events has
taken considerable time the reader must
understand that their actual occurrence cov-
ered only a brief span we were already
however some  miles from the sur-
face of venus and it was apparent that we
would be  miles up before we could
overtake the fleeing ship i made a rapid
calculation in my head the attraction of
gravity at the surface of venus is about 
feet a second at  miles the acceler-
ation would be less than two feet a second
however that would suffice if my plan
worked out otherwise
the struggle for venus



  rhodes fell in with the idea completely
when i sketched it in a few words

  ill put a ten-second fuse in the bomb
and let you know the moment i release it
he said

  left alone in the control chamber in the
bow as my companion hurried back amid-
ship i watched the martian ship grow
steadily brighter i wondered if the enemy
ship like ours was entirely unfitted for
fighting if they were able to direct that
powerful ray of light from the ship we were
doomed for once the double shell of our
ship was punctured we could not survive in
the vacuum of space that was a chance we
were forced to take

  it was only a few minutes before our ship
was quite close to the martian the super-
ior speed at my command enabled me to
manoeuvre the enemy into position between
our ship and the planet below i then let
the space ship sink gradually until it was
speeding along a course directly parallel to
that of the martian exactly above it relative
to venus and separated by no more than
fifteen or twenty feet

  all set came the steady voice of
arthur rhodes

  all set i replied

  in my minds eye i could see him light the
fuse close the inner door of the chamber and
open the outer one

  its off came his shout over the tele-
phone

  i held the ship steady for two nerve-
wracking seconds to give the bomb time to
clear it and then again turned the rockets
on full force and directed the ship sharply
upward

  with the nose of the ship pointed away
from the martian ship i was unable to see

what happened next but when i turned some
ten seconds later at a distance of more than
a hundred miles from the point where the
other ship should be it could not be dis-
tinguished instead i could make out sev-
eral large luminous particles and i knew
that innumerable smaller particles of what
had been the martian ship had been lung
off in every direction

  arthur rhodes who joined me in the con-
trol room had actually witnessed the break-
up of the martian ship no noise of the ex-
plosion had reached us of course since
sound is not carried through a vacuum

  the large pieces of the ill-fated ship had
been flung down toward venus in different
directions soon after our ship reentered
the atmosphere of the planet we saw one of
these particles flash through the atmosphere
as a flaming meteor or shooting star

  it is necessary only to add that rhodes
and i joined the other colonists and that the
interrupted work begun on the radium field
was resumed a few days later we discov-
ered what had taken the martians daily to
the westward of the holmes river several
miles west on another seacoast bluff they
had built another colony such as the one
which commander jones called an ant
hill doubtless this had been intended as
a home for others who were to be led back
to venus by the exploring party how-
ever the martians apparently deserted the
plan of colonizing venus when the party
of explorers failed to return and none of
them have since appeared on venus the
earth colony there has of course grown to
important proportions and the inspired
dreams of dr sanders head of the com-
mission for venus bids fair to be not only
fulfilled but surpassed

a familiar shadow was cast upon the
frosted glass of the door-panel a
sturdy fist hammered out a well remembered
rap-a-taptap

  come right in doctor i cried as i
pressed the button which released the elec-
trically controlled door-catch this is cer-
tainly a surprise

  doctor destanne swung the door open
and entered it was good to see the little
biologist once more sibyl my fiancee had
been acting as his assistant for several
months during this time they had been
cruising in the west indies hoping to com-
plete their extensive research into certain
obscure plant forms of that region des-

tanne had now returned weeks in advance
of their schedule which meant that sibyl
must be in the offing

  but doctor destanne was unaccompanied
although he turned and closed the door be-
hind him so swiftly that his action suggested
pursuit yet it was not the manner of his
entry that startled me it was his attire that
made me stare

  he was wearing a light-weight grey over-
coat buttoned well up around his throat
a tweed cap and a heavy pair of monstrous
goggles that were so large they resembled
an owlish mask a truly amazing outfit for
a midsummer day in new york city

his goggles from a face that was streaming
with perspiration and sank with a gasp into
the large leather upholstered office chair
 keep in readiness for clients i saw that
he was on the verge of collapsing

  whew he said at last and i saw that
his face usually so placid with a profes-
sional calm was haggard from sheer ex-
haustion thought i d never make it

  i filled a tumbler with ice-water from
the cooler doctor destanne took the brim-
ming glass from my hand and swallowed the
contents at a gulp whew he said
again

   never in all my long friendship with the
staid little man had  seen him any tiling
like this usually he made me think of a
prosaic busy little brown sparrow

   true there was the time when he returned
from crossing and recrossing that deadly val-

ley of gigantic arum lilies west of zanzibar
that must have taken nerve only after his
reports were completed had the public

to their deaths stifled by the lethal frag-

 its this accursed thing thats such an
 abomination he was saying when i re-
 turned with more ice water

he had unbuttoned his overcoat and now
i saw what had been concealed beneath

   surrounding his throat was a massive
metal collar which completely covered his
neck connected to the lower edge of this

   i drew an open box of havanas from the

 saw that he was still

 nothing i can say will

 in time to avert a disaster our country-
 even sibyls existence-is hanging by a

   he stopped suddenly and i seized him by
 both shoulders sibyl i breathed

   as if we needed concrete evidence
 destanne said pointing to the window
 where evening shadows were fast gathering

   i would have stepped forward but he in-
 tercepted me back he shouted as you
 value your life leave that window securely
 fastened

   then i saw what appeared to be a length
                     of dangling cable
                     coarse stuff that was
                     swinging freely a few
                     feet beyond the para-
                     pet perhaps as heavy
                     as a mans finger med-

                       but even as i spoke
                     the cable twisted with
                     an uncanny waving
                     motion another length
                     descended and hung a
                     foot or so from the
                     first then another
                     and another until
                     there were fully a
                     dozen of them dangling
                     and swinging but ever
                     gliding downward

                      curiosity prompted
                    me to crouch and
                    watch the upper edge
                    of the window i
                    caught a glimpse of
                    some vague grayish
                    bulk that was hanging
                    there then the mass
                    sailed swiftly down to
                    stop abruptly hover-

                    destanne coughed
 slightly one of the
 scouts he said with
 the manner of a cur-
 ator explaining an interesting specimen
 he doesnt want to lose track of me from
 now on roger id advise you to be pre-
 pared for anything

   like one hypnotised i crouched staring

tt e are accustomed to
thinking of sentient be-
ings in terms of human or
other animal life we can-
not conceive for example
of a plant having a brain 
yet the functions that
many plants perform are
in reality no less compli-
cated than our own actions
and if the ability to adapt
oneself to circumstances is
intelligence we must admit
this quality in many plants
sir jagadis bose one of
the noted paleontologists of
the world comes to this
conclusion in his remark-
able book u plant auto-
graphs and their revela-
tions

  it is not far-fetched
then to give to plants a
will to have control over
the earth and displace men
what prohibits them from
any such action is that
they are fixed in place for
their entire lives but sup-
pose there arose a plant
that was not fixed but
could feed wherever it
wished then endowed
with mobility such a sen-
tient plant would indeed
be a menace to our race as

at the creature that faced me beyond that ex-
panse of thin window-glass

  nine eyes in a horizontal row black
orbed blinking strangely human eye with
human intelligence and human curiosity
shining in the sparkling depths the row
so compact was it did not exceed two feet
from end to end

   it was moving the eye at the left-hand
end of the row closed and sank away the
row moved along from right to left a tenth
eye became apparent at its right-hand end
another eye blinked and drifted away
again the row moved along again and
again

   i felt i was being inspected by a concen-
trated nightmarish crowd of people it was
a moment before the
shock of the thing wore
off but soon i was able
to reason sufficiently to
understand that the eyes
were placed at regular
intervals around what ap-
peared to be the neck of
a balloon-shaped affair

and that this balloon-like
creature was slowly re-
volving horizontally so
that each of its many eyes
was being presented in
slow succession

  for awhile i suffered
the inquisition of the bale-
ful creatures penetrating
stare then so suddenly
that it gave the impression of an optical il-
lusion the thing was gone and the shadows
lay long and soft over the adjacent roofs
and the flickering fireflies that were the
traffic glittered in the deeper canyons be-
neath us

flippancy up lo the five thousand foot
level like a shot and practically out of sight
from the ground now you will understand
why im wearing this accursed collar roger
they wouldnt dare attack us in a crowd
not at this stage of the game at least but
when they do get a chance those tentacles of
theirs are almost as tough as steel-elastic
as rubber bands sensitive as fingers di-

rected by a fiendish intelligence they choke
their victims gouge out his eyes-

  and sibyl-is being held by these-
these infernal creatures i gasped my
voice sounded hollow and i wondered vague-
ly if i could be talking in a dream

be in time when we reach the airdrome to

a waiting taxicab

  once inside the cab
doctor destanne gave the
chauffeur terse instruc-
tions to take us to the
seaboard central then
he closed the window and
removed his goggles

  be surprised how
quickly those things can
get you he commented
pointing upwards

were going empty
handed i reminded him

  no i ordered quite
a lot of stuff in miami on
my way north a radio
from the flying field will have it meet us
when we pass there lot of things includ-
ing a collar and chain-mesh for you and
goggles and one of these-

  from just above his belt he seized the
scarcely concealed hilt of a machete jerked
the weapon out and stroked its razor-keen
edge as lovingly as a roman gladiator might
have toyed with a short sword i was glad
when he slammed the frightful blade back
into its scabbard for the chauffeur had
been watching us suspiciously

  we reached the flying field without inter-
ference and more than half an hour before
the time set for the great amphibian air-
liners departure here i found the doctors

arrival had been expected and arrangements
had already been made for our passage a
sheaf of telegrams settled my affairs and i
was ready to join destanne in one corner
of the luxurious smoking compartment of
the waiting ship

  sibyl he said apparently reading my
thoughts is in the gravest danger in deadly
peril in fact but not in altogether immi-
nent danger that is i suspect we shall be
in ample time if nothing unforeseen occurs

  you will appreciate the situation better
if i begin somewhere near the beginning and
give you an outline of what i know of the
air-plant men

  brisson a new orleans police detective
who is also a brilliant southern botanist
sent me in a joking way a specimen of a
tiny and quite rare plant-er not unlike a
hyacinth he wrote me that his confreres
had given this plant the name of death
lily for a rather curious reason

  brisson it seems had been at work as-
sembling the data on all the recent mur-
ders in the south especially florida and
louisiana they had a string of eight
apparently unreasonable disconnected un-
interesting homicides-unsolved affairs of
violence they were alike seemingly in
only one respect fiendish brutality crush-
ed skulls broken necks gouged out eyes
in one case the victim had been practically
torn asunder

  all of them were country people ob-
scure tenant-farmers or farm laborers of the
very poorest class and utterly without
money or enemies the cases were so far
apart however and the time interval be-
tween so short that not even a fiend killer
seemed to fill the bill

  brissons love of botany often led him
far afield in his investigation he found
a bed of the tiny hyacinth a specimen of
which he sent me growing somewhere in
the vicinity of each murder death lily
they named it

destanne paused and gazed thought-
fully at the airdrome beacon a rest-
less finger of light which stroked the night

sky that lay beyond the smoking-rooms
heavy curved-glass windows

  death lily he said again brissons
associates had named it well a modest
pale-blue bloom with a peculiarly pleasant
sweetish aroma-harmless fragile non-
poisonous shrinking as a violet yet more
deadly in its significance than the vilest
leper

  we traced it sibyl and i to what seem-
ed its source-this death lily-for it was
a newcomer to the south the beds brisson
found were undoubtedly far-flung colonies
of a plant apparently having its origin on
a group of uncultivated tropical islands ly-
ing in the caribbean south-east of cuba
shadow island the map called the largest
one the lines we plotted on our charts
converged at that point

  at this time we haw no thought but for
the fun we were having assembling data on
an unknown plant recently finding root in
north american soil-a seemingly harmless
and rather likeable plant at that

  to test our figures we decided on a trip
to shadow island that was when we left
new york as you remember

  i nodded and at shadow island you
found what i asked rather tired of the
details

  at shadow island destanne bit out
grimly we found hell

  the great airliner was already shaking
with the pulsations of its powerful engines
a last passenger arrived followed by a
white-coated steward the roaring of the
engines rapidly grew in intensity soon we
would be taking off and anything resembling
conversation would be drowned out by the
ear-aching thunder

  but sibyl i shouted

  destanne shot me a brow-lifted smile
dont worry too much about sibyl he
said in a shout that was scarcely audible
if we use our heads we can beat those
devils guess ill go turn in this roaring
doesnt bother you so much after a time-
restful

  the smoking-room jolted slightly as if
shaken by a mild earthquake we were
under way
the air-plant men



chapter iii

the menace of the air-plant men

nightmare hours slid by i was m

sleeping became gasps of dreaming
horror the cachet of tissue-wrapped clove-
perfumed gauze which the steward brought
me did little to relieve my illness although
it was highly recommended as a preventive
of airsickness

  and my mental state was even more un-
happy than my physical condition what
exactly was the peril which threatened
sibyl what was the connection between
the air-plant men and the death lily
how did the air-plant men intend to launch
their attack against humanity  would they
begin by wrecking the airliner upon which
we were travelling these and a thousand
other questions went racing through my
mind during those semi-delirious hours

  but at last i lept when  woke des-
tanne was bending over me the motors
of the airliner no longer roared the port-
giass of my cabin was a disk of brilliant
turquoise the room flooded with sunlight

  come along roger shake it up the
doctor was saying this is batamano and
the launch is waiting to take us ashore
batamano i learned as i dressed was a
fishing village on the isla of batamano this
was the caribbean upon its deep blue water
the great airliner rested and the splashes
of dazzling whiteness which dotted it were
the sails of myriad sponge-fishing craft we
were within fifteen miles of shadow is-
land

  you slept like the proverbial log des-
tanne told me here climb into this
were getting pretty close now

  from a chair beside me he lifted a suit
of steel chainmesh to which a massive steel
collar similar to the one he was wearing
was attached you missed miami and all
the rest he said just as well though
almost unnoticed by our fellow passen-
gers we clambered down the swinging gang-
way to the waiting launch the body of
the amphibian airliner stood tall above us
as destanne introduced me to the three

bronzed men who helped us into the wab-
bling launch

  pedro is the mechanic b explained
henrique they call el practico the pilot
and francisco-well hes just excess bag-
gage he owns the launch

  sturdy sun-tanned fishermen they were
fearless enough and square they knew of
the peril which lurked around shadow is-
land but were indifferent to it they laugh-
ed heartily at the chainmesh collar and gog-
gles we wore and as they stowed the
heavy trunk destanne had brought said they
wished for nothing better than their
machetes

  that reminds me put in the doctor
hurriedly stick one under your own belt
roger right now the moment you find
yourself within striking distance of one of
the tentacles dont hesitate just whack

  i took the barbarous weapon reluctantly
such things i thought were good for cutting
sugar-cane but not quite the weapon for a
civilized man i was glad i had slipped a
 automatic into my shoulder holster when
i left new york

  we were by now leaving the indigo bay of
the plava of batamano and entering the
greener waters of the open sea eagerly we
scanned the blazing sky for a sign of a
hovering scout of the air-plant men there
were none

  you will find the goggles a great help
the doctor told me the lenses are slightly
tinted and act as color-screens to a certain
extent ive found the air-plant men are ex-
perts at hiding in a clear sky by chameleon-
like color changes the balloon-like part
too is often quite transparent and scarcely
more tenuous than a cloud of smoke

vt hat i asked are the air-plant

   t men

  now youve asked me something an-
swered the doctor gravely my opinions
are formed from observations made during
a hurried and very harassing encounter-
yes very this is what i suspect

  their amazing intelligence their physi-
cal and mental make-up everything about
them suggests that instead of being the
devilish octopus-like creature which we are


wonder stories

by circumstances forced to think them they
are much more highly developed than we
are therein lies their deadly menace

  going back a little you will remember
that our earth has been ruled from time to
time by varying types of creatures each of
these was replaced by newer more efficient
ones until climbing the evolutionary scale
we find man dominating the scene

  good now we know the part evolution
played in these changes and the extent they
were hurried along by the sudden mutations
of radically new types also that each of
the creatures to dominate the scene-even
man himself-put in a first appearance as
an almost defenseless creature

  for ages man survived as a weak and un-
important inhabitant before he stepped up
to anything like a dominant place so weak
was he that if the creatures then dominat-
ing had even guessed that he was to be their
successor they could have wiped him out
in a day

  judging then by what had gone before
the fact is pertinent that the creature which
is to replace man must be already somewhere
on this earth of ours by now mans suc-
cessor must be gaining a foothold by now
some mutation or some amazingly new
branch of--of man himself possibly must
be somewhere hiding and growing furtive
and hunted most likely but gaining strength
for the overthrow of the very parent from
which he sprang

  destanne lapsed into speculative silence

  and you infer that these air-plant men
are our superiors i asked with some heat

  possibly possibly destanne murmured
quite unmoved dont rush to conclusions
roger i believe im correct when i say
that their superiority-intellectual superior-
ity-is almost beyond our grasp of course
im puzzled but that balloon-shaped body
of theirs suggests a head-an awe-inspiring
skull-less brain their multiple eye sug-
gests something too youve noticed that
it isnt a mechanical contrivance like the
multiple eye of a fly each pair of eyes is
an individual characteristic independent
affair

through my goggles i had been
watching the blue jiorizon of a placid
sea high above us a single saber-winged
bird soared from beside me came the idle
slap of wavelets against the bow of the
launch and the put-puttering of the asth-
matic motor a blazing tropic sun hung in
the western sky but the heat continued to
be intense blistering heat a tranquil
sea and a light breeze at our backs oven-
hot

  hot enough to hatch devils i comment-
ed

  man destanne reminded me with ex-
asperating calm had his origin in warm
climates

  nonsense i exclaimed youve let
this heat and the idea of these things run
away with your imagination theyre new
theyre unpleasant to deal with like an
octopus or a shark but theyre far from
being what you think them to be

  directly ahead of us land showed as a
short black line thickening the horizon a
shadowy line that would have been scarcely
visible had it not been for a growth of palm
trees whiskering one end of it

  if im not mistaken-our destination i
announced

  destanne nodded agreement shadow
island he said a touch of awe in his
voice

  right i said fingering the  auto-
matic under my armpit and cursing the
heat and the chainmesh it is eh well
if sibyls there held by man or superman
i intend to find her and bring her back-
or raise hell trying

  destanne shot me a quick glance smiled
slightly at my enthusiasm-a trifle sadly
i thought his manner galled me unreason-
ably i pointed at the wretched little cayo
we were now rapidly approaching

  sibyls there i said for some rea-
son i dont doubt that that shes being
kept there by force in the manner you sug-
gest is another thing youve been pre-
cious quiet as to how and why these so-
called air-plant men are doing it

   i really dont know destanne said
meekly at the time we were seized and i
managed to hew my way out with a machete
the air-plant men



it seemed to me that the air-plant men han-
dled sibyl with the greatest care carlos
the boatman we had hired to come with us
they smashed to a pulp in something less
than ten seconds 

  we were close in now and headed for a
beach where a sunparched sand bank of
dazzling whiteness drifted down almost to
the waters edge a barren shore spotty
with scraggly bunch-grass and away to our
left a stretch of saltmarsh mangrove-cov-
ered

  not a sign of life i commented stand-
ing up in the bow of the launch and tempted
to tear off the metal collar which under the
suns scorching rays fairly seared my neck
i wouldnt be surprise if sibyl-

  i broke off abruptly

  above the crest of the hogback of sand
directly before us something rose slowly
like a semi-transparent blue bubble it lifted
against the skyline until it was just clear
of the sandy range it was roughly pear-
shaped some twenty feet tall by fifteen
wide

  for a moment it remained silent and mo-
tionless then it sank behind the ridge and
i stood gaping and speechless and filled
with the suspicion that i had been stared
at and inspected by some lethargic giant
who had merely lifted his head and peered
at me over the ridge

        chapter iv
        a horrible plan

 a look-out probably said doctor

  xa destanne

  i turned to find francisco was examining
his machete grim-lipped henrique was at
the helm whispering to himself in spanish
but keeping the launch on its course we
were headed straight for the beach which
was now less than a hundred yards away

  will they attack us when we land do
you think i asked suddenly feeling very
weak and helpless

  that remains to be seen replied des-
tanne i doubt it for we are to windward
of them we came up on them from that
direction because ive found that their

flight isnt well controlled they seem to
rise by inflating themselves with some very
light gas internally produced and probably
heated their direction appeared to me to
be largely a matter of selecting the right
air currents-like a balloonist although
sometimes i suspect they are able to rocket
themselves for short distances by the ejec-
tion of air from tiny openings placed on
their under surfaces

  henrique shut off the motor the launch
drifted silently forward until it nosed softly
onto the sand at the waters edge only the
pouring of the waves and the long-drawn
hiss of sand-laden water disturbed the utter
silence

  doctor destanne was the first to spring
ashore i followed quickly after him and
francisco and pedro brought up the rear

  i was intent upon watching the place at
which the air-plant men had peered at us
for this reason i scarcely noticed that the
two fishermen were carrying ashore the
trunk destanne had brought along

  we were climbing the ridge by that time
and i was too busy struggling up the steep
sandy wall to comment on the matter

  this embankment was less than twenty
feet high but steep-unnaturally steep i
thought every step of our climb was a
sweating agony many a timethe crumb
ling and uncertain surface gave way beneath
us and we slid to the bottom

  but eventually we gazed over the crest
and over the amazing expanse which formed
the interior of the island roughly circular
it was at least a mile in diameter and deep
like the crater of an extinct volcano

  the similarity ceased at that though for
as i was quick to realize the whole struc-
ture was artificial the entire area had been
scooped out to a depth of some thirty feet
the ground was approximately fifty feet
below us

  and it was cultivated ground watered
seemingly from a meagre stream which
emerged by way of the mangrove swamp
without pathway or trial a single field
close-covered with a pale blue flower it was
one sweep of blue-a pastel dainty hue

  the death lily murmured destanne
the feeding ground


wonder stories

  i blinked and then saw what before i had
thought was simply the result of atmospheric
heat waves the air above the field was
shimmering as if heated air were flowing
into the cooler space above the moist
ground

  i saw now that the shimmering had a de-
finite pattern it was like a roof over the
field a roof formed by a myriad glass
domes built row after row domes-glass
globes solidly massed huge bubbles-
air-plant men millions of them-their ten-
tacles spread out upon the ground amongst
the flowers

  feeding said destanne slowly im
not quite sure its that either notice the
absence of perfume the air should be
positively reeking with it i suppose they
absorb that perfume-and maybe some in-
finitely subtle and essential gases with it

  i was staring drymouthed paying little
heed as destanne iambled on the neces-
sities of their existence-air and water and
the perfume of the death lily the latter
they seem to need only occasionally i sus-
pect they take it in large periodic doses

my glance had been wandering far and
near for a sign of sibyl i had hoped
to find her-if destanne had told me the
facts-wandering along the beach my
plans scant as they had been were to circle
the island and perhaps find sibyl waiting for
us

  now it seemed to me sibyl must indeed
be lost what were we against this multi-
tude of super-powerful super-intelligent
creatures

  destanne was silent and i was wrapped
in thoughts of the most melancholy nature
as we stared out across that vast blue field
perspiration trickled under our goggles it
streamed beneath our metal collars

  then as if my worst fears had suddenly
materialized i saw sibyl clear and plain
i saw her she was some three hundred
yards to our left supine as if resting with
the glasses that destanne handed me i saw
how death-like was the marble pullor of her
cheek

  stifling a shout i seized destanne by the

arm he saw her and his face became tenses
with the realization of her danger

  if we go along this side he said point-
ing at the beach we might-

  without waiting for words i slid down
to the beach ran with the doctor stumb-
ling after me ran until i believed i was
opposite the spot where sibyl lay then i
climbed like a crazy ant up the embank-
ment until i again reached its crest

  a scrap of white paper like a pale pen-
nant faced me it had been wedged into
the end of a short split stock which was
planted on the embankment sibyls hand-
writing-

  if you come-the words spun dizzily
before my eyes as i crouched and read on
at first i was dreadfully frightened they
seemed such unnatural ghastly creatures
these air-plant men

  but i learned to understand them their
multiplex personality puzzled me the idea
of a compound creature using a community
brain was appalling it was hard to under-
stand how a group could live on indefinitely
by subjugating the personalities of its mem-
bers

  doctor destanne called them the air-
plant men he was nearly correct-except
that each one is a composite of many mem-
bers in our struggle to escape the doctor
shot at the group which attacked us his
shot killed one of its members the group
immediately sloughed off the dead mem-
ber and prepared to absorb a younger one
as a replacement

  in some way not clear to me they have
selected me to be the replacement i am
to be absorbed and adopted as a member of
the group which attacked doctor destanne

i understand my body will be unnecessary

  my mind entirely different in its views
from the usual run of air-plant folk is con-
sidered a very valuable asset-a stimulant
to the group the absorption of it will take
time-possibly-

  as if the paper had suddenly become a
enomous reptile i cast it from me pounded
it into the sand with my clenched fist
the air-plant men



the rescue

again i stared at sibyl down there
among the death lilies her face
was pale and upturned eyes closed as if in
sleep her khaki shirt was open at the
throat khaki breeches and leggings sand-
dusted she might have been a corpse-
yet i knew life still lingered in that sweet
face that a heart still pulsed in that sand-
sprinkled form

  the thought sent me berserk heedless
f the myriad eyes i knew must be staring
at me i sprang to ray feet gun tight-
clasped in ray fist i rushed down the em-
bankment seven leaping strides and i
struck bottom

  sibyl was at my feet and above me loomed
great globular forms i could see them
more clearly now like captive balloons
tipped by the sunlight they swayed held
down by a forest of taut tentacles tenta-
cles that moved and reached out for me

  a single sinuous arm slithered serpent-
like across the white throat of sibyl an-
other like a snake of soft glass was brush-
ing my face

  in a flash i had the machete out hack-
hack the razor-edged blade bit through the
yielding stuff hack-hack and with each
blow severed ends twisted and contracted
like chopped eels

  a moment of madness an instant of strug-
gling and i had sibyl slung over my shoul-
der her ankles crooked under my gun arm
her head was hanging down across my back
how slight she was how limp but alive
yet i knew that by her very limpness-
by a magnetic warmth

  an arm a powerful constricting arm
closed around my throat began lifting with
power tremendous thwack the blade of
my machete rang with the very swiftness of
the blow thwack the handle tingled in
my fingers ten feet of severed tentacle
writhed about me then hung still and flac-
cid

  i faced the steep slope of the fifty-foot
embankment behind me the air was thick
with a lashing writhing movement heavy
vilh a sense of soundless commotion

up and up  climbed the blood mist of

desperation thick before my eyes up and
up

  the inner side of the embankment was
smooth moist and firm due to some extent
perhaps to the proximity of the damp cul-
tivated land it offered a reasonable foot-
hold fighting for breath i reached the
crest destanne was waiting there machete
in hand

  down he yelled pointing toward the
launch ill cover the rear

  one step i took then toboganned to the
beach in a welter of dry sand straightened
up and began staggering off in the direction
of the launch

  i could see henrique in the launch he
was waving his arms wildly his suntanned
figure was black against the sky his
screamed words came to me in garbled
spanish that was meaningless

  then a faint shadow indistinct as the
shadow of a passing cloud swept over me
i could hear destanne shout a shot rang
out but i staggered on heels deep-sunk in
the sand

  the shadow passed it was before me
now stretched over the whiteness of the
beach lashing tentacles hissing like whip-
lashes cut the air over my head swiftly
the thing bore down on the launch

  henrique had ceased waving his arms
he stood now quite still one foot resting on
the boats gunwale chest out machete
flashing

  but the enraged air-plant man was too
quick for him a flick of a tentacle and a
jerk one moment henrique hung high in
the air his arms gallows-twitching legs
dancing on air head twisted neck broken
the next he was falling like a dropped
weight feet-foremost into the blue water
beneath him

from somewhere not far behind me
came shouts of encouragement from
destanne they seemed to me to be strange-
ly out of place the creature that had mur-
dered henrique was still floating high over
the launch soon a horde of them would
spring upon us fiom behind the embank-
ment henriques fate had been merely a


wonder stories

demonstration of what was in store for each
of us

  nevertheless i plunged on toward the
launch a man struggling for a hopeless
cause my feet sank deeper with every stride
my strength was lessening with each gasp-
ing breath

  a little to my left i saw pedro and fran-
cisco were also making for the launch until
now they had been crouching in a hole they
had dug at the base of the embankment
they came running now and pointing up-
ward at the evening sky

  were the air-plant men even now assemb-
ling their hordes above us i gave one
swift despairing glance upward only a
sky of cloudless blue was there for some
reason i did not understand the air-plant
man which had attacked henrique was rap-
idly swinging off inland

   

  in a huddle of striving humanity we met
at the launch the breeze destanne was
saying thank heavens its holding had
to go see he pointed at the air-plant
man drifting swiftly inland couldnt hold
his position with this light breeze blowing

  francisco got the motor ready as i placed
sibyl tenderly in the vessels stern and took
my place beside her the girl seemed to be
sleeping destanne was grasping a slender
wire to which what appeared to be a battery
box and a switch was attached the wire
stretched from the still motionless craft to
a point far up the beach

  then like a wall of transparent ice the
air-plant men rose above the embankment
a faint breeze still blew in from the ocean
the air was clear and flooded with long rays
of a lowering sun so clear was it i thought
of it as translucent water and the hordes of
air-plant men that were rising beyond the
ridge as gigantic jelly-fish that floated
whilst we infinitesimal creatures were
doomed to crawl over a strange oceans floor

  destanne was squatting on a seat the
switch-box in his lap one arm he raised
in a signal to francisco who waited hand on
the starter

  with a hissed word of command the lit-
tle biologist snapped his arm down shot
the switch over

  the mighty roar which followed shook
the launch rocked the island and blotted
out the sunlight

  madre de dios i heard francisco
groan as the chug-a-chug-chug of the
launchs motor bit into the ear-throbbing
silence that followed that blast the buried
trunk had been dynamite packed i under-
stood that now

  sand-clouded darkness was all about us
as we left shadow island the sea around
us was pelted for miles with the rain of fall-
ing debris

  the embankment destanne said after
awhile its broken then abruptly
well well if sibyl isnt wide awake once
more dont be alarmed sibyl i think
weve beaten them

  the girl rolled her head from side to side
a little water nothing more said destan-
ne come along roger snap out of it
theres a canteen beside you

  clumsily i lifted the canteen to sibyls
lips and she swallowed a little of the luke-
warm fluid rested her head on my shoul-
der again and closed her eyes

  swiftly the launch was nosing into the
breeze and we sped away from shadow
island the place we left behind us was
a smoking wreck above it high above it
rose tier upon tier the floating hordes of the
air-plant men slowly they were drifting
away from us driven by the westerly
breeze they sped eastward tier upon tier
they rose a golden argosy of strange and
scintillating beauty which towered far into
the cloudless sky their uppermost mem-
bers were caught in the crimson streaks- of
sunlight which marked them against the sky
as golden bubbles where would they go
next i wondered as i glanced at destanne

  their feeding ground flooded destroy-
ed he said noting my glance mighty
good thing for us the direction of the wind
makes it impossible for them to overtake us
for some time he pased then my ori-
ginal plan wras to dynamite their feeding
ground whilst they were heavy under the
influence of the perfume which plays such
an important part in their lives

  the stuff must leave them groggy i
commented
the air-plant men



  precisely an essential food to them
just the same brisson has arranged for
the destruction of the smaller beds they were
establishing throughout the southern
states

  which will leave them quite defeated
i asked-

  i hardly think so they are marvellous
balloonists-tireless effortless motion they
will establish new grounds central amer-
ica perhaps or even africa wherever the
death lily will flourish defeated now
but a menace to posterity

  we lapsed into silence the last of the
air-plant men were vanishing into the shad-

ows far astern slap-slap the waves bounc-
ed the bow of the launch and flew past us
in threads of white spume

  sibyl sighed and stirred restfully i moved
a trifle something was tangled around my
feet

  destanne followed my movements he
bent over and picked up one end of a ten-
foot length of what looked like cable limp
and dry it hung from his hand slick-sur-
faced

  obviously a vegetable tendril he
chuckled with a knowing smile as he twist-
ed the thing into a seamanlike coil if
you dont mind ill keep this-er piece of
liana vine

the end of time

familiar it had the musty look peculiar
to parliamentary chambers and by the fix-
tures i knew that i had seen it before in
pictures i had even visited its modern
counterpart rows of chairs were placed
facing a dais row on row one above the
other as in a theatre to one side sat a
man with a gavel dressed in the long frock
coat the stiff-bosomed shirt the open col-
lar and the soft black silk necktie of an-
other generation and in the center of the
room stood another man dressed like the
chairman a tall heavy-set severe-looking
individual with a brow like the dome of
saint peters and the jaw of a mastiff the
man was speaking in a rich sonorous voice
slowly distinctly the audience paid him
the tribute of hushed attention

  in this respect sir he was saying with
a note of satire in his mellow resonant
voice i have a great advantage over the
honorable gentleman there is nothing
here sir-and he placed his hand over his
heart-which gives me the slightest un-
easiness neither fear nor anger nor that
which is sometimes more troublesome than
either the consciousness of having been in
the wrong-

  and so it went on this stately courteous
debate of a bygone day there was some-
thing familiar about the speakers face and
words i recognized the old senate cham-
ber pictures of which i had studied and
then it all came to me in a flash

  my god i exclaimed its webster
beginning his reply to hayne i knew the
opening words which i had studied years
before in which the great orator laid spec-
ial emphasis upon haynes use of the word
here-with its accompanying gesture of
indicating the heart

  i was standing listening to the beginning
of the greatest extemporaneous speech ever
made in the united states and then sud-
denly i remember something else web-
ber spoke steadily for twenty-four hours

i said to myself i mut get out of here
before brown regains consciousness and
kills me with contempt

  slowly ray historical knowledge came
back to me the reply to hayne was de-
livered at the end of january  i had
overshot my mark by exactly one century
not so bad for an amateur in a space of
seven million years i said aloud as i
turned the control and the senate chamber
and the majestic speaker faded from view

  to come to my own century my own
year was the work of a fraction of a mo-
ment as the familiar cavern formed itself
around the crystal globe as the lights stop-
ped glowing and the vibration ceased i
breathed a prayer of gratitude to the des-
tiny which had brought me safely back to
my own world and my own time

  i held a vial of smelling salts under
browns nose he moved his head feebly
in an effort to avoid the pungent odor and
opened his eyes all out i quoted
taking unfair advantage of a wounded man
this is as far as we go

  i dragged him fiom the machine and out
into the cavern he looked around noted
the familiar surroundings and thanked me
with a look well i said can i operate
that machine or not where would you
be without me do you realize youve
been unconscious since we left-that is for
seven million years

  in spite of his pain brown smiled faint-
ly youre all right he whispered and
that was the greatest compliment i ever re-
ceived from the master of time

  many a time i was tempted to tell him
i had seen and heard daniel webster a man
whom he had never seen and never heard
but that would have made me subject again
to his satirical remarks on my abilities
and after all how do i know he has never
seen and heard webster with a man like
brown one can never be sure of anything-
unless it be the certainty of adventure such
as the world has never known

as possible it has been minimized no ob-
jection was made to the publication of this
account however as long as no details of
certain confidential matters were given

  benson is very modest as to his part in
the campaign against the millipedes he
assert that it was purely accidental that
he was placed in a position where he re-
ceived credit that was equally due a number
of other men he accepted under protest
the special medal voted by congress

  assurances have been given by the chem-
ical warfare division that precautions will
be observed in the future manufacture of
the xy gas which will make any repetition

of the tragedy impossible meanwhile
scientists are somewhat disgruntled be be-
cause the government refuses to furnish any
of the x-substance for experimental pur-
poses they consider it of the highest
scientific importance that the reason for its
astounding effect on the millipedes be in-
vestigated they believe such research
would bring them appreciably nearer to the
solution of the fundamental problems of
biology

  evidently the government thinks that
certain practical considerations are more
important at any rate it is at the present
time observing absolute silence in regard
to the x-substance in response to recent
inquiries it has even denied any knowledge
of its existence

frigid space

editor science questions and answers

  how do scientists know that space is frigid is it
because the higher one goes the colder it becomes
and therefore when one gets well away from the earth
it is intensely oold i would appreciate the answer
to this puxsling affair

                      ronald small

                     west  st

                    new york city

  to answer this question we must first get clear
what is meant by temperature let u suppose that
we place a thermometer on a body whose temperature
we wish to measure the thermometer shows 
degrees centigrade what we have really measured is
the temperature of the thermometer because we have
waited until the temperature of the thermometer is
steady and therefore the thermometer has reached
the same temperature as the body we arc observing

  we can only measure the temperature of material
bodies such m gases liquids and solids we can no
more measure the temperature of space than we can
measure the temperature of time

  it follows then that empty space with no material
such as gases liquids or solids in it has no tempera-
ture and if we were to take a thermometer out into
space we would measure the temperature of the ther-
mometer itself

  what happens to a body in empty space is this
it has in the beginning its own intrinsic heat it
receives heat from every body in space that is radiat-
ing and it radiates heat itsdf now the temperature
that a small mr will have in empty space will de-
pend on how much heat it receives and absorbs and

how much it radiates away the reason why a human
being would perish in open space is that the side of
him that is toward the sun would be warmed but
before the heat could penetrate through his body to
tho sunless side he would have radiated enough heat
away to make him frigidly cold even a body like
mercury which can be considered in empty space
has its sunny ide unbearably hot and its sunless
side intensely cold

  so we cannot speak of the temperature of space we
can only speak of the temperature of bodies that are
in empty space and we can speak of how hot tmy
are by considering how much heat tr receive and
how much they lose-editor

the wonder tube of iiadio

editor science questions and answers

  there is one particular thing of interest to me a
paragraph entitled magic radio tube works won-
ders  and in it you state the various wonderful
things that this radio tube has done and that el-
evators can be leveled with quick accuracy

  now i am very interested m elevators or lifts a
we call them and i am writing to ask you how this
system of levelling by means of this radio tube works
any information however small would be greatly
appreciated by me and i sincerely hope you will bo
able to furnish me with many particulars

  i may also say that your magazine has afforded
me many hours of enjoyable reading and may i
wish you and your publications every sucoess

  the self-leveling of elevators is accomplished by
the use of a photoelectric cell with a suitable relay
the pressure of a button lights a lamp opposite the
floor level desired when the photoelectric cell set
under the car comes opposite this signal lamp it
passes a current which operates a relay and stops the
car the principle is simple its application of course
is a task to be worked out very carefully by engineers
in many of the apartment buildings in this city
there are no elevator attendants the passenger steps
in presses a button designating the desired floor the
door closes automatically the elevator moves up or
down to the desired floor stops and levels itself and
the door opens again if the button is pressed from
another floor the elevator closes itself and descends
or ascends to the desired level a similalr device
has been installed among the bookstacks of the
library of congress at washington for the use of
the librarians traveling between different levels

  this type of photoelectric cell is the alkaline hydride
tube type the old selenium cell is very efficient but
takes a somewhat longer time to react to a change
in light the photoelectric phenomenon is the basis
also of television now being demonstrated in england
by mr baird and here by several experimenters-

how zeppelins descend

editor science questions and ancert

  would you mind letting me know how the descent
to earth of a lighter-than-air ship xppiin or blimp
is accomplished i understand that as long as an
airship is lighter than air it remains up or keeps
ascending how can it be made  come down i
mean this is it the motion of th propellers that
pushes it down or what is it a general explanation
will be sufficient for all i want to know is the cause
of the descent

g cataldt

                    p o box 

                       springfield mas

  a power-driven zeppelin or blimp the lame as an
airplane has at its tail a rudder that can move in a
vertical plane in other words up or down from the
horizontal if the zeppelin is moving straight ahead
and wishes to descend the rudder or elevator as it
is called is depressed in other words it inclines
downward the air that rushes at it therefore tends
to give an upward impetus to the elevator and there
fore to the tail

  since the tail is raised the nose points downward
and the craft can descend the reverse is used if the
craft wishes to rise a zeppelin or blimp has its
structure so adjubted that when it is fully loaded it
just floats in the air in other words under such
conditions a single man could hold up a giant zeppelin
therefore the zeppelin neither rises nor descends by
virtue of ita buoyancy the buoyancy merely gives it
the power to remain in the air without movinr

measuring the distances of stars

editor science questions ami answers

there are a few questions i would like to ask your

  	is the suns energy conveyed to the earth by
light rays which on striking the earths atmosphere
are converted into heat waves

  	are all the stars restricted to slight movement
with regard to the earth if not how can the tri-
angulation method of finding the distance of a star
be used  for certainly the star would have changed
itb position considerably in six months

                       george currie

                     sudbury ont canada

   the energy of the sun is radiated in the form
of electromagnctic waves of all lengths depending on
their frequencies only a small portion of these are
seen by us directly as light other waves differing
from visible light only in wavelength are not percept-
ible to our eyes they have the property trther of
generating heat in objects which they strike there
is no absolute difference in the nature of light wave
and heat waves the effects which they produce de-
pend rather upon the physical and chemical natures
and the sizes of the objects which they strike each
set of waves has a tendency to set up activity i whe-

ther heat or-as in our eyes-chemical action in sub-
stances the particles of which are of a size which
bears a certain ratio to their particular wavelength
it is quite probable that some of the suns radiation
is converted into long or heat waves in the atmos-
phere but at the bottom of the atmosphere we are
able to measure only what radiation gets through to
us when tcientists are able to ascend through the
atmosphere into space they will be able to tell us
more about this

  	all the stars are in motion and in the case of
the nearer stars this movement is measurable by their
displacement against their background sirius the
brightest star and our very near neighbor has moved
in the past two thousand years apparently about the
width of the moon-a distance actually numbered in
billions of miles this proper motion has been com-
puted by astronomers for all stars which are near
enough to have an observable parallax and is taken
into account astronomers make great numbers of
corrections for this and that source of error in meas-
urement and repeated observations over a period of
several years before they venture to estimate the par-
allax of a star

  the triangulation method is illustrated in the ac-
companying diagram it follows the same principles
as the work of a land surveyor except that much more
delicacy of measurement must be observed the par-
allax of our nearest neighbor alpha centauri cor-
responds to a yearly movement back and forth of
less than half an inch at a distance of a mile and
the telescopic observations mubt bo corrected for ap-
parent motions which cover many times this distance

 editor wonder stories

   it is not because  am a contributor to wokb
 stories that i advance this theory which has in
 ray own experience proved itself a reader of the
 incredible-nuniey science fiction- is thus more quick-
 ly broadened in mind than by any other means 
 can conceive his world ceases to be a single village
 or town or city or planet but broadens out into the
 vastness of the speculative into the far flung reaches
 of infinite space and time and thought into beau-
 tiful fields of worlds where the suns of andromeda
 and the milky wnv shine upon worlds of the realm
 of the great beyond

   the stark immensity of it amazes one the sheer
 beauty of it stimulates the senses casts to the four
 winds of this tiny speck rolling in the atmosphere
 the importance of the things about which a man
 worries wherefore is beauty but in dreams  where-
 fore is reality but in thought

    going through the- pages of this daring publication
 i came upon the story by francis flagg entitled
 the lizard men of buh-lo and after reading that
 masterpiece of imagination i lay the book down to
 begin writing here and say that every man who ex-
 pects to amount to a whoop in this world of great
 demands should read science fiction because it trains
 his mind to think in terms broader than he has been
 accustomed to

   i ought to know t recal when  got my first
 copy of a science fiction magazine and began read-
 ing it i threw it aside in disgust a few months
 later  was writing a story for mr gernsback it
 was published i said that i would never go beyond
 the probable again but the more  read such stories

	as marooned in andromeda and the many others
 published during the past few months in wojfuer
 storibs i wish i could write them--the more i
 realize that while we read to be entertained we might
 also read to think and to dream and to create per-
 sonally i have built up a religious belief-or rather
 i have approached a sort of probability-by reading
 science fiction and delving into the mysteries of
 science through as many of its branches as time will
 permit

                       edsel newton

                          billings mo

    its quite stimulating to read a frank confession-
 such as mr newton gives us if science fiction
 didnt do the things that he says they do we would
 have to qvrit publishing but our magazines have
 grown because we give our readers something to
 take them beyond themselves-so that as mr newton
 says they can grasp greater immensities and have
 thoughts they would not have had otherwise

   mr newton also makes a startling statement but
 something that verifies what the editor said during
 a recent oontrovery that by understanding the
 physical universe one can really find a meaning in
 it and from that meaning he can find a religion we
 wonder if any of our other readers have had snch an
 experience and whether we dare ask mr newton to
 tell us more about it-editor

meetings open to the public have been attracting
considerable attention

  at the last few meetings such problems as the
landing on a strange planet the possibility of life ex-
isting on other planets the problem of communication
between the planets have all been discussed the
latter talk delivered by mr clyde pitch a radio
engineer and member of the society brought forth an
interesting editorial in the new fork times of octo-
ber 

  the society is now undertaking a complete research
on the possibilities of the rocket and expects to issue
reports in sections over the next year or two in this
way it hopes to make an important contribution to
the science

  its membership continue to grow there are
members not only throughout the united states but
also in canada mexico and france among our
members are dr robert h goddard the american
rocket expert robert esnault-pelterie the french
rocket expert captain sir hubert wilkins the noted

  the society offers associate membership at three
dollars per year to interested men and women this
entitles tfce member to all the privileges of the society
except in the conduct of its business including the
monthly bulletin now being expanded to eight pages
active membership is open to men and women over

  mr c k rodgers spasm amused me greatly he
says he isnt a woman hater bt theres a fly in the
ointment somewhere because he admits he used to get
a thrill out of a nice moonlight necking party but
i dont call that romance it is slushiness and surely
anyone can see the difference

  no mr editor we dont want cold-blooded 
scientists-in stories or otherwise for they are not
like that in real life they are human and fiction
cannot change them except to make them distasteful
to the reader so lets have our heroes scientists-
super-men of course-but warmhearted and sympa-
thetic and in love or capable of being life is teeming
with romance so our fiction should not be entirely

fatherland by such a proportion tlie story was
never substantiated and probably was not true

  no doubt the future will eve us many new ideas
on our relation to the dead we know that i he burial
of dead was not originally for the preservation of
the body but to maki sure that the dead man did not
return to haunt those he left behind he was sup-
posed to have acquired some evil forces and he
must be deprived of the ability to do damage with
the ages the idea behind buri al suffered changes and
to-day the burial serves the purposes of public health
sentiment and family spirit perhaps in a future age
cremation will he universal or the willing of bodies
to the state for research and experimenting will be
necessary-editor

pearls before swine

editor wonder stories

  its difficult for me to make a mild expression of my
esteem i consider you a very generous benefactor and
am selfish enough to wish you a long and prosperous
career as a server of the same sort of diet you are
giving us now

  i think i enjoy the reader speaks most except-
ing when we run across sucb bilge as that tendered by
no address cody dont you care were all with
you and things like that mage us realize the meaning
of casting pearls before the swine i just lapped
up marooned in andromeda you surely do dish
up the cream

  i am sorry i have no suggestions as to how you
should do your job after all youve had a little ex-
perience and i do believe you know your work at
least better than i do i feel wc can trust safely
our mag in your hands leaving the work worry
vigilance to one who has proven his worth i know
you will never abuse our faith in your ability to keep
a rood balance of science adventure and lastly a

  unfortunately we cant feel the way mrs chris-
tiansen does about casting pearls before swine we
are just foolish enough to feel like the man who had
charge of  sheep and teu wandered away he left
the ninety to bring back the ten we dont want our
readers to wander away from their magazine we
feel that our readers do appreciate what we arc giving
them when difficulties arise as in the case of mr
cody wo think that they were the result of too hasty
conclusions undue suspicions etc and when they are
cleared up we will all be good friends again

  its easy enough to adopt a high-and-mighty atti-
tude and say well if you dont like it go back where
you came from just as our  percent patriots
want our government to do with it radicals but
thats a foolish attitude if theres anything wrong
with a government a mans body or a maguzine the
sensible thing to do is to find out what it is and cure
it if its a misunderstanding only as it was in mr
codys case everyone can be enlightened and made
happy but we thank mrs christiansen for her nice
sentiments may we continue to dish up the cream-

hurrah for the new size

editor wonder stories

  the  per cent that voted for the change in tho
size of the wonder stories magazine surely did
know what they were voting for i measured the
new size on an old magazine and was greatly im-
pressed by the improvement that i could see there
hurrah i for the new size

  in reading about space cars t have often won-
derd how an propellers be ud in space where as
far a- i can find out there is no atmospheric re-
mstaii served in the air service during the war
and understand how the propeller pulls the airplane
through tli- air but i can understand what good
fhey are wher there is no resistance please enlighten
me on that point i

  how about some oriental scieni- fiction i under-
stand that they hare a science of their own am i

  were glad that mr michel is included among
ihe throng who were so pleasureably delighted with the
new mag size we believe our readers will find
that this issue has even more material than the last
propellers are not used for flights into space ob-
viously they are useless where there is no air the
rocket which does not depend on air is the only means
found thus far to operate in a vacuum for the rocket
needs no air

  oriental science is a closed book to us occidentals
orientals may perform their miracles by means of a
science we are ignorant of or it may be all trickery
fooling us by taking advantages of our sense of sight
and touch etc we wish we could learn how they do
some of their magical tricks-editor

writing a story of the type you publish although i
am but fourteen years old im blushing all my
previous efforts have met with hearty approval from
my literary teachers and friends likewise ardent
readers of your magazine the story-the martian

  we certainly do publish the work of new authors
our contests have been notably successful in that
they stimulated non-professional writers to try their
hand at our stories the resuit was that they
found they had a good time at it and discovered
talent in themselves a writer must- at one time be
a beginner and to such beginners we are happy
to otter our advice and criticism but we say in the
beginning lint the average amateur starts to write
his story before he has studied the art of fiction
there are rules for the planning of stories just as
for the planning of bridges numerous books on the
short story will offer much help and by getting the
beginner started right will help him to avoid much of
the disappointment and heart-ache that is likely to
occur

  so before sending stories to us get some critical
opinions on them study the short story art and
then put your story away for a few weeks come
back to it afresh and read it critically as though it
were the work of some one unknown to you then
after finally revising it and assuring yourself its
the best job that you could do send it on to us

the boys scientifiction club

 editor wonder stories

   we would appreciate it very much if you would
 print this in your reader speaks department

   we wish to inform the readers of wonder sto-
 ries of an organization lately formed called the
 boys scientifiction club its purpose is to promote
 scientific interest among boys between the ages of 
 jnd  to encourage the reading of science-fictional
 tind scientific works and to create a bond of friend-
 ship among them

   a circulating library composed of sclentific-fic-
 tional books magazines articles etc is being con-
 structed to circulate among members who desire to
 read any of the contents

   officers are president-librarian-forrest j ack-
 erman  staples ave san francisco california

 san francisco the writer being vice-president

   address all letters concerning membership to the
 president he will be glad to answer all letters and
 explain particulars of the club

   every such club as your young readers have
 formed in san francisco is a -tep in the right direc-
 tion-toward spreading of science fiction throughout
 the people of the country

   but such clubs should not rest content to confine
 themselves to their own friends the great work to
 be done lies among the present scoffers or people
 who are indifferent the greatest enthusiasts are
 very often those who were previously the greatest
 doubters and each such person ouee concerted is
 firmly held from then on we wish the b s c

women did not want to kill

editor wonder stories

  in reply to mr kirshners letter in the august
issue of wonder stories i wish to say that ev-
erything that mr kirshner said was wrong here ia
my answer to the first the women did not want t
kill the men till they had learned how to produce lif
artificially the second dr keller has shown that
gas could not reach the termites and the bombs were
of no avail also the people were not prepared for
any invasion and so could not have timo to get to-
gether and fight besides a gun would not have
had any effect on twenty-foot insects third brunton
was smarter than mr kirshner thinls he had other
plans besides killing the dwarfs all at once also
wanted to study them for a while

which are we the old sheet

  one of our authors explained the situation to us
some of the science fiction magazines he said
read like technical textbooks or the record of
laboratory experiment nd ome read like a new
type of wild west story bm your magazine is in
between these two types it his plenty of action and
adventure yet the action d-t r becomes cheap it
has a good background of scivnc yet the science

far mr edwards is author of the earth tube
published by d appleton  co new york and we
understand that the book has received very favorable
reviews throughout the country it is also a science
fiction story telling about an invasion of the went by
means of ft gigantic tube bored through the earth
it is a tremendous theme and mr edwards gives to
it the same realistic yet imaginative treatment that
he gave to the rescue from jupiter

  the favorable reception afforded the new size won-
der stories was practically unanimous now we
ran continue to go on as mr glosser says to sur-
pass our stories during the coming year-editor

would his watch be slow

  the publishers of wonder stories are to h
congratulated upon the improvements made in the
magazine during its second year the latest issues
were the best we have had and although i was one of
those who had some misgivings about the merger
with air wonder stories  am not sorry that it
was doue the paper used is of a better quality
and the stories are all superior the one fault i
still find with wonder stories is in the binding
despite the utmost care the covers insist upon coming
off  think the trouble can be remedied by using
more glue and we would then have a stronger
binding what has happened to paul i find only
two of his illustrations in the entire magazine

  t have a little suggestion to make in the las
number of each volume print an index of all the
stories authors and editorials that appeared in that
volume that would come in very handy to those of
us who frequently go over some old numbers for
reference for instance if we wanted to reread or
find- a fact iu some story by iiarl vincent but didnt
know the name of the story we would look under
vincent where it would tell all the stories he had
that year the september editorial could be listed under
space-matter- what do you think of the idea

  will you please answer a question which has been
puzzling me for some time it is on the fitzgerald
contraction theory if n man whose watch was cor
reet traveled at a very fust speed for about a day
at the end of that time would his watch be slow

                      allan p stern

                       lincoln blvd

                       cleveland heights ohio

  the suggestion for an index is a good one
believe that something can be done with it inasmuch
as the volume ends with the may  issue we will
have an announcement on it some time before that

  the whole liorentz-ifitzgeraid contraction theory
is much more complex than it sounds the contrac-
tions that take place ere based oi a motion of ona
body with respect to a body at rest inasmuch as we
have not yet discovered any body at absolute rest
the contraction formula is applied o relative motion
in other words if the man with the watch is on a
swiftly moving train moving with reference to the
track or embankment the einb ukment may also bo
considered to be moving with reference to him

now if he were inoviug very swiftlv and while in

motion tried to associate his own scale of miles and
minutes with that of a man on tin- embankment he
would find that his miles were shorter and his min-
utes longer iu other words his watch would appear
to be slow

  yet if the man on the embankment were to hav a
watch and associate hi miles and minutes with those
of the man on the train his own miles would appear
to be smaller and his own minutes longer and hit
watch would appear to be slow but when the motion
of the man on the train ceased and the two meu
ere once more at rest with each other their watches
would read the same

  dr breuer in his fitzgerald contraction did not
really mean that in actuality people would travel

scientific novelty co

a park place n f city

the world in  by the earl of bir-
 kenhead  pages stiff cloth covers size
 vn x svz published by brewer and war-
 ren new york price 

  it is rare that a man in such a distinguished po-
sition as the lato karl of birkenhead occupied will
risk his time and reputation on prophecies of the
future men of eminence are quite satisfied with
themselves generally if they can guess accurately
the events of the coming year or two without at-
tempting to predict the occurrences of the next cen-
tury

  the present book has a great deal of interest in
that it represents an opinion of the world of 
years henoe of neither a writer nor a scientist but
one of the most eminent of the english conservatives
and a leader of the english bar the author admit-
ted in his book that a better scientific background
would have aided him immensely in his task but it
is evident that he has wisely made up for his own
shortcomings by consulting authorities in the fields
he wrote about

  to readers of science fiction the book should have
n peculiar interest for it will enable them to check
the predictions of science fiction authors with that
of one of the sanest most conservative men of tha
day science fiction does not buffer thereby-in fact
the late earl may be suspected of having dipped
liberally into men like wells verne and edward
bellamy and pei-haps others known more intimately
to readers of wonder siqhils

  conscious all the time of the critical appraising
eyes of his contemporaries on his work the karl
wa content to stick doso to the predictions that
are quite conservative  in many of them it strike
the reviewer he does not make use of a sense of
time values aud the changes that should occur over
the next fifty years he places as oocurring in not
less than a century some of his conclusions ara
worth quotation

  speaking of war in  he sees great masses of
mechanically operated engines such as tanks con-
trolled by wireless hence he goes on to ay tho
contending armies of tanks may be able to go into
battle entirely unmanned and the issue of the day
will be decided by two men each of them directing
his countrys entire armament

  a completely synthetic diet is a probability of the
next century synthetic foods will be cheaper moro
palatable moro various perhaps more hygienic than
their predecessors bv the year  synthetic
bread sugar and vegetables may bo cheaper than
water today

  like henry ford the earl sees that at last relief
from burdensome toil is in sight for the laboring man
it will not bo often that his one day a week will bo
made laborious by specially hard work superintend
ing the operations of giant machines of two hundred
years hence will be supremely easy and supremely
dull

  he foresees loo a world in which science and sci-
entific thought will dominate the minds of the masses
of the people as thoroughly au koman catholic
thought dominated the middle ages we will bo abl
to use scientific judgment in casting our votes on
great national problems and advertisers will use ft
real established science of psychology to compel us
to buy their goods pictured in their hypnotic adver-
tisements

  we will be less emotional than we are now in fact
judged by our present standards the man and
woman of  will seem harsh aud unemotional

  on the question of interplanetary travel the earl
is quite discreet he is sure that by  attempts
to reach the other planets will have been made and
that several expeditions will perish before one suc-
ceeds yet the perils are such that he personally
did not wish to risk himself on a trip

  we sec through the eyes of the author a world
in which many of our problems economic social and
industrial will have been solved by the scientist man
freed from toil will devote himself in his leisure to
intellectual pursuits by cooperative effort war may
be averted but if it comes it will probably bo less
awful than the last it will probably come to a quiok
and devastating end but the conquerors will be wise
enough not to cripple too much the man aud indus-
trial power of the defeated

book reviews

 the day of the brown horde by
  richard tooker  pages stiff cloth
  covers size x published by payson
  and clarke ltd new york price 

  novels dealing with the struggles of prehistoric man
on our earth are quite rare possibly becaus they need
for their writing a combination of qualities not often
found in one man for that reason the present book
is quit welcome

  mr tooker gives us in this story of a avge tribe of
troglodytes who inhabited california at an unnamed
date a story not only of human struggles against nature
but also the greater struggle of a race against its en-
vironment

  it is in his ability to make his half human charac-
ters real and associate them with u and our own
lives that gives this book such a gripping quality we
find here in the childhood of cur ra- be signs of
heroism self-sacrifice yielding to saprrmition rising
above circumstance-a pictorial mody of the seeds of
humanity

    there are catacylsmie upheavals in which man hows
down before the great brut forces of nature and on
the other hand in the motb-   n-rthon through a
forest to a new refuge in r rrvn uplands - we get
a dynamic account of tl- or i will over physical
difficulties and natural obi

  the book has both ar -pi-a nrwp and a personal
poignancy it is heartily r-c mitended

 the purple cloud by m p shiel 
   pages stiff cloth covers size  x 
   published by vanguard press new york
   price 

  mr shiel wrot and published this strange scfence
fiction story in  it is rather a tribute to it there-
fore that the publishers saw fit to revive it in a day
when many of the bas of the story have been de
etroyed by the march of science however it is a good
yarn well told many of its sections gripping one with
a feeling of inutterabta d--spair and even transmitting
lo the reader part of th madness of the solitary hero

  an expedition sets out for the north pole to win a
prize of   the first man to set foot on
the pole naturally this is before the day of the air-
plane and the expedition fights the elements with
schooner dog and sled our hero leaving behind his
fiancee who has admonished him to win for me
leaves his companions in the dead of night near the
pole and make the final dash alone he returns to
find  dead world people sitting or reclining at their
usual occupations struck dead by some mysterious force
newspaper clippings and other records reveal that a
purple cloud of cyanogen gas had gradually spread
over the earth to gather all living things into its death-
ly fold the chapters by the wav that recount the
scenes found by tlip heto as he makes his way from
the pcle back to london are the beet of the book

  alone in the world with corpses on every band
madness gradually seizes him he works for seven-
teen years to build a palace of gold and a great laki
of wine and then abandons his work to rush off to
china for he has a feeling that a living being still
exists there but at the end he does find a young girl
alivo and they create a new race

  there aro touching ironical bitterly satirical as well
as penetrating scenes in this strange book many of
the passages however are drawn out unduly long but
as a whole the book holds ones attention and for
science fiction fans it is certainly worth reading

some of the more re-
cent developments
his earlier predic-
tions which have

past decade in
many newspapers

now realities every
prophecy ia based
on accurate scienti-
fic knowledge his
ideas are no more
fantastic than tho
realities and com-
monplaces of our

to our great
grandfathers
